## Question

A 68-year-old man presents with progressive jaundice, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. Imaging reveals a hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor) that is deemed unresectable due to extensive vascular involvement. He has no significant comorbidities, normal renal function, and an ECOG performance status of 1. After discussing the diagnosis and prognosis with the patient and his family, you are asked to recommend a treatment plan. The patient is not interested in clinical trial participation at this time.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate first-line chemotherapy regimen to offer this patient, and what alternative would you consider if his renal function were impaired?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate first-line chemotherapy regimen for a 68-year-old man with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma, normal renal function, and ECOG 1, and what alternative regimen to choose if renal function were impaired. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease context and prognostic implications. Then, I should verify the patient's fitness for combination therapy and the standard-of-care first-line regimen. Next, I will review the pivotal evidence supporting that regimen and confirm dosing. After that, I need to check guideline positions on adding immunotherapy and whether that changes the recommendation today. Finally, I will consider the renal impairment scenario and outline the alternative regimen with supporting guidance and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and prognosis. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is an extrahepatic, perihilar subtype with aggressive biology and frequent unresectability due to vascular involvement; median survival in advanced disease is poor, historically around 12 months, which underscores the need for effective systemic therapy in appropriate candidates [^17681da3] [^59668b1d].

> I need to ensure the patient is fit for combination chemotherapy. ECOG performance status 1 with preserved organ function, including normal renal function, supports full-dose platinum-based doublet therapy, and guidelines consistently prioritize combination regimens over monotherapy in patients with good performance status [^6b951e36] [^56a2bbcf].

> Now, I should verify the standard first-line regimen. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on gemcitabine plus cisplatin as the backbone for advanced biliary tract cancers, including hilar cholangiocarcinoma, based on robust randomized data and long-standing practice standards [^48f8432a] [^d55944e1] [^56a2bbcf].

> Wait, let me verify the pivotal evidence and dosing. The ABC-02 randomized phase III trial demonstrated a significant overall survival advantage for gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine alone, establishing the combination as the reference regimen; typical dosing uses gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 with cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, which balances efficacy and tolerability in patients with adequate organ function [^6b951e36] [^6b951e36].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immunotherapy. I initially thought to recommend adding durvalumab upfront because EASL-ILCA endorsed gemcitabine–cisplatin plus durvalumab for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but wait, I should double-check whether that applies to extrahepatic/hilar disease and whether regulatory approvals and contemporary guidelines align here [^6ea17174]. Let me reconsider: while ESMO 2025 and NCCN 2025 list durvalumab or pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine–cisplatin as category 1 preferred options for advanced BTC, the magnitude of benefit is clearest in intrahepatic disease and may be less compelling in extrahepatic/hilar subtypes; given the patient's preference to avoid trials and the need to balance benefit, toxicity, and cost, sticking with gemcitabine–cisplatin remains reasonable, with immunotherapy as an optional upgrade after shared decision-making rather than the default here [^001998c9] [^ac59dbf9] [^56a2bbcf].

> Next, I should review the renal impairment scenario. If creatinine clearance is below about 60 mL/min or there are other cisplatin contraindications, guidelines advise substituting cisplatin with oxaliplatin, yielding a gemcitabine–oxaliplatin (GEMOX) regimen that preserves activity while mitigating nephrotoxicity; this substitution is supported by ESMO guidance and is commonly used in practice for cisplatin-ineligible patients [^854fc177] [^a04a5dbd].

> I will now examine the alternative regimen details and safety. GEMOX typically uses gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on day 1 and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 14-day cycle, with attention to neurotoxicity and hematologic monitoring; although randomized data are less robust than for gemcitabine–cisplatin, GEMOX has demonstrated activity and a favorable toxicity profile in retrospective and prospective series, making it a reasonable standard alternative when cisplatin is contraindicated [^79021d9f].

> But wait, what if performance status declines or comorbidities emerge? I should confirm that in patients with ECOG 2 or significant organ dysfunction, monotherapy such as gemcitabine alone may be more appropriate, whereas patients with ECOG 3 or decompensated liver disease should receive best supportive care rather than cytotoxic therapy; this stratification ensures we do not over-treat patients unlikely to benefit [^72ddd5db] [^3340fe5b] [^8149f590].

> Finalizing the recommendation, I should double-check alignment with guidelines. For this 68-year-old with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma, ECOG 1, and normal renal function, the most appropriate first-line regimen is gemcitabine plus cisplatin, with consideration of adding durvalumab or pembrolizumab after discussing uncertain incremental benefit in extrahepatic disease and patient preferences. If renal function were impaired, I would substitute cisplatin with oxaliplatin to use GEMOX, maintaining a platinum-based doublet while avoiding nephrotoxicity [^48f8432a] [^56a2bbcf] [^854fc177] [^a04a5dbd].

---

The standard first-line regimen for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma with good performance status and normal renal function is **gemcitabine plus cisplatin** [^48f8432a] [^d55944e1], which improves survival compared to gemcitabine alone [^6b951e36] and is supported by multiple guidelines [^56a2bbcf] [^6ea17174]. If renal function is impaired, **substitute cisplatin with oxaliplatin** (GEMOX) [^854fc177] to reduce nephrotoxicity while maintaining efficacy [^79021d9f]. Immunotherapy combinations (durvalumab or pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine/cisplatin) are category 1 options [^ac59dbf9] but were not specified in the question; they can be considered if available and appropriate after shared decision-making [^001998c9].

---

## Standard first-line chemotherapy regimen

The standard first-line regimen is **gemcitabine plus cisplatin**, based on the ABC-02 trial [^245449b9], which showed a significant survival benefit over gemcitabine alone (median OS 11.7 vs 8.1 months; HR 0.64) [^e598cbe3]. This regimen is recommended by major guidelines for advanced biliary tract cancers, including hilar cholangiocarcinoma [^48f8432a] [^d55944e1] [^56a2bbcf].

---

## Alternative regimen for impaired renal function

If renal function is impaired, **substitute cisplatin with oxaliplatin** (GEMOX) [^854fc177] to reduce nephrotoxicity while preserving efficacy [^79021d9f]. GEMOX is a validated alternative supported by guidelines and clinical experience [^a04a5dbd].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal renal function | Gemcitabine + cisplatin | Standard of care; proven survival benefit [^245449b9] [^48f8432a] |
| Impaired renal function | Gemcitabine + oxaliplatin (GEMOX) | Reduced nephrotoxicity; maintained efficacy [^854fc177] [^79021d9f] |

---

## Additional considerations

- **Performance status**: The patient has ECOG 1, supporting full-dose combination therapy [^6b951e36].
- **Comorbidities**: No significant comorbidities are reported, supporting standard therapy.
- **Clinical trials**: The patient declined trials; standard regimens remain appropriate [^notfound].

---

The recommended first-line regimen is **gemcitabine plus cisplatin** [^48f8432a]; if renal function is impaired, use **gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin** [^854fc177].

The delivery of ablative doses of RT for unresectable EHCC has also been studied. A single institution prospective single-arm study reported a complete response rate at 3 months of 34.9% in patients treated with a hypofractionated regimen of 44 to 48 Gy in 9 to 12 fractions. A single institution phase I feasibility study involving 6 patients with unresectable EHCC treated with a hypofractionated regimen of 60 Gy in 15 fractions following 6 to 8 cycles of systemic chemotherapy found the 12-month LC rate to be 80% without any observed limiting toxicities.

The pivotal ABC-02 established gemcitabine/cisplatin as the standard first-line treatment for advanced BTC. This phase III study, enrolling 410 patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma to receive either cisplatin/gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone, showed OS was superior in the combination group without the added risk of toxicity. In patients who are not able to tolerate cisplatin due to chronic kidney disease or hearing impairment, alternative treatment with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel can be considered.

Materials and Methods

Study design

This was a single-centre, randomised phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XELIRI regimen compared with irinotecan monotherapy in GP doublet refractory, good PS ABTC patients. Patients were randomised to either single-agent irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 on day 1 of a 14-day cycle (IRI-arm) or irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 on day 1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 twice daily on days 1–10 of a 14-day cycle (XELIRI-arm). The assigned treatment was delivered until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.

Eligibility criteria

Patients were eligible for the study if they were 18 years of age or older and had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma (intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder carcinoma) and a radiologically confirmed progression after first-line GP doublet chemotherapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 or 1. Other eligibility criteria were radiological measurable disease, adequate function of major organs, in particular a haemoglobin ≥ 10 g per 100 ml, white blood cells ≥ 3000/mm 3, neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm 3, platelets ≥ 80,000/mm 3, total bilirubin levels ≤ 2 times the upper limit of the normal range, liver-enzyme (alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) levels ≤ 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, renal function with levels of serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range, and a calculated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 45 ml/min.

This study (ClinicalTrials. Gov ID: NCT02558959) was approved by Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and guidelines on Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before random assignment.

Background

Biliary tract cancers represent a diverse group of epithelial cancers characterized by aggressive and chemoresistant tumors with poor long-term survival. Surgery remains the only curative treatment; however, only roughly 35% of patients can undergo curative surgery and of surgically resected patients, 35% have clinical relapse in 2 years. Often limiting surgical resection includes the presence of vascular involvement and the presence of metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes, which are often evident at time of diagnosis given the frequent asymptomatic status of early disease. Systemic therapy for cholangiocarcinoma represents the only feasible option for patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. Results of the multicenter ABC-02 trial showed superior results of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy combined with cisplatin when compared to gemcitabine alone. However, this regimen is associated with significant toxicity, limited to patients with adequate renal function, and achieves only limited efficacy with median overall survival (OS) of 11.7 months. Outside of the United States, a commonly used regimen includes gemcitabine plus S-1 (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil). Both gemcitabine/cisplatin and gemcitabine/S-1 showed similar results with regard to median OS (15.1 versus 13.4 months) and median PFS (6.8 versus 5.8 months) with gemcitabine plus S-1 compared to gemcitabine plus cisplatin.

Following first-line treatment, only 15–25% of patients are candidates for salvage therapy due to morbidity of the disease and rapid decline in performance status. Prognostic tools to determine clinical response in second-line treatment are not established; however, three studies suggest that patients with ECOG 0–1, disease control to first-line therapy, low CA 19–9, and absence of peritoneal carcinomatosis confer the best response in the second line. – Patients who progress on first-line treatment have limited treatment options with dismal OS and progression-free survival benefit compared to active symptom control (ASC). The recently published ABC-06 trial reported an OS benefit of just 4 weeks with the addition of 5-fluoruracil, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) compared to ASC alone (6.2 months versus 5.3 months). Furthermore, the recent results from the NIFTY trial suggest added efficacy of liposomal irinotecan with fluorouracil when compared to fluorouracil and leucovorin in the second-line setting with an OS of 8.6 months versus 5.5 months (p = 0.035), highlighting the need for additional therapies.

### How to determine unresectability in hilar cholangiocarcinoma [^54793df1]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is considered a biologically aggressive disease for which surgical resection remains the only curative treatment. Preoperative evaluation for resectability is challenging given tumor proximity to the porta hepatis, but minimal benefit and increased morbidity precludes recommendation for margin positive resection. This article reviews the determination of unresectability in hilar cholangiocarcinoma through discussion of the preoperative assessment, the intraoperative assessment, and key steps of surgical resection, as well as treatment options for unresectable tumors. Overall, evaluating patients preoperatively for resectability requires a multidisciplinary, holistic, and individualized approach to accurately determine resectability and optimize clinical outcomes for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.

Methods

Study design and participants

The ABC-06 clinical trial was a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled study conducted under the auspices of the UK National Cancer Research Institute. Patients were recruited across 20 centres with expertise in managing biliary tract cancer in the UK (appendix p 17).

Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and had histologically or cytologically verified locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer (including cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, and ampullary carcinoma) with documented radiological disease progression to previous first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. Any other form of first-line systemic chemotherapy or additional line of first-line chemotherapy (including rechallenge with cisplatin and gemcitabine) was not allowed. Patients who had been started on first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine for whom the cisplatin was stopped due to toxicity (with continuation of gemcitabine) were eligible.

A maximum of 6 weeks was allowed between disease progression to first-line treatment and the start of second-line chemotherapy as part of the ABC-06 trial. All patients had to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–1, life expectancy of longer than 3 months, and adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function, with no evidence of ongoing infection or inadequate biliary drainage. Patients with clinical evidence of metastatic disease to the brain and those with clinically significant cardiovascular disease were excluded. Full details of the patient inclusion and exclusion criteria are in the protocol (see appendix).

Trial data were collected and monitored at each site, and underwent quality control and analysis at the Manchester Clinical Trials Unit (CTU; Manchester, UK). The study was sponsored by The Christie NHS Foundation Trust and conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by a research ethics committee and all patients were required to provide written, informed consent before any trial-related investigations or treatment took place.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma — primary treatment options for unresectable disease include biopsy, if not previously performed, and molecular testing. Options are systemic therapy, clinical trial, combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiation, or chemoradiation, along with consideration of locoregional therapy, arterially directed therapies, RT, consideration of referral to a transplant center, and best supportive care. There are limited clinical trial data to define a standard regimen or definitive benefit and participation in clinical trials is encouraged; gemcitabine- and fluoropyrimidine-based regimens may be used before or after chemoradiation as referenced, and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (with or without systemic chemotherapy) may be used in a clinical trial or at experienced centers in carefully selected cases; palliative care guidance is available.

### Gemcitabine alone or in combination with cisplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinomas or other biliary tract tumours: a multicentre randomised phase II study-the UK ABC-01 study [^4696d11a]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

This is a multicentre randomised phase II study of weekly (for 3 weeks in every four-week cycle, × 6 cycles) doses of gemcitabine 1000 mg m −2 as a single agent or preceded by cisplatin 25 mg m −2 (on a 2 weeks in every three-week cycle, × 8 cycles) in patients with histologically or cytologically verified, non-resectable or recurrent/metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (intra- or extrahepatic), gallbladder or ampullary carcinoma (Figure 1).

Eligibility criteria included the following: no earlier chemotherapy or radiotherapy, Karnofsky performance (KP) status ⩾60, age ⩾18 years, predicted survival ⩾12 weeks, adequate bone marrow, liver, renal and cardiac function, adequate biliary drainage, no known brain metastases, no previous malignancy, no serious concurrent medical illness and, where applicable, approved methods of birth control. All patients gave written informed consent and the trial was conducted in accordance with ICH-GCP standards and the Declaration of Helsinki. Each participating institution was required to have approval by their respective local research ethics committee.

Treatment

Patients were randomised to receive gemcitabine 1000 mg m −2 intravenous infusions on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle or cisplatin 25 mg m −2 followed by gemcitabine 1000 mg m −2 by intravenous infusions on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.

A minimum of two cycles was required to assess tumour status and the maximum period of therapy was 24 weeks (six cycles of single-agent gemcitabine and eight cycles of cisplatin/gemcitabine).

Patients were assessed after every cycle for adverse events; toxicities were graded according to the Revised Common Toxicity grading Criteria version 2.0. A complete blood count, biochemistry, physical examination and urine analysis were also assessed at the commencement of each cycle. Radiological assessment by CT scan every 12 weeks during treatment determined the tumour status. Objective tumour response was evaluated according to the WHO criteria by local investigators; central radiology review was not performed.

Treatment was given until progressive disease (or until completion of the planned 24 weeks of therapy), unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. Thereafter, patients continued to be followed up for survival data. Patients who had not progressed by the end of the treatment period continued to have CT scans at 3-month intervals until such time as there was evidence of disease progression.

### Biliary tract cancers, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^7e2ede4a]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Mixed hepatocellular carcinoma–cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CCA) — management and systemic therapy considerations: An estimated 1% to 10% of primary liver tumors contain both HCC and CCA histologies. Tumor molecular profiling should be considered in all patients with advanced stages of disease, and liver resection is considered the standard treatment for resectable disease. For limited unresectable hepatic disease, liver-directed local therapies may be appropriate. Patients with HCC-CCA limited in size should be considered for evaluation in a transplant center, and at recurrence after prior therapy a repeat biopsy should be considered to determine dominant histology; if an isolated recurrence of either component is found, the Panel considers a systemic therapy option appropriate for that component. A retrospective study reported similar overall response rates with chemotherapy versus non-chemotherapy therapies and a trend toward longer median OS with chemotherapy (15.5 vs. 5.3 months; P = 0.052). Based on these data, gemcitabine plus cisplatin combined with either durvalumab or pembrolizumab is an appropriate choice for first-line therapy, and the Panel notes these combinations include agents with anti-tumor activity in both CCA and HCC histologies.

### Hilar cholangiocarcinoma [^1097ae1d]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Optimal treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma depends on location of the cancer and extent of biliary and vascular involvement. Candidates for resection or transplantation must be evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team at a high-volume hepatobiliary center. Success requires absence of distant nodal or extrahepatic metastases and an adequate functional liver remnant with a negative ductal margin. Ipsilateral portal vein resection and reconstruction should be performed in patients with venous involvement. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation and liver transplantation is the best treatment option for patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma without nodal or distant metastases and for patients with underlying chronic liver disease.

### Biliary tract cancers, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^5353d4e8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Biliary Tract Cancers — primary management of unresectable or metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: Primary treatment options include systemic therapy, clinical trial, consideration of locoregional therapy (arterially directed therapies or radiotherapy [RT]), or best supportive care, with additional options for unresectable disease including chemotherapy plus chemoradiation, chemoradiation alone, and referral to a transplant center; systemic therapy or enrollment in a clinical trial are preferred for metastatic intrahepatic CCA. After primary treatment, the disease should be assessed for response, resection or locoregional therapy should be reconsidered, subsequent-line systemic therapy is an option upon progression on or after systemic therapy, and evaluation for liver transplantation should be considered for patients eligible for transplant exception points including biopsy-proven intrahepatic CCA or mixed HCC-intrahepatic CCA, presence of cirrhosis, unresectable, receipt of locoregional or systemic therapy, and 6 months from time of diagnosis or last treatment with no new lesions or extrahepatic disease.

### Phase II study of gemcitabine and cisplatin as first-line chemotherapy in inoperable biliary tract carcinoma [^9ea34e19]. Annals of Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The prognosis for patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer is poor and existing chemotherapy is relatively ineffective. Therefore, a need exists for new, effective chemotherapeutic regimens. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety profile of gemcitabine plus cisplatin in patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) and gall bladder cancer.

From December 2000 to July 2002, 43 patients received gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) in a 30-min i.v. infusion on d1, 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) in a 2-h i.v. infusion on d1 (with appropriate hydration), every 3 weeks. ELIGIBILITY: Normal hematologic parameters and creatinine levels; serum bilirubin < 5 mg/dl.

Results

Forty-three patients enrolled; 40 were assessable (three patients were not assessable due to incomplete treatment; they chose to discontinue chemotherapy after the first cycle). There were 23 males and 17 females, median age 50 years (range 31–69), median Karnofsky PS 80%. Tumor types: cholangiocarcinoma (39), gall bladder cancer (1). Median number of chemotherapy courses was four (range 1–8). Overall response rate was 27.5% (PR in 11 pts), with 32.5% SD and/or minor response. Median survival time was 36 weeks. Grade 3 hematologic toxicity: anemia (4.33%), leukopenia (1.73%). Non-hematologic toxicity (i.e. rash, nausea, vomiting, neuropathy and myalgia) ranged from mild to moderate.

Conclusions

Gemcitabine plus cisplatin is active in biliary tract carcinoma. These data warrant further investigation of single-agent gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin or its derivative, i.e. oxaliplatin.

### Indications for extended hepatectomy in the management of stage IV hilar cholangiocarcinoma… [^07cac1eb]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Cumulative survival in patients with stage IVB hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Survival did not differ between the surgical and self-expandable metallic biliary stent groups. Therapeutic factors determining the prognosis in patients with stage IV disease who underwent resection. Twenty-one patients with no residual cancer had significantly longer survival, as compared with that in 12 patients with residual cancer. Tumor factors determining the prognosis in patients with stage IV disease who underwent resection. No significant difference in long-term prognosis was seen between patients with and those without lymph node metastasis or vascular invasion. C, However, among patients with distant metastasis, including carcinomatous peritonitis, there was a significant difference in long-term survival between the 28 patients without distant metastasis with stage IVA disease and the 5 patients with distant metastasis with stage IVB disease.

Main Outcome Measure Survival in patients with stage IV hilar cholangiocarcinoma treated by means of extended operation or stenting. Results Survival was 25. 7 ±
40. 9 months in the surgical group vs 6. 5 ±
5. 8 months in the EMBS group. In the surgical group, radical resection results were macroscopically and histologically successful in 21 patients. In patients with stage IVB disease, survival did not differ between the surgical and EMBS groups. without cirrhosis, long-term survival might be attained. 2–5 However, stage IV hilar cholangiocarcinoma tends to invade the portal vein and the hepatic arteries and also metastisizes to lymph nodes or liver; therefore, extended hepatectomy, including excision of involved vessels and reconstruction,… Thirty-eight patients with stage IV disease underwent surgery. Although 5 patients had palliative tumor resection or biliary drainage alone, 33 underwent extended hepatectomy with the aim of macroscopic radical resection.

Of these 33 patients, 2 died in the hospital within 30 days after surgery. They had portal vein reconstruction but developed acute portal vein thrombosis and postoperative hemorrhage. The diagnostic procedure for hilar cholangiocarcinoma at our department was as follows: Ultrasonography or computed tomography was performed to localize the tumor and to verify distant metastasis to the liver or other sites, presence of ascites, and extent of lymph node metastasis. If jaundice was present, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed. Angiography was also performed to confirm the anatomic characteristics of the blood vessels and determine the presence of tumor invasion into the hepatic arteries and portal vein. Intrahepatic metastasis was studied by means of computed tomographic angiography.

Cholangiography was performed by injecting contrast medium via the percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage tube, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was simultaneously performed. Immediately thereafter, helical computed tomography was performed to visualize the bile duct 3-dimensionally. Since invasion of the caudate lobe is especially frequent in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma, the presence and severity of invasion into the caudate branch bile ducts was confirmed. In 4 patients in whom extent of invasion was unclear, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography was performed for the biopsy to assess the actual tumor invasion. Recently, magnetic resonance cholangiography has been used, which allows the bile duct branches to be imaged without drainage.

### Advances in the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: an overview of the current and future therapeutic landscape for clinicians [^83f4b4d8]. CA (2023). Medium credibility.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common primary liver tumor and remains a fatal malignancy in the majority of patients. Approximately 20%-30% of patients are eligible for resection, which is considered the only potentially curative treatment; and, after resection, a median survival of 53 months has been reported when sequenced with adjuvant capecitabine. For the 70%-80% of patients who present with locally unresectable or distant metastatic disease, systemic therapy may delay progression, but survival remains limited to approximately 1 year. For the past decade, doublet chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin has been considered the most effective first-line regimen, but results from the recent use of triplet regimens and even immunotherapy may shift the paradigm. More effective treatment strategies, including those that combine systemic therapy with locoregional therapies like radioembolization or hepatic artery infusion, have also been developed. Molecular therapies, including those that target fibroblast growth factor receptor and isocitrate dehydrogenase, have recently received US Food and Drug Administration approval for a defined role as second-line treatment for up to 40% of patients harboring these actionable genomic alterations, and whether they should be considered in the first-line setting is under investigation. Furthermore, as the oncology field seeks to expand indications for immunotherapy, recent data demonstrated that combining durvalumab with standard cytotoxic therapy improved survival in patients with ICC. This review focuses on the current and future strategies for ICC treatment, including a summary of the primary literature for each treatment modality and an algorithm that can be used to drive a personalized and multidisciplinary approach for patients with this challenging malignancy.

Although uncommon, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) is a deadly malignancy, and the treatment approaches remain controversial. While surgery remains the only cure, few patients are candidates for resection up front, and there are high rates of both local and distant failure following resection. Herein, we systematically review the available evidence regarding treatment approaches for patients with EHCC, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The evidence regarding treatment outcomes was assessed using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design (PICOS) framework. A summary of recommendations based on the available literature is outlined for specific clinical scenarios encountered by providers in the clinic to guide the management of these patients.

Unresectable or metastatic CCA — biopsy is recommended to confirm diagnosis prior to therapy, and for unresectable disease biopsy is recommended only after determining transplant status because transperitoneal and surgical biopsy may be contraindicated in transplant candidates. Molecular testing is recommended to potentially guide targeted treatment, with primary options including systemic therapy, clinical trial, or best supportive care; additional options include combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiation, chemoradiation, and palliative RT. Following primary treatment, the disease should be assessed for response, resection or locoregional therapy should be reconsidered, and subsequent-line systemic therapy is an option if there is progression on or after systemic therapy.

Background:

We assessed the activity of gemcitabine (G) and cisplatin/gemcitabine (C/G) in patients with locally advanced (LA) or metastatic (M) (advanced) biliary cancers (ABC) for whom there is no standard chemotherapy.

Methods:

Patients, aged ⩾18 years, with pathologically confirmed ABC, Karnofsky performance (KP) ⩾60, and adequate haematological, hepatic and renal function were randomised to G 1000 mg m −2 on D1, 8, 15 q28d (Arm A) or C 25 mg m −2 followed by G 1000 mg m −2 D1, 8 q21d (Arm B) for up to 6 months or disease progression.

Results:

In total, 86 patients (A/B, n = 44/42) were randomised between February 2002 and May 2004. Median age (64/62.5 years), KP, primary tumour site, earlier surgery, indwelling biliary stent and disease stage (LA: 25/38%) are comparable between treatment arms. Grade 3–4 toxicity included (A/B, % patients) anaemia (4.5/2.4), leukopenia (6.8/4.8), neutropenia (13.6/14.3), thrombocytopenia (9.1/11.9), lethargy (9.1/28.6), nausea/vomiting (0/7.1) and anorexia (2.3/4.8). Responses (WHO criteria, % of evaluable patients: A n = 31 vs B n = 36): no CRs; PR 22.6 vs 27.8%; SD 35.5 vs 47.1% for a tumour control rate (CR+PR+SD) of 58.0 vs 75.0%. The median TTP and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) (the primary end point) were greater in the C/G arm (4.0 vs 8.0 months and 45.5 vs 57.1% in arms A and B, respectively).

Conclusion:

Both regimens seem active in ABC. C/G is associated with an improved tumour control rate, TTP and 6-month PFS. The study has been extended (ABC-02 study) and powered to determine the effect on overall survival and the quality of life.

### Surgical considerations of hilar cholangiocarcinoma [^ec169873]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy of the extrahepatic bile ducts. Hilar lesions are most common. Patients present with obstructive jaundice and intrahepatic bile duct dilation. Cross-sectional imaging reveals local, regional, and distant extent of disease, with direct cholangiography providing tissue for diagnosis. The consensus of a multidisciplinary committee dictates treatment. Resection of the extrahepatic bile duct and ipsilateral hepatic lobe with or without vascular resection and transplantation after neoadjuvant protocol are options for curative treatment. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor with negative margins. Patients with inoperable tumors or metastatic disease are best served with palliative chemoradiotherapy.

HCCa remains an uncommon malignancy, though increasing use of more radical surgery has led to prolonged survival in those patients who undergo curative resection. The extent of these resections suggest that the best results are likely to be obtained in centers with the resources and experience to conduct these operations in a safe fashion. Until major advances in the systemic therapy of HCCa are made, however, the management should focus on optimal preoperative imaging and palliation of jaundice with improvement in quality of life.

Background

We assessed the activity of gemcitabine (G) and cisplatin/gemcitabine (C/G) in patients with locally advanced (LA) or metastatic (M) (advanced) biliary cancers (ABC) for whom there is no standard chemotherapy.

Methods

Patients, aged ≥ 18 years, with pathologically confirmed ABC, Karnofsky performance (KP) ≥ 60, and adequate haematological, hepatic and renal function were randomised to G 1000 mg m(-2) on D1, 8, 15 q28d (Arm A) or C 25 mg m(-2) followed by G 1000 mg m(-2) D1, 8 q21d (Arm B) for up to 6 months or disease progression.

Adjuvant treatment

The aim of adjuvant treatment is to reduce the chances of disease relapse, thereby improving survival, following potentially curative resection. The PRODIGE 12 randomised phase III trial failed to show benefit of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin chemotherapy in patients with resected biliary tract cancer (CCA or gallbladder cancer) over observation alone; there was also no benefit from gemcitabine in a phase III study limited to patients with extrahepatic (perihilar and distal) CCA. The STAMP study compared gemcitabine and cisplatin with capecitabine in node-positive extrahepatic CCA. This was negative, but the sample size of 101 patients was small. The BILCAP phase III study, randomising patients with CCA and gallbladder cancer to receive adjuvant capecitabine versus observation failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival (the primary endpoint) by intention-to-treat analysis (HR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.04; p = 0.097). However, there was an improvement in survival according to the prespecified sensitivity analysis adjusted for sex, tumour grade and nodal stage (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.92; p = 0.010). This, together with the clinically meaningful numerical improvement in median survival (51.1 vs 36.4 months) favouring chemotherapy, by intention-to-treat analysis) has led to the adoption of capecitabine as standard of care and the reference for future studies.

### Cholangiocarcinoma 2020: the next horizon in mechanisms and management [^6b951e36]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Palliative chemotherapy

At the time of assessment of patients with CCA for palliative treatment, the following three aspects need to be considered: patient fitness as assessed in terms of ECOG-PS (patients with an ECOG-PS of ≥ 3 are unlikely to benefit from treatment and should be managed with best supportive care); disease distribution (patients with oligometastatic disease or with liver-only disease might be suitable for specific treatment approaches); and accessibility of tumour profiling.

Robust data support the used of first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy in patients with advanced disease. The ABC-02 trial randomly assigned 410 patients with ECOG-PS ≤ 2 to systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine alone or cisplatin–gemcitabine; the study showed an OS benefit in favour of cisplatin–gemcitabine (HR 0.64), a benefit confirmed in the Japanese randomized phase II BT22 study. Although patients with bilirubin more than twice the upper limit of normal were excluded from the ABC-02 trial, safety and feasibility data support its use in patients with a good ECOG-PS (PS 0 or 1) with jaundice who have refractory biliary obstruction due to endoluminal disease. More intensive triple-chemotherapy combinations are being explored in the first-line setting, such as cisplatin–gemcitabine combined with nab-paclitaxelor with S1 (tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil), and FOLFIRINOX (5-FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan; AMEBICA study, NCT02591030). Acelarin (NUC-1031) is a first-in-class nucleotide analogue, which, unlike gemcitabine, is independent of hENT2 (also known as SLC29A2) cellular transport and is not metabolized by cytidine deaminase, resulting in greater intracellular concentrations. Acelarin with cisplatinwill be compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin combination therapy in a phase III study (NCT04163900).

### Bile duct cancer stages-NCI… [^3af9f036]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

Bile Duct Cancer Stages This page describes the stages of bile duct cancer for adults. The stage describes the extent of cancer in the body. Knowing the stage helps the doctor plan the best treatment. Bile duct cancer stages are described using the TNM staging system. To learn more about TNM and how cancer stages are described, see Cancer Staging. To learn about the tests and procedures used to diagnose and stage bile duct cancer, see Bile Duct Cancer Diagnosis. Intrahepatic bile duct cancer Stage 0: In stage 0 intrahepatic bile duct cancer, abnormal cells are found in the innermost layer of tissue lining the intrahepatic bile duct. These abnormal cells are not actually cancer but may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage I: Stage I intrahepatic bile duct cancer is divided into stages IA and IB.
- In stage IA, cancer has formed in an intrahepatic bile duct and the tumor is 5 centimeters or smaller.
- In stage IB, cancer has formed in an intrahepatic bile duct and the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters. Stage II: In stage II intrahepatic bile duct cancer, either of the following is found:

- the tumor has spread through the wall of an intrahepatic bile duct and into a blood vessel; or
- more than one tumor has formed in the intrahepatic bile duct and may have spread into a blood vessel. Stage III: Stage III intrahepatic bile duct cancer is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.
- In stage IIIA, the tumor has spread through the capsule of the liver.
- In stage IIIB, cancer has spread to organs or tissues near the liver, such as the duodenum, colon, stomach, common bile duct, abdominal wall, diaphragm, or the part of the vena cava behind the liver, or the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.

Stage IV: In stage IV intrahepatic bile duct cancer, cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the bone, lungs, distant lymph nodes, or tissue lining the wall of the abdomen and most organs in the abdomen. Perihilar bile duct cancer Stage 0: In stage 0 perihilar bile duct cancer, abnormal cells are found in the innermost layer of tissue lining the perihilar bile duct. These abnormal cells are not actually cancer but may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called high-grade dysplasia. Stage I: In stage I perihilar bile duct cancer, cancer has formed in the innermost layer of tissue lining the perihilar bile duct and has spread into the muscle layer or fibrous tissue layer of the perihilar bile duct wall. Stage II: In stage II perihilar bile duct cancer, cancer has spread through the wall of the perihilar bile duct to nearby fatty tissue or to liver tissue.

Stage III: Stage III perihilar bile duct cancer is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.
- **Stage IIIA**: Cancer has spread to branches on one side of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein.
- Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to one or more of the following:

- the main part of the portal vein or its branches on both sides
- the common hepatic artery
- the right hepatic duct and the left branch of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein.
- the left hepatic duct and the right branch of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein
- Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes. Stage IV: Stage IV perihilar bile duct cancer is divided into stages IVA and IVB.
- **Stage IVA**: Cancer has spread to 4 or more nearby lymph nodes.
- **Stage IVB**: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, bone, brain, skin, distant lymph nodes, or tissue lining the wall of the abdomen and most organs in the abdomen.

Methods

Study design and participants

This trial was performed according to the Bryant and Day two-stage designto enrol a total of 30 patients with advanced BTC previously treated with GEMCIS. In the first stage, ten patients were treated with standard doses of FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2, irinotecan 180 mg/m 2, leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 and fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m 2, followed by continuous infusion of 2400 mg/m 2 fluorouracil over 46 h). Subsequently, stage two of this study was initiated if at least one objective response rate (ORR) or two stable diseases had been observed and not more than three patients had experienced treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) within the first 6 weeks of treatment.

Patients aged ≥ 18 years with Eastern Cooperative Group performance status (ECOG PS) of ≤ 1 and histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma with disease progression during or after ≥ 3 cycles of GEMCIS or intolerance to this treatment toxicities were enrolled in this trial. Other inclusion criteria included measurable disease according to RECIST1.1, and adequate bone-marrow, liver and kidney function. Patients with combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma were excluded.

All patients provided written informed consent. The institutional review boards and Medical ethics committee at the Amsterdam UMC reviewed and approved the protocol. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study was registered at Clinical Trials.gov (NCT02456714) on 28 May 2015.

### Update on treatment options for advanced bile duct tumours: radioembolisation for advanced cholangiocarcinoma [^0621109e]. Current Oncology Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Considerations When Developing a Treatment Algorithm for the Treatment of Patients with Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma

Surgical resection, where possible, is the cornerstone of therapy; however, in patients presenting with advanced disease, this is not appropriate. Systemic chemotherapy has an established, albeit modest, survival benefit. However, there is limited evidence supporting the use of RE in this patient subgroup. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, chemotherapy is a recommended treatment option for patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; there is a reference to the use of locoregional therapy but no specific reference to the use of RE. Additionally, comparative studies between systemic chemotherapy and RE are limited to single-centre, non-randomised studies or in the retrospective setting. The use of RE in other hepatic malignancies such as colorectal liver metastases has been evaluated with a phase III clinical trial, randomising patients to first-line chemotherapy alone vs. chemotherapy and RE. The results showed no improvement in overall PFS at any site; however, there was a significant delay in progression within the liver. A systematic review by Al-Adra et al. reported a mean OS in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma treated with RE therapy of 15.5 months. The reported survival is favourable in comparison to the previously reported median OS of 11.7 months in patients with advanced BTC treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy; therefore, within the limits of the evidence available, RE may be a potential treatment option.

A limitation to a number of the studies comparing various treatments includes the selection of a heavily pre-treated population; therefore, the true benefit of the therapy in question cannot be accurately tested. Also, various methods have been used to calculate treatment response or to predict outcomes with a number of studies assessing treatment response using either Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) or modified RECIST (mRECIST). Camacho et al. concluded that the use of mRECIST criteria accurately predicted OS whereas RECIST did not in patients with advanced BTC.

Pre-treatment prior to RE treatment (i.e. with systemic chemotherapy) may mask the true benefit of RE. A study performed by Haug et al. reported prolonged survival in patients treated with RE who were chemotherapy-naïve. This was also reported in a study performed by Ibrahim et al; however, these conclusions must be interpreted with caution as the studies include small patient cohorts and are therefore prone to selection bias.

NCCN Biliary Tract Cancers — Mixed HCC-CCA systemic therapy: A retrospective study of mixed hepatocellular carcinoma–cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CCA) treated with palliative systemic therapy demonstrated similar overall response rates with chemotherapy versus non-chemotherapy-based systemic therapies, with a trend toward longer median overall survival with chemotherapy (15.5 vs. 5.3 months; P = 0.052). Based upon this study, gemcitabine plus cisplatin combined with either durvalumab or pembrolizumab is an appropriate choice for first-line therapy, and the Panel notes these combinations include agents with anti-tumor activity in both CCA and HCC. Upon disease progression, molecularly-targeted therapies should be considered if the tumor harbors a targetable aberration, and in the absence of a targetable aberration, regimens with activity in both HCC and CCA are reasonable options, including nivolumab plus ipilimumab or regorafenib.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma — hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy outcomes and panel guidance: In unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), gemcitabine and oxaliplatin combinations yielded objective radiographic response 58% and disease control 84%, with median overall survival (OS) 25.5 months and progression-free survival (PFS) 11.8 months. A prospective single arm phase II of gemcitabine/cisplatin plus HAI floxuridine in 50 patients reported median follow-up 26.4 months, median OS 22.1 months, median PFS 10 months, and 1-year and 2-year OS rates 80% and 28.6%. A meta-analysis including 30 studies (N = 657) found OS and tumor response greater for HAI than for TACE, DEB-TACE, or TARE with Y90 microspheres, with a median tumor response rate of 57%. In a retrospective cohort of 525 patients, HAI combined with chemotherapy improved OS versus chemotherapy without HAI (30.8 vs. 18.4 months; P < .001). Another retrospective comparison of HAI chemotherapy versus modified FOLFOX first-line therapy found no difference in median OS or PFS overall, but intrahepatic PFS improved with HAI (P = 0.035), with single-tumor patients showing OS (P = 0.047) and PFS (P = 0.009) benefit. Based on these data, the Panel has included locoregional therapy as a treatment option that may be considered for unresectable disease or metastatic cancer without extrahepatic disease, and states that HAI chemotherapy, with or without systemic chemotherapy, may be used in the context of a clinical trial at experienced centers in carefully selected cases for patients with advanced disease confined to the liver.

### Cholangiocarcinoma: current opinion on clinical practice diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms: a review of the literature and a long-standing experience of a referral center [^78253744]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

In the oncology landscape, cholangiocarcinoma is a challenging disease in terms of both diagnosis and treatment. Besides anamnesis and clinical examination, a definitive diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma should be supported by imaging techniques (US, CT, MRI) and invasive investigations (ERC or EUS with brushing and FNA or US or CT-guided biopsy) followed by pathological confirmation. Surgery is the main curative option, so resectability of the tumour should be promptly assessed. Moreover, jaundice must be evaluated at the outset because biliary tract decompression with drainage and stent placement may be required. If the patient is resectable, pre-operative assessment of postoperative liver function is mandatory. After a curative resection, an adjuvant therapy may be administered. Otherwise, in cases with macroscopic residual disease after surgery or locally recurrent or unresectable cholangiocarcinoma at the diagnosis, first-line chemotherapy is the preferred strategy, possibly associated with radiotherapy and/or locoregional treatments. As the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway for cholangiocarcinoma can be declined in different modalities, patients should be promptly referred to a multidisciplinary team in a tertiary centre, familiar with this rare but lethal disease. Hence, the aim of the present paper is to focus on diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms based on the common guidelines and also on the clinical practice of multispecialist expert groups.

Biliary tract cancer accounts for roughly 3% of adult malignancies of the gastrointestinal system. First-line treatment with gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy is the standard for the management of metastatic biliary tract cancers. We present the case of a man who presented with abdominal pain, decreased appetite and weight loss for 6months. Baseline evaluation revealed a liver hilar mass with ascites. Imaging, tumour markers, histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed the diagnosis of metastatic extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. He was treated with gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy with gemcitabine and demonstrated an exceptionally good response and tolerance to chemotherapy with no long-term toxicity so far on maintenance therapy and progression-free survival exceeding 2.5 years after diagnosis. The rarity of this case is the exhibition of prolonged clinical response with maintenance chemotherapy for an aggressive cancer, thus needing further research into duration and outcomes of maintenance chemotherapy.

Laparoscopy can identify the majority of patients with occult metastatic hilar CCA, albeit with a lower yield, and a review including six studies of staging laparoscopy in patients with hilar CCA showed a yield of 14% to 45%.

### Liver transplantation for locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant therapy: a prospective case-series [^bd7212d0]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

At present, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is a contraindication for liver transplantation. However, previous studies in this field did not preselect patients on the basis of chemosensitivity or disease trajectory after neoadjuvant therapy. Experience with hilar cholangiocarcinoma has indicated that neoadjuvant therapy followed by liver transplantation in patients without disease progression results in a long-term survival benefit. We aimed to establish the potential efficacy of liver transplantation in patients with biologically responsive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who have had sustained tumour stability or regression with neoadjuvant therapy.

Methods

In this prospective case-series, patients with locally advanced, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, without extrahepatic disease or vascular involvement, were treated at a single liver transplant centre according to a non-randomised, centre-approved clinical management protocol with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by liver transplantation. Neoadjuvant therapy consisted of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine-cisplatin or gemcitabine-capecitabine, with second-line or third-line therapies given per institutional standards. Patients with a minimum of 6 months of radiographic response or stability were listed for liver transplantation. The primary endpoints were overall survival and recurrence-free survival after liver transplantation, assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. This report includes interim data from the initial case-series treated under this ongoing clinical management protocol, censored on Dec 1, 2017.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 1, 2017, 21 patients were referred for evaluation and 12 patients were accepted, of whom six patients have undergone liver transplantation for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Three patients received livers from extended criteria deceased donors that would otherwise have been discarded, two from domino living donors, and one from a standard criteria liver donor. Median duration from diagnosis to transplantation was 26 months (IQR 17–33) and median follow-up from transplantation was 36 months (29–51). All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy while awaiting liver transplantation. Overall survival was 100% (95% CI 100–100) at 1 year, 83.3% (27.3–97.5) at 3 years, and 83.3% (27.3–97.5) at 5 years. Three patients developed recurrent disease at a median of 7.6 months (IQR 5.8–8.6) after transplantation, with 50% (95% CI 11.1–80.4) recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years. Adverse events after liver transplantation included one patient with postoperative ileus (grade 3) and one patient with acute kidney injury requiring temporary dialysis (grade 4).

Interpretation

Selected patients with locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who show pre-transplant disease stability on neoadjuvant therapy might benefit from liver transplantation.

Management of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma — preoperative drainage and nodal surgery extent: Combined hepatic and pancreatic resections to clear distant nodal disease are not recommended, as these are highly morbid procedures with no obvious associated survival advantage. The guidelines recommend consideration of biliary drainage prior to definitive resection for patients with jaundice prior to instituting systemic therapy, but caution should be exercised in patients with hilar biliary obstruction as drainage is not always simple and can be associated with significant morbidity, and decisions about whether preoperative biliary drainage is appropriate (and the type of drainage) should be made by a multidisciplinary team at an experienced high-volume center.

### Second-line FOLFOX chemotherapy versus active symptom control for advanced biliary tract cancer (ABC-06): a phase 3, open-label, randomised, controlled trial [^245449b9]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Biliary tract cancer is a term that includes cholangiocarcinoma (either intrahepatic or extrahepatic in origin) and cancers of the gallbladder and ampulla of Vater. These uncommon cancers arising from the biliary tract account for less than 1% of all cancers worldwide. However, its incidence is increasing, primarily due to a rising incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The prognosis is poor, with an all-stage 5-year overall survival of less than 20%. Patients are rarely diagnosed with early-stage disease and therefore curative surgery and adjuvant therapy is only feasible for a small proportion of patients.

The ABC-02 study established cisplatin and gemcitabine as first-line therapy for patients with advanced biliary tract cancerand remains the current standard of care. Randomised studies during the past decade have failed to show an improvement in survival with the addition of biological therapies (EGFR or VEGF inhibitors); intensification of chemotherapy is under evaluation (eg, gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel; cisplatin, gemcitabine, and S-1; and FOLFIRINOX [oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil]).

The role of second-line chemotherapy after progression on cisplatin and gemcitabine remains unclear, with no prospective randomised trials reported so far. Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer often experience a rapid decline in performance status following progression on first-line chemotherapy, and only 15–25% receive second-line therapy. Some studies suggest that second-line chemotherapy might be of value for patients with a good performance status;, however, this theory is subject to selection bias and has not been explored in a randomised study, and no consensus exists regarding the optimum regimen.

Three groups of agents have broadly shown activity in biliary tract cancer in retrospective and prospective trials: gemcitabine, fluoropyrimidines, and platinum agents. Since the sensitivity to platinum agents in these malignancies is well described, together with the fact that switching to a fluoropyrimidine-based schedule after progression on first-line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is considered appropriate in similar scenarios, it was anticipated that a fluorouracil and platinum doublet (such as oxaliplatin and fluorouracil in FOLFOX, which comprises leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) was most likely to be effective. Existing phase 2 and retrospective data also supported this choice.

ASTRO — External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC) recommendations emphasize indication-specific use and strength language as follows: Strong recommendations are made for using EBRT as a potential first-line treatment in patients with liver-confined HCC who are not candidates for curative therapy, as consolidative therapy after incomplete response to liver-directed therapies, and as a salvage option for local recurrences. The guideline conditionally recommends EBRT for patients with liver-confined multifocal or unresectable HCC or those with macrovascular invasion, sequenced with systemic or catheter-based therapies. Palliative EBRT is conditionally recommended for symptomatic primary HCC and/or macrovacular tumor thrombi, and EBRT is conditionally recommended as a bridge to transplant or before surgery in carefully selected patients. For patients with unresectable IHC, consolidative EBRT with or without chemotherapy should be considered, typically after systemic therapy, and adjuvant EBRT is conditionally recommended for resected IHC with high-risk features. Selection of dose-fractionation regimen and technique should be based on disease extent, disease location, underlying liver function, and available technologies, and the scope includes definitive, consolidative, salvage, preoperative (including bridge to transplant), adjuvant, and palliative settings for symptomatic primary lesions.

Arterially directed therapies including Y90 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma — Hepatic tumors may be amenable to arterially directed therapies provided the supply to tumor may be isolated without excessive non-target treatment. Select patients with limited extrahepatic disease (hilar lymph node ≤ 3 cm or ≤ 5 lung nodules each ≤ 1 cm) may be considered for arterially directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy. Arterially directed therapies include transarterial embolization, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), TACE with drug-eluting beads, and Y90, and these therapies may be used alone or followed by systemic chemotherapy with the intention to prolong survival or downstage to curative resection. When treating with Y90, personalized dosimetry/radiation segmentectomy to achieve > 205 Gy to tumor may improve outcome. Y90 is relatively contraindicated in patients with bilirubin > 3 mg/dL, and with well-selected patients, grade 3–4 hepatic toxicity occurs in < 10% of patients, although this may be significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (with or without systemic chemotherapy) may be used in a clinical trial or at experienced centers in carefully selected cases.

### International registry on cholangiocarcinoma treatment (CHOLANGIO) [^b24e4228]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare and very aggressive neoplasm that arises from the biliary epithelium, constitutes approximately 2% of all reported cancer, and accounts for about 3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. Up to date, there are many modalities to diagnosis and treat with a range of sensitivity and specificity, and also the advantage and disadvantage of its modality. Cholangiocarcinoma has a poor prognosis. Surgical resection offers the only curative option and usually requires a major hepatic resection in addition to resection of the cholangiocarcinoma. Unfortunately, curative resection is possible in only about 30% of patients due to locally advanced disease, distant metastases or comorbidity in elderly patients. Even after resection, the recurrence rate is approximately 60%, resulting in a low 5-year overall survival.

Patients with intra-hepatic Cholangiocarcinoma have a very limited benefit from systemic chemotherapy, indeed, in unresectable cholangiocarcinoma Overall Survival with systemic chemotherapy is less than 1 year. Since most cholangiocarcinoma patients develop distant metastases at late stages only, locoregional therapy is an interesting therapeutic strategy. Locoregional therapy studies in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma employing radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization or external as well as internal radiation therapy yielded promising results in the last couple of years. TACE is safe and may be effective for prolonging the survival of patients with nonresectable combined hepatocellular carcinoma -cholangiocarcinoma, as compared with the historically reported survivals of these patients. Tumor vascularity is highly associated with tumor response.

The patient survival period after TACE for combined HCC-cholangiocarcinoma is significantly dependent on tumor size, tumor vascularity, Child-Pugh class, and presence or absence of portal vein invasion. Currently, few centers perform TACE therapy for unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma. Several European studies have reported the efficacy and safety TACE for ICC. The establishment of a registry to obtain the majority of Cholangiocarcinoma cases treated with locoregional approach within and outside Europe can help the investigators evaluate a larger and non-ambiguous sample population. This would help the investigators evaluate the technical success rates, clinical success rates, feasibility and safety of TACE for ICC. Study Design: Prospective observational study Primary objective: This is a data collection study where the main purpose is to collect information about the treatments that patients receive for their unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.

Secondary objectives: To create an international Registry including patients undergoing locoregional treatments, to correlate tumour characteristics with outcome, survival and prognosis; to identify criteria for guiding therapy including TACE, chemoinfusion and other locoregional treatments. Day -1: prehydration, antibiotic prophylaxis and setting up of a therapeutic scheme appropriate for analgesic prophylaxis as previously reported 1 vial of tropisetron administered by slow drip Day 0: Upon admittance to the radiology room, the patient receive morphine hydrochloride 10 mgr diluted in 100 mL of salin solution i. v. Tropisetron i. v. if needed. Intra-arterial premedication with 2. 5 mgr of verapamil
2. 5 mgr diluted in 4 mL of normal saline solution followed by 4 mL of lidocaine 2%.

Locoregional therapy — patient selection and modalities for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: Locoregional therapy may be considered in patients who are not candidates for surgical curative therapies or to downstage for other treatments. For recurrent or primary small single tumors < 3 cm, thermal ablation is a reasonable alternative to surgical resection; ablation options include cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and irreversible electroporation. Hepatic tumors may be amenable to arterially directed therapies provided the supply to the tumor may be isolated without excessive non-target treatment; arterially directed therapies may be considered for select patients with limited extrahepatic disease (hilar lymph node ≤ 3 cm or ≤ 5 lung nodules ≤ 1 cm each). These therapies may be used alone or followed by systemic chemotherapy with the intention to prolong survival or downstage to curative resection. Locoregional therapies including radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), TACE with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE), and radioembolization (TARE) with Y90 microspheres have been shown to be safe and effective in a small retrospective series of patients with unresectable intrahepatic CCAs.

### Novel multimodality treatment sequencing for extrahepatic (mid and distal) cholangiocarcinoma [^8c816ab8]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiation has demonstrated significant advantages in the management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A similar tumor in a nearby anatomical location is extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which has proven to be largely unresponsive to current forms of therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma has been combined with surgical resection and/or liver transplantation with a 25–33% complete pathological response rate. We propose a wider application of neoadjuvant chemoradiation for patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma and present our rationale for this form of treatment sequencing.

### A phase II study of gemcitabine and cisplatin plus sorafenib in patients with advanced biliary adenocarcinomas [^e9007664]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The study was a phase II, single-institution, non-randomised, open-label clinical trial in patients with advanced biliary adenocarcinomas. It was approved by the institutional review board at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The US National Cancer Institute ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT00919061.

Eligibility criteria

Patients with histologically proven, non-resectable, recurrent or metastatic biliary adenocarcinoma including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder adenocarcinoma with measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 were eligible for enrolment. Patients with combined cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma were also allowed in the study. No prior systemic therapy except for gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil in the adjuvant setting, administered more than 6 months prior to enrolment, was permitted. Patients were required to have a Karnofsky performance status of ⩾80% and adequate organ function, including a haemoglobin level of ⩾8 g dL −1, ANC ⩾1.5 × 10 3 μ l −1, platelet count ⩾100 × 10 3 μ l −1, serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg dL −1 or calculated creatinine clearance ⩾60 mL min −1, total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg dL −1, and ALT and AST ≤ 3 times the upper limit of normal (≤ 5 times if liver metastases present). Patients with evidence of biliary obstruction were only allowed to join the study if total bilirubin level was expected to decrease to the required limit after adequate biliary drainage.

Treatment and dose modifications

Gemcitabine and cisplatin were administered as an intravenous infusion, weekly for 2 weeks, followed by a week off treatment for each 3-week cycle at starting doses of 1000 mg m −2 and 25 mg m −2, respectively. A maximum of 3-week delay in treatment was allowed. During the conduct of the study, in view of excess haematologic and other toxicity as described in the Results section, the study was amended and the gemcitabine dose was reduced to 800 mg m −2 and the cisplatin dose to 20 mg m −2 at the same treatment schedule. Treatment was continued until disease progression (either clinical or radiologic evidence) or development of unacceptable toxicity.

Sorafenib was prescribed at the standard dose of 400 mg twice daily throughout the cycle. Dose delays or modifications were required due to drug-related toxicities. A maximum of 3-week delay in treatment was allowed. During the conduct of the study, in view of unanticipated toxicity described in the Results section, the study was amended and sorafenib dose was reduced to 400 mg daily at the same treatment schedule.

### Efficacy and safety comparison of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and upfront surgery for treating intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8eb97636]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originating from bile duct epithelial cells and can be divided into intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which can be classified into hilar and distal cholangiocarcinoma based on their anatomical location. ICC is the second most common liver tumor after hepatocellular carcinoma, accounting for 10% to 20% of all cholangiocarcinoma. Surgical resection is the widely accepted and potentially curative therapy of choice for ICC, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend upfront surgery for resectable and non-metastatic ICC. However, most ICC cases are usually advanced and unresectable, with multiple intrahepatic lesions and distant metastasis due to late diagnosis. Although about 15% of ICC are resectable, the median survival is less than 3 years. Additionally, ICC is very prone to recurrence and metastasis after surgery, resulting in a relapse in about 22% of patients within six months after surgery, with lower 5-year overall survival (OS) (less than 40%) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS). Thus, ICC has a very poor prognosis.

The BILCAP phase III randomized controlled trial showed that using capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery can improve OS in patients with resected cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer. The trial has promoted the widespread adoption of capecitabine as a clinical practice standard for adjuvant therapy and has been included in the treatment guidelines for biliary tract cancer, including the ASCO guidelines, in various countries. However, the treatment has been criticized for its ability to represent the true standard of care since postoperative capecitabine therapy failed to improve OS in the intention-to-treat population, which was the primary endpoint. Furthermore, two other phase-III randomized clinical trials also failed to show whether adjuvant chemotherapy based on gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin improves the OS or RFS in patients with biliary tract cancer. Therefore, it can be concluded that not all patients can benefit from adjuvant therapy, whose effectiveness is closely related to the types of chemotherapy drugs. Most importantly, most ICC are unresectable, making it impossible for the patients to undergo postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.

### Guidelines development group for the British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma [^95de05b3]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

We have recently published in Gut the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma. In the guidelines we recommended cisplatin plus gemcitabine (CisGem) chemotherapy as first-line systemic treatment in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), and that immunotherapy may be added to CisGem chemotherapy if approved and available (Recommendation 39). A few weeks after the guidelines were published, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence approved and recommended the use of durvalumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin as an option for treating locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic BTC in adults, and we believe this triple combination should be first line. This was also approved by the Scottish Medicines Consortium in November 2023 and thus represents a new standard of care for cholangiocarcinoma treatment, but this is not specifically mentioned in the latest published BSG guidelines.

Furthermore, at the time of publication of the BSG guidelines, there was little consensus as to the frequency of clinical follow-up following resection for cholangiocarcinoma. However, as patients are at risk of complications related to treatment, as well as the high rate of cholangiocarcinoma recurrence, follow-up is carried out in practice by most centres. Following the recent publication of the ESMO Guidelines Committee's Clinical Practice Guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of BTC, we also now recommend that follow-up is undertaken following cholangiocarcinoma-resection, and this may consist of 3 to 6-monthly visits during the first 2 years and 6 to 12-monthly visits for up to 5 years, or as clinically indicated. A combination of clinical examination, laboratory investigations, tumour markers and CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis may be appropriate.

These updates have been endorsed by all authors on the guideline writing panel as well as the Liver Committee of the BSG. We request that these important updates, via this letter, be linked to the online BSG guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for cholangiocarcinoma, more specifically with respect to radiotherapy (technical considerations), ASTRO 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering dose-escalated ultra- or moderately hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy with fractionation based on tumor location, underlying liver function, and available technology in patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma receiving external beam radiation therapy. Do not use concurrent systemic therapy with ultrahypofractionated external beam radiation therapy.

### Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) treatment (PDQ ®) [^17681da3]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Perihilar region. The hilum is the region where the right and left hepatic ducts exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct that is proximal to the origin of the cystic duct. Tumors of this region are also known as perihilar cholangiocarcinomas or Klatskin tumors. Distal region. This region includes the common bile duct and inserts into the small intestine. Tumors of this region are also known as extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Clinical Features Distal and perihilar bile duct cancers frequently cause biliary tract obstruction, leading to the following symptoms:

- Jaundice.
- Weight loss.
- Abdominal pain.
- Fever.
- Pruritus. Intrahepatic bile duct cancer may be relatively indolent and difficult to differentiate clinically from metastatic adenocarcinoma deposits in the liver.

Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation Clinical evaluation is dependent on laboratory and radiographic imaging tests that include:

- Liver function tests and other laboratory studies.
- Abdominal ultrasonography.
- Computed tomography.
- Magnetic resonance imaging.
- Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. These tests demonstrate the extent of the primary tumor and help determine the presence or absence of distant metastases. If a patient is medically fit for surgery and the tumor is amenable to surgical resection, surgical exploration is performed. Pathological examination of the resected specimen is done to establish definitive pathological staging. Prognosis Prognosis depends in part on the tumor's anatomical location, which affects resectability. Because of proximity to major blood vessels and diffuse extension within the liver, a bile duct tumor can be difficult to resect.

Total resection is possible in 25% to 30% of lesions that originate in the distal bile duct; the resectability rate is lower for lesions that occur in more proximal sites. Complete resection with negative surgical margins offers the only chance of cure for bile duct cancer. For localized, resectable extrahepatic and intrahepatic tumors, the presence of involved lymph nodes and perineural invasion are significant adverse prognostic factors. Additionally, among patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, the following prognostic factors have been associated with worse outcomes:

- A personal history of primary sclerosing cholangitis.
- Elevated cancer antigen 19–9 level.
- Periductal infiltrating tumor growth pattern.
- Presence of hepatic venous invasion.

Extended resections of hepatic duct bifurcation tumors to include adjacent liver, either by lobectomy or removal of portions of segments 4 and 5 of the liver, may be performed. If major hepatic resection is necessary to achieve a complete resection, postoperative hepatic reserve should be evaluated. For patients with underlying cirrhosis, the Child-Pugh class and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score are determined. Unresectable Bile Duct Cancer Most cases of intrahepatic, distal, and perihilar bile duct cancer are unresectable and cannot be completely removed. Often the cancer directly invades the portal vein, the adjacent liver, along the common bile duct, and the adjacent lymph nodes. Portal hypertension may result from invasion of the portal vein. Spread to distant parts of the body is uncommon, but intra-abdominal metastases, particularly peritoneal metastases, do occur.

### Update on treatment options for advanced bile duct tumours: radioembolisation for advanced cholangiocarcinoma [^e598cbe3]. Current Oncology Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment Options for Advanced Disease

The most frequently used treatment modality is chemotherapy, particularly in the presence of systemic (usually extrahepatic) disease. The current reference regimen is cisplatin and gemcitabine based on the pivotal phase III study showing an advantage in overall survival (OS) from this combination compared to gemcitabine alone (11.7 vs. 8.1 months, respectively; p < 0.001). These findings were confirmed in a Japanese randomised phase II study (BT22 study) (see Table 1). Other regimens using fluoropyrimidines (such as 5-fluorouracil), gemcitabine and other platinum agents, either in combination or as monotherapy, have been reported. However, their efficacy has not been confirmed in randomised phase III studies.

Table 1
Summary of some clinical trials exploring the role of cisplatin/gemcitabine systemic chemotherapy in BTCs

CI confidence interval, ICC intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, OS overall survival, PFS progression-free survival

a The GERCOR clinical trial divided patients into two prognostic groups: the first one (group A) was good prognosis patients (n = 33) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–2, less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) total bilirubin and without previous chemotherapy treatment. The second group (group B) patients were poor prognosis: greater than performance status 2, bilirubin above 2.5 times ULN or progressive disease to a previous chemotherapy schedule

Following progression on first-line chemotherapy, approximately 15% of patients are suitable for further chemotherapy, mainly due to rapidly progressive disease and worsening performance status. In addition, the magnitude of benefit, if any, from second-line chemotherapy is unknown. Active symptom control (e.g. by biliary stenting and antibiotics, as appropriate) is considered the standard of care in some countries as the benefit suggested by small prospective and retrospective studies has not been confirmed in prospective studies. The ABC-06 study (NCT01926236;) is a randomised phase III trial which compares the combination of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil (FOLFOX) against active symptom control alone in patients with advanced BTC following progression on first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine; recruitment is ongoing.

Unlike patients with gallbladder cancer or distal cholangiocarcinoma, patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma may have liver-only (or liver-predominant) disease; in such cases, a liver-directed approach (e.g. RE) may be considered following systemic therapy.

Biliary tract cancers — management options and first-line systemic therapy: BTCs are associated with a poor prognosis and commonly present with advanced disease. Complete resection is the best available potentially curative treatment, and ablation is potentially curative for small intrahepatic CCAs. Consideration of locoregional therapy is included as an option for unresectable or metastatic intrahepatic CCA. The combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiation, chemoradiation alone, and referral to a transplant center are options for unresectable intrahepatic or extrahepatic CCA. Palliative RT may be used for unresectable gallbladder cancer or extrahepatic CCA, and systemic therapy is also an option for unresectable or metastatic BTCs.

Patients and methods

Patient selection

Patients were eligible if they had a pathologically proven diagnosis of advanced and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic biliary duct carcinoma, or gallbladder carcinoma, an ECOG performance status 0–1, measurable disease, as well as adequate liver and renal function tests. A total serum bilirubin level up to 3.0 mg per 100 mL was allowed. Advanced disease was defined as primary tumours or relapsed disease not amenable for radical surgery or metastatic disease. Earlier treatments including surgery, locoregional treatment, and systemic therapy were allowed as well. Patients were required to sign an informed consent, and the Local Ethics Committee of the Province of Modena approved the study.

Study design

This was a phase II single-arm open-label non-randomised multicentre trial. The primary objective was to evaluate the activity, defined as the disease control rate at 12 weeks, of sorafenib as a single agent in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Disease control rate was defined as the percentage of patients without disease progression (complete response, partial response, stable disease) and still on treatment at 12 weeks. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and tolerability.

Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the first day of administration of the study drug to disease progression or death for toxicity or disease progression.

Overall survival was defined as the time from the first day of study medication administration to death or last contact.

### Study details | Robotically assisted surgery for perihilar… [^59668b1d]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Cholangiocarcinoma represents the most common biliary tract malignancy, and the second most common primary hepatic malignancy, accounting for 15% to 20% of primary liver tumours. Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma involves the biliary confluence with or without involvement of the right and left hepatic ducts. Complete resection with negative histologic margins is the only chance of cure and the most robust predictor of long-term survival for patients affected by any type of locally advanced CCA. However, the proximity of perihilar tumors to vital structures makes curative excision technically difficult. This is a monocentric, single arm, observational, prospective study that aims at analyzing the outcomes of robotic major liver resection and biliary recontruction for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.

Among study outcomes, the primary outcome is evaluation of morbidity; secondary outcomes includes conversion rate, margin status, biliary fistula, liver failure, disease specific survival, overall Survival. Cholangiocarcinoma represents the most common biliary tract malignancy, and the second most common primary hepatic malignancy, accounting for 15% to 20% of primary liver tumours. The incidence of bile duct cancers is increasing worldwide, currently accounting for 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers. According to the anatomical location it is classified as follows: intrahepatic, perihilar and distal subtypes. Approximately 50% of CCA are perihilar, 40% are extrahepatic and only 10% or less are intrahepatic. Each type of cholangiocarcinoma is characterised by differences in the tumour biology and management, each has a separate American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.

Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, also called Klatskin tumour, involves the biliary confluence with or without involvement of the right and left hepatic ducts. It is a challenging disease to manage in the preoperatory setting and during surgery. Painless jaundice is the main symptom at presentation. It often arises rapidly and it is present in 90% of pCCA. Fatigue, anorexia, weight loss and non-specific abdominal pain are other common symptoms. Complete resection with negative histologic margins is the only chance of cure and the most robust predictor of long-term survival for patients affected by any type of locally advanced CCA. However, the proximity of perihilar tumors to vital structures, such as the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic parenchyma, makes curative excision technically difficult. Median survival for patients who cannot undergo surgery is 12 months. Patients who receive radical surgical resection have a 5-year survival up to 40%.

Radical surgical resection of pCCA usually requires a hemi-hepatectomy, often extended. For this reason, the preoperative assessment of the future liver remnant volume is a critical step in the surgical plan. Traditionally, a "safe" liver resection requires a FLR of at least 25% in a perfectly healthy liver. When the organ is compromised by steatosis, chronic cholestasis, cirrhosis or chemotherapy this rate has to increase up to 40%. Regional lymphnode metastases are not considered an absolute contraindication to resection, although N+ disease is an independent prognostic factor for worse outcome. Nevertheless, complete lymphadenectomy of the hepatoduodenal ligament is considered an essential step of the surgical procedure. Liver and bile duct resection for pCCA are technically complex procedures: the specimen resection with negative margins requires careful dissection of major vascular structures such as portal vein and hepatic arteries.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) systemic therapy — gemcitabine/cisplatin (gem/cis) remains the standard of care for advanced biliary tract cancers, but this combination resulted in a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 8 months and a median overall survival (OS) of 11.7 months. The combination of 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan did not demonstrate any significant improvement in 6-month PFS compared to gem/cis in a randomized Phase 2 study. In a single-arm Phase 2 study, gem/cis plus nab-paclitaxel showed a median OS of 19.4 months and an overall response rate (ORR) of 45%, leading to an ongoing randomized Phase 2 trial (SWOG-1815). After progression on gem/cis, retrospective second-line data demonstrated a median PFS in the 2-month to 3-month range; the ABC-06 study showed a significant improvement in median OS with 5-FU and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) versus active symptom control, but the numerical difference was marginal (5.3 vs. 6.2 months), and FOLFOX is now viewed as the gold standard for second-line therapy in advanced biliary tract cancers.

NCCN Biliary Tract Cancers — locoregional therapy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: Locoregional therapy may be considered for patients who are not candidates for surgical curative therapies or to downstage for other treatments, using modalities such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), TACE with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) or TACE drug-eluting microspheres, and radioembolization (TARE) with Y90 microspheres, which have been shown to be safe and effective in a small retrospective series of unresectable intrahepatic CCAs. For recurrent or primary small tumors < 3 cm, thermal ablation is a reasonable alternative to surgical resection; ablation options include radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and irreversible electroporation. Hepatic tumors may be amenable to arterially directed therapies if the arterial supply can be isolated without excessive non-target treatment, and these therapies may be considered for select patients with limited extrahepatic disease (hilar lymph node < 3 cm or ≤ 5 lung nodules ≤ 1 cm each); they may be used alone or followed by systemic chemotherapy to prolong survival or downstage to curative resection. In two independent prospective studies, the efficacy of TACE with irinotecan drug-eluting beads was similar to gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) but superior to TACE with mitomycin.

NCCN biliary tract cancers — hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: Data from prospective studies support the use of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy in patients with advanced, liver-confined, and unresectable intrahepatic CCA. In a meta-analysis including 20 studies (N = 657), HAI was compared to TACE, DEB-TACE, and TARE with Y90 microspheres, and OS and tumor response were greatest for HAI, with a median tumor response rate of 57%, although grade III/IV toxicity was also highest. A retrospective analysis of 525 patients with intrahepatic CCA showed that patients who received a combined regimen of HAI and another chemotherapy agent had greater OS relative to chemotherapy without HAI (30.8 vs. 18.4 months; P < .001). In a separate retrospective comparison, the median OS and PFS did not differ between HAI chemotherapy with mFOLFOX and first-line systemic therapy, although intrahepatic PFS was improved with HAI (P = 0.035), and subgroup analysis indicated benefit for single tumors in terms of OS (P = 0.047) and PFS (P = 0.009). Based on the available evidence, the Panel has included locoregional therapy as a treatment option that may be considered for patients with unresectable disease or metastatic cancer without extrahepatic disease, and states that intra-arterial chemotherapy, with or without systemic chemotherapy, may be used only in the context of a clinical trial or at experienced centers in carefully selected cases for patients with advanced disease confined to the liver.

### Guiding first-line treatment decisions in advanced urothelial carcinoma: a global survey [^96379ac1]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Controversy exists on the need to define absolute restrictive criteria for EV-P use. Our survey of 201 genitourinary physicians underscores the critical importance of clinical vigilance and the need for practical guidance to assist non–expert clinicians in identifying patients at an increased risk of treatment-related toxicities. These findings are not intended to limit access to EV-P therapy but rather to support individualized decision-making, enabling clinicians to identify patients for whom alternative approaches or enhanced monitoring may be more appropriate.

Our study did not explore optimal therapies based on specific clinical scenarios. For instance, cisplatin-based chemotherapy would likely not be favored in patients with significant renal dysfunction or pre–existing neuropathy, and treating patients with ECOG PS ≥ 3 remains challenging regardless of the regimen chosen. In clinical practice, some physicians may consider empirical dose modifications of EV, such as initiating treatment with a reduced dose or omitting the Day 8 administration, in an effort to improve tolerability in frail patients or those with borderline fitness. However, these strategies remain unsupported by prospective clinical data, and their impact on efficacy cannot be directly compared with other alternative regimens such as carboplatin plus gemcitabine or single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. It is important to emphasize that such empirical practices should not be considered evidence-based, but rather anecdotal adaptations reflecting the heterogeneity of real-world clinical scenarios. It is also noteworthy that several of the clinical factors identified as potential contraindications for EV-P overlap with those that preclude the safe use of platinum-based chemotherapy, such as severe neuropathy, renal dysfunction, poor performance status (ECOG PS > 2), or uncontrolled diabetes. This overlap underscores that many patients considered unsuitable for EV-P are, in fact, broadly unfit for any multi–agent systemic regimen, rather than uniquely ineligible for this specific combination. The recent EAU guidelineshighlight this point clearly, emphasizing the need for individualized treatment approaches for such patients, which often include single-agent immunotherapy or best supportive care. Furthermore, some of the contraindications identified by respondents, such as significant liver impairment, severe ocular abnormalities, or extensive dermatologic comorbidities, are also relevant for checkpoint inhibitor therapy in general. These factors may preclude not only the use of EV-P but also the administration of single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the first-line, maintenance, or later-line setting. This observation suggests that part of the perceived contraindication spectrum reflects the broader safety profile of immunotherapy agents, rather than being exclusive to the antibody-drug conjugate component of EV-P.

### Biliary intervention combined with lenvatinib + PD-1 inhibitor of Klatskin tumor complicated with malignant obstructive jaundice… [^f9d9942a]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract e14620 Background: Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare and highly aggressive cancer that occurs at or near the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts. Gemcitabine + cisplatin has been established as an effective first-line treatment. However, this malignancy is commonly complicated by malignant biliary obstruction which may gradually damage patients' liver function and may limit the chemotherapy. In addition, Cumulative clinical evidence showed that tyrosine kinase inhibitor combined with immunotherapy is represented as a promising alternative. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical value of biliary intervention combined with the Lenvatinib+PD-1 inhibitor for the Klatskin tumor. Methods: From January 2020 to December 2022, 21 Klatskin tumor patients with malignant hilar biliary obstruction were included.

All included patients received biliary decompression by metal stent + Iodine-125 seed strand implantation. The number of 125I seeds to be implanted was determined according to the plan of the preoperative computerized treatment planning system. The procedure-related outcomes were evaluated regarding successful drainage and complications. In addition, the survival of patients who received successful biliary drainage and patients who received sequential systemic anticancer treatment were analyzed. Successful biliary drainage was defined as the serum total bilirubin level dropped by 75% of the preoperative value within 4 weeks. Major complications referred to those that result in death or serious adverse effects including sepsis, uncontrollable biliary or intestinal bleeding, and acute renal failure. The time between stent insertion and death was defined as patient survival. Results:

71.

4% achieved successful drainage, significant improvements were observed from before to one month after the procedure in liver function values, including total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin. Minor complications occurred in 5 patients in all patients, including 1 patient who experienced cholangitis, and 4 patients who suffered abdominal pain. No major procedure-related complication was observed. The median overall survival of 21 patients was 6. 1 months. Patients who received successful biliary drainage had longer mOS than those who received unsuccessful biliary drainage. Patients who received sequential Lenvatinib+ Pembrolizumab after effective drainage had longer mOS than those who only received palliative therapy.

### Multivariate prognostic factors analysis for second-line chemotherapy in advanced biliary tract cancer [^6dbe2c16]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The positive prognostic role of previous surgery on primary tumour is probably linked to a more favourable disease course in patients presenting with resectable tumour; in fact, biology may differ in localised and unresectable or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Moreover, immediate surgery may avoid otherwise frequent complications in aBTC such as biliary or bowel obstruction, thus favourably impacting on patient conditions and treatment tolerability.

reported in a smaller series that PFS after first-line CT is a predictor of benefit from second-line therapy in terms of PFS; however, they did not analyse OS or integrate this parameter into a prognostic score. Similarly, found that response to first-line CT is an independent predictor of OS with salvage therapy in their series of 89 cases. Even though the formal demonstration that PFS is a surrogate for OS in aBTC is lacking, it is arguable that PFS may represent an index of the chemosensitivity of the disease. Therefore, no or limited benefit from first-line CT should discourage from an aggressive approach in second-line. The threshold of 6 months for the PFS variable appears a reasonable choice, as reported median PFS times with first-line platinum plus gemcitabine regimens are in the range 5.7–8.0 months.

Our retrospective study did not aim to identify an optimal second-line CT regimen. Univariate analysis suggests that combination CT is associated with a slightly higher DCR compared with monotherapy (39% vs 26% P = 0.002) as well as slightly longer median PFS (3.4 vs 3.0 months; P = 0.030), as reported also by, and OS (8.2 vs 5.2 months; P = 0.028). We thus selected the second-line CT regimen as a stratification factor at multivariate analysis, in order to develop a prognostic model based only on baseline treatment-independent, patient- and disease-related factors. Therefore, caution is needed and randomised trials are ongoing in order to establish the optimal second-line regimen in aBTC. In our opinion, until the results of these trials are made available, the use of combination CT is justified in those patients with good PS and preserved liver function who derived significant benefit from first-line CT (e.g. objective response and PFS longer than 6 months) without major toxicities. This simple prognostic model may thus help in designing and interpreting the results of future trials.

### Preliminary experience with liver transplantation in selected patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma [^7a61a7a8]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Previous experience with OLT for hilar CCA has been discouraging, and survival was dismal. This study demonstrates that carefully selected patients with unresectable hilar CCA can achieve long-term survival after OLT. The survival rate obtained with this protocol (5-year actuarial survival of 87%) is comparable with the overall survival rate of liver-transplant recipients at the authors' institution. In comparison, the best survival rate after OLT for hilar CCA reported in the literature is 64.8% at 5 years in a subset of nine patients with negative lymph nodes. In the absence of a control group, it is difficult to assess with certainty the role of a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but in some patients it seems to prevent or slow progression of the disease while waiting for an available organ. Treatment-related morbidity, although significant, is not prohibitive. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of treated patients ultimately was found to have advanced disease precluding transplantation. This finding confirms the importance of the staging laparotomy as an essential component of the protocol.

### Biliary tract cancers, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^34a676dd]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Biliary tract cancers — neoadjuvant therapy for gallbladder cancer only lists no preferred regimens and none as useful in certain circumstances, with other recommended regimens directing to Principles of Systemic Therapy, Primary Treatment for Unresectable and Metastatic Disease (BIL-C 2 of 5). The decision to use neoadjuvant therapy needs to be individualized and in close consultation with surgical oncologist and multidisciplinary team, and a period of 2 to 6 months with reassessment every 2 to 3 months is reasonable, noting limited clinical trial data and that clinical trial participation is encouraged.
