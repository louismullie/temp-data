## Question

A 7-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department with a 2-day history of vomiting, poor feeding, and increasing lethargy. On examination, the infant is jaundiced, has hepatomegaly, and mild coagulopathy (INR 2.0). There is no clinical evidence of encephalopathy. Laboratory tests reveal markedly elevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia. The parents report no history of acetaminophen ingestion or viral illness. The pediatric team is considering the diagnosis of acute liver failure and discussing next steps for management and referral.

Based on current pediatric guidelines, how should acute liver failure be defined in this infant, and what key considerations should guide your diagnostic and management approach compared to adults?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to define pediatric acute liver failure in a 7-month-old infant with jaundice, hepatomegaly, markedly elevated transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, and INR 2.0 without encephalopathy, and what key diagnostic and management steps should be taken now, including how this differs from adult ALF. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this infant meets pediatric ALF criteria. Then, I should verify the key differences from adult definitions, especially the role of encephalopathy. Next, I will outline immediate priorities in stabilization, etiologic workup, and transplant center referral. Finally, I will consider prognostic nuances and special infant-specific issues that could change management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criteria. Pediatric acute liver failure is defined by biochemical evidence of acute liver injury in a child without preexisting chronic liver disease, with coagulopathy not corrected by vitamin K, and either INR ≥ 1.5 with encephalopathy or INR ≥ 2.0 with or without encephalopathy; encephalopathy is not required for diagnosis in children, which is a critical distinction from adult definitions [^1a151f83] [^973184dd] [^3938e288]. This infant has INR 2.0, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and marked transaminase elevations, and there is no reported chronic liver disease, so he meets PALF criteria even without encephalopathy [^1a151f83] [^973184dd].

> Wait, let me verify the adult contrast so I don't overgeneralize. Adult ALF definitions generally require hepatic encephalopathy plus coagulopathy (INR > 1.5) in the absence of preexisting liver disease, whereas pediatric criteria deliberately allow diagnosis at INR ≥ 2.0 without encephalopathy because infants and young children can have severe liver failure with subtle or absent encephalopathy, and relying on HE would delay recognition and transplant referral [^215d3006] [^1a151f83] [^2c528cbe]. Hold on, I should also note that some pediatric consensus work has explored requiring encephalopathy for INR 1.5–2.0, but the prevailing pediatric definitions endorsed by major societies accept INR ≥ 2.0 without encephalopathy as sufficient for PALF, which applies here [^edfbf590] [^1a151f83].

> Next, I should review immediate priorities. I need to ensure the infant is stabilized and that we do not miss time-sensitive, treatable causes. That means urgent PICU-level monitoring, frequent neurologic assessments for evolving encephalopathy, correction of hypoglycemia, and early contact with a pediatric liver transplant center, ideally within 24–48 hours, because PALF can deteriorate rapidly and early transfer improves outcomes [^a3fc88cb] [^d043106a] [^de01e63e]. I should double-check that we are not delaying transfer while waiting for a full etiologic workup; transfer should proceed in parallel with diagnostics to avoid missing the window for timely listing [^a3fc88cb].

> I will now examine the etiologic workup with an age-based approach. In infants, metabolic and genetic diseases are prominent, collectively accounting for roughly 28–36% of PALF, so I need to prioritize newborn screening review, ammonia, lactate, acylcarnitines, plasma amino acids, and consider early exome or genome sequencing if no diagnosis emerges, because monogenic disease is a leading cause in this age group and early genetic testing can be decisive [^526bf5d0] [^18adb694]. But wait, what if this is infectious or drug-induced? I should still obtain viral studies and a careful exposure history, and I should remember that NAC is indicated for acetaminophen toxicity even if the history is negative, because unreliable histories are common in toddlers and NAC is safe and may help even in non-APAP etiologies, though pediatric data are mixed outside APAP [^f1a030db] [^1cb51285].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about coagulopathy management. I initially thought to give FFP to "correct" INR, but I should correct that impulse. Routine FFP to normalize INR is discouraged unless there is active bleeding or an impending invasive procedure, because INR reflects synthetic failure and FFP can worsen volume overload without proven benefit; instead, give vitamin K and reserve plasma for bleeding or procedures, and consider cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen is low, while monitoring clinically for bleeding and thrombosis risks [^bf33b28f] [^be2879d0] [^4bb7d0ca]. I need to ensure we avoid overtransfusion and use TEG judiciously where available to guide hemostasis decisions [^be2879d0].

> Let me consider neurologic monitoring and encephalopathy risk. Even without overt encephalopathy, I should obtain ammonia and reassess mental status frequently, because ammonia > 100 µmol/L is an independent risk factor for high-grade HE and > 200 µmol/L is strongly associated with cerebral herniation; in infants, HE can be subtle and confounded by illness, so serial exams and ammonia trends matter for prognostication and neuroprotective strategies [^c2ca6aeb] [^4a814210]. If HE advances to grade 3–4, I should confirm that ICP monitoring and neuroprotective targets are considered in a tertiary center, recognizing that pediatric-specific CPP targets differ by age and evidence is limited [^aefa7e55].

> I should confirm transplant listing considerations. Given INR 2.0 and the infant's age, I need to discuss early listing with the transplant team, because infants have higher waitlist mortality and longer waits, and technical variant grafts or living donor options are often required; early transfer and listing are associated with better outcomes, and indeterminate PALF carries a high risk of progression to death or transplant, reinforcing the need for timely action [^acba76fc] [^68312abc] [^a3fc88cb]. Let me reconsider prognostic tools: adult criteria like King's College are poorly validated in pediatrics, and PELD is not designed for acute disease, so clinical judgment, trajectory, and center-specific experience guide decisions, and I should communicate this uncertainty transparently with the family [^0af70744] [^41166c74].

> Finally, I need to ensure supportive care details are addressed. Maintain euglycemia with hypertonic dextrose as needed, restrict fluids judiciously to avoid overload, monitor and correct electrolytes including magnesium and phosphate, and watch for renal injury requiring CRRT; these measures reduce complications while we await spontaneous recovery or transplant, and they are standard in pediatric ALF pathways [^295e2782] [^85ed14a0] [^a3fc88cb]. I should double-check that we are not missing a treatable metabolic crisis or infection that could alter management, and I will align the diagnostic plan with the age-based algorithm to avoid unnecessary delays [^a3fc88cb].

This 7-month-old meets **pediatric acute liver failure** criteria: acute liver injury with INR ≥ 2.0 and no encephalopathy, without chronic liver disease [^1a151f83] [^973184dd]. Unlike adults, **encephalopathy is not required** for diagnosis in children, and the etiology often differs, with metabolic and genetic causes more common in infants [^2c528cbe] [^526bf5d0]. Immediate priorities are to stabilize in a PICU, begin an age-specific etiologic workup (metabolic, genetic, infectious, autoimmune, toxins), and **urgently refer to a pediatric transplant center** because progression can be rapid and unpredictable [^a3fc88cb] [^644c3acd]. Early involvement of a pediatric hepatology team is essential to guide diagnostics and transplant decisions [^654417c2].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Pediatric acute liver failure is defined by the following criteria:

- **Acute onset**: Rapid development of liver dysfunction without preexisting chronic liver disease [^1a151f83].
- **Biochemical evidence**: Markedly elevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia [^1d73771d].
- **Coagulopathy**: INR ≥ 2.0 with or without hepatic encephalopathy, or INR ≥ 1.5 with encephalopathy, not corrected by vitamin K [^973184dd] [^3938e288].
- **Encephalopathy**: Not required for diagnosis in children, unlike adults [^2c528cbe] [^1cb51285].

In this infant, the **absence of encephalopathy does not exclude PALF**, and the INR of 2.0 meets pediatric criteria [^1a151f83].

---

## Key differences from adult acute liver failure

| **Feature** | **Pediatric alf** | **Adult alf** |
|-|-|-|
| Encephalopathy | Not required for diagnosis | Required for diagnosis |
| Etiology | - Metabolic <br/> - Genetic <br/> - Infectious <br/> - Autoimmune <br/> - Drug-induced | - Acetaminophen toxicity <br/> - Viral hepatitis <br/> - Alcohol-related <br/> - Drug-induced |
| Clinical course | Rapid and unpredictable progression | More predictable progression |
| Transplant considerations | - Early referral <br/> - Living donor transplantation common | - MELD-based listing <br/> - Deceased donor transplantation common |

---

## Immediate diagnostic approach

A structured, age-specific diagnostic workup is essential to identify the underlying cause and guide management:

- **Metabolic and genetic testing**: Ammonia, lactate, acylcarnitine profile, plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, and consider early genetic testing (exome or genome sequencing) [^526bf5d0] [^18adb694].
- **Infectious evaluation**: Hepatitis A, B, C, E, EBV, CMV, HSV, adenovirus, and enteroviruses [^notfound].
- **Autoimmune screening**: ANA, ASMA, IgG levels.
- **Drug and toxin exposure**: Detailed history and toxicology screen [^f1a030db].
- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler to assess liver size, echotexture, and vascular patency [^2080ef2e].

---

## Management priorities

### Stabilization and supportive care

- **PICU admission**: Continuous monitoring of vital signs, neurologic status, and laboratory parameters [^d043106a].
- **Fluid and electrolyte management**: Restrict fluids to 90% of maintenance, use hypertonic glucose (D10) with electrolyte supplementation, and monitor for hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia [^295e2782].
- **Coagulopathy management**: Vitamin K administration; avoid routine FFP unless active bleeding or invasive procedures are planned [^bf33b28f] [^4bb7d0ca].
- **Neurologic monitoring**: Frequent assessment for encephalopathy, ammonia levels, and consider ICP monitoring if severe encephalopathy develops [^4a814210] [^aefa7e55].

---

### Etiology-specific interventions

- **Acetaminophen toxicity**: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is indicated even if history is negative, as unreliable histories are common in infants [^notfound].
- **Herpes simplex virus**: Acyclovir should be started empirically if HSV is suspected [^notfound].
- **Autoimmune hepatitis**: Immunosuppressive therapy may be indicated if diagnosed [^a7cd37d7].
- **Metabolic diseases**: Specific therapies may be available depending on the underlying disorder [^notfound].

---

### Liver transplantation considerations

Early referral to a pediatric transplant center is critical because PALF can progress rapidly to multiorgan failure and death. Living donor transplantation is often considered due to organ availability and favorable outcomes in children [^68312abc] [^9319b959]. Prognostic tools such as the Liver Injury Unit (LIU) score may assist in decision-making, but no single score reliably predicts outcomes in PALF [^0af70744].

---

## Prognostic factors

Poor prognostic indicators in pediatric ALF include:

- **Young age**: Infants under 1 year have higher mortality and transplant rates [^68312abc].
- **High-grade encephalopathy**: Associated with increased mortality and need for transplantation [^notfound].
- **High ammonia levels**: Strongly associated with cerebral edema and poor outcomes [^c2ca6aeb].
- **Indeterminate etiology**: Linked to worse outcomes and higher transplant rates [^1cb51285].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

This 7-month-old meets pediatric acute liver failure criteria, and the absence of encephalopathy does not exclude the diagnosis. Immediate priorities are to stabilize in a PICU, initiate an age-specific etiologic workup, and **urgently refer to a pediatric transplant center**. Early involvement of pediatric hepatology and transplant teams is essential to optimize outcomes and navigate the rapid, unpredictable course of PALF [^a3fc88cb] [^644c3acd].

### Diagnostic approach to acute liver failure in children: a position paper by the SIGENP liver disease working group [^998f61b4]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a clinical condition characterized by the abrupt onset of coagulopathy and biochemical evidence of hepatocellular injury, leading to rapid deterioration of liver cell function. In children, ALF has been characterized by raised transaminases, coagulopathy, and no known evidence of pre-existing chronic liver disease; unlike in adults, the presence of hepatic encephalopathy is not required to establish the diagnosis. Although rare, ALF has a high mortality rate without liver transplantation (LT). Etiology of ALF varies with age and geographical location, although it may remain indeterminate in a significant proportion of cases. However, identifying its etiology is crucial to undertake disease-specific management and evaluate indication to LT. In this position statement, the Liver Disease Working Group of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SIGENP) reviewed the most relevant studies on pediatric ALF to provide recommendations on etiology, clinical features and diagnostic work-up of neonates, infants and children presenting with ALF. Recommendations on medical management and transplant candidacy will be discussed in a following consensus conference.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare, acute, potentially reversible condition resulting in severe liver impairment and rapid clinical deterioration in patients without preexisting liver disease. Due to the rarity of this condition, published studies are limited by the use of retrospective or prospective cohorts and lack of randomized controlled trials. Current guidelines represent the suggested approach to the identification, treatment, and management of ALF and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence was reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation process to develop recommendations. When no robust evidence was available, expert opinions were summarized using Key Concepts. Considering the variety of clinical presentations of ALF, individualization of care should be applied in specific clinical scenarios.

INTRODUCTION

Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a rapid onset, severe disease that affects individuals of all ages, usually without any signs of preceding illness. It progresses quickly and can either self‐resolve, necessitate liver transplantation (LT), or cause death. Although there are many different etiologies of PALF, the most common cause is indeterminate, accounting for up to 50% of cases. Other etiologies include drug toxicity (especially acetaminophen), infection, genetic disorders, autoimmune hepatitis, oncologic processes or complications, perfusion‐related etiologies, and metabolic diseases.

The current definition of PALF denotes biochemical signs of liver injury in a child without preexisting chronic liver disease, coagulopathy not correctable by vitamin K supplementation, and international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.5 in a child with encephalopathy or greater than 2.0 without encephalopathy. Encephalopathy, one of the hallmark signs in progressive PALF, can be especially difficult to assess in children and presents a unique clinical quandary for pediatricians. Furthermore, the prognosis of PALF is very difficult to ascertain. At times, patients are treated without much understanding of the potential final outcome with regard to transplantation, death, or spontaneous recovery given the limited information available to providers to help clarify a patient's trajectory. In the United States, 10%–15% of all the pediatric LTs are indicated for acute liver failure. This review will summarize the contemporary diagnosis and management of PALF (Part I) and areas of ongoing research (Part II).

Pediatric acute liver failure

Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a complex, rapidly progressive clinical syndrome that is the final common pathway for many disparate conditions including metabolic, genetic, infectious, and immunological disease processes that vary in frequency by age group. Historically, children were assigned an ALF diagnosis based on the adult definition that included HE. Recognizing the challenge of accurate HE assessment in infants and children, the PALF Study Group (PALFSG, U01 DK072146) used consensus entry criteria for their longitudinal study enabling enrollment without HE. These criteria were not intended to establish a definitive diagnosis but rather to identify children with ALI sufficiently severe to place them at risk for a progressive clinical deterioration that could result in LT or death. Over time, the general adaptation of these study criteria has improved our ability to compare descriptive, diagnostic, therapeutic, and mechanistic studies performed by investigators worldwide. These efforts have enabled generally agreed on approaches to the diagnosis and management of these critically ill children. –

Despite improvements in diagnosis, the cause of PALF for roughly one-third of children remains indeterminate (iPALF). In these children, outcomes are generally poorer, with over 50% of iPALF progressing to death or LT.iPALF occurs more frequently in children between 1 and 10 years of age (~60%), and recent studies have supported a hypothesis that a hyperinflammatory host immune response propagates the liver injury. Future efforts involving immunomodulatory agents to explore this population have the potential to shift the treatment paradigm in PALF and advance the basic understanding of immune dysregulation disorders in childhood.

Beyond iPALF, improved strategies for optimized care, specifically in the ICU setting, are needed. Etiology and age-based differences mean lessons learned from adult experiences may not be transferrable to children. An important example includes our finding that NAC, broadly beneficial in many forms of adult ALF, did not demonstrate efficacy in non-APAP PALF. Recently, there have been reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United Kingdom, and World Health Organization demonstrating an increase in cases of idiopathic hepatitis in young children with some of them requiring emergency LT. These cases do not appear to be due to adenovirus or COVID-19 infection as initially believed, and pathogenesis studies are ongoing.

### Acute liver dysfunction criteria in critically ill children: the PODIUM consensus conference [^edfbf590]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Develop evidence-based criteria for individual organ dysfunction.

Objectives

Evaluate current evidence and develop contemporary consensus criteria for acute liver dysfunction with associated outcomes in critically ill children.

Data Sources

Electronic searches of PubMed and Embase conducted from January 1992 to January 2020, used medical subject heading terms and text words to characterize acute liver dysfunction and outcomes.

Study Selection

Studies evaluating critically ill children with acute liver dysfunction, assessed screening tools, and outcomes were included. Studies evaluating adults, infants ≤ 36 weeks gestational age, or animals or were reviews/commentaries, case series with sample size ≤ 10, or non-English language studies were excluded.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted from each eligible study into a data extraction form along with risk of bias assessment by a task force member.

Results

The systematic review supports criteria for acute liver dysfunction, in the absence of known chronic liver disease, as having onset of symptoms < 8 weeks, combined with biochemical evidence of acute liver injury, and liver-based coagulopathy, with hepatic encephalopathy required for an international normalized ratio between 1.5 and 2.0.

Limitations

Unable to assess acute-on-chronic liver dysfunction, subjective nature of hepatic encephalopathy, relevant articles missed by reviewers.

Conclusions

Proposed criteria identify an infant, child, or adolescent who has reached a clinical threshold where any of the 3 outcomes (alive with native liver, death, or liver transplant) are possible and should prompt an urgent liaison with a recognized pediatric liver transplant center if liver failure is the principal driver of multiple organ dysfunction.

CONCLUSIONS

PALF continues to be a rare but potentially lethal disease process in otherwise healthy children. Its clinical trajectory remains unpredictable and requires further characterization to establish reliable management algorithms. The reasoning process for when to commit to LT also remains undefined. Given the necessity for rapid decisions to list patients for transplant, teams must weigh the risks associated with transplant surgery and lifelong immunosuppression with the risk of decompensating acute liver failure. Data show improved overall graft and patient survival following LT for PALF, regardless of the type of graft, and the use of technical variant grafts has significantly reduced waitlist mortality. LDLT also reduces patient wait times and may provide higher quality organs than DDLT. Research into newer techniques to characterize the immunologic features of PALF may help clarify the diagnostic process, establish predictive models, and aid in the clinical management of these patients.

Pediatric acute liver failure — general recommendations state that PALF is a complex, rapidly evolving clinical syndrome, and children meeting diagnostic criteria should be considered for early contact/transfer to an experienced pediatric liver transplant center when indicated (Figure 2). Children meeting diagnostic criteria for PALF warrant careful laboratory and clinical monitoring in a pediatric intensive care unit (Table 4). A timely, age-based diagnostic approach (Table 4) should be used to establish an etiology and inform treatment decisions. Once PALF has been established, general management strategies should be undertaken to monitor for (Table 4) and manage (Table 5) common complications regardless of the etiology.

Intensive care unit management of

LT represents the definitive cure for PALF. Between 2010 and 2013 in the United States, 11.2%–12.5% of all pediatric LTs were performed for PALF. If applicable, treatment may be directed toward the underlying etiology of PALF, such as the administration of N ‐acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity. However, the majority of etiologies lack a targeted therapeutic option. Stabilizing the patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) and managing multisystem organ failure remains the mainstay of therapy both while awaiting LT and to avoid LT as outlined in Table 1. Determining which patients might benefit from LT versus exhibit potential for recovery has been difficult to ascertain. Therefore, patients are monitored and treated supportively, with their clinical and mental statuses continuously reassessed to determine the likelihood of self‐resolution versus progressive decompensation (Figure 1).

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^bbd58e31]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric acute liver failure — initial management, testing priorities, and diagnostic workup — states that a patient meeting PALF study entry criterion should initiate general management strategies regardless of etiology, and once the most appropriate setting is established, a 4‑pronged coordinated management and diagnostic approach should be conducted to inform clinical decisions including liver‑specific tests, general tests for co‑morbidities, laboratory and physical examination based assessment for evolving complication of PALF, and age‑based diagnostic investigations to establish an etiology. Almost 50% of PALF occurs in children under 4 years of age, which limits blood draw volumes and demands knowledgeable prioritization of tests; required blood work for a liver transplant also competes for this resource, and additional challenges may include a rapid clinical trajectory ending in death or LT.

Predictive models of clinical outcomes

Today, there remains a lack of accurate prediction models regarding patient outcomes of PALF. This means that patients who may have otherwise recovered without invasive intervention will instead undergo organ transplantation. Determining which patients may recover versus those who would die without LT continues to be the focus of ongoing research to protect patients from unnecessary transplantation and the sequalae of lifelong immunosuppression. It is difficult to use subjective manifestations of disease, such as presence or progression of hepatic encephalopathy as a reliable marker of overall prognosis. Accurate and predictive biomarkers could dramatically change the diagnosis and management of PALF. As the CD8‐dense inflammatory subset of indeterminate PALF has been identified, it likely that the immune landscape of PALF may represent a more definitive approach to establish a clinical trajectory as well as identify possible therapeutic targets.

Natural history of pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) underscores urgency: the clinical course is rapid, dynamic, and unpredictable; the interval from presentation to an outcome such as liver transplantation (LT), death, or spontaneous recovery can be as short as a few hours or days, and thus there is an urgency in establishing a specific diagnosis as a timely therapeutic intervention can affect clinical outcomes.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^a4773913]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) — diagnosis and management overview emphasizes that PALF is a rare, rapidly progressive clinical syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality, with variable clinical presentation in which rapid decline occurs often. Management is reliant upon intensive clinical care and support by multidisciplinary teams, and an age-based diagnostic approach to identify the potential underlying cause is of utmost importance to initiate appropriate lifesaving therapy, with prompt implementation of therapy noted as potentially lifesaving. The dynamic nature of PALF demands that diagnostic inquiries be paired with monitoring strategies for recognition and treatment of common complications. Etiology-specific treatment and general management focusing on preventing complications may help to mitigate disease progression and avoid liver transplant. Although liver transplantation can provide a potential life-saving therapeutic option, decision certainty is limited by a lack of adequately tested clinical decision support tools and accurate predictive models. The manuscript provides clinical guidance by presenting recent advances in diagnosis, management, pathophysiology, and associated outcomes for pediatric providers caring for children with PALF.

Concerns and Recommendations for Liver Failure Guidelines

Several issues undermine the reliability of the recommendations:

Divergence in recommendations

Conflicting advice exists among various guidelines, particularly due to differences in ethnic and geographical factors that influence the distribution of liver disease etiologies in different regions. This results in discrepancies in recommendations for etiological screening, selection criteria for transplantation, and management of ICP in ALF patients. Additionally, debates surrounding the definition of chronic liver disease and the application of plasma exchange in ACLF patients persist, potentially complicating clinical decision-making.

Inconsistent evidence application

The utilization of evidence to back recommendations is often confusing, with a mix of adult and pediatric study results. For example, one guideline for adults endorses the use of N -acetylcysteine (NAC) for treating nonacetaminophen-related ALF, relying on pediatric studies for evidence. Meanwhile, we have also observed that certain guidelines lack references to support their recommended advice, especially contentious recommendations.

Acute liver failure (ALF) — definition and guideline scope — ALF is a rare, acute, potentially reversible condition resulting in severe liver impairment and rapid clinical deterioration in patients without preexisting liver disease and is a life-threatening condition that occurs in patients with no preexisting liver disease as characterized by jaundice, coagulopathy (international normalized ratio [INR] > 1.5), and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). It is imperative for clinicians to recognize ALF early in patient presentation because initiation of treatment and transplant considerations could be lifesaving. These guidelines represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology; the scientific evidence was reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation process to develop recommendations, and when no robust evidence was available, expert opinions were summarized using Key Concepts. The GRADE process was used to assess the quality of evidence, which is expressed as high, moderate, low, or very low, and a strength of recommendation is given as either strong (recommendations) or conditional (suggestions) based on the evidence and other factors. Considering the variety of clinical presentations of ALF, individualization of care should be applied in specific clinical scenarios, and evidence review methods included an electronic search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library through January 2022 limited to English language and fully published articles.

Abstract

Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a rare, rapidly progressive clinical syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality. The phenotype of PALF manifests as abrupt onset liver dysfunction, which can be brought via disparate etiology. Management is reliant upon intensive clinical care and support, often provided by the collaborative efforts of hepatologists, critical care specialists, and liver transplant surgeons. The construction of an age-based diagnostic approach, the identification of a potential underlying cause, and the prompt implementation of appropriate therapy can be lifesaving; however, the dynamic and rapidly progressive nature of PALF also demands that diagnostic inquiries be paired with monitoring strategies for the recognition and treatment of common complications of PALF. Although liver transplantation can provide a potential life-saving therapeutic option, the ability to confidently determine the certainness that liver transplant is needed for an individual child has been hampered by a lack of adequately tested clinical decision support tools and accurate predictive models. Given the accelerated progress in understanding PALF, we will provide clinical guidance to pediatric gastroenterologists and other pediatric providers caring for children with PALF by presenting the most recent advances in diagnosis, management, pathophysiology, and associated outcomes.

Clinical and histological assessment in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF): A laboratory and clinical assessment plan should be commenced immediately and occur at least twice per day initially, then adjusted based upon medical progress; the presence and degree of hepatic encephalopathy are critical in determining appropriate management; it should be a priority to identify conditions contraindicated in LT, amenable to specific therapy, or that inform subsequent pregnancies; although liver biopsy involves bleeding risk and may not always inform decisions, recent reports demonstrate it can be performed safely — especially when the transvenous (e.g., transjugular) approach is feasible — and results are used to guide diagnosis and therapy, which is particularly important in indeterminate PALF where histology has identified patterns suggesting immune-mediated liver injury.

### Acute liver failure in children [^24ce43a4]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) in children, irrespective of cause, is a rapidly evolving catastrophic clinical condition that results in high mortality and morbidity without prompt identification and intervention. Massive hepatocyte necrosis impairs the synthetic, excretory, and detoxification abilities of the liver, with resultant coagulopathy, jaundice, metabolic disturbance, and encephalopathy. Extrahepatic organ damage, multiorgan failure, and death result from circulating inflammatory mediators released by the hepatocytes undergoing necrosis. There are yet no treatment options available for reversing or halting hepatocellular necrosis, thus current therapy focuses on supporting failing organs and preventing life threatening complications pending either spontaneous liver recovery or transplantation. The aims of this review are to define pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), understand the pathophysiologic processes that lead to multiorgan failure, to describe the consequences of a failing liver on extrahepatic organs, to enumerate the critical care challenges encountered during PALF management, and to describe pharmacologic and extracorporeal options available to support a critically ill child with ALF in the intensive care unit.

### Neonatal acute liver failure [^6f6600ba]. Liver Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Neonatal acute liver failure (NALF) is a rare disease about which there is little published data; however, NALF is an extremely important condition as it is distinct from acute liver failure seen in older children and adults. First, unlike acute liver failure in older patients, NALF can be diagnosed in an infant with cirrhosis. This is due to the fetal-neonatal continuum of liver disease, or the principle that neonatal liver failure may be the result of a liver disease that began in utero. Further differences exist in the mechanism of disease, diagnostic principles, and the common etiologies of NALF when compared with pediatric and adult acute liver failure. This review will address many of the distinguishing features of NALF and focus on the most common etiologies of NALF, including gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD), the most common cause of NALF. Additionally, this review will provide insight into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of this rare condition. Liver Transplantation 22 677–685 2016 AASLD.

TABLE 1
Summary of clinical findings with PALF diagnosis and management approaches

Coagulopathy, part of the diagnostic criteria for PALF, is exhibited by elevated INR in the setting of a balanced loss of both pro and anti‐coagulant components, which minimizes the incidence of clinical bleeding. As such, elevated INR is more representative of a loss of hepatic synthetic function rather than a likelihood of bleeding, and bleeding risk has not been shown to correlate with the INR trajectory. Although patients are indeed at increased risk of bleeding when compared with the general population, the risk of thrombosis may actually outweigh the risk of clinically significant bleeding. Patients can be treated with subcutaneous vitamin K supplementation and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) if needed, although overtransfusion can increase the risk of thrombosis and bleeding, and no standardized transfusion protocols have been established. Overall, significant bleeding has been noted in 5% of patients, of which < 1% are intracranial bleeds. Of note, the degree of coagulopathy has not been shown to correlate with hepatic encephalopathy. The PALFSG has demonstrated that 25% of patients who had Grade 3 or 4 hepatic encephalopathy and required intensive care had mild coagulopathy with INR < 2.0, yet patients with this degree of encephalopathy (Grade 3–4) also demonstrated the highest rates of mortality. All patients with acute liver failure require close monitoring and daily assessment of overall mental status for this reason.

Identifying the underlying etiology of PALF is of the utmost importance, as determining contributing factors or underlying disease processes will impact the medical team's decision to list for LT. For instance, PALF attributed to acetaminophen ingestion can be treated using protocols including N ‐acetylcysteine and thus has been shown to be less likely to require LT as these patients recover more often than not. Conversely, herpes simplex virus, Wilson disease, and gestational alloimmune liver disease have been associated with more severe illness and multiorgan system involvement, which may sway the medical teams to list these patients earlier or even exclude them from listing altogether given the critical nature of illness. Similarly, some patients may not be eligible for transplant because of their underlying cause of PALF, such as patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or chemotherapy‐induced PALF with active malignancy.

PART I: CLINICAL FEATURES OF PALF

Epidemiology and disease presentation

Prior to the introduction of LT for PALF, estimates of mortality were as high as 72%. Dr. Starzl pioneered the field of pediatric LT in the late 1960s for biliary atresia and liver carcinoma following his first human LT in 1963 in a child. The Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Group (PALFSG), an international consortium supported by the National Institutes of Health, was formed in 1999 as a repository for patient data and outcomes, which has generated a wealth of information since its inception. These milestones in LT and in the care of pediatric liver disease have been instrumental in the progress and improvement of patient outcomes.

Presentation and diagnosis

Patients meeting criteria for PALF should be evaluated with an extensive, careful history and a physical exam with an emphasis on family history, past medical history, possible ingestions or exposures, and recent travel. Physical exam findings may include ascites, jaundice, generalized edema, signs of cardiac failure, or mental status changes. Some patients may have vague symptoms without evidence of end‐stage liver disease or clinical instability. Hepatic encephalopathy can be difficult to assess in children, depending on their age and developmental abilities at baseline. Mild features may manifest as fatigue, irritability, and confusion, and severe encephalopathy can rapidly progress to stupor, cerebral edema, seizures, and coma. Diagnostic workup should include a comprehensive metabolic panel, fractionated bilirubin, gamma‐glutamyltransferase, complete blood count, serum ammonia, INR, abdominal ultrasound with Doppler to assess hepatic vasculature, and investigate for possible underlying etiologies including infection, metabolic disorders, autoimmune hepatitis, and drug testing (summarized in Table 1). Further diagnostic clarity may be attained via liver biopsy, although it is important to note that biopsies are subject to sampling error and may not reliably represent the histopathology of the entire organ. A transjugular approach to liver biopsy is often better tolerated than a percutaneous attempt in this population given the bleeding propensity in the setting of liver synthetic dysfunction.

Objectives

The Hepatology Committee of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) aims to educate pediatric gastroenterologists, members of ESPGHAN and professionals from other specialties promoting an exchange of clinical expertise in the field of pediatric hepatology. Herewith we have concentrated on detailing the recent advances in acute liver failure in infants and children.

Methods

The 2020 ESPGHAN monothematic three-day conference on pediatric hepatology disease, entitled "acute liver failure" (ALF), was organized in Athens, Greece. ALF is a devastating disease with high mortality and most cases remain undiagnosed. As knowledge in diagnosis and treatment of ALF in infants and children has increased in the past decades, the objective was to update physicians in the field with the latest research and developments in early recognition, curative therapies and intensive care management, imaging techniques and treatment paradigms in these age groups.

Results

In the first session, the definition, epidemiology, various causes of ALF, in neonates and older children and recurrent ALF (RALF) were discussed. The second session was dedicated to new aspects of ALF management including hepatic encephalopathy (HE), coagulopathy, intensive care interventions, acute on chronic liver failure, and the role of imaging in treatment and prognosis. Oral presentations by experts in various fields are summarized highlighting key learning points.

Conclusions

The current report summarizes the major learning points from this meeting. It also identifies areas where there is gap of knowledge, thereby identifying the research agenda for the near future.

Given the nuances of determining etiology, the need for early aggressive management, and the potential need for emergent LT, patients should be cared for in pediatric LT centers as early in the disease course as possible given the rapidly progressive and unpredictable nature of disease. Patients who are transferred earlier to pediatric transplant centers, before developing hepatic encephalopathy, have better outcomes than those who are transferred later.

Physiology of multiorgan failure in

The natural course of PALF results in either recovery or death. For patients with decompensating and progressive disease, intensive care is imperative. Patients may develop cardiac dysfunction, including peripheral vasodilation with decreased systemic vascular resistance and low mean arterial blood pressure in the setting of hyperdynamic cardiac failure. Respiratory compromise can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of fluid overload, and patients may require endotracheal intubation, especially to protect the airway in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy. Acute kidney injury or even renal failure is also a commonly observed complication among the PALF population and is associated with increased mortality. Kidney injury can be attributed to intrarenal vasoconstriction and decreased renal perfusion as well as drug toxicity, hypovolemia, and sepsis. Renal function typically recovers as hepatic function improves. Patients with PALF require careful monitoring of electrolytes as they are at risk of hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Persistent hypoglycemia can represent an ominous sign of complete hepatic necrosis, with an inability to maintain euglycemia in the absence of gluconeogenesis. For the most part, maintenance of normal electrolyte ranges is optimal. In the event of increased intracranial pressure, hypernatremia may be indicated, but outside of cerebral complications, normal serum Na levels ought to be maintained.

Although hyperammonemia is involved in the development of hepatic encephalopathy because of its neurotoxic nature, the degree of elevation does not always correlate with the extent of encephalopathy that a patient may exhibit. Careful and frequent neurological assessments are important as the high ammonia level can cause increased intracellular osmolarity in astrocytes, leading to enhanced water diffusion into the cells and ultimately cerebral edema. According to the PALFSG, 55% of children present with hepatic encephalopathy, usually Grade 1 or 2. Patients with Grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy usually require brain imaging to evaluate for any signs of intracranial hemorrhage. It is important to ensure the ammonia level is collected from a free‐flowing blood sample that is quickly placed on ice to reduce the chance of falsely elevated results.

While managing patients' disease sequelae, the ever‐present decision of listing for LT must be reassessed. Many centers favor listing patients while workup and intensive management is ongoing within the first 24–48 h. If possible, obtaining a tissue sample can provide diagnostic clarity and may even invite medical therapy to potentially save the patient from LT, such as activated CD8+ T cell hepatitis, which may respond to corticosteroids. Some patients, such as those with underlying mitochondrial conditions, may not be eligible for LT. Furthermore, patients with life‐threatening cerebral complications also may not be candidates for LT. Even so, the possibility remains to remove a child from the waiting list once signs of recovery are demonstrated.

Poor prognostic indicators for PALF include age younger than 1 year at the time of presentation, presence of Grade 4 encephalopathy, and need for pretransplant dialysis. Although predictive models have been proposed, no scoring system has been successfully applied to reliable clinical outcome modeling. The Liver Injury Unit (LIU) score, which uses peak serum total bilirubin, prothrombin time/INR and ammonia, is able to predict death or LT by 4 weeks of patient presentation with an area under the curve of 88.5%–90.5%. In a multicenter validation study, the LIU was able to predict LT status better than death with a concordance index (c‐index) of 0.84 and a c‐index of 0.81 for the prediction of survival without LT. However, its use in the clinical setting is limited by a reliance on peak laboratory values, which is of minimal use in the day‐to‐day practical setting and does not account for patient's age. The King's College model incorporates the presence of hepatic encephalopathy, which is an unreliable feature in pediatrics, impeding its applicability. When validated in a large cohort of patients with PALF, the sensitivity and specificity of death prediction were low at 61% and 70%, respectively. The Pediatric End‐Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score was developed in an attempt to predict mortality pretransplant in children with liver disease and is calculated using albumin, bilirubin, INR, presence of growth failure, and age. Although the PELD score is widely used for chronic disease, it is unreliable in PALF and is not an appropriate grading score. As such, predicting patient outcomes remains challenging. Without a corroborated scoring system, some patients will be listed for and ultimately receive LT who would have otherwise spontaneously recovered.

### Pediatric acute liver failure: reexamining key clinical features, current management, and research prospects [^acba76fc]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

As the rate of transplant listing and pursuit decreased during the 15‐year study period, it can be presumed that identification of more treatable causes of PALF have been determined. However, the time to listing remained stable throughout, usually within 1 day of study enrollment, which contradicts previous studies documenting the decision to list patients for transplant as a process that unfolds over time. More likely, patients are listed quickly to optimize the potential for organ receipt given the continued organ shortages and unpredictable waitlist times.

Both patient survival and waitlist mortality improve for patients listed for transplant at centers that perform more than 50 technical variant graft transplants (split, reduced, and living donor) when compared with lower volume centers. This is likely due to the enhanced wealth of experience performing these technically demanding procedures in small children in the busier centers. Waitlist mortality on the whole has improved for pediatric patients since the incorporation of technical graft variants. Younger patients tend to have the longest waitlist times, especially when younger than 1 year of age, in whom waitlist mortality is > 20%, and these patients are more likely to receive split and living donor grafts compared with whole livers. Age may affect both the severity of illness as well as the likelihood of transplant listing. Because of limited organ availability, difficult clinical assessments of encephalopathy, and the increased incidence of multisystem organ failure, younger children (aged younger than 3 years) tend to have worse prognoses without LT.

Increased death and graft loss are observed in patients who have public insurance, and health‐related quality of life, fatigue, and school performance are all worse in patients who have received LT and in patients who recovered from PALF when compared with the general population. Sexual disparity among LT recipients exists on a national level, with only 35.7% female recipients in 2017. Reasons for this remain unknown.

High‐risk populations in

PALF can affect children of any age, and managing the youngest patients, younger than 90 days, can be particularly challenging. The PALFSG has studied this subset of patients, revealing the median age of enrollment was 18 days of life, with most commonly presenting with lethargy. Of these patients, 38% were identified as indeterminate PALF, and 64% lacked encephalopathy at the time of study enrollment. Resolution of disease without transplant was more likely in patients without encephalopathy. Overall, 60% of the patients recovered, usually with indeterminate PALF, followed by metabolic disease, which accounted for 20.5%. Of these patients, 41% were listed for LT, 40% of whom were successfully transplanted within 21 days. The mortality rate of this younger patient cohort is worse than their older counterparts, with 24% of the infants enrolled in the study succumbing to sepsis, multiorgan failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, or cerebral edema. This clearly demonstrates the negative impact of young age on PALF outcomes.

Pediatric LT remains a more complicated task given the prevalence of donor–recipient size mismatch and the general lack of pediatric donors. The rapid progression of PALF can drastically reduce the time available for transplant, necessitating emergency evaluations both of living and deceased donors. In some parts of the world, transplant relies more heavily on living donation because of a lack of deceased donor availability. In a 2016 study from Turkey, 16 patients were emergently listed for LT, and 12 received living donations after no deceased donor became available: nine received a left lateral segment donation, two received a right lobe donation, and one patient received a left lobe organ donation. The remaining four patients died while awaiting organ donation. Published statistics between 2005 and 2014 in Turkey are 3–4.8 deceased donors per 1 million people. Such scenarios amplify the importance of expedited living donor evaluation in PALF.

Evolving use of LT in

LT remains the standard of care and can be lifesaving for PALF. The PALFSG demonstrated a reduced frequency of listing patients for transplant and a reduced number of transplants without an increase in mortality after describing the trends from 1999 to 2014. Patients most likely to be listed had higher INR (median, 3.0), total bilirubin (median, 15 mg/dl), lactate (median, 2.8 mmol/L), ammonia (63 μmol/L), and lower liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, 1635 IU/L) than patients who were not listed because of a categorization of "not sick enough". [12] Listed patients were also more likely to be boys and require mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support. Indeterminate PALF was the most common diagnosis for listing. Patients who were not listed because they were "medically unsuitable" were more likely to have viral causes of PALF, shock, or HLH as well as a higher incidence of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor requirement. Contrary to adult data, irreversible brain damage was not a predominant exclusionary reason for listing. Overall, approximately one‐third of patients with PALF were listed for transplant during the course of the study period.

The American Academy of Pediatrics updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in infants born at more than 35 weeks of gestation. Preventing Isoimmune Hemolytic Disease Hemolysis is an important cause of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn. Blood group typing, Rh typing, and antibody screening should be performed early in pregnancy to determine the need for Rh immune globulin and prevent isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn. If screening was not performed during pregnancy, a maternal blood type and antibody screen should be obtained at admission.

If the maternal antibody screen is positive or unknown at birth, a direct antiglobulin test and blood typing should be performed on the infant as soon as possible. Infants with negative direct antiglobulin test results are not at elevated risk and may be managed with usual care. Infants with a positive direct antiglobulin test are at increased risk of hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity unless their mother received Rh immune globulin during pregnancy, because the immune globulin treatment can cause the positive direct antiglobulin test. Hyperbilirubinemia Related to Feeding Hyperbilirubinemia is common in infants who are exclusively breastfed but does not lead to hazardous hyperbilirubinemia. There are two main categories of jaundice associated with breastfeeding: Breastfeeding jaundice is caused by suboptimal intake of calories and is commonly associated with excess weight loss. This type of jaundice presents earlier with a bilirubin peak on days 3 to 5.

Breast milk jaundice occurs in infants with adequate intake and weight gain. A component in breast milk can cause prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that presents later and can persist for up to three months. Those risk factors include birth before 38 weeks' gestation; clinical instability in the previous 24 hours; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or other hemolytic condition; infant albumin level less than 3 g per dL; positive direct antiglobulin test, if Rh immune globulin was not given during pregnancy; and sepsis. VISUAL ASSESSMENT Visual assessment for jaundice offers an opportunity to identify early hyperbilirubinemia within 24 hours of birth, which is most often caused by hemolysis. The transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin level should be measured immediately if infants are noted to be jaundiced within 24 hours of birth.

After 24 hours, visual assessments should be used cautiously because visual estimates can differ from serum bilirubin by as much as 15 mg per dL. G6PD DEFICIENCY G6PD deficiency is rare but is one of the most important causes of hazardous hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus. If a formula-fed infant has hyperbilirubinemia or if any infant has severe hyperbilirubinemia or late-onset jaundice, G6PD deficiency should be considered. G6PD activity should be measured in any infant with jaundice of unknown cause when bilirubin levels increase despite intensive phototherapy, increase suddenly, increase after an initial decline, or when escalated care is necessary. Measuring G6PD activity close to a hemolytic event or exchange transfusion can lead to a falsely normal result; therefore, repeat measurements may be necessary. When bilirubin levels increase by 0. 3 mg per dL or greater per hour within 24 hours of birth or
0. 2 mg per dL (3.

### Advances in medical management of acute liver failure in children: promoting native liver survival [^1a151f83]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2022). High credibility.

Paediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is defined as a biochemical evidence of acute liver injury in a child with no previous history of chronic liver disease characterised by an international normalised ratio (INR) of 1.5 or more unresponsive to vitamin K with encephalopathy, or INR of 2.0 or more with or without encephalopathy. PALF can rapidly progress to multiorgan dysfunction or failure. Although the transplant era has substantially changed the outlook for these patients, transplantation itself is not without risks, including those associated with life-long immunosuppression. Consequently, there has been an increased focus on improving medical management to prioritise bridging of patients to native liver survival, which is possible due to improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of multiorgan involvement in PALF. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in the medical management of PALF with an aim of reducing the need for liver transplantation. The Review will focus on the non-specific immune-mediated inflammatory response, extracorporeal support devices, neuromonitoring and neuroprotection, and emerging cellular and novel future therapeutic options.

Kidney injury in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) — most renal injury is presumed to be acute and otherwise recoverable, and patients may require continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or renal replacement therapy to maintain fluid balance when renal function is impaired; in hepatorenal syndrome, recovery parallels improvement in liver function, whereas with direct kidney injury the course can be more prolonged.

Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) study entry criteria — PALF Study Group (PALFSG) requirements — specify three mandatory components for enrollment without requiring hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and are intended to identify severe acute liver injury at risk for liver transplantation (LT) or death. All three components are required: acute onset of liver disease without evidence of chronic liver disease, biochemical evidence of severe liver injury, and coagulopathy not corrected by vitamin K. Coagulopathy is defined as: "Prothrombin time (PT) ≥ 15 s or INR ≥ 1.5 with evidence of hepatic encephalopathy or PT ≥ 20 s or INR > 2.0 with or without encephalopathy".

### Management of adults with paediatric-onset chronic liver disease: strategic issues for transition care [^d89b4175]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of children with chronic liver disease have enabled many to survive into adulthood with or without their native livers, so that the most common of these conditions are becoming increasingly common in adult hepatology practice. Because the aetiologies of chronic liver disease in children may vary significantly from those in adulthood, adults with paediatric-onset chronic liver disease may often present with clinical manifestations unfamiliar to their adulthood physician. Transition of medical care to adult practice requires that the adulthood medical staff (primary physicians and subspecialists) have a comprehensive knowledge of childhood liver disease and their implications, and of the differences in caring for these patients. Pending still unavailable Scientific Society guidelines, this article examines causes, presentation modes, evaluation, management, and complications of the main paediatric-onset chronic liver diseases, and discusses key issues to aid in planning a program of transition from paediatric to adult patients.

The term acute liver failure (ALF) is frequently applied as a generic expression to describe patients presenting with or developing an acute episode of liver dysfunction. In the context of hepatological practice, however, ALF refers to a highly specific and rare syndrome, characterised by an acute abnormality of liver blood tests in an individual without underlying chronic liver disease. The disease process is associated with development of a coagulopathy of liver aetiology, and clinically apparent altered level of consciousness due to hepatic encephalopathy. Several important measures are immediately necessary when the patient presents for medical attention. These, as well as additional clinical procedures will be the subject of these clinical practice guidelines.

Pediatric acute liver failure — coagulopathy and bleeding management states that both prothrombin time (PT) and the international normalized ratio (INR) are elevated in PALF, yet abnormalities in these synthetic markers do not equate with bleeding risk because both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins are reduced; clinically significant bleeding can occur. Initial management should look to improve the abnormality via administration of an age- and weight-appropriate dose of vitamin K therapy from 1 mg in infants to 10 mg in older adolescents. Oral vitamin K therapy should not be used to correct the INR in PALF; rather, subcutaneous administration should be used, while intramuscular and intravenous routes carry a Black Box warning for rare, but potentially serious side effects. Coagulopathy secondary to vitamin K deficiency should rapidly correct following repletion, and if coagulopathy persists, efforts to "correct" with fresh frozen plasma or other pro-coagulation products should generally be avoided because plasma transfusions transiently improve laboratory measures but have no proven benefit when given prophylactically and can instead contribute to volume overload; most centers will use plasma and/or platelet infusions before an invasive procedure or in the setting of life-threatening bleeding. Thromboelastography (TEG) is designed to incorporate all coagulation phases and has the promise to inform management decisions but requires additional study.

### Quality evaluation of guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of liver failure [^23caaf2a]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Variability in evidence levels

The evidence supporting the same recommendation exhibits obviously variability across different guidelines. For instance, a notable disparity in the levels of evidence was observed for the recommendation of NAC treatment in acetaminophen-induced ALF, where all five guidelines advocate strongly for it but reference differing levels of evidence. For others, see Figure 3.

Our investigation offers several recommendations for the development of future LF-CPGs: 1) use systematic methodologies for evidence retrieval, referencing internationally recognized tools, such as the Cochrane Handbook; 2) before developing new guidelines, conduct comprehensive reviews of the current landscape of LF diagnosis and treatment. For recommendations that are controversial or conflicting, convening expert consensus panels is advisable to achieve agreement before finalization; 3) strive to use higher-level evidence and avoid conflating adult and pediatric evidence; 4) provide detailed citations of evidence sources to enhance traceability for guideline users; 5) guideline developers should familiarize themselves with established standards in guideline development, such as the AGREE II framework; 6) the development of clinical guidelines should incorporate the perspectives of the target audience; 7) an external review by experts should be conducted before the guidelines are published; and 8) rigorous assessment of potential conflicts of interest among guideline developers is essential to ensure transparency throughout the development process.

Our study highlights several strengths and limitations. The strengths include: 1) the evaluation of CPGs from diverse fields, enhancing the reliability of our findings. 2) A comprehensive evaluation of the evidence and recommendations of LF-CPGs, identifying some meaningful issues. The limitations manifest as follows: 1) only Chinese and English language CPGs were included in our evaluation, excluding guidelines published in other languages and 2) the AGREE II instrument does not assess the impact of recommendations on current clinical outcomes.

### Etiology and outcome of adult and pediatric acute liver failure in Europe [^40867c0b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is rare but life-threatening. Common causes include intoxications, infections, and metabolic disorders. Indeterminate etiology is still frequent. No systematic data on incidence, causes, and outcome of ALF across Europe are available. Via an online survey we reached out to European Reference Network Centers on rare liver diseases. Numbers and etiology of ALF cases during 2020 were retrieved and diagnostic and treatment availabilities assessed. In total, 455 cases (306 adult, 149 pediatric) were reported from 36 centers from 20 countries. Intoxication was the most common cause in adult and pediatric care. The number of cases with indeterminate etiology is low. Diagnostic tools and specific treatment options are broadly available within this network. This is the first approach to report on etiology and outcome of ALF in the pediatric and adult population in Europe. High diagnostic yield and standard of care reflects the expert status of involved centers.

Clinical signs and initial assessment in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) emphasize that presentation varies by age and etiology, with a frequent prodromal phase of fatigue, malaise, nausea, and abdominal pain; a history of fever is occasionally reported. Initial appearance of jaundice should be elicited if possible, and perceived change in behavior or attention that may reflect the development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) should be identified. Physical examination may be normal early; however, initial, and serial neurological examinations should be performed to assess mental and neurological signs of HE, and signs on initial examination suggestive of an underlying chronic liver disease are essential.

Pediatric acute liver failure — ammonia levels and encephalopathy risk note clinically important thresholds and cautions: Ammonia levels of > 100 µmol/L on admission represent an independent risk factor for the development of high-grade HE, and a level of > 200 µmol/L is strongly associated with cerebral herniation; medical therapy targeting ammonia reduction is often prescribed; lactulose may be favored over rifaximin given its mechanism of action and shorter time to clinical effect, however no definitive data suggests that either impact clinical outcomes; mechanisms driving HE extend beyond ammonia so reliance upon a singular ammonia value to determine the presence of HE should be avoided, with its measurement supporting the clinical assessment at the bedside.

Guidelines for the management of adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure in the ICU state the objective is "to develop evidence-based recommendations for clinicians caring for adults with acute liver failure (ALF) or acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) in the ICU". The panel "comprised 27 members" and in part 2 was "divided into four subgroups: neurology, peri-transplant, infectious diseases, and gastrointestinal groups". Methods included developing Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) questions, conducting "a systematic review and meta-analysis where applicable", assessing quality using the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation" approach, and using "the evidence to decision framework" to classify recommendations. The guideline "report[s] 28 recommendations (from 31 PICO questions)" for ICU management; "five were strong recommendations, 21 were conditional recommendations, two were best-practice statements, and we were unable to issue a recommendation for five questions due to insufficient evidence". Conclusions note "Multidisciplinary, international experts formulated evidence-based recommendations" and that "most recommendations were based on low quality and indirect evidence".

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The Hepatology Committee of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) aims to educate pediatric gastroenterologists, members of ESPGHAN and professionals from other specialties promoting an exchange of clinical expertise in the field of pediatric hepatology.

Methods

The 2020 single topic ESPGHAN monothematic 3-day conference on pediatric liver disease, was organized in Athens, Greece and was entitled " Acute Liver Failure" (ALF). ALF is a devastating disease with high mortality and in a considerable fraction of patients, the cause remains unresolved. As knowledge in diagnosis and treatment of ALF in infants and children has increased in the past decades, the objective was to update physicians in the field with developments in medical therapy and indications for liver transplantation (LT) and to identify areas for future research in clinical and neurocognitive outcomes in ALF.

Results

We recently reported the epidemiology, diagnosis, and initial intensive care management issues in separate manuscript. Herewith we report on the medical treatment, clinical lessons arising from pediatric studies, nutritional and renal replacement therapy (RRT), indications and contraindications for LT, neurocognitive outcomes, new techniques used as bridging to LT, and areas for future research. Oral presentations by experts in various fields are summarized highlighting key learning points.

Conclusions

The current report summarizes the current insights in medical treatment of pediatric ALF and the directions for future research.

### Diagnosis, grading, and treatment recommendations for children, adolescents, and young adults with sinusoidal obstructive syndrome: an international expert position statement [^8c7cf681]. The Lancet: Haematology (2020). High credibility.

Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, also known as hepatic veno-occlusive disease, is a potentially life-threatening complication that occurs in children undergoing haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Differences in the incidence of genetic predisposition and clinical presentation of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome between children and adults have rendered the historical Baltimore and Seattle diagnostic criteria insufficient for children. In 2017, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) proposed the first paediatric diagnostic and severity grading guidelines for sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, intended for implementation across European centres. However, universally accepted paediatric criteria are needed to ensure prompt diagnosis, definitive treatment, and improved outcomes for children, adolescents, and young adults with sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, and to facilitate international clinical research collaboration. We convened an international panel of multidisciplinary experts including physicians with expertise in HSCT, paediatric intensive care, nephrology, hepatology, radiology, pathology, and transfusion medicine; HSCT advanced-practice providers and medical trainees; pharmacists; and translational and basic science researchers from the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators Network, the EBMT, the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortia, and several other institutions with extensive experience in sinusoidal obstructive syndrome. Panellists convened at The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) in February, 2019, to evaluate the available evidence. In this expert position statement paper, we provide consensus recommendations for the international implementation of guidelines for the diagnosis, severity grading, and treatment of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome among children, adolescents, and young adults. We endorse universal adoption of paediatric diagnostic guidelines for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome as proposed by the EBMT, and provide implementation guidance for standardisation across centres; we have further proposed adjunctive use of age-appropriate organ-specific toxicity criteria for severity grading and provided prophylaxis and treatment considerations among children and adolescent and young adult patients. Key recommendations include: (1) liver biopsy, portal venous wedge pressure, and reversal of portal venous flow on Doppler ultrasonography should not be used for the routine diagnosis of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome in children, adolescents, and young adults; (2) platelet refractoriness can be defined as a corrected count increment of less than 5000–7500 following at least two sequential ABO-compatible fresh platelet transfusions; (3) hepatomegaly is best defined as an absolute increase of at least 1 cm in liver length at the midclavicular line; and if a baseline measurement is not available, hepatomegaly can be defined as greater than 2 SDs above normal for age; and (4) the presence and volume of ascites can be categorised as mild (minimal fluid by liver, spleen, or pelvis), moderate (< 1 cm fluid), or severe (fluid in all three regions with > 1 cm fluid in at least two regions).

AASLD practice guidance — definition and core elements of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF): We suggest that the presence of all of the following elements are minimum critical components for the definition of ACLF: (1) acute onset with rapid deterioration in clinical condition, (2) the presence of liver failure defined by elevated bilirubin and elevated INR in patients with chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis, and (3) the presence of at least one extrahepatic (neurologic, circulatory, respiratory, or renal) organ failure. Although specific criteria to define ACLF vary by region, organ failure is common to all ACLF definitions, and there are three major definitions with a fourth by the World Gastroenterology Organization; thresholds used in definitions include coagulopathy with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5–2.5 or above and bilirubin cutoffs of 5–12 mg/dL. Critically ill patients with cirrhosis are at a high risk of mortality within 1–3 months.

Stages of acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity — time course and hallmark findings are organized as follows: Stage I (< 24 h) presents with "Non-specific features such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain" and "Lab test often normal, or near normal"; Stage II (24–72 h) features "RLQ abdominal pain" with "LFT and INR elevations"; Stage III (73–96 h) includes "HE, AKI, MOF", "Severe liver injury with markedly increased LFTs", "Bilirubin may be elevated, but often to lesser degree than expected" and "Rising bilirubin is ominous sign", plus "Metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap", "Worsening coagulopathy", and "Mortality is highest"; Stage IV (> 96 h) is the "Recovery stage" with "Clinical and biochemical symptoms improve". Abbreviations are defined on-page: "AKI = acute kidney injury; APAP = acetaminophen; HE = hepatic encephalopathy; INR = international normalized ratio; LFT = liver function tests; MOF = multi-organ failure".

Guideline scope and limitations — We report 29 recommendations on the management ALF or ACLF in the ICU, related to four groups (neurology, infectious disease, gastroenterology, and peri-transplant), with a summary list of recommendations provided in Table 2; the guideline assembled multidisciplinary experts and used a rigorous methodological approach led by international experts to summarize evidence and issue recommendations, while acknowledging limitations including lack of patient participation in development, possible misalignment with patient values, inability to comment on other prioritized PICO questions, and identification of areas where evidence is lacking and should be targeted for future research.

Pediatric acute liver failure — coagulopathy diagnosis and management include laboratory features and targeted transfusion strategies: Findings include ↑↑ INR, ↓ Factor V and VII, and ↓Fibrinogen; management includes Vitamin K repletion – consider intravenous route to assure administration, and to Avoid FFP and platelets to just correct the INR or improve platelet count in the absence of bleeding as both are associated with transfusion related volume injury and fluid overload; use Cryoprecipitate for low fibrinogen levels (e.g., < 100 mg/dL); recombinant factor VIIa has been used to lower the INR before placement of an intracranial monitor, but it is very expensive and there is a risk of thrombosis; thromboelastography (TEG) is often normal, although hyper- and hypo-coagulable states may occur.

### Paediatric acute liver failure: a prospective, nationwide, population-based surveillance study in Germany [^18adb694]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this nationwide surveillance study on PALF in Germany provides the first published epidemiologic data with an incidence rate of 3.7 cases per 1 million children per year, mainly affecting children in their first year of life. This dynamic and life‐threatening clinical condition needs a high awareness in all paediatric hospitals to early recognise this condition and to initiate a recommended referral of the patient to a centre of excellence. Laboratory parameters might guide therapeutic decisions regarding prognosis of spontaneous recovery. Finally, monogenic diseases were the leading cause of PALF; hence, we recommend exome or genome sequencing to be applied early in the diagnostic course of PALF.

Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) — fluids and electrolytes: In the presence of cardiovascular instability, fluid or colloid resuscitation should be prioritized; in the absence of the need for volume resuscitation, total intravenous fluids should initially be restricted to around 90% of maintenance fluids to avoid overhydration, and initial fluids should be similar to hypertonic glucose (D10) one- half normal saline and supplemented with 15 mEq of potassium (K +) / L; fluids with pre-determined concentrations of electrolytes, such as Lactated Ringers, should be avoided; glucose infusion rates as high as 10 to 15 mg/min per kg body weight may be required to achieve stable serum glucose levels between 90 and 120 mg/dL, ideally using hypertonic glucose solutions via a central catheter; hypomagnesemia can be profound and requires supplementation to maintain phosphorus levels above 3 mg/ dL.

### Acute liver failure in children: the first 348 patients in the pediatric acute liver failure study group [^aacee24d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine short-term outcome for children with acute liver failure (ALF) as it relates to cause, clinical status, and patient demographics and to determine prognostic factors.

Study Design

A prospective, multicenter case study collecting demographic, clinical, laboratory, and short-term outcome data on children from birth to 18 years with ALF. Patients without encephalopathy were included if the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio remained ≥ 20 seconds and/or > 2, respectively, despite vitamin K. Primary outcome measures 3 weeks after study entry were death, death after transplantation, alive with native liver, and alive with transplanted organ.

Results

The cause of ALF in 348 children included acute acetaminophen toxicity (14%), metabolic disease (10%), autoimmune liver disease (6%), non-acetaminophen drug-related hepatotoxicity (5%), infections (6%), other diagnosed conditions (10%); 49% were indeterminate. Outcome varied between patient sub-groups; 20% with non-acetaminophen ALF died or underwent liver transplantation and never had clinical encephalopathy.

Conclusions

Causes of ALF in children differ from in adults. Clinical encephalopathy may not be present in children. The high percentage of indeterminate cases provides an opportunity for investigation.

Consensus recommendations — agreement process and rationale: The guideline's recommendations reflect universal agreement or a strong consensus among committee members, and in the one situation with only majority agreement, additional members were appointed and added; subsequently, consensus was achieved. The major reason for disagreement was varying levels of risk tolerance, and for these recommendations the Key Action Statements provide more detailed explanations of uncertainties and attempts to derive numbers needed to test and treat.
