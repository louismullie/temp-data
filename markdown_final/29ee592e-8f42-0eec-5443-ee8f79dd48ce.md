## Question

Do patients with a family history of thoracic aortic disease require more frequent screening?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with a family history of thoracic aortic disease require more frequent screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence and guideline consensus. Then, I should verify which relatives exactly should be screened and how often. Next, I will examine the rationale for intensified surveillance, including risk magnitude and early dissection risk. After that, I need to check how genetic testing modifies screening cadence. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and note exceptions and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the strength of evidence and guideline direction. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on the same conclusion: first-degree relatives of patients with thoracic aortic disease should undergo screening aortic imaging, and if initial imaging is normal, repeat imaging at defined intervals is recommended, which constitutes more frequent screening than the general population receives [^315a2d94] [^1d5761bf].

> Wait, let me verify exactly who should be screened and how often. The ACC/AHA 2022 guideline recommends screening aortic imaging for all first-degree relatives of patients with aortic root or ascending aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection, and if the initial study is negative, repeating imaging in about 5 years for younger relatives and about 10 years for older relatives, with the understanding that aortic size and age can shift intervals toward shorter follow-up if risk is higher [^cc79af90] [^1d5761bf]. The ESC 2024 guideline advises starting imaging at age 25 or 10 years below the youngest affected age, whichever is younger, and if the initial screen is normal, repeating every 5 years until age 60, which again reflects intensified surveillance compared with average-risk individuals [^ff5e659b] [^842d61aa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the magnitude of risk that justifies this. Population-based data show that a family history of thoracic aortic disease confers a roughly six- to twenty-fold increased risk of thoracic aortic disease in first-degree relatives, with the effect stronger in younger individuals and in women, which materially elevates pretest probability and supports earlier, more frequent imaging than in those without family history [^9be5e10d]. Observational cohorts also show that familial cases present about a decade earlier and have more proximal aortic involvement, reinforcing the need for earlier surveillance in relatives [^d894d705].

> I need to check how genetic testing changes the cadence. If a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant is identified in the proband, cascade genetic testing is recommended for at-risk relatives, and those who carry the variant should undergo aortic imaging with TTE (or CT/MRI if TTE is inadequate) and then be surveilled more frequently, often annually or semi-annually depending on the gene, age, and aortic size, which is clearly more frequent than population screening [^700fd96e] [^5c1d8fa4] [^8a8a6303]. Conversely, if no variant is found but there is a positive family history, imaging of first-degree relatives remains indicated, again with shorter intervals than for average-risk patients [^98d64d2d] [^1d5761bf].

> Let me consider the clinical rationale for intensified screening. Thoracic aortic disease is frequently silent until dissection, which carries high mortality; early detection via family screening enables timely medical therapy and prophylactic surgery, improving outcomes compared with emergency repair after dissection, which is a key justification for more frequent surveillance in relatives [^3e2cba0d] [^32ebd2dc]. Feasibility studies also show that cascade screening identifies a meaningful fraction of relatives with previously unrecognized aortopathy, supporting programmatic screening rather than ad hoc approaches [^8c5189f9] [^162aeaf8].

> But wait, what if the index case is older and hypertensive — does family history still matter? I should double-check that. Even in older adults, a positive family history remains a recognized risk enhancer, and guidelines still recommend screening first-degree relatives, though the yield may be lower than in younger, nonhypertensive probands; nonetheless, given the catastrophic nature of missed dissections, the balance of benefit favors screening with individualized interval decisions based on age and aortic size [^315a2d94] [^1d5761bf].

> Next, I should review practical implementation details. TTE is the first-line modality for root and ascending aorta visualization, with CT or MRI reserved for inadequate TTE windows or when the arch/descending aorta must be assessed; recording baseline aortic dimensions and maintaining a family pedigree with ages of dissection or repair are essential to calibrate surveillance intensity and surgical thresholds in relatives [^5c1d8fa4] [^e8ba9d82]. For families with known HTAD but no identified variant, imaging of relatives remains indicated, and intervals should be shortened if any relative shows rapid growth or early-onset disease, aligning with gene-informed and family-history–informed risk stratification [^98d64d2d] [^1d5761bf].

> I will now examine exceptions and uncertainties. Evidence quality for exact screening intervals is largely consensus-based rather than randomized, and cost-effectiveness data are limited, so shared decision-making is important, especially when uptake is suboptimal or when imaging reveals only borderline enlargement; nonetheless, major societies prioritize preventing dissection over screening burdens, which supports adhering to guideline-recommended intervals and escalating when red flags emerge [^8b3ed4d9] [^179e7b3a]. Additionally, some relatives will have variants of uncertain significance, in which case imaging-based surveillance with shorter intervals is prudent until more data clarify risk [^28e498a7].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, patients with a family history of thoracic aortic disease require more frequent screening than the general population: first-degree relatives should undergo baseline aortic imaging and, if normal, repeat imaging about every 5 years until age 60 per ESC, or about every 5–10 years depending on age per ACC/AHA, with earlier starts and shorter intervals when family onset is young or when a pathogenic variant is present, reflecting a materially higher risk profile and the potential to prevent catastrophic events through early detection [^ff5e659b] [^842d61aa] [^cc79af90] [^1d5761bf].

---

Patients with a family history of thoracic aortic disease should have **more frequent screening** because they carry a higher risk of heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) and aortic events [^9be5e10d]. Current guidelines recommend **imaging every 3–5 years** for first-degree relatives, starting at age 25 or 10 years younger than the youngest affected family member, with shorter intervals if any abnormality is found or if there is a known pathogenic variant [^ff5e659b] [^842d61aa]. This approach enables early detection and timely intervention to prevent dissection or rupture [^32ebd2dc].

---

## Risk associated with family history

Family history significantly increases the risk of thoracic aortic disease; **first-degree relatives have a 6–20-fold increased risk** compared with the general population [^9be5e10d]. HTAD accounts for about 20% of thoracic aortic aneurysms, and up to 20% of patients with thoracic aortic disease have an affected first-degree relative [^46d7088f]. This elevated risk persists even without overt syndromic features, underscoring the need for targeted screening [^510a9bc5].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Major cardiovascular societies provide clear guidance on screening frequency for individuals with a family history of thoracic aortic disease:

- **ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines**: Recommend screening aortic imaging for all first-degree relatives of patients with aortic root or ascending aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection, regardless of age of onset [^1d5761bf] [^2cbd1256]. If initial imaging is normal, repeat imaging every 5–10 years is reasonable, with shorter intervals if any abnormality is detected or if a pathogenic variant is identified [^cc79af90].

- **ESC 2024 guidelines**: Recommend initiating screening at age 25 or 10 years below the youngest age of onset in the family, whichever is earlier, and repeating imaging every 5 years if initial results are normal [^ff5e659b] [^842d61aa]. Shorter intervals are advised if abnormalities are detected or if a pathogenic variant is identified.

- **EACTS/STS 2024 guidelines**: Emphasize cascade genetic testing and imaging for at-risk relatives, particularly in families with early-onset disease or known pathogenic variants [^9255f526].

---

## Evidence supporting more frequent screening

Several studies highlight the **benefits of more frequent screening** in this population:

- **Early detection**: Screening identifies asymptomatic aneurysms in approximately 20–30% of first-degree relatives, enabling timely intervention [^8c5189f9] [^0df8d9a7].

- **Preventing dissection**: Early detection allows prophylactic surgery before dissection or rupture, significantly improving outcomes [^32ebd2dc].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Despite initial costs, screening is cost-effective by preventing catastrophic events and reducing long-term healthcare expenses [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing screening frequency

Screening frequency should be **individualized** based on:

- **Age of onset**: Earlier onset in family members warrants earlier and more frequent screening [^ff5e659b].

- **Genetic testing results**: Presence of pathogenic variants necessitates more frequent surveillance [^e611f627].

- **Aortic size and growth rate**: Rapidly enlarging aneurysms or those approaching surgical thresholds require closer monitoring [^4a36865e].

- **Family history specifics**: History of dissection at smaller diameters or unexplained sudden death increases risk and may justify more frequent screening [^4a36865e].

---

## Recommended screening modalities

Imaging modality selection depends on **availability, patient factors, and clinical context**:

| **Imaging modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Widely available | Limited visualization of descending aorta and arch |
| Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - No radiation <br/> - Comprehensive aortic assessment | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time |
| Computed tomography angiography (CTA) | - High-resolution <br/> - Widely available | Radiation exposure |

---

TTE is typically the **first-line modality** for initial screening, with MRI or CTA reserved for inconclusive results or when detailed anatomical assessment is needed [^5c1d8fa4].

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits of frequent screening

Frequent screening in high-risk individuals leads to:

- **Early detection**: Identification of asymptomatic aneurysms, enabling timely intervention [^8c5189f9].

- **Reduced morbidity and mortality**: Early intervention prevents dissection and rupture, significantly improving survival [^32ebd2dc].

- **Improved quality of life**: Early detection and management reduce anxiety and improve long-term outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite clear benefits, several challenges persist:

- **Uptake**: Only about 34% of eligible relatives undergo screening, highlighting the need for improved awareness and access [^dcb6a151].

- **Uncertainty**: Optimal intervals and modalities remain debated, necessitating ongoing research [^38bb0bbf].

- **Psychological impact**: Anxiety and stress associated with screening and genetic counseling must be addressed [^notfound].

---

Patients with a family history of thoracic aortic disease should undergo **more frequent screening** — typically every 3–5 years — with shorter intervals if abnormalities or pathogenic variants are found. This strategy enables early detection and intervention, reducing the risk of dissection and rupture and improving outcomes [^ff5e659b] [^842d61aa].

Introduction

Diseases of the thoracic aorta are increasing in prevalence, accounting for 1% to 2% of all deaths in Western countries. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 In the United States, diseases of the aorta account for more than 40 000 deaths per year. 1, 4 Thoracic aortic diseases (TADs) are often silent entities with a mortality of almost 80% when presenting as life‐threatening emergencies. 3, 6 Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are likely to improve long‐term survival. TADs may be syndromic, associated with disorders involving other organs such as Marfan syndrome, or more commonly nonsyndromic, with manifestations restricted to the thoracic aorta. 4, 5 Nonsyndromic TADs (NS‐TADs) may be familial, characterized by the presence of a family history and an autosomal dominant inheritance, or sporadic. 4, 5, 6, 7 Unlike syndromic TADs, NS‐TADs are not evident from external physical features and abnormalities of other organ systems and are characterized by silent aneurysm formation and dissection. 4, 5 Screening of first‐degree relatives (FDRs) of patients affected by NS‐TAD is therefore recommended for early detection and treatment of asymptomatic disease. 4, 5 However, existing guidelines are based predominantly on the consensus of expert opinion, rather than high‐quality evidence, and the testing modality, frequency, and extent (FDRs versus second‐degree relatives [SDRs]) of screening are not defined. 4, 5 As a consequence, there is widespread variation in the screening of family members of patients with NS‐TADs. To address this area of uncertainty, we performed a systematic review of the evidence for screening in the relatives of patients affected with NS‐TADs with reference to the prevalence of aortic disease, the predictive accuracy of genetic and imaging screening tests, and the effectiveness of screening programs in this high‐risk population.

Clinical Evaluation and Genetic Testing in Suspected Inherited Aortopathy

When patients and their families are being investigated for suspected inherited thoracic aortopathy, important consideration will be given to whether genetic testing is indicated and how to counsel patients about the potential implications. Here again, it is useful to split into syndromic and nonsyndromic categories. In a patient presenting with suspected sHTAD, imaging and genetic investigations vary significantly according to the proband phenotype (summarized in Table 3). Familial testing in relatives will be guided by a genetics specialist and will be focused on those family members with phenotypic features suggestive of the condition.

Table 3.
Summary of Diagnostic Criteria, Imaging Assessment, and Targeted Genetic Testing for Syndromic Inherited Aortopathies

Managing patients presenting as the proband for nsHTAD can be challenging, with a degree of uncertainty often surrounding diagnosis, prognosis, and how to investigate family members. First, careful elucidation of any family history of acute aortic events, including sudden unexplained death at a young age, is important in establishing a clear heritable aortopathy. Echocardiographic screening of the aorta in first-degree relatives can be a useful and affordable tool for establishing the prevalence of aortic dilatation within the family, both solidifying a diagnosis of an inherited aortopathy and identifying at-risk family members who will require more regular aortic surveillance (Figure 3). Second, because nsHTAD with aortic dilatation or dissection in patients < 50 years of age has a stronger likelihood of identifiable genetic mutations, offering genetic testing in these patients is reasonable even in the absence of a clear family history (Figure 3). When a heritable thoracic aortopathy is suspected, genetic testing should be considered carefully and discussed with the family, usually by a geneticist specialist.

Figure 3.
Summary of the management for imaging, family screening, and counseling management for inherited thoracic aortopathies. First-line genetic testing targets are in bold. BAV indicates bicuspid aortic valve; and nsHTAD, nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease.

Genetic screening in nsHTAD has developed over the past decade and can be beneficial when applied in the right context by providing more personalized selection for aortic surveillance and the timing of prophylactic aortic surgery and conveying a better understanding of the risks of pregnancy and to future offspring. In the clinical setting, this genetic testing is best performed when positive results are actionable by adding meaningful prognostic information affecting the patient's medical care and influencing important clinical decisions, for example, the timing of prophylactic aortic replacement surgery. Families should be aware that a clear genetic cause can be found in only ≈20% of cases, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty. In these cases, a robust mechanism for monitoring family members, whether apparently affected or not, will be required because aortopathy may not develop until later in life (Figure 3). The majority of commercially available gene panels across the United States and Europe also include targeted sequencing of genes with an association with thoracic aortopathy that is less well established (Figure 3). Although there is a role for expanded genetic testing, particularly in the context of gene discovery research, prospective counseling on the consequences of uncertain results and follow-up aortic monitoring will be crucial when supporting families in this scenario. Improved understanding of the gene-disease aortic risk association and novel gene discovery are going to be vital to improving the care received by these families with inherited aortopathies. To move toward the eventual goal of personalized gene-adapted management, longitudinal international collaboration with the pooling of affected patients will be essential to overcoming the lack of power consequent to the rarity of gene-positive disease. Until then, treatment, management, and counseling of patients with a confirmed inherited aortic disease are based on reducing the risk of acute aortic events through an understanding of biomechanical and biological principles.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic Disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^cc79af90]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Thoracic aortic disease family screening and follow-up: Cascade screening extends imaging to identify asymptomatic thoracic aortic enlargement in at-risk relatives, and individuals with pathogenic variants in genes for heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) should be screened with aortic imaging for asymptomatic TAD. Multiple studies have confirmed the utility of screening aortic imaging of at-risk relatives of all TAD patients with a positive family history, and studies also support the screening of first-degree relatives of patients with TAD who do not have a family history of the disease. If initial imaging is negative, repeat screening imaging might be worthwhile in 5 years for younger family members or 10 years in older family members, and aortic imaging may be repeated years later depending on the relative's age and aortic size. It should be recognized that there is no upper limit to the age at which patients present with TAD that precludes an underlying genetic cause of the disease, and the specific aortic diameters should be recorded in the medical record so that the information can be readily retrieved when needed in the future.

### Screening for lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^1fa125ee]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

Thoracic aortic dimensions and aneurysm management in asymptomatic screening populations — Normal aortic size increases with age, with at 70 years of age the normal ascending aorta 3.5 cm and the descending aorta 2.7 cm; the upper limit of normal is 4.2 and 3.2 cm, respectively. Aortic enlargement should not be called an aneurysm until the size is > 50% larger than normal, and there is no evidence of benefit or recommendation for screening individuals for thoracic aortic aneurysm unless there is a clear family history or known genetic defect associated with aortic disease. Measurement should be of the outside of the aorta in a plane strictly perpendicular to the blood flow. Management of BP and lipids is recommended for individuals with an aneurysm to decrease the rate of further expansion, but the data come primarily from patients with familial risk, and there is little evidence to suggest that reporting mild/moderate aortic dilation affects health outcomes. Monitoring recommendations include annually or biannually based on size, type, and location in the context of annual lung cancer screening, and consideration of surgical repair is recommended for patients with an ascending or descending aortic size of ≥ 5.5 cm (unless there is a familial syndrome).

### Systematic review of studies that have evaluated screening tests in relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic disease [^38bb0bbf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to defining an area of unmet need, the review has identified important knowledge gaps with respect to screening. Specifically, the diagnostic accuracy of existing screening tests, the optimal screening program, and the clinical, societal, or economic benefits of such a screening program in the relatives of patients with sporadic or familial NS‐TAD are unclear. Current guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases do not specify the details of what screening tests should be used (Table S11). 4, 5, 77 The 2014 European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend investigating FDRs by genetic counseling for family investigation and molecular testing, with a 5‐year interval screening until diagnosis (clinical or molecular) is established or ruled out (class I, level of evidence C). 5 The corresponding 2010 American guidelines suggest aortic imaging screening for FDRs along with counseling and testing whether a specific mutant gene (FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, COL3A1, ACTA2, MYH11) is identified in the affected probands (class I, level of evidence C). 4 These recommendations are based on opinion of the experts and small group studies only. 4, 5 Importantly, specific testing schedules, the requirement for screening of SDRs and TDRs, the need for sequencing of other less‐common mutant genes, the optimal screening interval and modality, or the need to investigate the entire arterial tree other than the thoracic aorta are not specified. 4, 5 The results of the current study suggest that FDRs, SDRs, and possibly TDRs should be offered screening for TAD. Clarification of the family history regarding the location of the aortic disease, the specific nature of "sudden deaths", or the presence of other concomitant cardiovascular disorders during clinical examination should represent the initial step of screening. 75 Our results also suggest that genetic testing and cardiac imaging with at least TTE should be offered to all FDRs and SDRs of patients with suspected NS‐TADs. Mutation carriers should undergo further imaging (MRI or CT scan), focusing on thoracic aorta and/or other arterial trees based on the causative gene mutation. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74 For example, ACTA2‐mutation carriers should be monitored for coronary artery disease and occlusive cerebrovascular disease, in addition to the currently recommended routine imaging tests. 32 We suggest that complete aortic imaging at initial diagnosis and at 6 months for patients with a confirmed genetic aortopathy (eg, FBN1, FOXE3, MFAP5, MYLK, PRKG1, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2) should be obtained to establish whether aortic enlargement is occurring. 4, 74 The final clinical management of patients with a specific gene mutation could be modified on the basis of these data, enabling personalized treatment that is independent of the native aortic diameters. 4, 5, 41, 50 Only relatives in whom a causal mutation is excluded and the aortic size is within recommended diameters should reasonably undergo clinical and/or imaging screening every 2 to 5 years, until diagnosis is confirmed or ruled out. 5, 76 The appropriate temporal interval for follow‐up imaging, as well as the starting age for aortic surveillance, are also poorly defined. Generally, patients with NS‐TAD are diagnosed on average 10 years older than patients affected by syndromic aortopathies, being also characterized by a lower annual aortic dilatation progression (0.5–0.7 mm/y). 59, 60 It therefore seems reasonable to initiate the screening 15 to 10 years earlier than first aneurysm or when dissection or sudden death is recorded within the family. 60, 79 A screening pathway based on these observations is proposed in Figure 3.

### Systematic review of studies that have evaluated screening tests in relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic disease [^c457f100]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases (‐) are often silent entities until they present as life‐threatening emergencies. Despite familial inheritance being common, screening is not the current standard of care in‐s. We sought to determine the incidence of aortic diseases, the predictive accuracy of available screening tests, and the effectiveness of screening programs in relatives of patients affected by‐.

Methods and Results

A systematic literature search on PubMed/, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from inception to the end of December 2017. The search was supplemented with the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. A total of 53 studies were included, and a total of 2696‐relatives were screened. Screening was genetic in 49% of studies, followed by imaging techniques in 11% and a combination of the 2 in 40%. Newly affected individuals were identified in 33%, 24%, and 15% of first‐, second‐, and third‐degree relatives, respectively. Familial‐s were primarily attributed to single‐gene mutations, expressed in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance. Specific gene mutations were observed in 25% of the screened families. Disease subtype and genetic mutations stratified patients with respect to age of presentation, aneurysmal location, and aortic diameter before dissection. Relatives of patients with sporadic‐s were also found to be affected. No studies evaluated the predictive accuracy of imaging or genetic screening tests, or the clinical or cost‐effectiveness of an‐screening program.

Conclusions

First‐ and second‐degree relatives of patients affected by both familial and sporadic‐s may benefit from personalized screening programs.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic Disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^cabbc788]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and genetic testing protocol for patients with thoracic aortic disease (TAD) — Genetic testing is recommended for individuals with syndromic features, family history of TAD, and/or early age of disease onset, and thoracic aortic imaging is recommended for first-degree relatives of all individuals with TAD, regardless of age of onset, to detect asymptomatic aneurysms. Entry triggers in the algorithm include TAD < 60 y of age and "Sporadic" patients (≥ 60 y of age) in whom imaging for aneurysms in at-risk family is performed; if imaging shows aortic dilation or aneurysm the pathway proceeds to genetic testing, whereas a normal aortic diameter represents the alternate branch. The figure also lists family history of TAD, intracranial or peripheral aneurysm as an entry condition. After genetic testing, positive genetic testing should trigger gene-based management and cascade testing of at-risk relatives, whereas when testing is negative or reveals variants of unknown significance, first-degree relatives should undergo screening aortic imaging.

The patient with thoracic aortic aneurysm disease requires careful evaluation and management over his or her lifetime. This includes assessment for the presence of an underlying genetic disorder, such as Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve disease, or a familial aortic aneurysm syndrome. Screening family members is necessary, inasmuch as up to 20% of first-degree relatives of the patient with a thoracic aortic aneurysm will also have aneurysm disease. Medical therapy is often prescribed, and beta-blocker therapy to reduce the stress on the aortic wall is usually recommended. However, very few clinical trials of pharmacologic therapy in humans with thoracic aortic aneurysm disease have been conducted. Mouse models have led to important discoveries and insight into the pathogenesis of aneurysm syndromes, and there is hope these may lead to effective therapy in people. Several studies are ongoing that examine the role of angiotensin receptor blockers in Marfan syndrome. Lifestyle modification is also important for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm, including restrictions on physical activity, weight lifting, and recommendations about the management of pregnancy. Long-term surveillance of the aorta, even after successful surgery, is necessary for timing of prophylactic surgery and to evaluate for late complications.

### Family history of aortic disease predicts disease patterns and progression and is a significant influence on management strategies for patients and their relatives [^d894d705]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

While a positive family history (FH) is a known risk factor for developing an aneurysm, its association with the extent of disease has not been established. We evaluated the influence of a FH of aortic disease with respect to the pattern and distribution of aortic aneurysms in a given patient.

Methods and Results

From November 1999 to November 2011, 1263 patients were enrolled in physician-sponsored endovascular device trials to treat aortic aneurysms. Of the 555 patients who were alive and returning for follow-up, we obtained 426 (77%) family histories. Three-dimensional imaging studies were used to identify the presence of aneurysms; 36% (155/426) of patients had a FH of aortic aneurysms and 5% (21/155) had isolated intracranial aneurysms. A logistic regression model was used to compare aortic morphology between patients with a positive or negative FH for aneurysms. Patients with a positive FH of aortic aneurysms were younger at their initial aneurysm (63 vs 70 years; P < .0001), more frequently had proximal aortic involvement (root: odds ratio [OR], 5.4; P < .0001; ascending: OR, 2.9; P < .001; thoracic: OR, 2.2; P = 0.01) with over 50% of FH patients ultimately developing suprarenal aortic involvement (P = 0.0001) and had a greater incidence of bilateral iliac artery aneurysm (OR, 1.8; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

FH is an important tool that provides insight into the expected behavior of the untreated aorta and has significant implications for the development of treatment strategies. These findings should be used to guide patient's management with regard to treatment, follow-up paradigms, genetic testing, and screening of other family members.

### Systematic review of studies that have evaluated screening tests in relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic disease [^5570bc97]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Proposed flow chart for a dedicated screening program for relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic diseases of the thoracic aorta based on the authors' extensive literature review. The figure represents the best judgement of the authors. BAV indicates bicuspid aortic valve; CT, computed tomography;, first‐degree relatives;, magnetic resonance imaging;‐, nonsyndromic thoracic aortic disease;, second‐degree relatives;, transthoracic echocardiogram.

There are several additional factors that may influence our proposed screening algorithm. First, variable penetrance, which often characterizes NS‐TAD forms, is a potential confounder. This results in intrafamilial variability, which is evident not only with reference to the aortopathy itself (severity, age of onset), but also with regard to other phenotypic manifestations. 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 The presence of associated features is certainly suggestive of having inherited the aortic condition along with the predisposition to the aortopathy, but the absence of these associated features does not eliminate the risk of having an underlying aortopathy. Second, women often demonstrate a lower lifetime risk of aortopathy, developing the condition at a later age than men. 81 This phenomenon, known as sexual dimorphism, explains the apparent paradox of an affected teenager with an affected maternal grandfather but an unaffected mother with normal echocardiographic features. Third, the age at onset of the aortopathy may be important in the natural history of the disease. Ma et al 82 recently demonstrated that age at onset of aortic dissection is lower in families with a positive history for aortic dissection, therefore suggesting a prompt and more aggressive screening pathway in these families. A positive family history with an aortopathy occurring at younger ages confers a significantly increased risk of developing a new dissection in apparently unaffected family members. 81 The above findings are all important in guiding the proper screening and surveillance strategies.

Heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) epidemiology and family screening — "Approximately 20% of TAA are related to a genetic or heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD)", and "Up to 20% of individuals with a TAA or aortic dissection have a family history of TAD, with at least 1 affected first-degree relative". HTAD "most commonly involves the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both but may also present with distal aortic disease and aortic dissection", and "Pathogenic variants in multiple genes can lead to TAA, cerebral aneurysms, and AAA". Therefore, "among patients with aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysm or those with aortic dissection, screening of first-degree relatives with imaging is essential to detect unrecognized, asymptomatic TAD".

Methods

The data, analytic methods, and study materials are available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure (Supplemental Material).

Protocol, Registration, and Search Strategy

The search strategy, objectives, study selection and eligibility, data collection, and assessment of study quality are published online and registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO registry — CRD42017064598). 8 The protocol of the present systematic review is fully reported in Data S1. The review adhered to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) guidelines (Table S1). 9

We searched electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library) without date or language restriction from inception to the end of December 2017. A systematic search in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database 10 on December 31, 2017, was also accomplished. To supplement the electronic search, the "first‐generation" reference lists of pertinent articles were reviewed. Search criteria, adopted keywords, and MeSH terms used in relevant combinations are reported in Data S1.

Participants

We included studies considering imaging and/or genetic screening tests in probands affected by diseases of the thoracic aorta (aneurysms and/or acute aortic syndrome), and their FDRs, SDRs, and third‐degree relatives (TDRs), with no restriction on ethnicity or age.

Target Condition

The target condition was disease of the thoracic aorta (aneurysm and/or acute aortic syndrome) defined by the international guidelines on diagnosis and management of patients with TAD. 4, 5 Only NS‐TAD forms were considered in the present review; syndromic TADs or other forme fruste of syndromic TAD related to the transforming growth factor β pathway were excluded. Familial NS‐TAD forms were defined as those occurring in families with ≥ 2 members with a known TAD, but without a clinical diagnosis or history of a syndromic TAD or any other connective tissue disease. 7 Sporadic TADs were defined as those occurring in patients apparently without a family history of TAD or evidence of syndromic TAD. 4, 5, 7

### Systematic review of studies that have evaluated screening tests in relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic disease [^501d0d4f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this review support routine imaging and genetic testing of relatives of patients with nonsyndromic aortopathies. The evidence suggests that screening of FDRs and SDRs of patients affected by familial NS‐TAD and FDRs of those affected by sporadic NS‐TADs will result in significant numbers of patients with otherwise undiagnosed disease. Personalized screening programs determined by the subtype of NS‐TAD and its related genetic mutation have the potential to benefit these patients. However, the diagnostic yield of available screening tests is unclear, as are the details of a screening program, and there is no existing evidence that routine screening and stratified treatment will have clinical or economic benefits. Further studies are required to address these knowledge gaps.

Other larger studies in sporadic disease have reached similar conclusions. Our work suggests that a clinical geneticist review should be sought where imaging results point toward a family history of the disease, to undertake phenotyping and aid variant interpretation. A final comment is that given the age of the participants and their comorbidities, only 1 out of the 3 probands who needed rephenotyping would have undergone testing according to the latest revision of the criteria of the National Genomic Test Directory.

Figure 17 — Evaluation and genetic testing protocol for thoracic aortic disease (TAD) — states that genetic testing is recommended for individuals with syndromic features, family history of TAD, and/or early age of disease onset, including those with features of Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), and it includes an entry category of "Sporadic" patients (≥ 60 y of age). Thoracic aortic imaging is recommended for first-degree relatives of all individuals with TAD, regardless of age of onset, to detect asymptomatic aneurysms, and aneurysms are typically asymptomatic. Positive genetic testing should trigger gene-based management and cascade testing of at-risk relatives, whereas when testing is negative or reveals variants of unknown significance, first-degree relatives should undergo screening aortic imaging.

### Evaluating the feasibility of screening relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases: the REST study [^162aeaf8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, NS‐TADs are conditions with an often‐unrecognized genetic etiology. Cascade testing could return positive results in up to 1 out of 4 relatives, even in families with a first case of aortic dissection. A tailored, focused screening program could potentially be helpful in optimizing surveillance, medical management, and prophylactic surgical intervention when required, by combining a careful review of a potential familial component with an imaging assessment that should be extended to SDRs.

Aim

The "2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation and family screening, medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (ie, asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes).

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, where appropriate.

Structure

Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. The is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

### Natural history of thoracic aortic aneurysms [^fb24d6c5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Understanding the natural history of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) is essential to patient care and surgical decision making. In this evidence summary we discuss some of the most clinically relevant features of the disease. The true incidence of TAAs is likely to be higher than currently reported because of the inherently silent nature of TAAs. However, TAAs can become rapidly lethal once dissection or rupture occurs, highlighting the need for more robust screening. The impressive discovery of familial patterns and novel genetic loci for TAAs challenges the idea that most TAAs are simply sporadic. Although the aorta grows in an indolent manner, its rate of growth and its current diameter both have important clinical implications. Biomechanical studies have supported clinical findings of 6.0 cm as a dangerous threshold. Surgical extirpation of TAAs is currently the mainstay of effective treatment. Although endovascular TAA repair is becoming increasingly common, long-term safety remains unproven. We still need more data to support the concept that any medical therapy is effective.

Marfan syndrome — family screening and surveillance are advised: Because Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion, transthoracic echocardiographic screening is recommended for the first-degree relatives unless a gene mutation has been identified and genetic testing can be used to identify affected relatives; all affected family members should undergo regular aortic imaging, with serial imaging dependent on age and specific features.

### Family history, comorbidity and risk of thoracic aortic disease: a population-based case-control study [^9be5e10d]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the risk of thoracic aortic disease (TAD) when one or more first-degree relatives are affected, and to relate the risk of family history to the risk of other cardiopulmonary comorbidity.

Design

Population-based, matched, case-control study.

Setting

Registry-based investigation.

Patients

All cases, nationwide, of TAD diagnosed 2001–2005 in individuals born 1932 or later (n = 2436) were identified, and a random control-group (n = 12 152) matched for age, sex and geography was generated. First-degree relatives were identified in the Multigeneration Registry. Family history of TAD was assessed by cross-linking nationwide health registries.

Interventions

None.

Results

Family history was present in 108 cases (4.4%), compared with 93 (0.77%) controls (p < 0.0001). The risk of TAD increased with number of affected relatives: OR 5.8 (95% CI 4.3 to 7.7) vs OR 20 (2.2 to 179) with one versus two or more affected relatives. The relative risk of TAD was highest in the youngest (≤ 49 years) age group and slightly more pronounced in women than in men (OR 7.2 (4.2 to 12) vs OR 5.5 (3.9 to 7.7)). Among cardiopulmonary comorbidities, heart failure conferred the highest relative risk, OR 6.3 (4.1 to 9.8).

Conclusions

Family history confers a significantly increased (sixfold to 20-fold) relative risk of TAD. The effect is more pronounced in women and in younger subjects, and is not conveyed by cardiopulmonary comorbidity. Knowledge of family history is important to counselling, treatment indications, surveillance and screening protocols.

### NLST-638: evaluation of thoracic aortic aneurysm mortality with low-dose computed tomographic… -approved projects… [^f083fcb6]. cdas.cancer.gov (2020). Medium credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends one-time ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in males age 65–74 years old who have ever smoked. Similar one-time screening recommendations are in practice in the United Kingdom and Sweden. A single ultrasound screening for AAA has been shown to half the mortality rate due to AAA in men aged 65–74 years. However, nearly half of deaths from ruptured abdominal aneurysms in the United States occur in patients outside these limited screening criteria. Additionally, screening has not been extended to thoracic aortic disease. Established risk factors for TAA include male sex, prior and active smoking, hypertension, emphysema, and familial history. Lung cancer and TAA share many of these same risk factors and can both be detected on a chest X-ray or non-contrast, low-dose CT scan.

Through analysis of existing imaging studies, we hope to define the incidence of thoracic aortic disease among lung cancer screening patients, those aged 55–75 years, with at least 30 pack year smoking history and who actively smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Clinical data available in the National Lung Cancer Screening trial includes many variables relevant to this study, including significant cardiovascular abnormalities found on imaging, participant demographics and risk factors, long-term mortality and cause of death, as well as non-cancer ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Our primary outcomes will be thoracic aortic disease detected on lung cancer screening imaging and cardiovascular mortality among those with and without detected aortic disease. The ability to identify a thoracic aortic disease prior to aortic catastrophe would not only prevent aortic-related mortality but would decrease complications and improve the quality of life for aortic patients.

The NLCS trial was a monumental improvement in the care of lung cancer patients. We hope to use this data to similarly advance the care of aortic patients. Specific Aims:

1. To determine the incidence of thoracic aortic disease among patients aged 55–75, with at least a 30 pack year smoking history, who are actively smoking or have quit within 15 years, that can be identified on: A: Chest X-Ray B: Low-Dose Computed Tomography.
2. To determine the incidence of aortic-related deaths among patients aged 55–75, with at least a 30 pack year smoking history, who are actively smoking or have quit within 15 years, with disease identified on screening imaging. Research Team:

Heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) — genetic testing and family screening recommendations: In patients with aortic root/ascending aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection, obtaining a multigenerational family history of thoracic aortic disease and related events is recommended (1 B-NR), and in those with such aneurysms or dissection plus risk factors for HTAD, genetic testing to identify pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants is recommended (1 B-NR). In patients with an established pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant predisposing to HTAD, it is recommended that genetic counseling be provided and that clinical management be informed by the specific gene and variant (1 B-NR). In patients with TAD who have a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, genetic testing of at-risk biological relatives is recommended, and family members who inherit the variant should undergo aortic imaging with transthoracic echocardiography if adequately visualized, otherwise with CT or MRI (1 B-NR). In families with aortic root/ascending aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection where no disease-causing variant is identified by genetic testing, screening aortic imaging of at-risk biological relatives is recommended (1 B-NR). In the absence of a known family history of TAD or a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, screening aortic imaging of first-degree relatives is recommended (1 C-LD). In patients with acute type A aortic dissection, the diameter of the aortic root and ascending aorta should be recorded in the operative note and medical record to inform the management of affected relatives (1 C-EO).

Familial clustering and inheritance in TAD — current data indicate that 13% to 20% of patients with thoracic aortic disease (TAD) without Marfan or Loeys-Dietz features have similarly affected first-degree relatives. TAD in these families is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with decreased penetrance, and in families with heritable TAD (HTAD), testing in an individual diagnosed with TAD should be initiated. Patients with a family history present at younger ages (average 57 years), and families show variable expression including frequency of aortic dissection at a diameter < 5.0 cm.

### Systematic review of studies that have evaluated screening tests in relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic disease [^ba7a0c1b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases (NS - TADs) are often silent entities until they present as life-threatening emergencies. Despite familial inheritance being common, screening is not the current standard of care in NS - TAD s. We sought to determine the incidence of aortic diseases, the predictive accuracy of available screening tests, and the effectiveness of screening programs in relatives of patients affected by NS - TADs. Methods and Results A systematic literature search on PubMed/ MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from inception to the end of December 2017. The search was supplemented with the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. A total of 53 studies were included, and a total of 2696 NS - TAD relatives were screened. Screening was genetic in 49% of studies, followed by imaging techniques in 11% and a combination of the 2 in 40%. Newly affected individuals were identified in 33%, 24%, and 15% of first-, second-, and third-degree relatives, respectively. Familial NS - TAD s were primarily attributed to single-gene mutations, expressed in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance. Specific gene mutations were observed in 25% of the screened families. Disease subtype and genetic mutations stratified patients with respect to age of presentation, aneurysmal location, and aortic diameter before dissection. Relatives of patients with sporadic NS - TAD s were also found to be affected. No studies evaluated the predictive accuracy of imaging or genetic screening tests, or the clinical or cost-effectiveness of an NS - TAD screening program. Conclusions First- and second-degree relatives of patients affected by both familial and sporadic NS - TAD s may benefit from personalized screening programs.

### Evaluating the feasibility of screening relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases: the REST study [^dcb6a151]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The major limitation of the study was the small sample size, and there is no certainty that these results would be representative of the findings of a larger study. The present study was restricted to a single center without an established inherited cardiovascular disease service, and therefore uptake rates and detection rates may be higher than in some other centers. Moreover, the approach to cascade screening adopted in the study and the necessity for additional phenotyping of some participants do not reflect the standard management adopted in a clinical context and are mainly due to the research nature of the procedures described. These limitations not withstanding, however, the data suggest that cascade screening is feasible, is safe, and does identify relatives who require ongoing surveillance and secondary prevention.

The study provided useful insights into the potential barriers to the wider introduction of such a program. First, uptake was low, accounting for 34%, possibly attributable to the limited understanding of the familial basis of TAD in people with the disease, but also more broadly, in primary and tertiary care. This suggests that education and overcoming institutional and individual barriers to cascade screening will be important components of any wider initiative. Decision support tools are increasingly used to help people make decisions around genetic testing in particular. Potential participants were also approached by mail, sometimes several years after the index admission of the proband. Uptake may be higher in the acute setting, as recommended by a recent Delphi exercise. Second, in those probands who expressed an interest in the study, the uptake of cascade screening in their FDR and SDR was high, accounting for 54% of participants. This may reflect the desire of people at risk to know more about their likelihoods of developing the disease. As a matter of fact, cascade screening was identified as top research priority for aortic dissection survivors and their families in a recent survey (Aortic Dissection Awareness UK, personal communication). Third, the study identified participants with disease phenotypes and no detected genetic abnormality. This points toward a potential unmet need for further research into the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the natural history of the condition. Finally, and accepting the limited power of the study sample size, the data constitute a potential argument in favor of imaging tests in FDRs and SDRs of both sporadic and familial groups. In contemporary clinical practice in the United Kingdom and United States, genetic and imaging testing are typically restricted to FDRs of familial cases in the first instance.

Genetic aortopathies — HTAD genetic testing and screening of family members emphasize the following actions: In patients with aortic root/ascending aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection, obtaining a multigenerational family history of thoracic aortic disease (TAD), unexplained sudden deaths, and peripheral and intracranial aneurysms is recommended. In patients with aortic root/ascending aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection and risk factors for HTAD, genetic testing to identify pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variants (ie, mutations) is recommended. In patients with an established pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a gene predisposing to HTAD, it is recommended that genetic counseling be provided and that the patient's clinical management be informed by the specific gene and variant. In patients with TAD who have a pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variant, genetic testing of at-risk biological relatives (ie, cascade testing) is recommended, and in relatives with the inherited variant, aortic imaging with transthoracic echocardiography (if aortic root and ascending aorta are adequately visualized, otherwise with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) is recommended. In a family with aortic root/ascending aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection where no disease-causing variant is identified with genetic testing, screening aortic imaging of at-risk biological relatives (ie, cascade testing) is recommended. In patients with aortic root/ascending aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection and no known family history of TAD or pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, screening aortic imaging of first-degree relatives is recommended. In patients with acute type A aortic dissection, the diameter of the aortic root and ascending aorta should be measured in the operative note and medical record to inform management of affected relatives.

Nonsyndromic thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) account for 95% of all TAAD cases and comprise a subset in which the lack of obvious clinical signs makes diagnosis a challenge. Despite the potentially fatal natural history, timely diagnosis and prophylactic surgical intervention allow restoration of near-normal life expectancy in TAAD patients, underlining the critical importance of screening tests. To date, more than 30 TAAD disease-causing genes have been identified, and over 30% of nonsyndromic TAAD patients have a genetic mutation in 1 or more of these genes. Whole exome sequencing allows routine genetic testing in a clinical setting by screening for all TAAD-related genes, thus facilitating personalized aortic care. Additionally, increased vigilance upon diagnosis of certain TAAD-related diseases ("guilty associates") and the emergence of modern radiologic and novel serologic screening tests will further bolster efforts to detect undiagnosed asymptomatic nonsyndromic TAAD.

Discussion

Main Findings

The present study has identified an area of unmet clinical need with respect to screening of relatives of patients with NS‐TAD: familial NS‐TADs occur more frequently than previously recognized, affecting ≈30% of relatives with a male predominance (3:1). These are primarily inherited as single gene mutations, expressed in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance, which demonstrate variable expression with respect to age of presentation, sex, aneurysmal location, and aortic diameter before dissection. The risk of acute aortic syndrome is determined by the underlying genetic mutation and this risk extends not only to FDRs but also to SDRs and TDRs of patients affected by NS‐TADs. There is an overlap between nonsyndromic and syndromic TADs for some genetic mutations, as well as concomitant cardiovascular pathology in over 10% of screened patients. The review also identified knowledge gaps with respect to the predictive accuracy of commonly used screening tests across NS‐TAD populations, the optimal structure and extent of a screening program across families, and the effectiveness of a screening program with respect to clinical outcomes or cost.

Clinical Implications

Nonsyndromic aortopathies have poor prognosis if untreated and the lack of relevant physical features precludes identification based on a clinical characteristics alone. 7, 75 As a consequence, NS‐TADs are asymptomatic, alerting clinicians to the underlining aortopathy only when sudden death or an acute aortic dissection occurs. 7, 19, 72, 75 This review indicates that routine screening and surveillance programs in relatives of patients affected by NS‐TADs, similar to those of syndromic TAD, are likely to identify significant numbers of patients with asymptomatic NS‐TAD. 4, 5, 76, 77 The overlap in genetic mutations between NS‐TAD and syndromic TAD identified in the review further support this assertion. It follows that diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment of NS‐TADs before clinical presentation, as is the standard of care for syndromic TAD, is likely to reduce premature deaths. The findings of this article also indicate that current guidelines which recommend treatment based predominantly on the aortic diameter are likely to result in the undertreatment of NS‐TADs. 4, 5 Specifically, subtypes of NS‐TADs attributed to specific genetic mutations may progress to aortic dissection without aneurysm formation. 78 Here, the treatment of affected relatives stratified by NS‐TAD subtype and genetic abnormality are likely to result in further clinical benefits (Figure 2).

### Evaluating the feasibility of screening relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases: the REST study [^2ab73713]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Diseases of the thoracic aorta (TADs) account for 1% to 2% of all deaths in the Western countries and occur in approximately 1% of the general population, although prevalence might be even higher according to recent series.TADs are often silent entities with a mortality of almost 80% when presenting as life‐threatening emergencies. Consequently, early recognition and treatment are crucial elements for improving patient survival. Unlike syndromic TADs, nonsyndromic TADs (NS‐TADs) lack overt clinical signs and systemic features, hindering early detection and prompt surgical intervention. Although both the European and American guidelines recommended the screening of first‐degree relatives of a subject affected by TAD, tailored imaging and genetic screening programs have not been standardized to date. As a result, there is uncertainty around the screening of relatives with regard to screening modality, prognosis, and genetic counseling. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the feasibility of a tailored imaging and genetic testing approach in relatives of probands affected by both sporadic and familial NS‐TAD.

### Evaluating the feasibility of screening relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases: the REST study [^8c5189f9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Diseases of the thoracic aorta are characterized by a familial etiology in up to 30% of the cases. Nonsyndromic thoracic aorta diseases (NS-TADs) lack overt clinical signs and systemic features, which hinder early detection and prompt surgical intervention. We hypothesize that tailored genetic testing and imaging of first-degree and second-degree relatives of patients affected by NS-TADs may enable early diagnosis and allow appropriate surveillance or intervention. Methods and Results We conducted a feasibility study involving probands affected by familial or sporadic NS-TADs who had undergone surgery, which also offered screening to their relatives. Each participant underwent a combined imaging (echocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging) and genetic (whole exome sequencing) evaluation, together with physical examination and psychological assessment. The study population included 16 probands (8 sporadic, 8 familial) and 54 relatives (41 first-degree and 13 second-degree relatives) with median age 48 years (range: 18–85 years). No syndromic physical features were observed. Imaging revealed mild-to-moderate aortic dilation in 24% of relatives. A genetic variant of uncertain significance was identified in 3 families. Imaging, further phenotyping, or a form of secondary prevention was indicated in 68% of the relatives in the familial group and 54% in the sporadic group. No participants fulfilled criteria for aortic surgery. No differences between baseline and 3-month follow-up scores for depression, anxiety, and self-reported quality of life were observed. Conclusions In NS-TADs, imaging tests, genetic counseling, and family screening yielded positive results in up to 1 out of 4 screened relatives, including those in the sporadic NS-TAD group.

### Paradigm for detecting silent thoracic aneurysm disease [^bd68709d]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) pose a serious detection challenge owing to their clinically silent nature. Only a small fraction of TAAs cause symptoms in patients. However, the mortality burden of this disease in the population is significant, given the high lethality of such complications as aortic rupture and dissection. Widespread screening for TAA has not been shown to be cost-effective. Therefore, currently most patients with a TAA are identified incidentally during an imaging study conducted for other reasons. Once a TAA diagnosis is established, prophylactic surgical treatment can safely be performed for aneurysms of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending or thoracoabdominal aorta, thus preventing aneurysm-related death. To facilitate early detection of TAA, recent studies have identified several "associates" of TAA that may be useful in making a timely diagnosis. These "associates" include intracranial aneurysm, aortic arch anomalies, abdominal aortic aneurysm, simple renal cysts, bicuspid aortic valve, temporal arteritis, a positive family history of aneurysm disease, and a positive thumb-palm sign, among others. Although for many of these "associates" the underlying mechanism that would explain the association remains to be elucidated, the clinical correlation is strong enough to suggest screening patients with these findings for TAA. This article introduces the "Guilt by Association" paradigm for detection of silent thoracic aortic disease based on detection of clinical markers associated with this condition.

### Preventing acute aortic dissections: the power of familial screening and risk assessment [^5618e448]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1997, we were the first to identify families without manifestations of genetic syndromes due to pathogenic variants in single genes predisposing to highly penetrant TAD, termed nonsyndromic familial TAD (NS‐TAD). We found an increased burden of thoracic aortic aneurysms and sudden death in first‐degree relatives (FDRs) of NS‐TAD probands compared with a control group. These data were supported by studies from an independent group, which showed that up to 20% of NS‐TAD probands have a family history of TAD. The impact of family history data to inform care was extended further by 2 studies that demonstrated patients with family history of TAD are at higher risk for aortic events at younger ages, show more rapid aneurysm growth, and have a higher likelihood of surgical reintervention.

Highly penetrant forms of thoracic aortic disease in individuals with or without syndromic features, collectively termed heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD), can be identified by molecular genetic testing, family history analysis, and phenotypic evaluation. HTAD is a genetically heterogeneous condition, associated with 11 clinically actionable genes to date. Professional guidelines and practice statements support genetic testing to confirm molecular diagnosis, tailor aortic surveillance and surgical management, and identify at‐risk relatives. However, pathogenic variants in these genes only account for only ≈30% of HTAD, with more diagnoses confirmed in syndromic families compared with nonsyndromic families. The likelihood of identifying a pathogenic variant in an HTAD gene is closer to 10% in patients ≤ 56 years with sporadic aortic dissection. If a pathogenic variant is identified, predictive "cascade" genetic testing can be used to definitively determine TAD risk in relatives. However, when the causative gene cannot be identified in patients with TAD, thoracic aortic imaging is the only way to diagnose aneurysms in at‐risk family members.

Diagnostic evaluation of thoracic aortic disease — imaging reliance, committee values, and risk-focused history: Thoracic aortic disease is increasingly an incidental finding with cross-sectional imaging, and there is no low-cost modality to image descending thoracic aorta (DTA) disease; therefore, evaluation relies on patient history and physical examination, with genetic testing providing further support for imaging. The committee acknowledges a lack of high-quality evidence for specific screening strategies and placed high value on preventing catastrophic vascular events over screening burdens and costs. History should identify elevated risk for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA): most patients are older with uncontrolled hypertension as a primary risk factor; younger patients warrant evaluation for secondary causes of severe hypertension including legal and illicit sympathomimetic drugs and genetic defects; patients with inflammatory vasculitides such as Takayasu disease, giant cell arteritis, and Behçet arteritis should also be considered at high risk for development of TAA.

Target Condition

Four main groups of familial NS‐TADs were identified: (1) those characterized by the presence of both aneurysms and dissections in the family pedigree (familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection; 44 studies); (2) those characterized by aneurysmal disease only (familial thoracic aortic aneurysm; 2 studies); (3) those characterized by aortic dissection only (familial thoracic aortic dissection; 3 studies); and (4) thoracic aortic aneurysm forms associated with the presence of bicuspid aortic valve (4 studies). Among the familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection forms, 3 additional subgroups were discovered based on the concomitant presence of patent ductus arteriosus (n = 4), intracranial aneurysms (n = 2), or peripheral arterial aneurysms (n = 2) (Table 1).

- A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms. 2
- The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms.
3. Types Thoracic aortic aneurysm A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age. 4 Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms. Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following:

- Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back.
- Shortness of breath.
- Trouble breathing or swallowing.

5 Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis, but infection or injury can also cause them. 6 Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:

- Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side.
- Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs. Risk factors Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm.

3.3. Using clinical criteria to identify candidates for genomic testing

Practice guidelines and expert opinion continue to support use of clinical criteria (eg, "red flags") to identify optimal genetic testing candidates who represent patients most likely to have a highly penetrant form of thoracic aortic disease. However, this approach relies on providers collecting and interpreting detailed patient phenotype and family history information, which is not routinely performed. Flow charts detailing criteria incorporate age of aortic disease onset, family history of aortic disease or premature sudden death, and physical features of syndromes predisposing to thoracic aortic disease, but they do not uniformly align on age thresholds for testing patients with sporadic AD (younger than 50 years, younger than 55 years, and younger than 60 years) or inclusion of bicuspid aortic valve disease and aneurysms/dissections involving other arteries. In addition, evidence used to develop these criteria were not generated from studies specifically designed to address this research question.

Index Tests

For the purposes of the review, we included studies that phenotyped participants using the following imaging tests: transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)/transoesophageal echocardiogram, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic aorta, and genetic screening, individually or in combination with the acknowledgement that sensitivities and specificities of CT (100% and 100%, respectively) and MRI (95–100%) are higher when compared with those of transoesophageal echocardiogram and TTE (74–100% and 71–91%, respectively). 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 In some studies, surgery for TAD, postmortem examination, or sudden death were used to assess the aortic phenotype. Molecular genetic testing approaches included a combination of gene‐targeted testing (multigene panel or single gene testing) and whole exome of genome sequencing. 16, 17, 18

Study Selection, Data Collection, and Extraction

Two investigators (G.M. and R.D.) independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full‐text articles against the specified inclusion criteria for studies regarding screening of relatives of patients with NS‐TADs. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus and consultation with a third investigator (G.J.M.). One reviewer extracted key data from the included studies using a standard dedicated pro forma; a second reviewer checked the collected data for completeness and accuracy. The Tables report full details on study design and quality, setting and population, details, and results of screening. Key study characteristics include details of the patient population (NS‐TAD form, ethnicity, family identification), participants undergoing screening (relatives eligible for screening; family pedigree; total number of screened relatives; numbers of FDRs, SDRs, and TDRs), TAD characteristics (new diagnosis of aortic disease, number/rate of newly diagnosed thoracic aortic aneurysms and/or dissection, rate of unexplained sudden death, age and aortic diameters at dissection, sex preponderance, and aortic disease penetrance), additional concomitant phenotype/clinical features (types and rates), and type of adopted screening modality (imaging and genetic test used, validation processes). The definitions of the extracted variables are fully reported in Data S1.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) — follow-up imaging of the aorta in unoperated patients specifies that all patients with associated aortopathy should undergo annual surveillance imaging of the ascending aorta. After identification of ascending aortic enlargement, repeat imaging after 6 months is recommended. If the aorta remains stable at 6-month follow-up and is < 45 mm in size and there is no family or personal history of aortic dissection, annual aortic imaging is recommended, whereas patients who do not meet these criteria should undergo repeat aortic imaging using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) every 6 months. Patients with BAVs and no demonstrable aortopathy should be screened every 3 to 5 years with TTE. Repeat computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is suggested at least every 3 to 5 years to reassess the aortic arch and descending aorta, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is generally not used for initial diagnosis and follow-up. Patients with aneurysmal dilatation of the arch or descending thoracic aorta or those with remote histories of type B dissection require regular CT angiography or MRI, and in such cases imaging should be repeated annually because TTE does not provide reliable serial follow-up of those portions.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) aortopathy — family screening and imaging: The aortic root, ascending aorta, arch, and proximal descending aorta should be imaged by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to evaluate valve function, dilation, and coarctation, and cardiac-gated computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior images when TTE is inadequate; the choice between CT or MRI depends on patient characteristics, institutional expertise, renal function, affordability, and radiation exposure concerns. In families with BAV and aortic root and ascending aortic dilation, screening of first-degree relatives with TTE identifies affected members, and if the ascending aorta is not adequately assessed by TTE, a CT or MRI should be performed; cascade evaluation is indicated when a relative is found with BAV and/or aortic dilation. The prevalence of a BAV in relatives ranges from 9% to 20%, and family members may also have aortic dilation; TTE screening of first-degree relatives to detect both BAV and aortopathy proves to be cost-effective. Certain heritable thoracic aortic disease syndromes show increased prevalence of BAV; for example, BAV is present in ∼10% of patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and reported aortic dilation rates in BAV range from 20% to 84%.

Surgical considerations for nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease (nsHTAD) with no identified genetic cause — For asymptomatic aneurysms of the aortic root or ascending aorta, timing of repair requires shared decision-making and is informed by known aortic diameters in affected relatives at dissection or repair; when there are no family diameter data and no high-risk features (Table 9), it is recommended to repair the aorta when the maximal diameter reaches ≥ 5.0 cm; if high-risk features are present or cardiac surgery for other indications is planned, aortic repair is reasonable at a maximal aortic diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm when performed by experienced surgeons in a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening — supportive evidence and definitions — Smoking history is defined as lifetime use of ≥ 100 cigarettes, with risk attributable to smoking varying by exposure and lower risk in those with lower versus higher pack-year history. Based on a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials inclusive of nearly 125 000 mostly male patients, screening of men ≥ 65 years of age reduced long-term AAA-related mortality (4 RCTs: OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57–0.74) and AAA-related ruptures (4 RCTs; OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.55–0.70) over 12 to 15 years. In a population-based study in the United Kingdom, two-thirds of the acute AAA events occurred in those ≥ 75 years of age; consequently, screening to elderly patients should be offered, provided they would benefit from potential aortic repair. Having a first-degree relative with AAA is a well-known and well-established risk factor for development of AAA, and small cohort studies of ultrasound screening in relatives have identified an overall prevalence of new AAA of 10% to 20%, with the highest prevalence of 25% found among brothers.

### Cardiogenetics: genetic testing in the diagnosis and management of patients with aortic disease [^c7d99b53]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection have a potent genetic underpinning with 20% of individuals having an affected relative. Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) may be classified as syndromic (including Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and others) or non-syndromic (without recognisable phenotypes) and relate to pathogenic variants in multiple genes affecting extracellular matrix proteins, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signalling and smooth muscle contractile function. Clinical and imaging characteristics may heighten likelihood of an underlying HTAD. HTAD should be investigated in individuals with thoracic aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection, especially when occurring in younger individuals, in those with phenotypic features and in those with a family history of aneurysm disease. Screening family members for aneurysm disease is important. Consultation with a medical geneticist and genetic testing of individuals at increased risk for HTAD is recommended. Medical management and prophylactic aortic surgical thresholds are informed by an accurate clinical and molecular diagnosis.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening evidence and risk factors — In randomized trials of men ≥ 65 years of age, screening reduced long-term AAA-related mortality (4 RCTs: OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57–0.74) and AAA-related ruptures (4 RCTs: OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.55–0.70) over 12 to 15 years, and a population-based study reported that two-thirds of the acute AAA events occurred in those ≥ 75 years of age; consequently, screening to elderly patients should be offered, provided they would benefit from potential aortic repair. Family history markedly elevates risk: among relatives of those with AAA, ultrasound screening has identified an overall prevalence of new AAA of 10% to 20%, with the highest prevalence of 25% found among brothers, and the overall lifetime prevalence of AAA is estimated to be 32% in brothers of those with AAA. In women, smoking was associated with a 15-fold increased risk of AAA (relative risk, 15.0; 95% CI, 13.2–17.0) versus 7-fold among men (relative risk, 7.3).

### Use of genetics for personalized management of heritable thoracic aortic disease: how do we get there? [^3732881f]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The major diseases affecting the thoracic aorta are aortic aneurysms and acute aortic dissections. Medical treatments can slow the enlargement of aneurysms, but the mainstay of treatment to prevent premature death resulting from dissection is surgical repair of the thoracic aortic aneurysm, which is typically recommended when the aortic diameter reaches 5.0 to 5.5 cm. Studies of patients with acute aortic dissections, however, indicate that as many as 60% of dissections occur at aortic diameters smaller than 5.5 cm. Clinical predictors are therefore needed to distinguish those at risk for dissection at an aortic diameter smaller than 5.0 cm and to determine the aortic diameter that justifies the risk of surgical repair to prevent an acute aortic dissection. Data from genetic studies during the past decade have established that mutations in specific genes can distinguish patients at risk for the disease and predict the risk of early dissection at diameters smaller than 5.0 cm. This information has the potential to optimize the timing of aortic surgery to prevent acute dissections.

### Preventing acute aortic dissections: the power of familial screening and risk assessment [^179e7b3a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite professional society guidelines and expert opinion that recommend thoracic aortic imaging for at‐risk relatives, additional data are needed to determine the optimal timing to initiate imaging, the preferred imaging modality, and impact of screening programs on health outcomes. Results from the largest cross‐sectional aortic surveillance study of 581 at‐risk relatives of NS‐TAD probands yielded 216 new TAD diagnoses with management implications, including 42 patients with aortic root/ascending diameters > 50 mm. Although the cost‐effectiveness of familial screening programs for TAD has not been investigated, Tessler et al. recently showed that echocardiography was a cost‐effective strategy to screen FDRs of patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The success of screening programs also relies on communication with at‐risk relatives and the relatives' willingness to pursue screening. A retrospective study of pediatric patients with BAV and/or thoracic aortic aneurysm called attention to screening barriers as only 38.7% of the 150 at‐risk siblings pursued aortic imaging. In addition to evaluating the clinical utility and sustainability of aortic screening programs moving forward, there is a critical need to assess screening implementation barriers.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Abbasciano et al. investigated the feasibility of a multifaceted TAD screening program that integrated thoracic aortic imaging for at‐risk relatives of NS‐TAD probands, exome sequencing for TAD probands, and psychological and quality of life assessments. This study included 16 probands with NS‐TAD (8 familial; 8 sporadic) and 54 FDRs and second‐degree relatives who underwent thoracic aortic imaging via transthoracic echocardiogram (n = 54) and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 43). Approximately 62% of the probands were male with median ages of 68.5 and 67.5 years in the familial and sporadic groups, respectively. All 16 probands were hypertensive and several had additional TAD or atherosclerosis risk factors (eg, aortic valve dysfunction, renal disease, smoking history). Notably, the median age of probands in the familial group and burden of hypertension are more typical of patients with sporadic TAD who have an average disease onset closer to 65 years. The preponderance of hypertension and older age of disease onset in the familial group could be due to several factors (eg, small sample size, heterogeneity of proband phenotype, how familial disease was defined) and is important to consider when interpreting the clinical implications of this study.

### Whole aorta imaging shows increased risk for thoracic aortic aneurysms and dilatations in relatives of abdominal aortic aneurysm patients [^263fca81]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

For relatives of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients, guidelines recommend abdominal imaging aimed at early detection and management of AAA, and do not include screening for thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA). We aimed to investigate if TAA occur in undiagnosed relatives of patients with AAA without a known genetic susceptibility for aneurysms, similar to families with identified genetic susceptibilities for aneurysms like in Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, where both AAAs and TAAs occur.

Methods

Relatives of patients with AAA were invited for noncontrast whole aorta computed tomography (CT) screening. Systematic measurements of the CT scans were used to detect aneurysms and dilatations. Classification into familial and nonfamilial was based on reported family histories. In addition, aneurysm gene panel testing of AAA index cases was used for the classification of high vs unknown genetic risk (high genetic risk: familial aneurysm or a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) in an aneurysm gene; unknown genetic risk: no family history or P/LP).

Results

Whole aorta imaging of 301 relatives of 115 index patients with AAA with noncontrast CT scans showed a 28-fold increase in TAAs in relatives (1.7% [P < .001] vs the age-adjusted population) and a high frequency of thoracic dilatations in 18% of the relatives. Thoracic aneurysms and dilatations in relatives occurred even when index patients were unaware of familial aneurysms. AAA was increased in the relatives compared with the age-adjusted population (8%; P < .001).

Conclusions

An increased risk for thoracic aneurysms and dilatations was detected by whole aorta imaging of relatives of index patients with AAA, even when index patients were unaware of familial aneurysms. These results indicate still unknown shared genetic susceptibilities for thoracic and abdominal aneurysms. Therefore, imaging of the whole aorta of relatives of all abdominal aneurysm patients, will improve early detection of aortic aneurysms in relatives of all patients with AAA.

Results of Imaging Tests

A total of 1039 families underwent screening for NS‐TAD, with a median number of patients in each family pedigree of 48 (study range: 6–270) (Table S3). The proportion of potential eligible patients per family was 73% (study range: 50–100%), while the rate of relatives effectively screened was 54% (study range: 5–100%) (Table 2 and Table S4). FDRs, SDRs, and TDRs were variably screened throughout the studies. Twelve percent of FDRs, 24% of SDRs, and 18% of TDRs were not available for screening (Figure 1).

Relatives screened in the studies included in the systematic review. Details for newly affected and not screened individuals are provided for first‐, second‐, and third‐degree relatives (FDRs, SDRs, and TDRs, respectively).

A total of 893 FDRs, 695 SDRs, and 670 TDRs were identified in the family pedigrees of the included studies (Table S5). Of these, a total of 910 newly affected relatives were detected, with an average among studies of 22 newly diagnosed individuals. The percentage of newly diagnosed relatives was 23% (study range: 6–56%). Newly diagnosed individuals were male in 67% of the cases (study range: 20–100%). Sudden unexplained deaths were reported in 2% of the cases (study range: 0–9%). Detailed data about rates of newly affected and screened FDRs, SDRs, and TDRs are depicted in Figure 1.

The type of aortic diseases (aneurysm and dissection rates), male preponderance rate, and age at dissection are summarized in Table 2 and Table S4. Only 1 study screened the relatives of 53 probands identified as affected by a sporadic NS‐TAD form, identifying 83 of 321 newly affected relatives. 59

Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections (and)

Patients with ACTA2 and MYH11 variants generally have few specific physical signs, unlike patients with other HTADs. Therefore, the disease is alternatively called nonsyndromic thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. In this study, > 90% of the probands in this group had experienced a cardiovascular event before genetic diagnosis, a significantly higher proportion than in probands with FBN1 variants. Moreover, this group had a higher incidence of aortic dissection (71.4%) as the first event than the group with FBN1 variants (41.9%) and a lower rate of prophylactic aortic surgery (17.9%) than the group with FBN1 variants (45.0%). These results reflect the fact that suspecting familial thoracic aortic dissection and aneurysm before an event in a proband is quite challenging; therefore, genetic testing would rarely be considered. A family history of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection might be the only clue before the onset of aortic dissection. A family history in "2 or more" relatives was defined as HTAD. However, only 9% of probands met that criterion in this study. Approximately 40% meet the criterion of "1 or more" relatives with the disease. Therefore, "1 or more", especially for patients with earlier onset, might be reasonable for screening for this disease. Despite the small population size, the affected lesions and clinical course were similar to those in patients with FBN1 variants. Previous studies with larger populations having ACTA2 variants suggested that the lifelong cumulative risk of aortic events and long‐term mortality might be equivalent to that in patients with MFS, or LDS. As clinical evidence is still limited, treatment strategies for patients with MFS might have to be implemented until more evidence has been established.

Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm without a known pathogenic variant — supportive thresholds for prophylactic surgery: The GenTAC study found a higher risk of dissection, with most dissection patients not having met the size criteria for prophylactic surgery, and it is useful to determine the size at which the aorta dissected or elective aortic surgery was performed and the age at the event; it is appropriate to offer aortic repair based on the family member's aortic size at dissection or elective surgery. In patients with a family history of TAAs and no known pathogenic variant, the GenTAC study noted that a large proportion had not met the 5.5-cm threshold for elective repair at dissection, and prophylactic surgery is warranted when the maximal diameter of the aortic root or ascending aorta reaches ≥ 5.0 cm. For patients with a family history of aortic dissection at a known maximal aortic root or ascending aortic diameter < 5.0 cm and no known variant, it is reasonable to perform prophylactic aortic repair at a maximal aortic diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm; relatives whose aortic dissection or unexplained sudden death occurred at an age ≤ 50 years indicate increased risk at ages ≤ 50 years as well.

### Clinical implications of identifying pathogenic variants in individuals with thoracic aortic dissection [^4a326f06]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Thoracic aortic dissection is an emergent life-threatening condition. Routine screening for genetic variants causing thoracic aortic dissection is not currently performed for patients or family members.

Methods

We performed whole exome sequencing of 240 patients with thoracic aortic dissection (n = 235) or rupture (n = 5) and 258 controls matched for age, sex, and ancestry. Blinded to case-control status, we annotated variants in 11 genes for pathogenicity.

Results

Twenty-four pathogenic variants in 6 genes (COL3A1, FBN1, LOX, PRKG1, SMAD3, and TGFBR2) were identified in 26 individuals, representing 10.8% of aortic cases and 0% of controls. Among dissection cases, we compared those with pathogenic variants to those without and found that pathogenic variant carriers had significantly earlier onset of dissection (41 versus 57 years), higher rates of root aneurysm (54% versus 30%), less hypertension (15% versus 57%), lower rates of smoking (19% versus 45%), and greater incidence of aortic disease in family members. Multivariable logistic regression showed that pathogenic variant carrier status was significantly associated with age < 50 (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% CI, 1.6–19.7), no history of hypertension (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.4–22.3), and family history of aortic disease (mother: OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.4–22.3, siblings: OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.1–23.9, children: OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.4–26.7).

Conclusions

Clinical genetic testing of known hereditary thoracic aortic dissection genes should be considered in patients with a thoracic aortic dissection, followed by cascade screening of family members, especially in patients with age-of-onset < 50 years, family history of thoracic aortic disease, and no history of hypertension.

### Preventing acute aortic dissections: the power of familial screening and risk assessment [^32ebd2dc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The natural history of aortic aneurysms involving the root and/or ascending aorta is to progressively and asymptomatically enlarge over time. If aneurysms are not diagnosed, progressive growth over time often leads to an acute type A dissection that requires emergent surgical repair or results in sudden death. However, if at‐risk individuals are identified before dissections occur, ascending aortic aneurysms can be repaired to prevent dissection‐related mortalities. In patients with heritable thoracic aortic conditions like Marfan syndrome, timely diagnosis has proven effective in reducing the prevalence of acute aortic dissection by enabling tailored medical management and surgical intervention. However, the optimal strategy for identifying individuals in the general population with increased risk of thoracic aortic disease (TAD) remains a challenge.

Approaches to stratifying TAD risk have rapidly evolved over the past few decades, particularly as molecular genetic testing has become more widely available, but phenotypic evaluation and pedigree analysis continue to be very effective tools for identifying at‐risk individuals. Since the 1950s, we have known that pathogenic variants in a single gene (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, a condition associated with highly penetrant and early‐onset TAD. Families with syndromic diseases that predispose to TAD such as Marfan syndrome, Loeys‐Dietz syndrome and vascular Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome originally came to attention because of external physical features permitting identification of at‐risk individuals to prevent dissections and improve clinical outcomes. However, many individuals with pathogenic variants in genes associated with Marfan syndrome and Loeys‐Dietz syndrome do not present with obvious syndromic features, emphasizing the importance of molecular genetic testing to confirm diagnosis.

### A highly penetrant ACTA2 mutation of thoracic aortic disease [^24d0d2ba]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The ACTA2 gene codes for a smooth muscle-specific isoform of α-actin and is involved in smooth muscle contraction. Mutations in this gene are the most frequently encountered non-syndromic cause of familial thoracic aortic disease, and estimated to encompass 14% of those with this disease. A variety of ACTA2 mutations have been characterized as pathogenic. The overall penetrance of an aortic event with any ACTA2 mutation was observed to be 48%, with an estimated 75% risk of aortic event by 85 years of age. The specific R118Q missense mutation identified in this family is estimated to comprise about 5% of all ACTA2 mutations with an estimated 76% lifetime risk of aortic event by 85 years of age. Although published estimates of risk profiles for specific variants are hindered by small patient cohort sizes, R118Q is also estimated to confer a lower risk of aortic event than other characterized mutations (i.e. R179). Though we do not have genetic testing for 2/4 family members who passed away from dissection, in this family we observed a 100% penetrance of aortic events in family members > 50 years of age. This suggests a higher risk and age dependent penetrance with this variant than previously estimated (Additional file 1).

In the current era of excellent outcomes in elective aortic surgery, we advocate an aggressive approach to elective repair in patients at elevated risk for aortic events. We further advocate strict aortic surveillance in patients with this and other high-risk genetic variants. The decision for repair should account for family history (including age of dissection of other family members), patient preferences, and concomitant cardiovascular pathology. Threshold aneurysm diameter for repair in these patients remains controversial but repair at diameters ≥ 4.0–4.5 cm should be strongly considered in otherwise healthy patients with a strong family history of dissection. At our experienced center we advocate replacement at 4.5 cm in patients with an ACTA2 mutation and a strong family history of dissection. As these disorders become increasingly recognized and families followed with imaging surveillance with elective aneurysmal repair when indicated, we hope for a reduction in morbidity and mortality in these families, We also advocate for strict surveillance and genetic testing in all patients with a family history of aortic dissection.

### Inherited thoracic aortic disease: new insights and translational targets [^3e2cba0d]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The Need to Improve Detection and Management of Inherited Thoracic Aortopathy

Inherited thoracic aortopathies denote conditions in which abnormalities lead to thoracic aortic wall weakness or abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles, predisposing patients to aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, and acute aortic complications. Degradation of the components of the thoracic aortic wall can also occur as part of acquired processes, for example, associated with aging or high blood pressure, factors that potentially compound genetically influenced thoracic aortic wall weakness. Patients with inherited aortopathy are at substantially increased risk of acute aortic complications, including aortic dissection or rupture, carrying with it major mortality risk. Because the outcomes from elective surgery are superior to those associated with emergency repair once dissection has occurred, current international guidelines advocate a focus on recognizing those at risk early, regular monitoring with imaging, and prophylactically replacing the diseased aortic segment once a threshold diameter is reached (Table 1). – Even with these guidelines and robust monitoring, many patients with inherited thoracic aortopathy still experience aortic dissection or rupture while still below the threshold diameter, whereas others may undergo surgery for thoracic aortic aneurysms that are unlikely to dissect or rupture. There is therefore universal agreement that better identification and risk stratification of thoracic aortopathy are urgently required. Indeed, a substantial body of research has been dedicated to exploring and developing novel solutions to this problem. This review summarizes the epidemiology and underlying pathological processes associated with inherited aortopathy, outlines current management strategies, and examines the evidence supporting promising therapeutic targets and emerging biomarkers for these high-risk aortopathies.

### Evaluating the feasibility of screening relatives of patients affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases: the REST study [^d47eb2a0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study demonstrated the feasibility of cascade screening for relatives of probands affected by nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases. Although the uptake was only 34%, the detection of clinical aortopathy rate was significant, with 24% of screened relatives demonstrating a potential phenotype disease on imaging. The cascade testing identified 61% of relatives requiring further management, including surveillance, clinical genetics, surgery, or secondary prevention.

The major strength of the study was the inclusion of comprehensive clinical, imaging, and genetic testing, in an unselected cohort of probands with NS‐TAD and their relatives. To our knowledge this is the first study to have included both sporadic and familial NS‐TAD forms. Participants in the familial group were shorter with lower body mass index and had higher blood pressure readings despite similar levels of treatment for hypertension. Genetic testing did not detect any clinically actionable results (besides the necessity to rephenotype 3 participants to confirm the lack of clinical signs of syndromic conditions) but this is likely to be because of the sample size in the study. The frequency of positive imaging tests was comparable in both familial and sporadic forms, highlighting the potential benefits of routine cascade screening in the often‐overlooked sporadic group.

Nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease (nsHTAD) without identified genetic cause — surgical timing: In asymptomatic patients with aneurysms of the aortic root or ascending aorta, determining the timing of surgical repair requires shared decision-making and is informed by known aortic diameters at the time of aortic dissection, thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) repair, or both in affected family members. In asymptomatic patients with nsHTAD and no identified genetic cause but no information on aortic diameters at the time of dissection or aneurysm repair in affected family members and who have no high-risk features for adverse aortic events, it is recommended to repair the aorta when the maximal diameter reaches ≥ 5.0 cm. In patients with nsHTAD and no identified genetic cause and a maximal aortic diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm who have high-risk features for adverse aortic events or who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications, aortic repair is reasonable when performed by experienced surgeons in a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Marfan syndrome — aortic imaging in unoperated patients: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is generally the initial imaging tool, and at the time of initial diagnosis additional computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally recommended to confirm TTE measurements and document distal segments; some patients have suboptimal TTE images and require serial CT or MRI to monitor aortic diameter. For follow-up of aortic root enlargement, follow-up imaging in 6 months is recommended; if at that time the aortic diameter remains stable, is < 45 mm, and there is no family or personal history of aortic dissection, then annual aortic imaging is reasonable, whereas patients who do not meet these criteria should undergo repeat aortic imaging every 6 months. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used for serial imaging follow-up when correlation between TTE and CT/MRI dimensions has been documented, and patients without enlargement until adulthood can be referred for transthoracic echocardiographic screening at 2 to 3 year intervals; repeat CT or MRI is suggested at least every 3 years to reassess the aortic arch and descending segments, and the descending thoracic aortic dilatation was not noted on TTE in the illustrative figure.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening recommendations include: In men who are ≥ 65 years of age who have ever smoked, ultrasound screening for detection of AAA is recommended. In men or women who are ≥ 65 years of age and who are first-degree relatives of patients with AAA, ultrasound screening for detection of AAA is recommended. In women who are ≥ 65 years of age who have ever smoked, ultrasound screening for detection of AAA is reasonable. In men or women < 65 years of age and who have multiple risk factors (Table 15) or a first-degree relative with AAA, ultrasound screening for AAA may be considered. In asymptomatic men or women > 75 years who have had a negative initial ultrasound screen, repeat screening for detection of AAA is not recommended.
