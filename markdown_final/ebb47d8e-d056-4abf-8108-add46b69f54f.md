## Question

Does family history of PCKD mean patient needs MRI screen for cerebral aneurysm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with a family history of polycystic kidney disease should undergo MRI screening for cerebral aneurysm, and if so, under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the family history implies autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and how that affects intracranial aneurysm risk. Then, I should verify how a family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage modifies that risk. Next, I will review major guideline positions to determine who should be offered screening and with which modality. After that, I need to consider age, comorbidities, and special populations like children. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and counseling points, including what to do if an aneurysm is found and how often to repeat imaging if the initial study is negative.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. A family history of polycystic kidney disease typically implies autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, which carries an increased risk of intracranial aneurysm compared with the general population, with estimates around 8–12% overall and higher when there is a family history of aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage, so I should not jump to conclusions about universal screening without stratifying by familial neurovascular history [^113DaW7g] [^111VpzeE].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk enhancement with a neurovascular family history. Multiple cohorts and meta-analyses show that among patients with ADPKD, a positive family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage roughly doubles the odds of harboring an unruptured aneurysm, with absolute prevalences reaching approximately 16–23% in that subgroup, which meaningfully shifts the pretest probability and the potential yield of screening [^111SrNvB] [^111UgTUm] [^113DaW7g].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to anchor the recommendation. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association advises offering noninvasive aneurysm screening with CTA or MRA in patients with ADPKD, particularly when there is a family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is a Class I recommendation with Level B evidence, so I need to ensure I frame this as a strong, evidence-based offer rather than a casual suggestion [^114N1RA1] [^114UBcft]. KDIGO 2020 similarly recommends considering screening for intracranial aneurysm in ADPKD patients at high risk due to prior history or a family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, reinforcing a targeted rather than universal approach [^117GezDR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal screening. I initially thought some European statements endorsed screening all ADPKD patients, but wait, I should double-check that nuance. The European ADPKD forum notes that while some authors argue screening is cost-effective, systematic screening for all is not broadly recommended, and most guidance favors a selective approach focused on those with additional risk factors such as a positive family history, older age, or high-risk professions, which aligns better with the AHA/ASA and KDIGO positions [^117Fdm7P]. I should also note that a cost-effectiveness analysis suggested potential utility of broader screening, but that single-center signal has not overturned the prevailing consensus for targeted screening in guidelines [^117TJttV].

> I need to check age-related considerations and modality. For adults with ADPKD and a positive family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage, screening with MRA or CTA is appropriate, with MRA generally preferred to avoid radiation when feasible; some centers pragmatically consider screening from around age 30 onward, but the strongest guideline anchor is the presence of the family history rather than a fixed age threshold, so I should individualize based on risk tolerance and comorbidities [^114N1RA1] [^113DaW7g]. Let me reconsider pediatric implications: routine screening is not recommended in children with ADPKD, even with a family history, given the extreme rarity of rupture in childhood and the lack of outcome data, though an individualized approach may be considered in exceptional circumstances after counseling [^113SNqen] [^115PgwDh].

> Next, I should review what to do if an aneurysm is detected. Small aneurysms, particularly under about 7 mm in the anterior circulation, often warrant surveillance rather than immediate intervention, with interval imaging typically at 6–12 months initially and extended if stable, while treatment decisions should incorporate size, location, morphology, age, and comorbidities using validated risk tools like PHASES, and I should confirm that patients with ADPKD do not appear to have inherently higher rupture rates than sporadic cases, which supports a measured, risk-stratified approach [^113JNhyz] [^113DaW7g] [^111EddEp]. But wait, what if the initial screen is negative? Prospective data suggest a low rate of de novo aneurysm formation over approximately 10 years, so repeating imaging at 5–10 year intervals is reasonable in higher-risk patients, whereas those at lower baseline risk may not require routine repeat imaging [^112yfXgq].

> I should confirm counseling points before ordering the test. Patients need to understand that screening can detect additional incidental intracranial findings in a meaningful minority, which may prompt follow-up or interventions and can affect anxiety and quality of life, so shared decision-making and pretest counseling are essential parts of the process [^115jGVT4] [^1165SWAt]. I need to ensure we also discuss lifestyle risk modification, especially strict blood pressure control and smoking cessation, because these modify aneurysm formation and rupture risk even when genetic predisposition exists [^113DaW7g].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is as follows. Yes, MRI screening for cerebral aneurysm should be offered to a patient with a family history of polycystic kidney disease when that family history also includes at least one first-degree relative with an intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage, using MRA or CTA depending on availability and patient factors, and this aligns with Class I AHA/ASA guidance and KDIGO's high-risk stance; if no such neurovascular family history exists, routine screening is not mandated, though some clinicians may discuss selective screening in older adults with additional risk factors after counseling about benefits, uncertainties, and incidental findings [^114N1RA1] [^117GezDR] [^113DaW7g].

Patients with a family history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have a **higher risk of intracranial aneurysms** [^113DaW7g] and should be considered for MRI screening, especially if there is a family history of aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [^111SrNvB]. The AHA/ASA recommends screening with MRA or CTA for ADPKD patients with a family history of aneurysm or SAH [^114N1RA1], as their risk is 2–4 times higher than the general population [^111UgTUm]. Routine screening is not advised for all ADPKD patients without such family history, but individualized decisions may be made based on age, hypertension, smoking, and patient preference [^117Fdm7P]. MRI/MRA is preferred for its safety and noninvasiveness, and positive findings should prompt neurosurgical referral for management [^113DaW7g].

---

## Risk of intracranial aneurysms in PKD

- **Prevalence**: Intracranial aneurysms occur in ~8–12% of ADPKD patients, higher than the general population (~3%) [^113DaW7g] [^111SrNvB].
- **Familial risk**: Family history of aneurysm or SAH increases ADPKD risk to ~16–23% [^111UgTUm] [^111SrNvB].
- **Rupture risk**: ADPKD patients have earlier rupture and higher morbidity/mortality than sporadic cases [^112yfXgq].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

- **AHA/ASA**: Screen ADPKD patients with family history of aneurysm or SAH using MRA or CTA [^114N1RA1] [^111UgTUm].
- **KDIGO**: Consider screening only in high-risk ADPKD patients with family history of SAH or aneurysm [^117GezDR].
- **ESO**: Do not screen with only one affected first-degree relative [^113MWenA].

---

## Evidence supporting MRI screening

MRI/MRA is **noninvasive, avoids radiation, and detects aneurysms ≥ 3 mm**. Screening detects aneurysms in ~9% of ADPKD patients, more with family history [^112RqGDe] [^115Vv4Kw]. Early detection enables timely intervention and reduces rupture risk [^117TJttV].

---

## Limitations and considerations

False positives/negatives can occur; small aneurysms may be missed, and incidental findings can cause anxiety [^112CzbEn]. Psychological impact from **anxiety and stress** is common with positive or incidental findings [^notfound]. Cost-effectiveness is debated; targeted screening of high-risk patients is generally favored [^114UBcft].

---

## Clinical approach and recommendations

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate family history of aneurysm/SAH, hypertension, smoking, age, and patient preference [^111SrNvB].
- **Screening modality**: Use MRI/MRA for noninvasive, radiation-free imaging [^112CzbEn].
- **Follow-up**: If aneurysms are found, refer for neurosurgical evaluation and management [^117ACbUn].
- **Counseling**: Discuss risks, benefits, and potential outcomes before screening [^1165SWAt].

---

Patients with a family history of PKD have an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms; **targeted MRI screening is reasonable** for those with a family history of aneurysm or SAH, while routine screening is not advised for all ADPKD patients without such history.

### Should patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease be screened for cerebral aneurysms? [^1178WQqy]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder affecting 1 in 1000 people worldwide and is associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms. It remains unclear whether there is sufficient net benefit to screening this patient population for IA, considering recent developments in imaging and treatment and our evolving understanding of the natural history of unruptured aneurysms. There is currently no standardized screening protocol for IA in patients with ADPCKD. Our review of the literature focused on the above issues and presents our appraisal of the estimated value of screening for IA in the setting of ADPCKD.

### Screening for intracranial aneurysms in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is cost-effective [^117TJttV]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Intracranial aneurysm rupture is a dramatic complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). It remains uncertain whether screening should be widespread or only target patients with risk factors (personal or familial history of intracranial aneurysm), with an at-risk profession, or those who request screening. We evaluated this in a single-center cohort of 495 consecutive patients with ADPKD submitted to targeted intracranial aneurysm screening. Cerebral magnetic resonance angiography was proposed to 110 patients with a familial history of intracranial aneurysm (group 1), whereas it was not our intention to propose it to 385 patients without familial risk (group 2). Magnetic resonance angiography results, intracranial aneurysm prophylactic repair, rupture events, and cost-effectiveness of intracranial aneurysm screening strategies were retrospectively analyzed. During a median follow up of 5.9 years, five non-fatal intracranial aneurysm ruptures occurred (incidence rate 2.0 (0.87–4.6)/1000 patients-year). In group 1, 90% of patients were screened and an intracranial aneurysm was detected in 14, treated preventively in five, and ruptured in one patient despite surveillance. In group 2, 21% of patients were screened and an intracranial aneurysm was detected in five, and treated preventively in one. Intracranial aneurysm rupture occurred in four patients in group 2. Systematic screening was deemed cost-effective and provides a gain of 0.68 quality-adjusted life years compared to targeted screening. Thus, the intracranial aneurysm rupture rate is high in ADPKD despite targeted screening, and involves mostly patients without familial risk factors. Hence, cost-utility analysis suggests that intracranial aneurysm screening could be proposed to all ADPKD patients.

### Risk factors for unruptured intracranial aneurysms in asymptomatic patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: who needs screening? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SrNvB]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have been identified to have a significantly increased risk of developing intracranial aneurysms (IAs). These patients are diagnosed at younger ages and are also at increased risk for IA rupture. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify risk factors associated with IA detection during screening of asymptomatic ADPKD patients.

Methods

The authors searched for studies reporting the prevalence of IA among patients with ADPKD screened using MRA, CTA, or DSA on PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov prior to August 2023 by using individualized standardized search strategies. Eligibility of all retrieved studies was assessed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Risk of bias of the included observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.

Results

Twenty-four observational studies involving 5907 patients with ADPKD were identified for quantitative analysis. The authors observed an overall prevalence of IA of 12.6%. They identified several risk factors for IA with statistically significantly increased odds for unruptured IA (UIA) detection, including female sex (18 studies, OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.37–1.94, I² = 0%), family history of either IA or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (12 studies, OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.68–2.81, I² = 0%), family history of SAH (3 studies, OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.25–5.71, I² = 66.0%), stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease (CKD) (4 studies, OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.84–3.54, I² = 0%), and hypertension (13 studies, OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04–1.91, I² = 34%). Age > 45 years, family history of ADPKD, smoking status, and presence of liver cysts did not reach statistical significance as risk factors during this meta-analysis.

Conclusions

The results of the authors' meta-analysis suggest increased risk of UIA detection in screening of ADPKD patients who are female, have a family history of IA or SAH, have hypertension, or have moderate or more severe CKD. Given the increased prevalence of IA in ADPKD patients with these risk factors, these patients may stand to benefit from screening for IA early in treatment or at time of diagnosis, even if neurologically asymptomatic.

### Clinical practice guideline monitoring children and young people with, or at risk of developing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^115yiY6g]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The guideline committee was not able to make a recommendation on MR imaging in CYP with ADPKD or at risk of ADPKD. No relevant studies examining whether neurological imaging in CYP with ADPKD and a family history of intracranial events is associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity compared with those who do not have neurological imaging, were identified. Three individual case reports of people under 18 years with ADPKD with intracranial events were found but did not meet inclusion criteria.

No consensus was achieved in 2 rounds of the Delphi survey; 61% of panellists agreed with the statement 'Intracranial Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging should be offered to CYP with ADPKD with a family history of intracranial aneurysm or sub-arachnoid haemorrhage' (round 1), whilst 41% agreed with the statement 'Intracranial Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging should not routinely be offered to CYP with ADPKD even with a family history of intracranial aneurysm or sub-arachnoid haemorrhage' (round 2). The lack of published data around screening in CYP < 18y was acknowledged and concern was noted with regard to thresholds for neurosurgical intervention if intracranial aneurysms were identified in CYP as a result of such testing.

A systematic review by Vlak et al. estimated an overall prevalence of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (ICA) of 3.2% in a population without comorbidity. They calculated a prevalence ratio (PR) of 6.9 (95%CI 3.5–14) in patients with ADPKD compared to the population without comorbidity. Further analysis showed that the PR for patients with ADPKD and a family history of SAH or UIA was 2.0 (95%CI 0.5–7.4) compared with patients with ADPKD but no family history of SAH or UIA. The committee agreed that studies assessing the prevalence of SAH and ICA in CYP < 18y with ADPKD should be undertaken prior to making recommendations in this area.

### Additional relevant intracranial findings in persons screened with MR for intracranial aneurysms [^115jGVT4]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Radiological screening for intracranial aneurysms (IAs) may identify other relevant intracranial findings. We investigated their prevalence on MR in persons screened for IAs.

Methods

We included all persons who were screened for the presence of IAs with brain MRI/MRA between 1996 and 2022 because of a family history of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We reviewed radiology reports of initial and repeated brain MR to identify additional intracranial findings that needed follow-up or treatment, or carried a risk of becoming symptomatic.

Results

We included 766 persons (positive family history of aSAH: n = 681; ADPKD: n = 85) who had 1446 MRI/MRAs. At initial screening, 49 additional relevant intracranial findings were reported in 47 persons (6.1%, 95% CI 4.7–8.1%). Of all included persons, 338 (44%) underwent one (n = 154) or more (n = 184) follow-up screenings (total MRI/MRAs at follow-up: n = 680). In 15/338 persons (4.4%, 95% CI 2.7–7.2%), 16 new additional relevant findings were reported at a median follow-up duration of 10 years (IQR 5–12).

Conclusions

Persons who are counselled for screening for IAs should be informed that there is a six percent chance of identifying an additional finding that requires follow-up or treatment, or may become symptomatic. Additionally, after 10-year follow-up screening there is a four percent chance of identifying a new additional relevant finding. The impact of such findings on quality of life needs further study.

Screening — familial and genetic risk groups — Patients with ≥ 2 family members with intracranial aneurysm (IA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) should be offered aneurysmal screening by computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and high-risk familial features include hypertension, smoking, and female sex (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, particularly with a family history of IA, should be offered screening by CTA or MRA (Class I; Level of Evidence B), and it is reasonable to offer CTA or MRA to patients with coarctation of the aorta and microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B).

### Clinical practice guideline monitoring children and young people with, or at risk of developing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^113GhDwh]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale for research recommendations

Research recommendation 1: In children and young people with ADPKD does regular (e.g. yearly or every 2 years) urine albumin: creatinine monitoring and treatment improve outcome?

Rationale

The guideline committee was not able to make a recommendation on monitoring of urine albumin: creatinine in CYP with ADPKD or at risk of ADPKD. No relevant studies assessing outcomes in CYP with proteinuria were identified and no consensus was achieved in 2 rounds of the Delphi survey; only 41% of panellists agreed with the statement 'Urine protein estimation (best assessed at urine albumin:creatinine) should be offered at least every 2 years to children and young people with confirmed ADPKD commencing at 5 years of age'. The prevalence of proteinuria in CYP with ADPKD has been reported to be as high as 20%, however, a number of studies have failed to show a relationship between hypertension and proteinuria in children with ADPKD. In adults with ADPKD, established proteinuria and microalbuminuria are reported to be associated with increased mean arterial pressure and more severe renal cystic involvement.

Research recommendation 2: In children and young people with ADPKD what is a) the incidence of sub-arachnoid haemorrhage and b) the prevalence of intracranial aneurysm?

Research recommendation 3: In adults, children and young people with ADPKD with a family history of intracranial aneurysm or sub-arachnoid haemorrhage does Intracranial Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging reduce the risk of intracranial events?

### Guidelines for the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112CzbEn]. Stroke (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for unruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA) — the decision to screen by noninvasive computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) depends on the patient under consideration, and clinicians should consider aneurysmal prevalence associated with a given trait, projected disease morbidity, accessibility of a cost-effective screening test, the likely availability of an acceptably low-risk and effective treatment, and the patients' understanding of the potential implications of detecting an intracranial finding on imaging as well as the stress and anxiety that can be associated with UA detection. Screening for unruptured aneurysms is appropriate in families with > 1 affected person with an IA; in patients with a family history of IA and evidence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, type IV Ehlers-Danlos (vascular subtype), or the extremely rare microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism; and in those with selected conditions associated with an increased occurrence of IAs, such as coarctation of the aorta or bicuspid aortic valve.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111UgTUm]. Stroke (2015). Medium credibility.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysm — populations at increased risk and targeted screening: Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease without a family history of intracranial aneurysm (IA) or hemorrhagic stroke have a reported 6% to 11% risk of harboring an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) compared with 16% to 23% among those with a family history, and in the latter group noninvasive screening should be strongly considered. First-degree relatives of patients with type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome should also be strongly considered for screening, and in microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism 13 of the patients (52%) had cerebral neurovascular abnormalities. Among patients with coarctation who were ≥ 16 years screened with brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), 10.3% had a UIA, and screening for UIA in these latter two groups is also appropriate. Population studies show that 9% to 14% of patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have a first-degree relative with SAH, and it is in these families that screening for UIA should be most strongly considered. An American Heart Association guideline regarding management of SAH suggested that it might be reasonable to offer noninvasive screening to first-degree relatives of those with SAH, but the risks and benefits are uncertain.

### Presymptomatic screening for intracranial aneurysms in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^112RqGDe]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Intracranial aneurysm rupture is the most devastating complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Whether selective or widespread intracranial aneurysm screening is indicated remains controversial.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

Records of 3010 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease evaluated at the Mayo Clinic between 1989 and 2017 were reviewed. Those who had presymptomatic magnetic resonance angiography screening were included.

Results

Ninety-four intracranial aneurysms were diagnosed in 75 of 812 (9%) patients who underwent magnetic resonance angiography screening. Sex, age, race, and genotype were similar in the groups with and without aneurysms; hypertension and history of smoking were more frequent in the aneurysm group. Twenty-nine percent of patients with aneurysms compared with 11% of those without aneurysms had a family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (P < 0.001). Most aneurysms were small (median diameter = 4 mm; range, 2–12 mm); 85% were in the anterior circulation. During a total imaging follow-up of 469 patient-years, de novo intracranial aneurysms were detected in five patients; eight intracranial aneurysms grew (median = 2 mm; range, 1–3 mm). During a total clinical follow-up of 668 patient-years, seven patients had preemptive clipping or coil embolization; no intracranial aneurysms ruptured. During a total clinical follow-up of 4783 patient-years in 737 patients with no intracranial aneurysm detected on the first magnetic resonance angiography screening, two patients had an intracranial aneurysm rupture (0.04 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval, 0 to 0.10). The rate of intracranial aneurysm rupture in large clinical trials of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was 0.04 per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.06).

Conclusions

Intracranial aneurysms were detected by presymptomatic screening in 9% of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, more frequently in those with familial history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypertension, or smoking. None of the patients with and two of the patients without aneurysm detection on screening suffered aneurysmal ruptures. The overall rupture rate in our autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease cohort was approximately five times higher than that in the general population.

### Intracranial aneurysm screening: indications and advice for practice [^115TZ72m]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

The advent of non-invasive methods of imaging intracranial blood vessels has facilitated screening for intracranial aneurysms in people who are at risk. A strong risk factor for intracranial aneurysm, which causes subarachnoid haemorrhage, is a positive family history, defined as two or more first-degree relatives with subarachnoid haemorrhages (relative risk [RR] = 6.6). The greatest familial risk is associated with an affected sibling. Another strong risk factor is polycystic kidney disease (RR = 4.4). People who have these risk factors are potential candidates for screening. Even if screening does not find abnormality, there is a high risk of new aneurysms 5 years later. Repeated screening might be done, although the optimum interval between screening assessments and the duration of repeated screening is unclear. Patients who have survived a subarachnoid haemorrhage are at increased risk of another from a newly developed aneurysm, but whether screening is beneficial in such patients is not clear. Most occurrences of subarachnoid haemorrhage in the general population are related to the more common risk factors of hypertension (RR = 2.8) and smoking (RR = 1.9). Therefore, screening of individuals who have a family history of subarachnoid haemorrhage or polycystic kidney disease will have little effect on the incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage in the general population. When patients present for screening, the construction of a family tree and discussion of the history of relatives with stroke can be revealing. Before referring a patient for non-invasive imaging of the circle of Willis, the physician should discuss the risks and benefits of screening, the implications for holding a licence to drive or fly and for life insurance, and whether or not the patient wants to be informed about other incidental findings.

### Intracranial aneurysms: current evidence and clinical practice [^117ACbUn]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysms occur in up to 6 percent of the general population. Most persons with these aneurysms remain asymptomatic and are usually unaware of their presence. Risk factors for the formation of aneurysms include a family history of aneurysm, various inherited disorders, age greater than 50 years, female gender, current cigarette smoking, and cocaine use. Because of the morbidity and mortality associated with surgical intervention, screening for aneurysms remains controversial. Two groups of patients may benefit from early detection: those with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and those with a history of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. These patients should undergo magnetic resonance angiography, followed by neurosurgical referral if an aneurysm is detected. Screening of patients who have two or more family members with intracranial aneurysms is controversial. Screening of patients who have one first-degree relative with an aneurysm does not appear to be beneficial.

### Vascular complications in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: perspectives, paradigms, and current state of play [^111VpzeE]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading cause of inherited kidney disease with significant contributions to CKD and end-stage kidney disease. The underlying polycystin proteins (PC1 and PC2) have widespread tissue expression and complex functional roles making ADPKD a systemic disease. Vascular complications, particularly intracranial aneurysms (ICA) are the most feared due to their potential for devastating neurological complications and sudden death. Intracranial aneurysms occur in 8–12% of all patients with ADPKD, but the risk is intensified 4–5-fold in those with a positive family history. The basis for this genetic risk is not well understood and could conceivably be due to features of the germline mutation with a significant contribution of other genetic modifiers and/or environmental factors. Here we review what is known about the natural history and genetics of unruptured ICA in ADPKD including the prevalence and risk factors for aneurysm formation and subarachnoid hemorrhage. We discuss two alternative screening strategies and recommend a practical algorithm that targets those at highest risk for ICA with a positive family history for screening.

Controlling the risk factors of stroke

Genetic factors

Recommendations

Inquiring a family history can help identify individuals at increased risk of stroke (class IIa; level of evidence A).
For patients with rare genetic causes of stroke (such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, Fabry disease, COL4A1-related intracerebral haemorrhage, autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos type IV), referral for genetic counselling may be considered (Class IIb; level of evidence C). In general population routine genetic screening for the prevention of a first stroke is not recommended (class III; level of evidence C).
For patients with ≥ 2 first-degree relatives with SAH or intracranial aneurysms, non-invasive screening such as CT Angiography (CTA) or MR Angiography (MRA) of brain for detecting any unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) may be reasonable (class IIb; level of evidence C).
For patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, ≥ 1 relatives with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or ≥ 1 relatives with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease and intracranial aneurysms, non-invasive screening such as CTA or MRA of brain for detecting any UIAs may be considered (class IIb; level of evidence C).
For patients with (cervical) fibromuscular dysplasia, non-invasive screening such as CTA or MRA brain for detecting any UIAs may be considered (class IIb; level of evidence C).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to screening for other vascular abnormalities, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain screening for aortic aneurysms in patients with ADPKD and their first-degree relatives with a family history of aortic root or thoracic aortic aneurysms.

### Intracranial aneurysms and dolichoectasia in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^116me1K7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Intracranial saccular aneurysms (ICA) are a known extrarenal manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In order to facilitate the definition of subgroups who are at risk for ICA and to determine the prevalence of ICA in these subgroups we studied ADPKD patients with a positive family history for a cerebral event, including cerebral stroke (group I) and intracranial bleeding or known ICA (group II).

Methods

Within an enrolment period of 21 months, 43 ADPKD patients from our outpatient clinic and hospital were examined with cerebral magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).

Results

ICA were detected in six patients (14%). Three out of 32 patients (9.4%) in group I and three out of 11 patients (27.3%) in group II had an ICA. A dolichoectasia of intracerebral vessels was found in two out of 43 patients (4.7%).

Conclusions

Using MRA a high prevalence of ICA was shown only in patients with a family history of cerebral bleeding or ICA. A family history for cerebral stroke does not imply an elevated risk for ICA. However, dolichoectasia, rare in the normal population, was detected in two patients. We recommend screening for ICA in patients with a positive family history for cerebral bleeding or ICA. Because of potential complications, examiners should direct their attention to dolichoectasia in ADPKD patients.

SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS

A diagnosis of ADPKD can have important lifelong effects on patients, including psychosocial and financial consequences. The advantages and disadvantages of offering screening to a patient's family members should be carefully discussed. The offer of screening should be provided with appropriate counselling on the implications of a diagnosis for adults and children. Routine pre-symptomatic screening of ADPKD is not recommended for at-risk children, while it is usually thought that the benefits outweigh the risks in adults. Ultrasound imaging is recommended for parents of children or adolescents in whom ADPKD is suspected and who have no previous family history of ADPKD.

ADPKD is diagnosed in adults and children mainly by ultrasound imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Both can be used for prognostic assessment. Specialist consultation is recommended for paediatric patients with renal cysts, as genetic testing is often required to confirm the diagnosis when clinical findings are equivocal. A detailed examination and additional investigations should be performed to identify extra-renal manifestations if appropriate.

### Novel PKD1 mutation (C.G10086T) drives high intracranial aneurysm risk in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^113Y628G]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The identification of this high‐risk variant has important clinical implications. First, it supports the role of genetic testing in risk stratification for ADPKD patients. Second, it suggests the need for more intensive vascular screening in carriers of high‐risk PKD1 variants. Third, it provides potential molecular targets for developing targeted therapies. Recent advances in therapeutic approaches, including targeted oligonucleotides and precision medicine strategies, suggest promising directions for mutation‐specific treatments.

Several limitations of our study warrant discussion. First, the findings are based on a single family, necessitating validation in larger cohorts. Second, the long‐term natural history of IA development in mutation carriers remains to be determined. Third, the complete spectrum of vascular complications associated with this mutation requires further investigation.

Future research directions should include multicenter studies to validate the association between c.G10086T and IA risk, the development of targeted screening protocols for high‐risk variant carriers, and the investigation of potential therapeutic approaches based on the identified molecular mechanisms. Additionally, the exploration of potential protective factors in unaffected mutation carriers may provide insights into disease modification strategies.

In conclusion, the PKD1 :c.G10086T mutation represents a novel genetic risk factor for IA development in ADPKD. Our findings not only expand the spectrum of known PKD1 mutations but also provide new insights into the genetic basis of ADPKD‐associated vascular complications. This work supports the development of genotype‐based approaches to risk stratification and management in ADPKD.

### Screening for intracranial aneurysm in 355 patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease [^115Vv4Kw]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

the association of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with intracranial aneurysm (ICAN) is well known but little is known about the characteristics of ICAN in ADPKD. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of ICAN in ADPKD.

Methods

we screened 355 patients with ADPKD (mean age, 46.5 ± 13.2 years; range, 7 to 87 years) with 3-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography. Size, location, and morphology of aneurysms were assessed. The prevalence and characteristics of ICAN in patients with ADPKD were evaluated. Patients with ICAN found by MR angiography and moderate renal function subsequently were recommended to undergo digital subtraction angiography for comparison.

Results

the prevalence of ICAN in ADPKD was 12.4% (95% CI, 8.95% to 15.82%) with an equal gender distribution. The prevalence increased as age increased, reaching a peak value of 23.3% (95% CI, 16.85 to 29.75%) in the 60- to 69-year age group. The prevalence of ICAN in patients with ADPKD with a positive family history of hemorrhagic stroke or ICAN was higher than patients with ADPKD lacking such family history (relative risk, 1.968; 95% CI, 1.57 to 2.67). The mean diameter of ICAN was 3.85 ± 3.25 mm. The most frequent site of ICAN was the internal carotid artery. The result of digital subtraction angiography of 15 patients with 18 ICANs and moderate renal function corresponded to the detection of MR angiography.

Conclusions

the characteristics of ICAN in patients with ADPKD were different from some previous reports. Systematic screening of ICAN with 3-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography is recommended for patients with ADPKD, particularly for adult patients (≧30 years) or patients with a positive family history of hemorrhagic stroke or ICAN.

### Vascular complications in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^113DaW7g]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease. Relentless cyst growth substantially enlarges both kidneys and culminates in renal failure. Patients with ADPKD also have vascular abnormalities; intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are found in ∼10% of asymptomatic patients during screening and in up to 25% of those with a family history of IA or subarachnoid haemorrhage. As the genes responsible for ADPKD — PKD1 and PKD2 — have complex integrative roles in mechanotransduction and intracellular calcium signalling, the molecular basis of IA formation might involve focal haemodynamic conditions exacerbated by hypertension and altered flow sensing. IA rupture results in substantial mortality, morbidity and poor long-term outcomes. In this Review, we focus mainly on strategies for screening, diagnosis and treatment of IAs in patients with ADPKD. Other vascular aneurysms and anomalies — including aneurysms of the aorta and coronary arteries, cervicocephalic and thoracic aortic dissections, aortic root dilatation and cerebral dolichoectasia — are less common in this population, and the available data are insufficient to recommend screening strategies. Treatment decisions should be made with expert consultation and be based on a risk-benefit analysis that takes into account aneurysm location and morphology as well as patient age and comorbidities.

### Number of affected relatives, age, smoking, and hypertension prediction score for intracranial aneurysms in persons with a family history for subarachnoid hemorrhage [^113tMfTY]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

We included all persons with 2 or more first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, or children) who had had a definite or probable aSAH. We also included persons with one first-degree relative with aSAH and another first-degree relative with an unruptured IA proven by CT-angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or digital subtraction angiography. Definite aSAH was defined as an abrupt onset of severe headache or loss of consciousness with or without focal neurological signs, the presence of subarachnoid blood on head CT compatible with a ruptured IA and an IA on CT-angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or digital subtraction angiography. Probable aSAH was defined as an episode suspected to be aSAH in a person younger than 70 years, such as stroke with a second ictus within 4 weeks followed by death. The standard screening modality was magnetic resonance angiography, and in case of contraindications, screening was performed by CT-angiography instead. Screening was usually performed from the age of 18 years until the age of ≈70 years, with the precise cutoff depending on the state of health of the screenees. Performed screening reflects clinical practice, and was not according to a study protocol. We excluded persons screened for IAs because of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The 660 persons included were selected from a total cohort of 935 persons screened between April 1993 up to April 2020. The main reasons for not including the remaining 275 persons were (1) relatives were not related in the first degree and did not have definite or probable aSAH (n = 207); (2) only one affected first-degree relative (n = 59); autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (n = 9). The outcome of interest was the presence of an IA at first screening.

Model Development

We obtained information about candidate predictors preselected based on the literature, which included age, sex, smoking, history of hypertension, history of previous aSAH, and number of affected family members with aSAH and IAs. – Smoking was defined as former or current smoking, and hypertension as a history of hypertension or use of antihypertensive drugs. The number of affected family members with aSAH or IAs was categorized into 2 affected relatives versus 3 or more affected relatives.

External Validation

For external validation of the model we used the Understanding the Pathophysiology of Intracranial Aneurysm (ICAN) prospective familial IA cohort consisting of 265 persons screened for IA because of familial aSAH in France between December 2012 and April 2019.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Study Design and Patient Recruitment

Between January 2017 and December 2022, we conducted a family‐based genetic study at the Department of Neurology, Second Affiliated Clinical College of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (Approval number: SPHFJP‐T2022004‐02) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

2.2 Clinical Assessment

Patients with ADPKD and IA were recruited from a single Han Chinese family between 2017 and 2022. The study, conducted across the Department of Neurology at the Second Affiliated Clinical College of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Department of Neurosurgery at the 900th Hospital of PLA Joint Logistics Team, comprehensively examined a four‐generation family cohort. Following initial screening, 21 participants were enrolled in the study, with 3 members excluded due to mortality. Of the 24 family members, 18 were blood relatives and 6 were spouses, with a detailed clinical and genetic investigation revealing the complex inheritance pattern of this rare genetic disorder. The onset imaging data for the proband II:7 and his second brother II:4 are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. A genetic map is shown in Figure 3 (see Supporting Information S1). Peripheral venous blood samples (4 mL) were collected from each participant and tissue samples from small blood vessels in the medial leg of the lower extremities were collected from the proband, the second brother, and a healthy control. These samples were stored at −80°C for centralized detection. Clinical evaluation included the following:
Detailed medical history and physical examination.
Laboratory tests (renal/liver function, blood count).
BrainCT, CTA, MRI, MRA, and Abdominal ultrasound Doppler.
Cardiovascular assessment.

### Impact of preexisting intracranial aneurysm on incidence and risk of de novo aneurysm formation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: an observational study [^111WPyu7]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) has an elevated prevalence of intracranial aneurysms compared to the general population. However, the risk of de novo aneurysm formation in these patients remains unclear, leading to a lack of consensus regarding whom and when to follow. Although the data from general population tend to be referred, this assumption needs caution because patients with ADPKD have different characteristics such as location tendency, aneurysm size at rupture, and gene mutation. Here, we investigate the incidence of de novo aneurysm in ADPKD patients to examine whether patients without intracranial aneurysms on initial imaging needs frequent follow-up. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study conducted in two ADPKD referral centers in Japan. Consecutive samples of 2,117 adult patients with ADPKD from April 2003 to October 2024 were eligible. Of these, 850 patients without baseline brain imaging and 555 patients without follow-up brain imaging were excluded, leaving 712 patients included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of intracranial aneurysm on the initial image. The primary outcome was the incidence of de novo aneurysm formation during follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate risk, adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, smoking history, and family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage or aneurysm. Results Of 712 patients, 181 had intracranial aneurysms on initial imaging (screening-positive) and 531 had none (screening-negative). The median age was 54 years (IQR, 45–62 years), and 398 (55.8%) were women. Over 4,580 person-years of follow-up, the overall incidence of de novo aneurysm formation was higher in the screening-positive group (1.2 per 100 person-years), than in the screening-negative group (0.26 per 100 person-years) (HR, 3.81; 95%CI, 1.50–9.67, p = 0.005). Conclusion ADPKD patients without preexisting aneurysms on initial imaging are at relatively low risk of developing de novo aneurysms. Our findings help to determine the adequate follow-up timing and its target in patients with ADPKD. However, caution is warranted in generalizing these results because the study population had a higher median age and more advanced kidney disease.

### Higher risk of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid haemorrhage in siblings of families with intracranial aneurysms [^114nn8CG]. European Stroke Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Study population

All individuals who are screened at the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht, The Netherlands, for intracranial aneurysms because of familial aSAH are recorded in a prospectively collected database. A positive family history was defined as two or more first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, or children) with aSAH or UIA. All patients with aSAH who were admitted or individuals with an UIA who visited the outpatient clinic at the UMC Utrecht were routinely asked for details about their family history. If aSAH occurred in their relatives, we suggested that they extend an invitation to their relatives to visit the outpatient clinic to be informed about screening for UIA. Individuals were also referred for screening by their general practitioner or neurologist. We retrieved all available information from the period from April 1994 to December 2016.

Data collection

Pedigrees were constructed based on the familial history of the probands or relatives who presented for screening in the UMC Utrecht. For the purpose of our study, the proband was defined as the relative with aSAH who was first brought under medical attention. aSAH must have been identified in a hospital. We obtained information about age, sex, and familial and personal history of UIA or aSAH of all relatives from the database. All UIA in first-degree relatives were identified by CT, MRI, or conventional angiogram in the UMC Utrecht. Screening was usually performed from the age of 18 years until the age of approximately 70 years, with the precise cutoff depending on their state of health. In case of a negative screen, people were advised to contact us after 5 years to repeat screening. Individuals were not actively invited for repeated screening. Performed screening reflects clinical practice and was not according to a study protocol. Consequently, screening intervals shorter and longer than the advised 5 years could occur. Only relatives screened for UIA in the UMC Utrecht were included. We excluded patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease. This study was approved by the institutional Research Ethics Board of the University Medical Center Utrecht.

### Risk of intracranial aneurysm bleeding in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease [^114XH5Nq]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) carry an increased risk of developing intracranial aneurysms. Bleeding from these sites is a significant complication with the events reported to cluster in some families. In this study we determined if individualized risk of aneurysm rupture can be estimated based on family history using a Bayesian random effects model. Previously reported data were used to define distributions and to construct a model that fit these data. Our results confirm that intracerebral aneurysm bleeding in ADPKD patients tends to cluster in families and that basic family history can provide a simple estimate of family-specific risk.

### Extended follow-up of unruptured intracranial aneurysms detected by presymptomatic screening in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^114mooFV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients have an increased risk for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). The importance of screening for unruptured IAs (UIAs) depends on their risks for growth and rupture.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

ADPKD patients with UIAs found by presymptomatic screening with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) during 1989 to 2009 were followed initially at 6 months and annually, and less frequently after demonstration of stability.

Results

Forty-five saccular aneurysms were detected in 38 patients from 36 families. Most were small (median diameter 3.5 mm) and in the anterior circulation (84%). Median age at diagnosis was 49 years. During cumulative imaging follow-up of 243 years, one de novo UIA was detected and increased in size from 2 to 4.4 mm over 144 months and two UIAs grew from 4.5 to 5.9 mm and 4.7 to 6.2 mm after 69 and 184 months, respectively. Seven patients did not have imaging follow-up. No change was detected in the remaining 28 patients. During cumulative clinical follow-up of 316 years, no aneurysm ruptured. Five patients died from unrelated causes and two were lost to follow-up after 8 and 120 months. Three patients underwent surgical clipping.

Conclusions

Most UIAs detected by presymptomatic screening in ADPKD patients are small and in the anterior circulation. Growth and rupture risks are not higher than those of UIAs in the general population. These data support very selective screening for UIAs in ADPKD patients, and widespread screening is not indicated.

### Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^116YSaUy]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease:

- **Definition**: ADPKD is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys, leading to enlarged kidneys and often resulting in kidney failure.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of ADPKD is primarily linked to mutations in two genes: PKD1 and PKD2. These mutations lead to abnormal polycystin proteins, which are believed to play a role in cell signaling and regulation of cell growth and division.
- **Epidemiology**: The point prevalence of ADPKD in the European Union is estimated at < 5 per 100,000 population, and it is estimated to affect 12 million individuals worldwide.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, ADPKD is characterized by progressive kidney enlargement due to cyst growth. Other common symptoms include abdominal pain, hypertension, and hematuria. As the disease progresses, patients are at an increased risk of renal complications, including CKD and ESRD. It is also associated with extrarenal complications such as liver cysts, intracranial aneurysms, and cardiac valvular disease.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The primary risk factor is a family history of the disease, as it is an inherited disorder.

INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS

Intracranial aneurysms are an uncommon but important manifestation of particular concern to patients. One survey in patients with ADPKD found a self-reported prevalence rate of 5.0% for brain aneurysm and 7.5% for stroke or cerebral bleeding. A recent systematic review reported that unruptured intracranial aneurysms occur in around 11% of patients with ADPKD, as compared with around 3% in the general population. The rate of rupture among patients with ADPKD appears similar to that in the general population: a rupture rate of 0.4%/patient-year was reported among ADPKD patients with conservatively treated aneurysms. In the general population, the rupture rate depends strongly on the size and location of the aneurysm.

Systematic screening for intracranial aneurysms is not recommended for all patients with ADPKD, but is recommended in certain groups at elevated risk. Consultation with a neurosurgeon and neurovascular radiologist is needed in the management of identified aneurysms.

### Follow-up of intracranial aneurysms in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease [^114zEuSj]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 8% of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients have intracranial aneurysms. The risk of growth and rupture of those discovered by presymptomatic screening is key to the feasibility and success of a screening program. This study was initiated to ascertain this risk.

Methods

ADPKD patients were offered screening with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging that included three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiographic and three-dimensional phase-contrast sequences. Patients with aneurysms were recommended periodic surveillance, initially at 6 months and yearly, and less frequently after demonstration of their stability.

Results

Twenty-two saccular and one fusiform aneurysms were detected at the initial screening in 21 patients from 19 families (seven men and 14 women, 47.9 ± 10.6 years old). All the saccular aneurysms were small (mean diameter 3.5 mm, range 2.0 to 6.5 mm) and the majority (77%) in the anterior circulation. Two patients died from unrelated causes without further follow-up. One patient was lost to follow-up. A new 2 mm middle cerebral artery aneurysm developed in one patient. One aneurysm increased from a size of 4 mm to 5 mm after a follow-up of 105 months. No aneurysmal development or growth occurred in the remaining 16 patients. No aneurysmal rupture occurred during a mean imaging follow-up of 81 months and a mean clinical follow-up of 92 months. During the period of the study, two additional ADPKD patients, with three intracranial aneurysms detected elsewhere by presymptomatic MR angiographic screening, were referred for surgical treatment. The larger size of these aneurysms (10, 8, and 8 mm) probably reflects referral bias.

Conclusion

Most intracranial aneurysms detected by presymptomatic screening in ADPKD patients are small and in the anterior circulation. The follow-up results do not suggest an increased risk for growth and rupture, compared to those of intracranial aneurysms in the general population. These data do not support widespread screening for intracranial aneurysms in the ADPKD population.

### Scanxiety and quality of life around follow-up imaging in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a prospective cohort study [^111EddEp]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient and aneurysm characteristics

We recorded the following patient and aneurysm characteristics: sex, age at enrollment, history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), family history of SAH, history of treatment of another intracranial aneurysm, years of follow-up at enrollment, reason for diagnosis, aneurysm size, aneurysm location, and PHASES score. The PHASES score estimates the 5-year rupture risk of UIAs based on the following patient and aneurysm characteristics: population, hypertension, age, size of aneurysm, earlier SAH from another aneurysm, and site of aneurysm. The score ranges from 0 to 22, with 5-year rupture risks ranging from 0.4 to 17.8%. We recorded the reason for diagnosis as "incidental" or "screening". "Incidental" included all patients in whom the UIA was found incidentally, including the diagnosis of a UIA at the time of rupture of another aneurysm. "Screening" included patients in whom the UIA was diagnosed because of a positive family history for SAH, a patient history of autosomal polycystic kidney disease, or pre-medical screening at a commercial center. We distinguished incidentally detected UIAs from UIAs detected at screening, as we hypothesized that patients undergoing screening would be more anxious than those in whom the aneurysm was found incidentally.

We recorded the following imaging-related characteristics: imaging modality, radiology report, the number of days between performance of the scan and receiving the radiology report, management plan after follow-up imaging (preventive treatment of a UIA, retreatment of another aneurysm, continued follow-up, or end of follow-up), and time to next scheduled follow-up imaging. We recorded the radiology report as "unfavorable" or "favorable". Unfavorable was defined as an increase in UIA size of at least 1.0 mm, a new UIA, or recanalization of a previously treated aneurysm. A radiology report was classified as favorable if the aneurysm remained stable.

### Repeat imaging for intracranial aneurysms in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with initially negative studies: a prospective ten-year follow-up [^112yfXgq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have a higher incidence of intracranial aneurysms (ICA) than the general population. These ICA also rupture at an earlier age in patients with ADPKD and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. In a recent study, 25% of patients with ADPKD with a documented ICA demonstrated a new ICA on follow-up. It is not known, however, whether patients with ADPKD who have had a negative ICA imaging study would demonstrate an ICA on a repeat imaging study. Only 2 (2.6%) of 76 patients with ADPKD with an initially negative study demonstrated an ICA on follow-up, despite the high frequency of risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, and a family history of ruptured ICA. The mean length of follow-up was 9.8 yr (median, 9.7 yr). These findings have important health care and economic implications in following patients with ADPKD.

### Renal transplantation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^117J3Sof]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) evaluated for kidney transplantation, issues related to native nephrectomy, cystic liver involvement, screening for intracranial aneurysms and living-related kidney donation deserve special consideration. Prophylactic native nephrectomy is restricted to patients with a history of cyst infection or recurrent haemorrhage or to those in whom space must be made to implant the graft. Patients with liver involvement require pretransplant imaging. Selection of patients for pretransplant screening of intracranial aneurysms should follow the general recommendations for patients with ADPKD. In living related-donor candidates aged < 30 years and at-risk of ADPKD, molecular genetic testing should be carried out when ultrasonography and MRI findings are normal or equivocal. After kidney transplantation, patient and graft survival rates are excellent and the volume of native kidneys decreases. However, liver cysts continue to grow and treatment with a somatostatin analogue should be considered in patients with massive cyst involvement. Cerebrovascular events have a marginal effect on post-transplant morbidity and mortality. An increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus and nonmelanoma skin cancers has been reported, but several studies have challenged these findings. Finally, no data currently support the preferential use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors as immunosuppressive agents in transplant recipients with ADPKD.

### Risk of intracranial hemorrhage associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in patients with end stage renal disease [^116Dd4dN]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

About 19% of the ADPKD cohort who developed ICH had a known berry aneurysm, about double that of non-ADPKD cohort. A previous study of 129 ADPKD patients who died showed that 11% of them died due to ICH. Of these, about half had a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. The prevalence of intracranial aneurysms might have been even higher than 19% among ADPKD patients who developed ICH, due to lack of screening. The prevalence of intracranial aneurysm in ADPKD is about 5–10% based on 3 prospective trials totaling 266 patients. However, at least in the general population, the vast majority of intracranial aneurysms do not rupture and therefore presumably do not need intervention, making a screening strategy based on detection of aneurysms problematic. Patients with PKD1 and PKD2 seem equally likely to develop intracranial aneurysms, while patients with mutations to the 5' half of PKD1 may more likely have vascular complications. Screening has been reported and recommends focus on patients age < 30, not applicable to the current study population.

Limitations

There were several limitations with our study. Because our cohort was limited to Medicare primary recipients, which was required to strictly ascertain Medicare-defined outcomes, such as claims for specific diagnoses, the patients were significantly older than the USRDS population as a whole, and excluded a disproportionately higher fraction of patients with ADPKD. The USRDS does not have information on family history, which is a key determinant of further evaluation for cerebral aneurysm, especially with a known diagnosis of ADPKD. The USRDS also does not have information on ADPKD genotype, and we thus cannot distinguish between genotype PKD1 vs. genotype PKD2, which generally has a more indolent course than PKD1, ie later age at diagnosis, and later onset of hypertension and ESRD. In any case, it may be even more impressive that a significant association was seen between ADPKD and subsequent ICH, as it is often assumed that ADPKD patients are past their high-risk period for intracranial events once they have started dialysis.

### Establishing a core outcome set for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: report of the standardized outcomes in nephrology-polycystic kidney disease (SONG-PKD) consensus workshop [^115H5rJo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The omission of outcomes that are of relevance to patients, clinicians, and regulators across trials in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) limits shared decision making. The Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Polycystic Kidney Disease (SONG-PKD) Initiative convened an international consensus workshop on October 25, 2018, to discuss the identification and implementation of a potential core outcome set for all ADPKD trials. This article summarizes the discussion from the workshops and the SONG-PKD core outcome set. Key stakeholders including 11 patients/caregivers and 47 health professionals (nephrologists, policy makers, industry, and researchers) attended the workshop. Four themes emerged: "Relevance of trajectory and impact of kidney function" included concerns about a patient's prognosis and uncertainty of when they may need to commence kidney replacement therapy and the lack of an early prognostic marker to inform long-term decisions; "Discerning and defining pain specific to ADPKD" highlighted the challenges in determining the origin of pain, adapting to the chronicity and repeated episodes of pain, the need to place emphasis on pain management, and to have a validated measure for pain; "Highlighting ADPKD consequences" encompassed cyst-related complications and reflected patient's knowledge because of family history and the hereditary nature of ADPKD; and "Risk for life-threatening but rare consequences" such as cerebral aneurysm meant considering both frequency and severity of the outcome. Kidney function, mortality, cardiovascular disease, and pain were established as the core outcomes for ADPKD.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113JNhyz]. Stroke (2015). Medium credibility.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysm — growth, hemorrhage risk, and imaging follow-up: In a serial MRA cohort, 1002 patients with 1325 aneurysms yielded 18 with interval growth, with an annual hemorrhage rate of 18.5% among those with documented growth, and modeling estimated that 90.3% of growing aneurysms would be detected before hemorrhage with screening at 6-month intervals. A second study of 258 aneurysms found 18% grew, with per-year hemorrhage 2.4% in the growing group versus 0.2% in the nongrowing group. Accordingly, "routine screening by noninvasive vascular imaging techniques to detect aneurysm growth is probably indicated", and "treatment of enlarging aneurysms with documented growth may be reasonable". Patients with aneurysms and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease "do not appear to be at increased risk of aneurysm rupture, but experience is limited".

Screening for extrarenal complications

Mitral valve prolapse

A systematic study published in 1995 reported mitral valve prolapse in 12% of children with ADPKD. This prevalence was significantly higher than that of their healthy siblings (3%) but is within the range reported for healthy children and is lower than that reported for adults with ADPKD (25%) –. As children without a murmur are unlikely to have haemodynamically relevant mitral valve prolapse, they do not require echocardiographic screening for mitral valve prolapse (Box 10).

Intracranial aneurysm

In adults with ADPKD, screening for intracranial aneurysms is generally recommended only if additional risk factors are present such as a positive family history, previous intracranial aneurysms or a high-risk profession. However, some authors disagree with this recommendation, arguing that screening is cost-effective. Treatment strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms are still controversial. As rupture of intracranial aneurysm is an exceedingly rare complication in childhood, routine screening is not justified. In rare cases with a positive family history and a strong desire to ease anxiety by screening, an individualized approach is justified.

Liver cysts

No reports exist of clinically relevant complications of ADPKD-related liver cysts in children. Congenital hepatic fibrosis is not a feature of classical ADPKD. Ultrasonography of the liver may be a reasonable investigation at first presentation of children with suspected ADPKD if alternative diagnoses are being considered or in the case of acute abdominal pain. However, we do not recommend regular screening for liver cysts in children with confirmed ADPKD.

Referral to specialized centres

Newborn babies and infants with severe cystic disease comprise a heterogeneous group who pose numerous challenges to diagnosis and management. Extended genetic testing of these patients is recommended to inform genetic and prognostic counselling in a specialized centre. However, neonates or fetuses with hyperechogenic kidneys and a family history of ADPKD who do not have symptoms or enlarged kidneys should not be considered to have severe disease. Children with TSC2 / PKD1 CGS typically have severe polycystic kidney disease and may reach ESRD in young adulthood. We recommend referral to a specialized centre and multidisciplinary care for these patients.

### Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^112k6fZW]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of people affected with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) will develop kidney failure, making ADPKD the 4th most common cause of end-stage kidney disease. ADPKD is a systemic condition affecting the kidneys, liver, heart, vasculature, and other organ systems. A minority of patients may have severe complications such as massive hepatomegaly from a polycystic liver or rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. Recent advances in the understanding of genetics, prognosis, and treatment of this condition have allowed delivery of personalized treatment capable of changing the natural history of the disease. This review focuses on diagnosis, determining risk of kidney failure, treatment, blood pressure management, and preimplantation genetic testing related to ADPKD.

### Intracranial aneurysm and recessive polycystic kidney disease: the third reported case [^115B8szb]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Objective

To highlight the possible association of intracranial aneurysm with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.

Design, Setting, and Patient

To our knowledge, this association has been reported only twice in the medical literature. We herein report the case of a 21-year-old man with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, at our institution.

Results

In the presence of only 3 cases in the medical literature, one might conclude they are a simple coincidence. However, should this association exist, such as with the dominant form, then the neurologic prognosis and even the life of young patients may be at stake.

Conclusions

Given the devastating consequences of intracranial bleeding in young patients, early neurologic screening may be warranted.

Syndromes Conferring Susceptibility to IBA

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease

Apart from family history, diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) imparts the highest risk for developing IBA (Table 3). Between 4% and 17% of patients with ADPKD will develop IBA, with an equal risk distribution between genders (Chapman et al; Huston et al; Niemczyk et al; Ruggieri et al; Xu et al.). As seen with non-syndromic IBA, the prevalence of IBA increases with age in this disease (Niemczyk et al; Xu et al.). The combined risk for aneurysmal formation in patients diagnosed with ADPKD and a family history of IBA or SAH increases to approximately 22–25% (Huston et al; Ruggieri et al.). Screening for IBA in ADPKD is recommended in patients above 30 years of age, or in patients with a family history of IBA (Xu et al.). Hypertension, found commonly in ADPKD patients, is not considered to be an obligatory risk factor for aneurysm formation in this context. Individuals with ADPKD who have well-controlled hypertension, or hypertension within a normal range, have still been seen to develop intracranial aneurysms (Chauveau et al; Gieteling and Rinkel; Niemczyk et al; Xu et al.). Pathogenic variants in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes are causative for ADPKD and account for 85% and 15% of diagnoses, respectively (Niemczyk). Patients with pathogenic variants in PKD1 or PKD2 appear to have an equivalent risk of IBA (Rossetti et al.). PKD1 and PKD2 mutations cause defects in the mechanosensory cilia found on renal and vascular endothelium, which leads to cyst and aneurysm formation, respectively (AbouAlaiwi et al; Nauli et al.). Patients with tuberous sclerosis complex can also have a concurrent diagnosis of ADPKD when their disease is caused by a contiguous gene deletion affecting TSC2 and PKD1 at chromosome 16p13.3. These patients not only have more severe kidney disease, but are also at risk for intracranial aneurysms (Chen et al; Longa et al; Sampson et al.).

Multidisciplinary coordination

The complex and heterogeneous manifestations of ADPKD often necessitate access to specialized services. In order to establish strategies to detect complications and prevent progression of kidney failure, specialist care should start as soon as possible after diagnosis, ideally when kidney function is not yet impaired and protective measures can be taken. Some patients present with impaired renal function and require RRT soon after diagnosis, while others may have a low risk of progressing to ESRD. In all these cases, specialist care should still be considered.

All patients with ADPKD should have access to a nephrologist knowledgeable about the diverse aspects of the disease, including the multi-organ involvement, psychological and psychosocial issues, genetics, pain management and current treatment options, in addition to the 'core' management of renal function and RRT. Depending on local circumstances, referral to an adult or paediatric nephrologist with specialist ADPKD expertise may also be helpful in some cases for particular aspects of care according to the evolving best practice, such as prognostic assessment, kidney cyst infections, specific reno-protective pharmacotherapy and for clinical trials and other types of research. Patients should also have access to care from a range of other clinical specialists (e.g. hepatology, clinical genetics, neurosurgery and anaesthesiology or pain specialists) and healthcare professionals who also have specific expertise in ADPKD, according to clinical need in the event of other disease manifestations and complications (e.g. liver cyst complications, intracranial aneurysms, lumbar pain; Figure 1). They may also require treatment for other chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes) based on a consensus among all practitioners involved.

### Risk of intracranial hemorrhage associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in patients with end stage renal disease [^1135kGWh]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

As a retrospective study, another limitation was the risk of misclassification. The primary outcome of ICH was based on ICD-9 codes which are entirely determined by physician documentation and standard clinical practice. Because all ADPKD patients are not screened for berry aneurysms, but only "high risk" patients, unscreened ADPKD patients may have an ICH due to intracranial aneurysm rupture, but may be coded as hemorrhagic CVA due to appearance on conventional imaging. Thus reliance solely on the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage could lead to under-ascertainment of the true incidence of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Conversely, most hemorrhagic CVA's in the general population or dialysis population are likely not related to ruptured intracranial aneurysm. This may not be the case for patients with ADPKD but the USRDS does not supply sufficient detail to definitively answer this question. Therefore, we performed sensitivity analyses of each outcome individually, in addition to the aggregate outcome, as used by previous investigators and demonstrated similar findings. Due to the retrospective nature of our analysis, which assesses association only and not causality, we cannot account for screening and other surveillance biases. As noted previously, patients with ADPKD are more likely to be evaluated for intracranial aneurysms than patients with other causes of ESRD. However, the diagnosis of hemorrhagic CVA should not be susceptible to surveillance bias, which is why we included it as an outcome. In addition, information on family history was not available. The risk of ICH is likely restricted to a subgroup of all patients with ADPKD. However, this is essentially a type of residual confounding in which the risk of any categorical variable (ie, diabetes, hypertension) is not uniformly distributed among all subjects with the condition, but rather varies according to the severity of the condition. This is a common limitation of all registry data.

Demographically, for purposes of analysis, patients were considered to be African-American or not. As discussed earlier, our cohort was older compared to the mean age at the time of intracranial aneurysm rupture reported among ADPKD patients (65.3 years vs. 41 years).

Strengths of the study are its large size and consistency of findings over many years. The study describes national physician practice as documented by standard coding techniques. Single center studies, and even multi-center studies unless conducted over many years, would not be large enough to assess differences in the outcomes that were assessed.

### Exome sequencing in 38 patients with intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage [^114RwVxN]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study cohort

Individuals of Northwestern German descent (genetically belonging to the group of non-Finnish, Northwestern Europeans) were recruited in the Interdisciplinary Neurovascular Center of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; approximately 70 patients with aSAH and 200 patients with intracranial aneurysms in total are treated there per year. Inclusion–exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) Only individuals with a family history of UIA and/or aSAH and substantially affected sporadic patients with ≥ 2 UIA or ≥ 1 UIA and aSAH were included. To that, we selected patients based on age, number of aneurysms and family history, resulting in a collective of relatively young patients with an increased number of aneurysms and family history above average compared to data provided in the literature (Table 1). Experienced physicians assessed the patients; familial history, clinical appearance, primary risk conditions (e.g. hypertension) and life-style risk factors (e.g. smoking) were recorded (Table 1). Missing clinical data of patients previously treated in a different institution were gathered as far as possible. Phenotype definitions following the FIA study protocol: "UIA and/or aSAH" (individuals having a documented UIA based on intra-arterial angiogram or operative report; individuals having an aSAH documented in medical records based on CT/MRI-scan, intra-arterial angiogram or operative report); "probable aSAH" (aSAH was stated in the medical history with supporting documentation such as severe headache or altered level of consciousness). (ii) Informed consents for blood collection, DNA storage and genetic analyses were obtained from all study participants. (iii) Patients with a familial or personal history of disorders associated with IA (i.e. polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Loeys–Dietz syndrome and Marfan syndrome) were excluded based on clinical findings. In total, we screened 101 individuals, of which 75 met the described inclusion criteria. To assess the putative risk of rupture in patients with UIA in comparison to those with a proven aneurysmal bleeding, we calculated the PHASES score (Table 1). In patients with multiple UIAs, the score was calculated for each aneurysm site and size, and the highest score was documented (Table 1). In the aSAH group, the score for the ruptured aneurysm was calculated retrospectively (Table 1). Finally, we assessed clinical characteristics for following subgroups (Table 1): exome sequenced individuals (ES IND), individuals with positive family history (FAM IND) and substantially affected sporadic individuals (SPO IND).

### An update on the use of tolvaptan for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: consensus statement on behalf of the ERA working group on inherited kidney disorders, the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network and polycystic kidney disease international [^115UyQdq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Importantly, before starting the evaluation of a patient for treatment with tolvaptan, the diagnosis of ADPKD needs to be confirmed. The diagnostic approach to ADPKD is not the focus of this consensus statement. Nonetheless, this is a point that needs increasing attention when targeted treatments become available for polycystic kidney disease. Briefly, in the presence of a positive family history, classic ADPKD can be diagnosed using imaging criteria. Consequently, kidney imaging (preferably by MRI) is a prerequisite before evaluation of patients for tolvaptan. Cases with atypical clinical presentation or kidney morphology usually require confirmation by genetic testing.

### Novel PKD1 mutation (C.G10086T) drives high intracranial aneurysm risk in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^111K4EPd]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common inherited kidney disorders, affecting 1:1000 to 1:2500 individuals worldwide. While renal manifestations are predominant, ADPKD is a systemic disorder with significant vascular complications, among which intracranial aneurysms (IAs) represent a life‐threatening condition. The prevalence of IAs in ADPKD patients (4%–11.5%) is approximately five times higher than in the general population, with a median age of rupture 10 years earlier.

Despite the established genetic basis of ADPKD, primarily involving mutations in PKD1 (~78%) or PKD2 (~15%) genes, the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to IA formation remain poorly understood. Recent studies have suggested that specific PKD1 mutations might correlate with distinct vascular phenotypes, but comprehensive genotype–phenotype correlations for IA risk are lacking. This knowledge gap hampers the development of personalized screening strategies, particularly for populations with different genetic backgrounds.

We identified a large Chinese ADPKD family (n = 24) exhibiting an unusually high prevalence of IAs. This unique familial clustering suggested a potential genetic driver for enhanced IA susceptibility. Through comprehensive genetic analysis incorporating whole‐exome sequencing, whole‐genome sequencing, and functional validation, we aimed to identify and characterize the genetic variant responsible for the high IA incidence in this family.

### A systematic review of the predictors of disease progression in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^115eVDim]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common genetic disorder leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD). Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by germline mutations in PKD1 (85% of cases) and PKD2 (15% of cases), and is typically diagnosed later in life than autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.

ADPKD is characterised by the progressive development of multiple bilateral renal cysts and has a prevalence of less than five patients per 10,000 of the population in the EU. ADPKD is a systemic disease, with extra-renal manifestations including liver cysts, intracranial aneurysms and hypertension. Approximately 70% of patients with ADPKD will progress to ESRD at a median age of 56 years. Patients with ADPKD may experience chronic pain, which may be debilitating, in addition to increased morbidity due to enlarged kidneys, which can lead to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduced social interaction.

ADPKD is associated with a high degree of clinical variability between patients, both within and between families, especially in terms of the likelihood and rate of progression towards ESRD. In the early stages of ADPKD, before renal function is significantly compromised, progression can be difficult to detect as patients are often asymptomatic. Currently, there is a lack of consensus in the published literature regarding the optimal factors for prediction of renal outcomes and the ideal variables that should be measured in order to monitor disease progression, especially in the early stages of the disease. This has led to difficulties in identifying patients at high risk of ESRD and in defining appropriate primary endpoints to consistently measure and compare the efficacy of therapies in development.

There is a requirement for greater understanding of the predictors of disease progression in ADPKD in order to optimise clinical trial design, treatment and patient care. The objective of this systematic review was to identify publications that detail the natural history of ADPKD, considering the indicators of early- and late-stage progression. It was envisaged that this review would aid clinical practice by informing future research and the development of a predictive model to estimate the likely rate of progression and ultimate long-term outcomes in patients with ADPKD.

### Preimplantation genetic diagnosis counseling in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^114VYEk7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common hereditary forms of chronic kidney disease. Mutations within PKD1 or PKD2 lead to innumerable fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys and in some instances, end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing the mutation to each of their offspring. Assisted reproductive technology using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) allows these individuals to reduce this risk to 1% to 2%. We assess the disease burden of 8 individuals with ADPKD who have undergone genetic testing in preparation for PGD. Clinical features that predict high risk for progression to ESRD in patients with ADPKD include genotype, early onset of hypertension, a urologic event before age 35 years, and a large height-adjusted total kidney volume. Patients may have a family history of intracranial aneurysms or complications involving hepatic cysts, which may further influence the decision to pursue PGD. We also explore the cost, risks, and benefits of using PGD. All patients with ADPKD of childbearing potential, regardless of risk for progression to ESRD or risk for a significant disease burden, will likely benefit from genetic counseling.

### Ruptured berry aneurysm as the initial presentation of polycystic kidney disease: a case report and review of literature [^111kCENr]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Intra-cranial saccular aneurysms, also known as Berry aneurysms, have a well-known association with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Aneurysmal rupture can be the initial presentation of the disease. ADPKD has two types of gene mutations: PKD1 and PKD2. The latter one is of a milder form presenting later in life. Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and assessment in order to provide adequate management of these patients however, there are no official standardized guidelines established for screening of these intracranial aneurysms.

### Intracranial aneurysms in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^112wFswx]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

ADPKD correlates with an increased frequency of ICANs, but universal screening for ICANs in patients with ADPKD is not currently recommended. The aim of our study was to determine which groups might benefit from screening by determining the prevalence of ICANs in the Polish ADPKD population and identifying any subgroups with an increased risk for ICANs.

Materials and Methods

Eighty-three adult, predialysis-phase patients with ADPKD underwent screening for ICANs with MRA of the brain.

Results

The prevalence of ICANs in the studied population was 16.9%, with 6% of the screened group requiring neurosurgical intervention. We also found that the frequency of ICANs increases with age, reaching 22.4% in patients older than 45 years. All diagnosed ICANs were small (< 9 mm) and were localized in the anterior circulation. In addition, MR imaging revealed arachnoid cysts in 4.8% of patients with ADPKD.

Conclusions

We suggest that patients older than 45 years with ADPKD be considered as candidates for screening for ICANs, and we propose a clinical algorithm for this subgroup. However, we could not find risk factors for ICANs in younger patients with ADPKD.

### Familial clustering of ruptured intracranial aneurysms in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^1147nRij]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Ruptured intracranial aneurysm (RICA) is a life-threatening complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). A family history of RICA may be a risk factor for RICA. Six hundred eight adult members of 199 ADPKD families were interviewed, and family pedigrees were constructed. Individuals were classified as having definite, probable, or possible RICAs from evidence and history obtained in interviews. Central nervous system (CNS) events not consistent with RICA were classified as other CNS events. Seventy-seven CNS events occurred in 906 subjects with ADPKD (8.5%) versus 13 events in 823 subjects without ADPKD (1.6%; P < 0.0001). No event in subjects without ADPKD was consistent with an RICA. Twenty-seven other (non-RICA) CNS events occurred in subjects with ADPKD (3%) versus 13 events in subjects without ADPKD (1.6%; P = 0.05). The frequency of RICA was increased in subjects with ADPKD: 21 definite RICAs in subjects with ADPKD (2%) versus none in subjects without ADPKD (P < 0.001); 28 definite and probable RICAs in subjects with ADPKD (3%) versus none in subjects without ADPKD (P < 0.001); and 50 definite, probable, and possible RICAs in subjects with ADPKD (5.5%) versus none in subjects without ADPKD (P < 0.001). The null hypothesis that RICAs are randomly distributed among subjects with ADPKD was tested for definite RICAs (n = 21), definite and probable RICAs (n = 28), and definite, probable, and possible RICAs (n = 50). In the three categories, the null hypothesis was rejected at P less than 0.05, P less than 0.05, and P less than 0.005, respectively. Vascular CNS events occurred more frequently in ADPKD than non-ADPKD family members, and clustering of RICAs occurred in families with ADPKD.

### Spanish guidelines for the management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^115Qhxms]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most frequent cause of genetic renal disease and accounts for 6–10% of patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT). Very few prospective, randomized trials or clinical studies address the diagnosis and management of this relatively frequent disorder. No clinical guidelines are available to date. This is a consensus statement presenting the recommendations of the Spanish Working Group on Inherited Kidney Diseases, which were agreed to following a literature search and discussions. Levels of evidence found were C and D according to the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (University of Oxford). The recommendations relate to, among other topics, the use of imaging and genetic diagnosis, management of hypertension, pain, cyst infections and bleeding, extra-renal involvement including polycystic liver disease and cranial aneurysms, management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and RRT and management of children with ADPKD.

Participants

Three large Dutch families with multiple affected first-degree relatives with an unruptured IA or an ASAH were selected: pedigree 1 included nine affected relatives in one generation, pedigree 2 included eleven relatives in three successive generations, while pedigree 3 included six in three successive generations (Fig. 2). Genealogical research showed no shared ancestor between these families for at least six generations back. For the variants identified in these families we further determined their role in the general IA patient population, using a cohort of 937 Dutch IA patients, of whom 160 had a positive family history for ASAH, from the University Medical Center Utrecht (Table 1). For the control cohort, GS genotypes from 1046 persons recruited within Project MinE were used. Presence of IA was determined with computed tomography, magnetic resonance, or digital subtraction angiogram. Families or persons with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos disease, Marfan Syndrome, or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease were excluded.

### A case report of atypical autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease presenting as glomerulocystic kidney superimposed with thin basement membrane nephropathy [^114KPrei]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although renal cysts were easily identified on imaging in our case, the number of renal cysts was under the age-related ultrasound Ravine criteria of ADPKD: the presence of four (two or more cysts in each kidney) for individuals aged 40–59 years with positive family history for cystic kidney diseases. There are no established imaging-based criteria for diagnosis of ADPKD in patients without a positive family history. A study showed that individuals who had 10 or more cysts in each kidney could be diagnosed ADPKD by imaging studies. Ultrasound can detect the cysts with a diameter of 10 mm or greater, while MRI can detect cysts of 2–3 mm. After genetic test, we confirmed more cysts on both kidneys by MRI. Thus, MRI is more useful in diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease.

ADPKD is a systemic disease, usually has extrarenal cysts in the liver or pancreas. And other extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD include hypertension, abdominal pain, cardiac valvular disease, cerebral aneurysms, and intestinal diverticulosis. In this patient, we did not find any extrarenal cysts or manifestations. Cases of polycystic kidney diseases resembling GCK in neonates and children have been reported. In those cases, cysts of liver or other organs were not identified either. GCK in PKD usually occurs from early childhood, and we seldom encounter adult GCK in PKD, making it difficult to diagnose in the present case. Therefore, genetic tests were necessary in suspicious case of GCK.

Cysts in PKD originate in renal tubules or glomeruli, and are thought to occur due to enhanced proliferation of the epithelial cells lining the cysts. In addition, the lack of tubular cysts in this case is not consistent with the typical histopathological features of ADPKD. The immunostaining showed that dilatation of Bowman's capsule was not tubule-derived, and the ultrastructure of Bowman's capsule and PECs appeared normal by TEM in this case. But selective dilatation of the Bowman capsule still remains largely unexplained. Other cases reported that the stenosis at the glomerulotubular junction increased pressure of Bowman's space, and remodeling of the basement membrane of the Bowman's capsule might be the cause of glomerular cysts.

Heterozygous missense mutation of NPHP1 was also detected in this case. But this heterozygous mutation is not pathogenic because homozygous or compound heterozygous defect of NPHP1 can cause Nephronophthisis, which is transmitted through an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

### Renal relevant radiology: radiologic imaging in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^111ReqEQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disorder and the most common hereditary renal disease, which is characterized by cyst growth, progressive renal enlargement, and development of renal failure. The cystic nature of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and its renal and extrarenal complications (kidney stones, cyst hemorrhage, intracerebral aneurysm, liver cysts, cardiac valve abnormalities, etc.) give radiologic imaging studies a central role in the management of these patients. This article reviews the indications, comparative use, and limitation of various imaging modalities (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scan, Positron emission tomography scan, and renal scintigraphy) for the diagnosis and management of complications in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Finally, this work provides evidence for the value of total kidney volume to predict disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2025 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation, Management, and Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) represents the first KDIGO guideline on this subject. Its scope includes nomenclature, diagnosis, prognosis, and prevalence; kidney manifestations; chronic kidney disease (CKD) management and progression, kidney failure, and kidney replacement therapy; therapies to delay progression of kidney disease; polycystic liver disease; intracranial aneurysms and other extrarenal manifestations; lifestyle and psychosocial aspects; pregnancy and reproductive issues; pediatric issues; and approaches to the management of people with ADPKD. The guideline has been developed with patient partners, clinicians, and researchers around the world, with the goal to generate a useful resource for healthcare providers and patients by providing actionable recommendations. The development of this guideline followed an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal, based on a rigorous, formal systematic literature review. The strength of recommendations follows the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The guideline also provides practice points serving to direct clinical care or activities relating to areas for which a systematic review was not conducted. Limitations of the evidence are discussed. Research recommendations to address gaps in knowledge, and implications for policy and payment, are provided. The guideline targets a broad audience of healthcare providers, people living with ADPKD, and stakeholders involved in the various aspects of ADPKD care.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 48-year-old man with ADPKD was admitted for long-term hemodialysis because his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dropped to 14 ml/min/1.73 m². His blood pressure was within the normal range. The patient was diagnosed with ADPKD 10 years earlier with a positive family history (Figure 1). He and his relatives had no history of intracranial aneurysm. He had no albuminuria and did not complain of renal pain. During diagnosis, an enlarged polycystic left kidney was found, but the right kidney was absent. An ultrasonography after admission detected a fist-sized, multi-cystic mass located before his right iliac artery. An enlarged polycystic liver was also detected. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan confirmed a 6 cm diameter polycystic mass in the right pelvis (Figure 2, Panels A and B, triangles), and the left kidney was significantly enlarged, measuring 18 cm × 12 cm × 8 cm. A renal volume assessment was then performed. The renal volume for the left kidney was 1127.6 cm³ and that for the right was only 74.6 cm³. Further MR urography revealed a tubular structure connecting the pelvic polycystic mass to the bladder with a fluid signal along the tubular lumen area (Figure 2, Panels B and C, arrows). This ADPKD patient had a right pelvic multicystic kidney with congenital aplasia, and the tubular structure was his right ureter.

### Diagnosis and risk factors for intracranial aneurysms in autosomal polycystic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study from the genkyst cohort [^116xFuH1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with an increased risk for developing intracranial aneurysms (IAs). We aimed to evaluate the frequency of diagnosis of IAs in the cross-sectional, population-based, Genkyst cohort, to describe ADPKD-associated IAs and to analyse the risk factors associated with the occurrence of IAs in ADPKD patients.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was performed in 26 nephrology centres from the western part of France. All patients underwent genetic testing for PKD1/PKD2 and other cystogenes.

Results

Among the 2449 Genkyst participants, 114 (4.65%) had a previous diagnosis of ruptured or unruptured IAs at inclusion, and ∼47% of them had a positive familial history for IAs. Most aneurysms were small and saccular and located in the anterior circulation; 26.3% of the patients had multiple IAs. The cumulative probabilities of a previous diagnosis of IAs were 3.9%, 6.2% and 8.1% at 50, 60 and 70 years, respectively. While this risk appeared to be similar in male and female individuals < 50 years, after that age, the risk continued to increase more markedly in female patients, reaching 10.8% versus 5.4% at 70 years. The diagnosis rate of IAs was > 2-fold higher in PKD1 compared with PKD2, with no influence of PKD1 mutation type or location. In multivariate analysis, female sex, hypertension < 35 years, smoking and PKD1 genotype were associated with an increased risk for diagnosis of IAs.

Conclusions

This study presents epidemiological data reflecting real-life clinical practice. The increased risk for IAs in postmenopausal women suggests a possible protective role of oestrogen.

RISK FACTORS FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RUPTURE OF INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS

Risk Factors for Development of Aneurysms

The important risk factors for the development of cerebral aneurysms are hypertension, smoking, chronic alcohol use,–family history of intracranial aneurysms in first-degree relatives,–and female sex. In the United States, the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is higher in the African American and Hispanic population compared with whites.–In New Zealand, the incidence of aSAH is found to be higher in native Maroi and Pacific Islanders than in the white population. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an inherited systemic disorder that is strongly associated with intracranial aneurysms. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease has a prevalence rate 2 to 4 times higher than the general population. Other conditions such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, neurofibromatosis type 1, and fibromuscular dysplasia are weakly associated with intracranial aneurysms (Table 1).–

Loeys-Dietz syndrome imaging — baseline and surveillance: In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a baseline TTE is recommended to determine the diameters of the aortic root and ascending aorta, and 6 months thereafter to determine the rate of aortic growth; if the aortic diameters are stable, annual surveillance TTE is recommended. In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and a dilated or dissected aorta and/or arterial branches at baseline, annual surveillance imaging of the affected aorta and arteries with MRI or CT is recommended. In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a baseline MRI or CT from head to pelvis is recommended to evaluate the entire aorta and its branches for aneurysm, dissection, and tortuosity. In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome without dilation of the aorta distal to the aortic root or ascending aorta and without dilated or dissected arterial branches, surveillance imaging from chest to pelvis with MRI (or CT) every 2 years is reasonable, but imaging may be more frequent depending on family history. In patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome without dilation of the cerebral arteries on initial screening, periodic imaging surveillance for cerebral aneurysms with MRI or CT every 2 to 3 years is reasonable.

### Risk of intracranial hemorrhage associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in patients with end stage renal disease [^114qsuiY]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common single gene hereditary disorders, occurring in about 1 in every 400–1000 live births. It is associated with renal, hepatic, and pancreatic cysts, valvular heart disease, diverticular disease, and intracranial aneurysms. The genes responsible, PKD1 and PKD2, respectively, appear to have equivalent expression of intracranial aneurysms and play a direct pathogenetic role in aneurysm formation. A ruptured intracranial aneurysm is a potentially life-threatening complication of ADPKD, associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Intracranial aneurysm prevalence in ADPKD ranges from 4% to as high as 41% with a positive family history, increasing with age; rates per person-years are not available. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has a 30-day mortality rate of 45%. The survivors of these strokes have about a 30% chance of moderate or severe disability. In comparison, in the general U.S. population the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is 9–20 per 100,000 person-years (PY), with 30-day mortality of 35%-52%. The overall total intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) incidence in the U.S. is 24.6 per 100,000 PY. In the general population, risk factors for ICH include male gender, older age, Asian ethnicity, and in the U.S. African American (AA) ethnicity. The most important etiologies for ICH in the general population are hypertension (usually leading to hemorrhage in deep structures) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is less likely related to blood pressure but more with older age, and associated ICH tends to occur in lobar regions. Chief among genetic factors contributing to ICH is apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene and ɛ2 and ɛ4 alleles. ADPKD is prominent among genetic contributors to SAH, along with first degree family history, Marfan's syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

### Prevalence of pre-eclampsia in 265 patients with an intracranial aneurysm, 393 female relatives versus a control cohort: a case-control study [^115TStDi]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of saccular intracranial aneurysms (sIAs), pouches on the bifurcations of intracranial extracerebral arteries, is around 3% in the general population. Most sIAs remain undiscovered during life if not incidentally found in neuroimaging or by screening for familial sIAs. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), caused by a rupture of the sIA wall, is the third most frequent form of stroke with high morbidity and mortality. The risk factors for sIAs and aSAH include female sex, age, smoking, hypertension, and autosomal‐dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). sIA disease is a complex condition with at least 10% of sIA patients belonging to sIA families.

About 4% of pregnancies in Europe are complicated by pre‐eclampsia, a severe multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and maternal organ dysfunction. Globally, pre‐eclampsia causes substantial maternal mortality and increased risks of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and stroke during pregnancy and later in life. ADPKD, a risk factor for sIA disease, is also a risk factor for pre‐eclampsia. Pre‐eclampsia has a clear familial propensity, with both maternal and paternal factors increasing the risk, and familial linkage predicts more severe pre‐eclampsia. Of all pre‐eclampsia cases, 20% are classified as severe.

A possible connection between familial sIA disease and familial pre‐eclampsia has not been reported. In our previous study, pre‐eclampsia was more common in sIA patients than in their matched controls and sIA patients with pre‐eclampsia had more frequently irregularly‐shaped aneurysms. The current study was conducted to verify the connection between pre‐eclampsia and sIA disease in an extended study population. Additionally, we included female relatives to study the familial linkage of pre‐eclampsia and sIAs. In the present study, we analyzed the prevalence of pre‐eclampsia in 265 sIA females with the first birth since 1987, their 393 female relatives, and 546 matched population controls, using data in the Kuopio Intracranial Aneurysm (IA) Patient and Family Database and data from the Finnish nationwide health registries. Additionally, we examined all sIA females with the first sIA disease diagnosis from 1995 to 2018 (n = 1895) and all female relatives (n = 12,141) for the prevalence of familial sIA disease and familial pre‐eclampsia. We hypothesized about a familial aggregation of sIA disease and pre‐eclampsia.

### Difference in rupture risk between familial and sporadic intracranial aneurysms: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^111JcJWZ]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

We combined individual patient data (IPD) from prospective cohorts of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) to assess to what extent patients with familial UIA have a higher rupture risk than those with sporadic UIA.

Methods

For this IPD meta-analysis, we performed an Embase and PubMed search for studies published up to December 1, 2020. We included studies that (1) had a prospective study design; (2) included 50 or more patients with UIA; (3) studied the natural course of UIA and risk factors for aneurysm rupture including family history for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage and UIA; and (4) had aneurysm rupture as an outcome. Cohorts with available IPD were included. All studies included patients with newly diagnosed UIA visiting one of the study centers. The primary outcome was aneurysmal rupture. Patients with polycystic kidney disease and moyamoya disease were excluded. We compared rupture rates of familial vs sporadic UIA using a Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusted for PHASES score and smoking. We performed 2 analyses: (1) only studies defining first-degree relatives as parents, children, and siblings and (2) all studies, including those in which first-degree relatives are defined as only parents and children, but not siblings.

Results

We pooled IPD from 8 cohorts with a low and moderate risk of bias. First-degree relatives were defined as parents, siblings, and children in 6 cohorts (29% Dutch, 55% Finnish, 15% Japanese), totaling 2,297 patients (17% familial, 399 patients) with 3,089 UIAs and 7,301 person-years follow-up. Rupture occurred in 10 familial cases (rupture rate: 0.89%/person-year; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–1.59) and 41 sporadic cases (0.66%/person-year; 95% CI 0.48–0.89); adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for familial cases 2.56 (95% CI 1.18–5.56). After adding the 2 cohorts excluding siblings as first-degree relatives, resulting in 9,511 patients, the adjusted HR was 1.44 (95% CI 0.86–2.40).

Discussion

The risk of rupture of UIA is 2.5 times higher, with a range from a 1.2 to 5 times higher risk, in familial than in sporadic UIA. When assessing the risk of rupture in UIA, family history should be taken into account.

### Recurrence of intracranial aneurysms in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease [^115gc6N9]. Kidney International (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The natural history of intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) in individuals with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is poorly defined.

Methods

We followed twenty ADPKD subjects, eleven with ruptured and nine with intact ICA, for 15.2 ± 8.1 years (range, 6.0 to 33.2 years). Initial diagnosis was by four-vessel cerebral angiography in eighteen subjects. Follow-up examinations were four-vessel cerebral angiography in fourteen and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in six subjects. We examined the occurrence of new ICAs, an increase in size of existing ICAs, recurrent rupture or surgical intervention, and death.

Results

Age at initial diagnosis of ICA was 37.7 ± 10.4 years (range, 20.2 to 53.1 years). Seventeen subjects (85%) had an anterior and three (15%) had a posterior ICA at initial diagnosis. On restudy, five subjects (25%) had a significant change, consisting of new ICAs in a different location in all five and an increase in size of an existing ICA in two of the five. All subjects with ruptured ICA and one subject with intact ICA had undergone surgery at the time of initial diagnosis. Ten subjects (50%) underwent further surgery 8.1 ± 6.1 years later (1.3 to 17 years). No subject died during follow-up and one subject experienced a recurrent RICA (RICA). We were unable to identify risk factors associated with development of a new ICA or increase in size of an existing ICA.

Conclusion

Individuals with ADPKD and ICA appear to be at moderate risk for new ICAs and increase in size of existing ICAs; mortality and risk of recurrent rupture, however, appear to be low.

### Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^117BYpy1]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited cause of kidney disease. Enlarging cysts within the kidneys are the clinical hallmark of the disease. Renal manifestations include varying degrees of kidney injury, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and hematuria. Extrarenal manifestations can include pain, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, hepatic cysts, intracranial aneurysm, diverticulosis, and abdominal and inguinal hernias. The progression of ADPKD cannot be reversed with current treatment modalities; therefore, therapies target the resulting clinical manifestations. Early detection and management of hypertension are important to delay the progression of renal dysfunction and development of cardiovascular complications. Pain management includes evaluation of concomitant illnesses, use of analgesics, and adjuvant therapy. Fluoroquinolones may be the most useful class of antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections because of their lipophilic properties and bactericidal action against gram-negative pathogens. Nephrolithiasis is twice as common in persons with ADPKD compared with the general population and is suggested by flank pain with or without hematuria. Cystic hemorrhages usually resolve within one week, although microscopic hematuria may still be present. Because of the proliferative effect of estrogen on hepatic cysts, oral contraceptives containing estrogen and menopausal estrogen therapy should be administered at the lowest effective dose or avoided in patients with ADPKD. Intracranial aneurysms are at least twice as common in patients with ADPKD than in the general population. Renal ultrasonography is the diagnostic modality of choice to screen at-risk individuals for ADPKD.

### Prevalence of intracranial aneurysm in patients with aortic disease in Korea: a nationwide population-based study [^112nRvcG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Understanding the prevalence of IA in the setting of concurrent AD is important not just for long‐term patient health, but also perioperatively. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of IA rupture during an aortic operation for such patients because cerebral perfusion pressure may increase temporarily by clamping or balloon occlusion of the aorta. 14 Empirical observations by one group have pointed to an increased risk of IA rupture after surgical thoracic aortic aneurysm repair (2 patients). 10 Subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to IA rupture is a life‐threatening event with substantial morbidity and mortality; 40% of hospitalized patients die within 1 month and 30% of survivors have persistent neurologic deficits. 26 In contrast, the rate of adverse outcomes after treatment of unruptured IA has been as low as 1%. 27 Therefore, early identification of IAs and measures, such as strict postoperative blood pressure control to the AD patient population, are likely to confer significant benefits. This is very important and should be taken into account when considering patients with aortic aneurysms for a systematic screening to identify IAs. Indeed, in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the prevalence of associated IA was around 10% to 12%, with a 4 times higher risk. 28, 29 According to this relative risk, some have advised a systematic screening with magnetic resonance angiogram for IA in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. 30 The present study demonstrated that the prevalence of IA in patients with AD was estimated at 6.8%. This is about 11 times higher than in the general population. Despite a high prevalence of IA, no systematic screening for IA is proposed for patients with AD.

### Development of de novo intracranial aneurysm in three months: case report and literature review [^117Et9ND]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Summary

Formation of de novo intracranial aneurysms is rare. Their etiology is not known, but they are seen in patients with inherited collagen disorders, polycystic kidney disease, and familial history of aneurysms. Most de novo intracranial aneurysms are found 3–20 years after diagnosis of the initial aneurysm. We report the imaging findings in a 46-year-old man who developed a de novo intracranial aneurysm only 3 months after surgical clipping of another aneurysm.

### Molecular analysis of a consanguineous Iranian polycystic kidney disease family identifies a PKD2 mutation that aids diagnostics [^1126tZiZ]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic kidney diseases (PKD) are a group of monogenic disorders characterized by cyst development in the kidney, but also often have extrarenal manifestations. This group of disorders has been linked to defects in the functioning of primary cilia and therefore are termed ciliopathies. The most common form of the disease (incidence 1/500–1000) is autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) that is typically a late onset disease characterized by progressive cyst development and often resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Clinically significant extrarenal manifestations include severe polycystic liver disease and an increased prevalence of intracranial aneurysms. ADPKD is genetically heterogeneous with two genes known, PKD1 and PKD2. PKD1 accounts for ~85% of clinical cases and is associated with more severe disease, with ESRD at 54.3 y compared to 74 y for PKD2. Recent data from Cornec-Le Gall also indicated a significance difference in age at ESRD between PKD1 cases with truncating compared to non-truncating mutations (55.6 y vs. 67.9 y, respectively). Diagnostics is usually possible by renal imaging with specific criteria determined for a positive diagnosis by ultrasound, but molecular diagnostic screens can also be helpful to determine the gene involved and to identify at-risk individuals. In particular, knowing the gene and mutation type can be of prognostic value (see above), and in rare cases where there is interest, facilitate preimplantation genetic diagnostics.

The most common recessive form of PKD, autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD; incidence 1:20,000), is most often a neonatal onset disorder and associated with significant neonatal demise; although adult presentation of the disease associated with at least one hypomorphic allele is increasingly recognized. A number of other recessively inherited, syndromic forms of PKD have additional disease manifestations likely associated with ciliary dysfunction. These diseases include the lethal Meckel syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Bardet Biedl syndrome and orofacial digital syndrome. Extrarenal manifestations range from liver, eye and digital defects to central nervous system abnormalities, including mental retardation. These rare disorders are enriched in consanguineous populations.

We describe here a complex Iranian family with multiple consanguineous relationships that manifests PKD, but also a number of other abnormalities, including heart defects, renal agenesis and mental retardation. Molecular testing of the ADPKD genes identified the molecular defect; highlighted variability associated with this mutation, and diagnosed at-risk individuals with negative or equivocal renal imaging data.

### Cerebral aneurysms in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a comparison of management approaches [^111gVG1a]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a risk factor for formation of intracranial aneurysms (IAs), though the ideal screening and treatment strategies in this population are unclear.

Objective

To report outcomes of observation, open surgical, or endovascular management of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms in patients with ADPKD.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with ADPKD and IAs at a single center from 2000 to 2016.

Results

Forty-five patients with ADPKD harboring 71 aneurysms were identified, including 11 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Of 22 aneurysms managed with observation, none ruptured in 136 yr of clinical follow-up. Thirty-five aneurysms were treated with open surgery and 14 with an endovascular approach. Among treated aneurysms, poor neurologic outcome (modified Rankin scale > 2) was seen only in patients presenting with SAH (17% SAH vs 0% elective, P = 0.06). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was also significantly associated with SAH presentation (22% SAH vs 0% elective, P = 0.05). Neither procedural complications nor AKI were associated with treatment modality. Among 175 yr of radiographic follow-up in patients with known IAs, 8 de novo aneurysms were found, including 3 that were treated. Of 11 patients with SAH, 7 ruptured in the setting of previously known ADPKD, including 2 with prior angiographic screening and 5 without screening.

Conclusion

Poor outcomes occurred only with ruptured presentation but were equivalent between treatment modalities. Screening is performed only selectively, and 64% (7 of 11) of patients presenting with SAH had previously known ADPKD.

### Beyond polycystic kidney disease [^1151Bme4]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) may have either recessive or dominant autosomal transmission. Recessive disease appears, in most cases, during the first year of life, usually with serious impairment of the renal function. Autosomal dominant PKD incidence is up to 1/1000 individuals. In 85% of cases, it results from PKD1 gene mutation, with the remaining 15% being caused by PKD2 gene mutation. It is characterised by bilateral renal cysts and progression to end-stage kidney failure. Other possible manifestations are hepatic and pancreatic cysts, aortic and cerebral aneurysms, hepatic fibrosis, intestinal diverticula and heart valve defects.

Although PKD and TS are two different genetic diseases, there is a rare subgroup of patients where the association between both entities is well established — the so called TSC2/PKD1 Contiguous Gene Syndrome. This syndrome occurs due to a large deletion involving the genes responsible for both diseases, the TSC2/PKD1 genes.

### A young patient with a family history of hypertension [^117Prsza]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The evaluation of causes of hypertension in young adults with a family history of hypertension needs to be methodical to identify potentially treatable causes. Renal- and renovascular imaging and measurement of plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity are at the core of this evaluation in most patients. Pertinent aspects of hypertension in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are discussed with a focus on the role of the endothelium in mediating early hypertension and a review of treatment strategies. Finally, the possibility that autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and primary aldosteronism are connected beyond coincidence is explored; evidence to support it is scant, although there is a likely role for aldosterone excess and the resultant hypokalemia in promoting cyst growth.

### Novel PKD1 mutation (C.G10086T) drives high intracranial aneurysm risk in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^113eRuSr]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is frequently complicated by intracranial aneurysms (IAs). However, the genetic factors driving the elevated IA risk in ADPKD remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel PKD1 mutation associated with a remarkably high IA incidence in a large Chinese ADPKD family.

Methods

We conducted whole‐exome sequencing in a three‐generation Chinese ADPKD family (n = 24) characterized by an unusually high IA prevalence. The pathogenicity of the identified PKD1 variant was validated through comprehensive functional studies, including protein localization, calcium signaling, and endothelial cell behavior analyses.

Results

We discovered a novel PKD1 mutation (c.G10086T) that co‐segregated with disease in all affected family members. Notably, 38.1% (8/21) of the mutation carriers developed IAs, a significantly higher rate than reported in general ADPKD populations (4%–11.5%). Functional studies revealed that this mutation disrupted polycystin‐1 trafficking and impaired calcium signaling, leading to endothelial dysfunction. In vitro experiments demonstrated enhanced angiogenic potential and compromised vascular integrity in cells expressing mutant PKD1.

Conclusions

The newly identified PKD1 :c.G10086T mutation represents a high‐risk genetic variant for IA development in ADPKD. Our findings provide new insights into the vascular complications of ADPKD and suggest that PKD1 genotyping may help identify patients requiring intensive IA surveillance. This study supports the development of mutation‐specific screening strategies for ADPKD‐associated vascular complications.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to prognosis, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize the prognostic value of the following factors in ADPKD:

- the disease-causing gene influences the severity of kidney disease

- the type of PKD1 pathogenic variant influences the severity of kidney disease

- the severity of kidney disease progression in the family can guide likely outcomes in other affected family members

- male sex is a possible prognostic factor for more severe disease

- overweight and obesity are likely risk factors for faster progression of kidney disease

- a higher salt intake level is associated with faster progression of ADPKD

- height-adjusted total kidney volume predicts future decline in kidney function

- ultrasound-determined total kidney volume and kidney-length measurements have prognostic value, but they are less precise than measurements using MRI or CT.

### Intracranial aneurysm and recessive polycystic kidney disease: the third reported case… [^1169zseU]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Results In the presence of only 3 cases in the medical literature, one might conclude they are a simple coincidence. However, should this association exist, such as with the dominant form, then the neurologic prognosis and even the life of young patients may be at stake. Conclusions Given the devastating consequences of intracranial bleeding in young patients, early neurologic screening may be warranted. The results of the rest of the laboratory examinations were all within the normal limits. A noninjected brain scan showed a right parenchymal parietal hematoma with surrounding edema. For technical reasons, the scheduled angiographic magnetic resonance imaging was replaced by an injected 64-slice angiographic scan that revealed a 5. 7-mm aneurysm of the right anterior choroid artery. The association between intracranial aneurysms and the dominant form of PKD occurs in 5% to 10% of cases.

1, 4 This association is exceedingly rare in cases of recessive PKD; it has been reported only twice in the medical literature. 3, 6 Reported in 1999, the first patient was a 31-year-old woman diagnosed as having ARPKD at the age of 14 years. 6 Her renal function deteriorated progressively until the age of 29 years, when she received a kidney transplant. During a routine follow-up for recurrent headaches at the age of 31 years, 4 intracranial aneurysms were discovered on neuroimaging and were successfully clipped. Reported in 2001, the second patient was a 2. 5-year-old girl without any family history of PKD. 3 She was diagnosed as having ARPKD and moderate renal failure while being investigated for pulmonary infection. In the presence of the dominant form of PKD and given the devastating consequences of aneurysmal rupture, systematic screening of the brain is currently recommended when patients reach the age of 30 years and must be repeated every 5 to 10 years.

1 These recommendations are mainly based on the risk for intracranial bleeding. The potentially life-threatening complications of intracranial bleeding in very young patients argue strongly in favor of the systematic early detection of cerebral aneurysms. The scarcity of reported cases may be owing to the low incidence of ARPKD and the short life expectancy of these patients. Early systematic neurologic screening of patients with ARPKD may increase the number of cases diagnosed as having intracranial aneurysms and provide new material for clinical and genetic studies.

### Intracranial aneurysms: current evidence and clinical… [^1146jBoe]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Inherited and acquired risk factors have been associated with the formation of intracranial aneurysms. 3 Familial clustering of these aneurysms may occur with no other history of hereditary disease. The incidence of intracranial aneurysms is between 8 and 9 percent in persons with two or more relatives who have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage or an aneurysm. 4, 5 Compared with other family members, the siblings of affected persons have a higher risk of developing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
6. 7 found that intracranial aneurysms may develop in 10 to 15 percent of patients with polycystic kidney disease, an autosomal dominant condition. Although Marfan syndrome was previously identified as a risk factor for aneurysms, a recent detailed study 8 found no significant relationship.

Coarctation of the aorta, fibromuscular dysplasia, and pheochromocytoma have been associated with intracranial aneurysms, most likely because of the elevated blood pressures that occur in these conditions.
3. Screening of patients with a positive family history of ruptured intracranial aneurysm is controversial. Patients with one affected first-degree relative should be differentiated from those with more than one such relative. In one study. The issue of screening in patients who have two or more family members with intracranial aneurysms is more complicated. Although several studies. 27, 28 have advocated the use of screening in this patient population, the conclusions were based on higher aneurysmal rupture rates than the ISUIA study found. A more recent analysis 29 indicated that screening does not reduce significant morbidity or mortality in these patients.

Therefore, the decision on whether or not to screen for intracranial aneurysms in patients who have two or more first-degree relatives with documented subarachnoid hemorrhage is best decided on a case-by-case basis. 7 However, the decision to screen these patients should be based on their overall health. In patients with a history of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, the annual rate of new aneurysm formation is between 1 and 2 percent, and the risk of aneurysmal rupture appears to be increased. 30 Therefore, surveillance of these patients with magnetic resonance angiography or intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography may be justified. 23.

### Management of risk factors in relatives of patients with SAH… [^117YPF7Q]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

to the editor: I read and enjoyed the article, "Intracranial Aneurysms: Current Evidence and Clinical Practice, ". 1 in American Family Physician and agree with screening the proposed groups: patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and patients with a history of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. I also agree with the consensus of not routinely screening for unruptured intracranial aneurysms in relatives of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, because of the increased morbidity and mortality associated with elective surgical intervention/repair of unruptured aneurysms. This is based on the result of the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms 2 that shows a decrease in the previously thought rupture rate of intracranial aneurysms:

0. 05 percent per year in patients with no previous SAH, and
0.

5 percent per year for large aneurysms, and for all aneurysms in patients with previous SAH, compared with the previously proposed rupture rate of 1 to 2 percent per year.
3. Table 1 in the article 1 listed the risk factors for intracranial aneurysm formation and SAH; these risk factors could be diminished or eliminated in at-risk patients. While the evidence is strong against routine screening of all relatives of patients with SAH, the issue of careful history taking to identify additional risk factors that could be prevented or corrected was not addressed in the article.

### Office collection of family… [^117NugP6]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Assessment Regardless of whether family history was collected in the physician's office or the patient's home, assessment should occur at the initial patient evaluation and be updated periodically to identify newly diagnosed medical or developmental conditions within the family. Physicians should begin with recording the current age and age at onset of symptoms or diagnosis of the patient and first-, second-, and third-degree relatives on each side of the family. The age and cause of death for deceased family members also should be recorded. The accuracy of information generally decreases as the degree of relatedness decreases. Therefore, physicians should note when information is from a medical source instead of a family report. Conditions that are thought to occur sporadically actually could be inherited. For example, a family history of multiple relatives with Down syndrome suggests an inherited translocation, not sporadic non-disjunction.

A woman may not realize that her paternal grandmother's and aunt's breast cancer diagnoses confer the same risk to her as if they were maternal relatives. Therefore, encouraging ascertainment of health information for three generations of relatives is warranted. 22 In these patients, awareness of their disease risk is important because early diagnosis avoids prolonged evaluation for other disorders and makes effective treatment possible. When Family History Suggests a Genetic Condition In some patients, the family history may be significant enough to consider genetic testing for an identified or suspected mutation in a single gene. If the tested gene is a component of a complex disease, a found mutation offers susceptibility or predictive, but not confirmatory, information.

The degree of risk attributable to variations or mutations in a single gene can range from a modest contribution in complex disease to near 100 percent certainty. For example, a variation in the. Susceptibility or predictive testing for familial cancers may significantly decrease morbidity or mortality by changing the management of the disease. Alternative screening with lower specificity but higher sensitivity may be sought, and chemoprophylaxis may be offered. Family history also may guide diagnosis even when DNA-based genetic testing is not available for an inherited condition. In a child presenting with a syncopal episode, a family history of syncope prompts consideration of long QT syndrome.

27 In an adult presenting with fatigue or arthralgias, a family history of diabetes and cirrhosis should signal measurement of transferrin saturation and consideration of hereditary hemochromatosis. 28.
