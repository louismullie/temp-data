## Question

Side effects of cortisone injections to knee

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of cortisone (corticosteroid) injections to the knee, organized by frequency, mechanism, and patient-specific risks, with practical counseling and guideline alignment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and typical indications. Then, I should categorize adverse effects by local versus systemic and immediate versus delayed. Next, I will quantify risks where possible and flag high-certainty signals. After that, I should consider special populations and procedural modifiers. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based counseling and monitoring recommendations, and close with a balanced, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and typical use. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are commonly used for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis to provide short-term pain relief and improved function, with benefits generally peaking within 1–2 weeks and waning by 3 months, and with variable durability across studies and patients [^1169S5Jd] [^113fWaJr] [^114NBF9J].

> I will now examine local adverse effects, starting with immediate post-injection reactions. Post-injection flare occurs in roughly 1–2% and typically presents 6–12 hours after injection with transient pain, warmth, and swelling; it is usually self-limited and responsive to NSAIDs, but I should double-check for infection if symptoms persist beyond 2–3 days or if systemic features develop [^116T2DAL] [^1174Lit2]. Local skin changes, including hypopigmentation and subcutaneous atrophy, can occur days to weeks after injection and are more likely with superficial placement or repeated injections; these are typically cosmetic and may improve over time, but I need to counsel patients accordingly [^1174Lit2] [^115HQqci].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about infection risk. Septic arthritis is rare but serious; incidence estimates range widely, with some series suggesting up to 1 in 3,000 in routine practice, and risk is minimized with strict aseptic technique and avoidance of injection through infected skin; I should confirm that patients with systemic infection or overlying cellulitis defer injection until cleared [^115mdEYU] [^1174Lit2] [^111yVeiK]. I need to ensure I also discuss perioperative infection risk, as injections within about 3 months of arthroplasty may increase prosthetic joint infection risk, prompting many guidelines to recommend a steroid-free interval before surgery when feasible [^111yVeiK] [^117VJiiZ].

> Next, I should review structural joint effects, because this is where long-term harm may accrue. Repeated triamcinolone injections every 12 weeks for 2 years led to greater cartilage volume loss without pain benefit in a randomized trial, supporting a dose- and frequency-dependent chondrotoxic signal; observational data also link repeated injections to accelerated radiographic progression and higher arthroplasty rates, although confounding cannot be fully excluded and some cohorts show null associations, so I must frame this as a potential harm signal rather than a deterministic outcome [^116QqUi7] [^113eAWEC] [^112ziRAh] [^112DHUs8]. But wait, what if the patient has severe synovitis where anti-inflammatory benefit might outweigh structural risk? The balance remains uncertain, so I should individualize and minimize cumulative exposure when possible [^111Z1r2e].

> Let me consider tendon-related complications. Although less common in the knee than peri-tendon sites, corticosteroids can weaken collagen and predispose to tendon rupture, particularly with forceful activity shortly after injection; I should advise avoiding strenuous loading for several days and screen for preexisting tendinopathy or partial tears before injecting near tendon insertions [^1174Lit2] [^115HQqci].

> I will now examine osseous complications. Subchondral insufficiency fractures and osteonecrosis are rare but reported, especially with repeated injections and in patients with low bone mineral density; given the potential for structural harm, I should avoid routine repeat injections and reassess the risk–benefit balance at each visit [^1174Lit2] [^116T2DAL].

> Turning to systemic effects, I need to check the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis impact. Even a single intra-articular dose can cause secondary adrenal suppression in a meaningful subset of patients, with suppression beginning within 12–48 hours and typically resolving in 30–42 days; extended-release formulations show a similar timeline, so I should counsel patients about fatigue, dizziness, or hypotension and consider adrenal insufficiency in the differential if symptoms arise post-injection [^114KhHjc] [^1154FRvE]. Routine cortisol monitoring is not recommended, but clinical vigilance is prudent in at-risk patients or those with symptoms suggestive of adrenal crisis [^111yVeiK].

> Hyperglycemia is a predictable and clinically important systemic effect. In patients with diabetes, fasting and postprandial glucose can rise within hours and peak around 1–2 days, with effects lasting up to a week; extended-release triamcinolone may blunt glycemic excursions compared with immediate-release, but monitoring for at least 48–72 hours is advisable, and longer if baseline control is poor or higher doses are used [^114ft7s2] [^113wjJvL] [^111yVeiK]. I should confirm that patients with diabetes have a monitoring plan and adjust insulin or oral agents proactively when indicated [^111yVeiK].

> Other systemic effects are less common but worth noting. Facial flushing occurs in a minority, hypertension may transiently worsen, and bone mineral density can decline with repeated injections; rare events include mood changes, insomnia, and ocular effects such as glaucoma or cataracts in predisposed patients, so I should screen for risk factors and limit cumulative exposure when possible [^1174Lit2] [^114WkgjA].

> Let me think about patient-specific modifiers. In diabetes, I should intensify glucose monitoring and consider extended-release formulations if available; in patients with osteoporosis or low BMD, I should minimize repeat injections; in those on anticoagulation with therapeutic INR, withholding warfarin is generally unnecessary with proper technique; and in patients facing arthroplasty, I should coordinate timing to respect the 3-month steroid-free interval when feasible to mitigate infection risk [^111yVeiK] [^113wjJvL] [^117VJiiZ]. For athletes, I should weigh transient performance gains against structural risks and counsel on load management post-injection [^1174Lit2].

> Next, I should review procedural modifiers that influence risk. Ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and reduces procedural pain compared with landmark-based injection, which may reduce extravasation and soft-tissue complications; I should also confirm intra-articular placement when possible, as misplacement can increase local tissue atrophy and reduce efficacy [^113F2nm4] [^114buFou] [^115mdEYU]. Regarding dosing, 40 mg triamcinolone appears as effective as 80 mg for knee OA, so using the lowest effective dose and extending intervals between injections is prudent to limit cumulative exposure and potential harm [^114VzM8g] [^111Z1r2e].

> I should double-check the perioperative timing guidance. Multiple societies advise avoiding intra-articular corticosteroids within about 3 months of joint replacement and at least 1 month before surgery when possible due to infection risk, with individualized risk–benefit discussions if timing cannot be adjusted; this is particularly salient in arthroplasty pathways and should be documented in the plan [^111yVeiK] [^117VJiiZ] [^113kGR7j].

> Now, I will integrate guideline positions to ensure balanced counseling. The AAOS suggests intra-articular corticosteroids can be considered for short-term relief up to 3 months, but downgrades the recommendation due to potential acceleration of OA progression with repeated injections; the ACR strongly recommends intra-articular glucocorticoids for knee OA, emphasizing short-term efficacy; and VA/DoD guidance highlights time-limited benefits and advises caution with repeated dosing, aligning with the structural harm signal seen in trials [^114NBF9J] [^115XUinh] [^112eWKZr]. Shared decision-making should explicitly weigh transient pain relief against potential cartilage loss and infection risks, especially with repeated injections [^114NBF9J].

> Let me reconsider the overall risk profile to ensure I am not overstating rare events. Serious complications such as septic arthritis and osteonecrosis are uncommon with proper technique and patient selection, whereas mild local reactions and transient hyperglycemia are more frequent; the dominant long-term concern is cumulative structural harm with repeated injections, which supports a conservative approach to frequency and a preference for noninvasive therapies as first-line [^1174Lit2] [^115HQqci] [^116QqUi7].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical counseling. Before injection, I will screen for infection, review diabetes control and anticoagulation, and discuss expected duration of benefit and the risks of repeat injections; during the procedure, I will use aseptic technique and consider ultrasound guidance; post-injection, I will advise limited weight-bearing for 24–48 hours, watch for post-injection flare, and arrange glucose monitoring for patients with diabetes; and for patients considering surgery, I will coordinate timing to respect the 3-month steroid-free interval when feasible, documenting the shared decision-making conversation [^111yVeiK] [^112oTcfp] [^113wjJvL].

Cortisone injections to the knee are generally safe when used appropriately, but they can cause **local and systemic side effects** [^1174Lit2]. The most common local effects are **post-injection flare**, skin atrophy, and depigmentation, while rare complications include infection and tendon rupture [^1174Lit2] [^113Q4FR2]. Systemic effects include transient hyperglycemia, especially in diabetics, and adrenal suppression with repeated injections [^114ft7s2] [^1162Wa7W]. Repeated injections may accelerate cartilage loss and increase the risk of arthroplasty, so **limit injections to 3–4 per year** and use the lowest effective dose [^111Z1r2e] [^116QqUi7] [^112ziRAh] [^116T2DAL]. Most side effects are mild and self-limited, but patients should be monitored for infection, hyperglycemia, and tendon symptoms [^1162Wa7W].

---

## Local side effects

Local side effects are the **most common** and typically occur at the injection site:

- **Post-injection flare**: Transient increase in pain and swelling within 24–48 hours, occurring in 1–2% of patients [^116T2DAL].

- **Skin atrophy and depigmentation**: Thinning or lightening of skin at the injection site, especially with repeated injections [^1174Lit2].

- **Infection**: Rare but serious, including septic arthritis, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 3,000 injections [^115mdEYU].

- **Tendon rupture**: Rare, associated with repeated injections or direct tendon injection [^1174Lit2].

---

## Systemic side effects

Systemic side effects are **less common** but can occur, particularly with repeated injections:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Transient elevation in blood glucose, especially in patients with diabetes, lasting up to 7 days [^111yVeiK].

- **Adrenal suppression**: Repeated injections can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, though usually reversible [^114KhHjc].

- **Facial flushing**: Transient and benign, occurring in a small proportion of patients [^1174Lit2].

---

## Long-term risks

Long-term or repeated cortisone injections carry **additional risks**:

- **Cartilage degeneration**: Repeated injections can accelerate cartilage loss and osteoarthritis progression [^116QqUi7].

- **Increased risk of arthroplasty**: Observational data suggest higher rates of subsequent knee replacement with repeated injections [^112ziRAh].

- **Bone density loss**: Chronic use may reduce periarticular bone mineral density [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Certain patients are at **higher risk** of side effects:

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Increased risk of hyperglycemia; monitor glucose closely [^111yVeiK].

- **Immunosuppression**: Higher infection risk; use caution [^notfound].

- **Anticoagulation**: Bleeding risk is low but present; weigh risks and benefits [^111yVeiK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **limiting the frequency and dose** of cortisone injections:

- **Maximum frequency**: No more than 3–4 injections per year per joint [^115dgTTi].

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the minimum effective dose to reduce side effects [^111Z1r2e].

- **Preoperative considerations**: Avoid injections within 3 months of planned joint replacement surgery due to infection risk [^117VJiiZ].

---

## Summary of side effects and risks

| **Side effect category** | **Common side effects** | **Rare but serious side effects** |
|-|-|-|
| Local | - Post-injection flare <br/> - Skin atrophy <br/> - Depigmentation | - Infection <br/> - Tendon rupture |
| Systemic | - Hyperglycemia <br/> - Facial flushing | - Adrenal suppression |
| Long-term | - Cartilage degeneration <br/> - Increased arthroplasty risk | - Bone density loss |

---

Cortisone injections to the knee are effective for short-term pain relief but carry risks of local and systemic side effects, especially with repeated use. Adhering to **clinical guidelines** — limiting frequency and dose — and monitoring for adverse effects can minimize these risks.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: what the orthopaedic provider needs to know [^111k87Nn]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been used for decades in the management of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee and remain a common practice. The pain relief from a steroid injection is thought to work by reducing inflammation within the arthritic knee. Substantial variability remains among providers with regard to the technique used to perform the procedure, including the site of the injection, the medications injected, and the level of sterility. The success of steroid injections in relieving arthritic knee pain most often occurs in the short term. However, the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections varies within the published literature. The latest American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline does not support conclusive recommendations about the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Providers should be aware of the adverse effects and potential complications of these injections when using them in clinical practice.

### Critical appraisal of intra-articular glucocorticoid injections for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee [^115eFtzG]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intra-articular (IA) injections of glucocorticoids (GCs) have been shown to decrease pain, increase mobility, and improve quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Concerns about cartilage loss with IA GCs have prompted reconsideration of their use in knee OA. This review has three objectives: 1) critically review the clinical, molecular, and structural effects of IA GCs in knee OA; 2) provide a design for a clinical trial aimed at improving our understanding of the long-term consequences of IA GCs; and 3) provide practical guidance on the use of IA GCs in patients with knee OA based on current information.

Design

A narrative review of current literature on the use of IA GCs for OA of the knee.

Results

Important questions remain to be fully answered with respect to IA GCs, including long-term effects on all aspects of the structural and molecular environment of the knee, and identification of factors that can reliably predict a positive or negative response to IA GCs.

Conclusions

While awaiting results from an appropriately designed study, several provisional statements regarding IA GCs can be put forward: 1) IA GCs appear to be a relatively safe option that is effective in specific patients with symptomatic knee OA; 2) there is no definitive evidence that IA GCs accelerate joint deterioration to an important extent or hastens the requirement for knee replacement; and 3) there are few contraindications to IA GCs and injection-associated complications are rare when IA GCs are delivered with proper technique.

### Local and systemic side effects of corticosteroid injections for musculoskeletal indications [^1174Lit2]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid injections can be associated with a range of potential side effects, which may be classified as local or systemic and further stratified as immediate or delayed in onset. Radiologists performing image-guided musculoskeletal injections should recognize the potential side effects of corticosteroid medication when counseling patients before injection and consider such side effects in planning individual injections. This Review summarizes the available evidence regarding the local and systemic side effects of corticosteroid injections performed for musculoskeletal indications. Local side effects include postinjection flare, skin hypopigmentation and atrophy, infection, tendon rupture, accelerated progression of osteoarthritis, and osseous injury. Systemic side effects include adrenal suppression or insufficiency, facial flushing, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis. Additional targeted counseling is warranted regarding side effects that are specific to certain patient populations (i.e., premenopausal women, patients with diabetes, athletes, and pediatric patients). Corticosteroid injections are contraindicated in the presence of superficial or deep infection, fracture, or a prosthetic joint. Guidelines on the frequency, duration, and maximal lifetime use of corticosteroid injections are currently lacking. Further research is needed regarding the long-term complications of continuous corticosteroid use, particularly with regard to osseous effects.

### Intra-articular corticosteroids for osteoarthritis of the knee [^1169S5Jd]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are intra-articular corticosteroids associated with improvement in pain and physical function compared with sham injection or no intervention in patients with knee osteoarthritis?

Bottom Line

Intra-articular corticosteroids may be associated with moderate improvement in pain and a small improvement in physical function up to 6 weeks after injection. However, the quality of the evidence is low.

### A randomized trial of intra-articular injection therapy for knee osteoarthritis [^111Wo5Bx]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This single-center randomized placebo-controlled trial compared intra-articular injection treatments in patients with mild to moderate OA of the knee. We found no significant difference in pain relief comparing glucocorticoid, hyaluronic acid, PRP, and placebo during the first 6 months after injection. Secondary outcomes including stiffness, Tegner Activity Scale, and clinical parameters of knee mobility were small and comparable among treatment groups. To take into account the structure of the data (patients measured over time) and to control for covariates, all results discussed are based on the LMM.

In the glucocorticoid group, pain reduction assessed with "pain NRS" score and WOMAC questionnaire was pronounced 1 week after the injection and vanished after 3 months. This is similar to a systematic reviewof 27 trials by the Cochrane group in 2015, which found a moderate reduction in knee pain in the first 1 to 2 weeks and no more pain reduction after 26 weeks. Although data in this review showed a difference in improved pain scores of 1.0 cm on a 10-cm NRS between corticosteroids and sham injections, our data found no difference in pain outcome between patients in the placebo and glucocorticoid group. Furthermore, the pain reduction in all our groups stayed mostly below a clinically relevant threshold, which is 30% of the baseline pain. For functional improvements, our observed effects were similar to the Cochrane analysis. In our study, the Tegner Activity Scale showed only small changes, with minimal improvement 3 months after the glucocorticoid injection. Glucocorticoid injections are frequently used in patients with knee OA, but whether the benefit exceeds the potential harms remains controversial. Recent studies indicated potential negative side such as loss of cartilage after repeated injections, transient meniscal thickness reduction, and increased risk of knee OA progression. Structural changes after the injection in our patients will be assessed in a separate article covering using magnetic resonance imaging data.

### Injectable corticosteroids in treatment of arthritis of the knee [^112TNUby]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Injection of corticosteroid preparations for the local treatment of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the knee, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, has been used widely since the 1950s. This local therapy minimizes systemic toxicity and can result in rapid improvement in symptoms, most often as an adjunctive therapy for acute or severe symptom flares. The evidence assessing safety and efficacy is reviewed and analyzed. Intra-articular knee injection technique is described and is a procedure that is easy to learn and can be performed quickly in an office or hospital setting.

### Effects of a single intra-articular injection of a microsphere formulation of triamcinolone acetonide on knee osteoarthritis pain: a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational study [^115tgkw9]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

In 1955, intra-articular injection of corticosteroids (particularly hydrocortisone acetate) was reported to be effective in 80% of arthritic joints, but the transitory nature of the effect "limited its practical value as a therapy". Subsequently, more potent synthetic corticosteroids replaced hydrocortisone for intra-articular indications; controlled clinical studies of these analogs also demonstrated short-term effects. Pharmacokinetic study indicated the efflux of corticosteroids from the joint within hours of injection.

Osteoarthritic pain represents a major health problem for aging and increasingly obese populations. Modern evidence-based management guidelines from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommend a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies, including joint replacement. In practice, the utility of oral pharmacotherapy is limited by modest efficacy and side effects, and the treatment effect of intra-articular hyaluronic acid preparations has been questioned. Despite the short-term efficacy, and perhaps reflecting the paucity of effective alternatives, intra-articular corticosteroid use is common. Among beneficiaries with knee osteoarthritis identified from a 1999 to 2013 Medicare 5% sample, > 25% of the nearly 12 million people with knee osteoarthritis received intra-articular corticosteroid injections; the fraction of newly diagnosed knee patients receiving intra-articular corticosteroids increased from 0.27 to 0.45 during the time period.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^114Ng5Rb]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is an intramuscular glucocorticoid injection noninferior to an intra-articular glucocorticoid injection in reducing knee pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis in primary care?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial including 145 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis found intramuscular injection of the glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide could present an inferior effect in reducing pain at 4 weeks compared with the intra-articular injection. Noninferiority of an intramuscular injection was observed at 8 and 24 weeks after injection.

Meaning

The findings of this trial suggest both types of injection should be considered effective strategies and that a shared decision-making process should take place between clinicians and patients with knee osteoarthritis when a glucocorticoid injection is indicated.

### The magnitude and duration of the effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections on pain severity in knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11368Xmr]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of the study were to clarify the evidence on the magnitude and duration of treatment effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis compared with placebo, to evaluate a treatment effect by steroid type, and to describe the reported adverse effects.

Design

Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. The risk of systematic bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's domain-based evaluation framework.

Results

The final sample included eight randomized controlled studies with follow-ups from 1 to 26 wks. The risk of systematic bias was considered low in five and high in three studies. The pooled standardized mean difference was -0.58 (95% confidence interval = -0.88 to -0.27) and number needed to treat 5.1 (95% confidence interval = 10.0 to 3.7). The heterogeneity was considerable. The pooled effect size approached the level of statistical insignificance at 4 mos. The pooled risk ratio of adverse effects was insignificant 0.95 (95% confidence interval = 0.34 to 2.55).

Conclusions

The intra-articular corticosteroid had a mild to moderate effect on pain severity up to 3 mos after the injection-much longer than it had previously been reported. The effect may vary substantially in different patient groups and appropriate patient selection is important. The risk of adverse effects was low.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid for knee osteoarthritis [^113fWaJr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of chronic pain, disability, and decreased quality of life. Despite the long-standing use of intra-articular corticosteroids, there is an ongoing debate about their benefits and safety. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of intra-articular corticosteroids compared with sham or no intervention in people with knee osteoarthritis in terms of pain, physical function, quality of life, and safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (from inception to 3 February 2015), checked trial registers, conference proceedings, reference lists, and contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared intra-articular corticosteroids with sham injection or no treatment in people with knee osteoarthritis. We applied no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pain, function, quality of life, joint space narrowing, and risk ratios (RRs) for safety outcomes. We combined trials using an inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Results

We identified 27 trials (13 new studies) with 1767 participants in this update. We graded the quality of the evidence as 'low' for all outcomes because treatment effect estimates were inconsistent with great variation across trials, pooled estimates were imprecise and did not rule out relevant or irrelevant clinical effects, and because most trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Intra-articular corticosteroids appeared to be more beneficial in pain reduction than control interventions (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.22), which corresponds to a difference in pain scores of 1.0 cm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale between corticosteroids and sham injection and translates into a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 (95% CI 6 to 13). An I(2) statistic of 68% indicated considerable between-trial heterogeneity. A visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested some asymmetry (asymmetry coefficient -1.21, 95%CI -3.58 to 1.17). When stratifying results according to length of follow-up, benefits were moderate at 1 to 2 weeks after end of treatment (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.27), small to moderate at 4 to 6 weeks (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.21), small at 13 weeks (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.00), and no evidence of an effect at 26 weeks (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.11). An I(2) statistic of ≥ 63% indicated a moderate to large degree of between-trial heterogeneity up to 13 weeks after end of treatment (P for heterogeneity ≤ 0.001), and an I(2) of 0% indicated low heterogeneity at 26 weeks (P = 0.43). There was evidence of lower treatment effects in trials that randomised on average at least 50 participants per group (P = 0.05) or at least 100 participants per group (P = 0.013), in trials that used concomittant viscosupplementation (P = 0.08), and in trials that used concomitant joint lavage (P ≤ 0.001). Corticosteroids appeared to be more effective in function improvement than control interventions (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.09), which corresponds to a difference in functions scores of -0.7 units on standardised Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) disability scale ranging from 0 to 10 and translates into a NNTB of 10 (95% CI 7 to 33). An I(2) statistic of 69% indicated a moderate to large degree of between-trial heterogeneity. A visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested asymmetry (asymmetry coefficient -4.07, 95% CI -8.08 to -0.05). When stratifying results according to length of follow-up, benefits were small to moderate at 1 to 2 weeks after end of treatment (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.14), small to moderate at 4 to 6 weeks (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.09), and no evidence of an effect at 13 weeks (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.10) or at 26 weeks (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.28). An I(2) statistic of ≥ 62% indicated a moderate to large degree of between-trial heterogeneity up to 13 weeks after end of treatment (P for heterogeneity ≤ 0.004), and an I(2) of 0% indicated low heterogeneity at 26 weeks (P = 0.52). We found evidence of lower treatment effects in trials that randomised on average at least 50 participants per group (P = 0.023), in unpublished trials (P = 0.023), in trials that used non-intervention controls (P = 0.031), and in trials that used concomitant viscosupplementation (P = 0.06). Participants on corticosteroids were 11% less likely to experience adverse events, but confidence intervals included the null effect (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.23, I(2) = 0%). Participants on corticosteroids were 67% less likely to withdraw because of adverse events, but confidence intervals were wide and included the null effect (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.07, I(2) = 0%). Participants on corticosteroids were 27% less likely to experience any serious adverse event, but confidence intervals were wide and included the null effect (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.67, I(2) = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of corticosteroids on quality of life compared to control (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.28, I(2) = 0%). There was also no evidence of an effect of corticosteroids on joint space narrowing compared to control interventions (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.46).

Authors' Conclusions

Whether there are clinically important benefits of intra-articular corticosteroids after one to six weeks remains unclear in view of the overall quality of the evidence, considerable heterogeneity between trials, and evidence of small-study effects. A single trial included in this review described adequate measures to minimise biases and did not find any benefit of intra-articular corticosteroids. In this update of the systematic review and meta-analysis, we found most of the identified trials that compared intra-articular corticosteroids with sham or non-intervention control small and hampered by low methodological quality. An analysis of multiple time points suggested that effects decrease over time, and our analysis provided no evidence that an effect remains six months after a corticosteroid injection.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^114S4Hex]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Intra-articular (IA) glucocorticoid injection is widely used in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), but the safety of this technique is in question among physicians. Intramuscular (IM) glucocorticoid injection could be an alternative approach.

Objective

To investigate whether an IM glucocorticoid injection is noninferior to an IA glucocorticoid injection in reducing knee pain for patients with knee OA in primary care.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The KIS trial, a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical noninferiority trial including patients with symptomatic knee OA, was conducted in 80 primary care general practices in the southwest of the Netherlands. The study was conducted from March 1, 2018, to July 28, 2020.

Interventions

Patients were randomly allocated to receive an injection of triamcinolone acetonide, 40 mg, either IM in the ipsilateral ventrogluteal region or IA in the knee joint. All patients were followed up for 24 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The pain score at 4 weeks measured with Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (range, 0–100; 0 indicates extreme pain), with a noninferiority margin of -7 (IM minus IA). A per-protocol analysis was prespecified as the primary analysis.

Results

A total of 145 patients (94 women [65%]; mean [SD] age, 67 [10] years) were included; of these, 138 patients (IM, 72; IA, 66) were included in the per-protocol analysis. Clinically relevant improvements in knee pain were reached up to 12 weeks after the injection in both groups. At 4 weeks, the estimated mean difference in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score between the 2 groups was -3.4 (95% CI, -10.1 to 3.3). Noninferiority could not be declared because the lower limit exceeded the noninferiority margin. Intramuscular injection was noninferior to IA injection at 8 (mean difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -6.5 to 7.8) and 24 (mean difference, 1.6; 95% CI, -5.7 to 9.0) weeks. No significant difference was found among all the secondary outcomes. These results were similar for the sensitivity analysis in an intention-to-treat population. The most frequently reported adverse events were hot flush (IM, 7 [10%] vs IA, 14 [21%]) and headache (IM, 10 [14%] vs IA, 12 [18%]), and all events were classified as nonserious.

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on the findings of this trial, among patients with knee OA in primary care, IM glucocorticoid injection could present an inferior effect in reducing pain at 4 weeks compared with IA injection. Noninferiority of an IM injection was observed at 8 and 24 weeks after injection. This trial provides data for shared decision-making, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of both types of injections.

### Corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee: meta-analysis [^1135Az5c]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee and to identify numbers needed to treat.

Data Sources

Cochrane controlled trials register, Medline (1966 to 2003), Embase (1980 to 2003), hand searches, and contact with authors.

Inclusion Criteria

Randomised controlled trial in which the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee could be ascertained.

Results

In high quality studies, the pooled relative risk for improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee at 16–24 weeks after intra-articular corticosteroid injections was 2.09 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.7) and the number needed to treat was 4.4. The pooled relative risk for improvement up to two weeks after injections was 1.66 (1.37 to 2.0). The numbers needed to treat to get one improvement in the statistically significant studies was 1.3 to 3.5 patients.

Conclusion

Evidence supports short term (up to two weeks) improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee after intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Significant improvement was also shown in the only methodologically sound studies addressing longer term response (16–24 weeks). A dose equivalent to 50 mg of prednisone may be needed to show benefit at 16–24 weeks.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^115w88xM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Despite clinically relevant improvements in both groups, the trial findings did not demonstrate the noninferiority of IM glucocorticoid injection in reducing OA knee pain at 4 weeks. This result could be partially explained by the finding that IM injection presented a peak effect at 8 weeks vs 4 weeks for IA injection. Accordingly, the IM injection reached the noninferiority level at 8 and 24 weeks after administration, while the effects at 24 weeks were small for both injections. Moreover, patients with IA injection reported slightly more adverse events, although none were serious.

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of an IM glucocorticoid injection for knee OA. The results are consistent with a previous trial of IM injection in patients with hip OA, with IM injection showing clinically relevant effects compared with placebo from 2 to 12 weeks and had the greatest effect approximately 6 weeks after injection. Based on these results, patients receiving an IM glucocorticoid injection are likely to experience a continuous reduction in knee pain within 8 weeks, in contrast with IA injection, which provides substantial short-term symptom relief (2–4 weeks). The mechanism behind this difference could be related to pharmacokinetics. Given that suppression of joint inflammation by IA injection of corticosteroids is associated with a lower level of knee pain, an IM injection may need longer to reach an adequate concentration of corticosteroids in the knee compared with an IA injection. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in further studies.

### The efficacy, accuracy and complications of corticosteroid injections of the knee joint [^115mdEYU]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Corticosteroid knee injections are being increasingly used in the conservative management of knee osteoarthritis. The procedure is usually performed in secondary care by orthopaedic surgeons and rheumatologists, but as the role of general practitioners in chronic disease management expands, joint injections are now frequently being performed in primary care. It is commonly perceived amongst clinicians that the benefits of corticosteroid knee joint injections in treating symptomatic knee osteoarthritis significantly outweigh the risks of complications.

Methods

The evidence in the literature for the benefits, accuracy, safety and complications of corticosteroid knee injections in osteoarthritis is reviewed. The perception that serious complications are rare is addressed, and the incidence of infectious complications is estimated.

Results and Conclusions

Short-term symptomatic relief is the only evidence-based benefit of corticosteroid injection of an osteoarthritic knee. Accurate intra-articular placement is not achieved in up to 20% of injections and varies considerably with the anatomical approach used. There is no evidence that a medial approach is more accurate. The incidence of serious infectious complications following knee joint injections ranges widely, and may be as high as 1 in 3,000 and potentially far higher in high-risk patients for whom specialist management is advised.

➢ Corticosteroid injections are largely safe, but patients and practitioners should be aware of the small risk of adverse side effects, and their limited duration of efficacy. The timing of injection should be coordinated with potential surgical dates.➢ The routine use of hyaluronic acid injections for osteoarthritis is not recommended, but there are certain subsets of patients, such as those who have undergone other therapies that failed, who may benefit from it.➢ Local anesthetics are frequently used in conjunction with corticosteroids for enhanced pain control; however, caution is needed because of concerns regarding chondrotoxicity. Proper patient selection is crucial, and their overuse for diagnostic purposes is not recommended.➢ There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of prolotherapy, bone marrow aspirate concentrate, stromal vascular fraction, and mesenchymal stromal cell injections.➢ Intra-articular saline solution has been associated with improvements in both patient-reported pain and function scores, and this should be considered in future study designs.

Intra-articular corticosteroids — Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids could provide short-term relief for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, with Strength of Recommendation: Moderate (downgrade). Overall pain and function improved with intra-articular corticosteroids; however, such effect lasted only up to 3 months. Analyses differentiating extended versus immediate release found that extended release IA steroids can be used over immediate release to improve patient outcomes (Moderate strength recommendation). The recommendation has been downgraded one level because of potential risk in accelerating osteoarthritis from injections. For implementation safety, the AAOS Patient Safety Committee recommends avoiding musculoskeletal corticosteroid injections for two weeks before and one week after COVID vaccine administration. The cost-effectiveness of different intra-articular therapies is still to be determined.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) dosing, imaging selection, injection intervals, efficacy duration, and adverse effects are summarized for musculoskeletal injections. US requires expertise; hence the physician should employ the imaging modality with which they are most experienced and comfortable. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. For dosing, a dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg TA for shoulder IACS, the most commonly used dose for hip IACS was 40 mg TA or MPA, and triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. For frequency, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks between injections, up to 3 months, and overall, IACS results in short-term (4 weeks to 3 months) pain relief. Adverse effects from IACS are related to the procedure and corticosteroid exposure and include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage, reduction of BMD, and PJI.

Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for osteoarthritis (OA) are strongly recommended for patients with knee and/or hip OA and conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA. Trials of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections have demonstrated short-term efficacy in knee OA, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injection is conditionally, rather than strongly, recommended for hand OA given the lack of evidence specific to this anatomic location. There are insufficient data to judge the choice of short-acting over long-acting preparations or the use of low rather than high doses.

Knee osteoarthritis intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) dosing — repeat IACS are associated with small volume cartilage loss (Level of certainty: high). Recommendations state that IACS for knee osteoarthritis should use the lowest effective doses of corticosteroids while increasing the time interval between repeat injections when possible (Grade A), and that the recommended initial maximum intra-articular knee triamcinolone acetonide dose is 40 mg, or another particulate corticosteroid equivalent (Grade A).

Injections for the pain caused by knee osteoarthritis have been the focus of significant research for the last few decades. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can provide up to 12 months of pain relief in these patients, superior to both cortisone and hyaluronic acid. There is also some evidence for a synergistic effect when combining both PRP and hyaluronic acid. Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) has significantly greater levels of interleukin-1ra than PRP, as well as a small concentration of mesenchymal stromal cells. However, BMAC is yet unproven in its efficacy, and obtaining BMAC is not as simple as taking blood. Research into the use of expanded autologous and allogenic mesenchymal stem cells continues and shows future promise. For today, PRP remains the gold standard for the treatment of pain associated with knee osteoarthritis.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^117Y3cEQ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability, and the knee is the most commonly affected joint. Key treatment strategies, such as disease education, exercise therapy, and weight loss, in combination with pain medications are usually indicated for patients with knee OA in clinical practice. Among the pain medications, intra-articular (IA) glucocorticoid injection is one of the most widely used. Clinical trials have demonstrated the short-term effectiveness of IA glucocorticoid injection in reducing moderate to severe knee pain. Several professional guidelines recommend use of IA glucocorticoid injection for patients with knee OA who have not responded to oral or topical analgesics.,

However, the safety of injecting a glucocorticoid into the knee is increasingly drawing concerns among physicians. A 2-year randomized clinical trial showed IA injection of glucocorticoids would result in significantly greater cartilage loss. In addition, although rare, IA injection is associated with higher risks of septic arthritis and postoperative joint infection, for which a 3-month minimum interval between injection and further operations is recommended. Another obstacle of implementing IA injection is that, in primary care, general practitioners (GPs) may not feel competent to place the needle into the knee joint.

Intramuscular (IM) injection could be an alternative approach for glucocorticoid administration in patients with knee OA because it eliminates the direct risks of toxic effects on cartilage and septic arthritis and is easier to perform than IA injection. Intramuscular glucocorticoid injection has been reported to be beneficial in relieving pain in other musculoskeletal diseases, such as rotator cuff diseaseand hand OA. In a double-blind trial conducted by our team, IM glucocorticoid injection was superior to placebo injection for reducing pain in patients with hip OA up to at least 12 weeks. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the analgesic effect of IM glucocorticoid injection for knee OA or directly compared its effect with IA glucocorticoid injection.

Therefore, we performed the KIS randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of IM glucocorticoid injection in patients with symptomatic knee OA in primary care, compared with standard IA glucocorticoid injection. The primary objective was to investigate whether an IM injection is noninferior to the IA injection in reducing knee pain at 4 weeks after injection.

Intra-articular corticosteroids and radiographic joint space narrowing — trial and observational data are as follows: a knee RCT used 40 mg IA triamcinolone every 3 months versus saline for up to 2 years, was powered with 34 patients per group to detect a 0.125 mm difference at 2 years, and found no difference between groups at either 1-year or 2-year follow-up. An observational series assessed 30 individuals with OA and 35 with RA who had a minimum of 15 knee CSIs over 4 years and a maximum of 167 injections over 8 years (semi-quantitative 0–4 scale).

Elective TJA timing — trial of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections: In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections. Patients who have an acute flare of OA or other inflammatory arthropathy may be interested in delaying TJA to obtain immediate pain relief, but potential harms include increased risk of hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus and increased risk of joint infection if surgery is performed within 3 months of the intraarticular injection. The recommendation is conditional with indirect and very low quality evidence, and the exceptions listed for the first recommendation (e.g., delay for personal reasons or other ongoing medical comorbidities) apply.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) and peri-articular injections for musculoskeletal pain are addressed in this adult-focused guideline, which summarizes scope, dosing, efficacy, and safety. The guideline covers corticosteroid joint injections for "the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet", notes "little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another", and states that "Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain". Dosing statements include: "A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections", "The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone", and "Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS". Efficacy is characterized as "short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months", and adverse events include "an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection".

### Intraarticular corticosteroid for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee [^114xcK2F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disorder. In the knee, injections of corticosteroids into the joint (intra-articular (IA)) may relieve inflammation, and reduce pain and disability.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of IA corticosteroids in treatment of OA of the knee.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PREMEDLINE (all to July 2003), and Current Contents (Sept 2000). Specialised journals, trial reference lists and review articles were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of IA corticosteroids for patients with OA of the knee: single/double blind, placebo-based/comparative studies, reporting at least one core OMERACT III outcome measure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Methodological quality of trials was assessed, and data were extracted in duplicate. Fixed effect and random effects models, giving weighted mean differences (WMD), were used for continuous variables. Dichotomous outcomes were analysed by relative risk (RR).

Main Results

Twenty-six trials (1721 participants) comparing IA corticosteroid against placebo, against IA hyaluronan/hylan (HA products), against joint lavage, and against other IA corticosteroids, were included. IA corticosteroid was more effective than IA placebo for pain reduction (WMD -17.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) -25.02 to -10.55) and patient global assessment (the RR was 1.44 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.82)) at one week post injection with an NNT of 3 to 4 for both, based on n = 185 for pain on 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and n = 158 for patient global assessment. Data on function were sparse at one week post injection and neither statistically significant nor clinically important differences were detected. There was evidence of pain reduction between two weeks (the RR was 1.81 (95% CI 1.09 to 3.00)) to three weeks (the RR was 3.11 (95% CI 1.61 to 6.01), but a lack of evidence for efficacy in functional improvement. At four to 24 weeks post injection, there was lack of evidence of effect on pain and function (small studies showed benefits which did not reach statistical or clinical importance, i.e. less than 20% risk difference). For patient global, there were three studies which consistently showed lack of effect longer than one week post injection. However, all were fairly small sample sizes (less than 50 patients per group). This was supported by another study which did not find statistically significant differences, at any time point, on a continuous measure of patient global assessment (100 mm VAS). In comparisons of corticosteroids and HA products, no statistically significant differences were in general detected at one to four weeks post injection. Between five and 13 weeks post injection, HA products were more effective than corticosteroids for one or more of the following variables: WOMAC OA Index, Lequesne Index, pain, range of motion (flexion), and number of responders. One study showed a difference in function between 14 to 26 weeks, but no differences in efficacy were detected at 45 to 52 weeks. In general, the onset of effect was similar with IA corticosteroids, but was less durable than with HA products. Comparisons of IA corticosteroids showed triamcinolone hexacetonide was superior to betamethasone for number of patients reporting pain reduction up to four weeks post injection (the RR was 2.00 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.63). Comparisons between IA corticosteroid and joint lavage showed no differences in any of the efficacy or safety outcome measures.

Authors' Conclusions

The short-term benefit of IA corticosteroids in treatment of knee OA is well established, and few side effects have been reported. Longer term benefits have not been confirmed based on the RevMan analysis. The response to HA products appears more durable. In this review, some discrepancies were observed between the RevMan 4.1 analysis and the original publication. These are likely the result of using secondary rather than primary data and the statistical methods available in RevMan 4.1. Future trials should have standardised outcome measures and assessment times, run longer, investigate different patient subgroups, and clinical predictors of response (those associated with inflammation and structural damage).

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^114Z4YsY]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this trial suggest that, among patients in primary care settings with symptomatic knee OA, an IM glucocorticoid injection could present an inferior effect in reducing pain at our primary end point of 4 weeks, compared with an IA injection. An IM injection is noninferior to IA injection at 8 and 24 weeks after injection, but not at 2 and 12 weeks. Both types of injection should be considered effective strategies, and this trial provides evidence for shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of both treatment strategies.

Table 3
Comparison of efficacy 1 year after treatment a

a All 273 patients were included in the analyses. The total effective rate was calculated as the basic disappearance of knee pain symptoms and a reduction in the pain score (VAS) of at least 30%

The overall direction of the primary outcome results remained unchanged after three post hoc sensitivity analyses. These analyses were performed in the following ways: first, with imputation for missing data; second, with the exclusion of 14 participants without WOMAC data at one year; and third, with adjustment for differences in radiographic severity and duration of symptoms at baseline (Additional File 2: Table S3). The physical therapy group showed an improvement in the total WOMAC score, SF-36 score of at least 12%, knee flexion improvement of at least 3.8%, a reduction of > 50% on the VAS scale, and a balance control test score of least 10% improvement from the follow-up (with the minimal clinically important difference).

Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. In the glucocorticoid injection group, minor side effects, such as transient pain at the injection site (n = 10) and allergic reactions (n = 5), were reported. In the physical therapy group, aggravation of pain (n = 14) and knee swelling (n = 3) were the most commonly reported adverse events, and these symptoms were relieved by the application of ice packs. No serious complications were observed in either group. These findings suggest that both interventions are generally safe, but clinicians should be aware of potential minor side effects.

During the treatment and follow-up periods, the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24) was used to assess pain-related distress and psychogenic pain. All the participants received careful clinical examinations to identify features indicative of somatic disease, functional somatic disorders, or mental disorders, and no pain-related distress or mental disease was recorded.

### A randomized trial of intra-articular injection therapy for knee osteoarthritis [^111WmDpN]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study included its single-center study setup and the single-dose intra-articular injection. The image-guided injection with contrast media assured correct intra-articular application, which is a crucial factor. This study is, to our knowledge, the first randomized trial comparing the use of glucocorticoids, hyaluronic acid, PRP, and placebo intra-articular injections.

Limitations

Up to now, there is no clear recommendation how often PRP should be injected. Because of the blinded study design, we could not offer multiple PRP injections to our patients.

Our study included patients with 1 or 2 knees treated. We took this into account in our statistical modeling and implemented a model with 2 random effects (for the patient and patient's knee) and an additional variable predictor that accounts for the treatment applied to the contralateral knee. Because systemic effects of glucocorticoid injections have only been reported up to 1 month after the initial injection, we injected the second knee at least 3 months after the injection in the contralateral knee.

Lastly, intra-articular injections are known for strong placebo effect. Self-reported parameters such as pain and stiffness are susceptible to this phenomenon. Future studies with larger study cohorts are warranted to confirm our findings.

In summary, there is no evidence that knee injections with glucocorticoid, PRP, or hyaluronic acid have superior short- or long-term effects in patients with mild or moderate OA when compared with placebo.

Based on these results, treating physicians might avoid these injection therapies for the management of knee OA.

### Cost-effectiveness of physical therapy vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection for knee osteoarthritis: a secondary analysis from a randomized clinical trial [^116m7f1X]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis, accounting for a disproportionate level of disability and health care expenditures worldwide. It is the eighth most expensive of 154 health conditions to manage in the US, costing more than $80 billion in 2016. The knee is one of the more common joints affected by osteoarthritis, with its prevalence doubling during the last 70 years. Knee osteoarthritis may begin early in life and progresses slowly, providing opportunities for nonsurgical treatment options.

Effective nonsurgical treatment options are available for knee OA that should be considered before surgery. The American College of Rheumatology provides guidelines that include 6 strongly and 8 conditionally recommended nonpharmacological interventions, as well as 3 strongly and 4 conditionally recommended pharmacological treatments. With so many choices, patients and clinicians often find it challenging to establish optimal treatment plans. One critical component for decision-making is the cost and accessibility of the intervention.

### The efficacy and safety of perioperative glucocorticoid for total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Z78SN]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly effective surgical treatment for severe knee arthritis which could reduce pain and maintain motor function. However, many patients still experience moderate to severe pain following TKA and require increased analgesic use postoperatively. Various analgesic methods, including nerve blocks, local anesthetic infiltration, and intravenous opioids, are utilized in these patients. Unfortunately, patients often report dissatisfaction with pain management and are prone to complications such as nausea and vomiting. Besides, surgical intervention triggers a local inflammatory response, which further leads to systemic inflammatioty response through the release of inflammatory factors. Inflammation can further exacerbate postoperative joint pain, restrict knee joint range of motion, impede rapid postoperative rehabilitation, prolong hospital stay.

Glucocorticoids are commonly employed in TKA surgery due to their anti-inflammatory and antiemetic properties. Some studies have indicated that glucocorticoids can effectively alleviate postoperative pain, reduce opioid consumption and mitigate complications such as nausea and vomiting in TKA patients. However, other studies have raised concerns about glucocorticoids usage, including potential adverse effects such as elevated blood glucose levels, infection, and impaired wound healing, particularly in patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, further investigation is required to determine the efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids in total knee arthroplasty. Additionally, the optimal medication, types, and number of doses of glucocorticoids administered perioperatively in TKA remain uncertain. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the available randomized controlled trials that investigate the efficacy and safety associated with glucocorticoid use in total knee arthroplasty. The main purposes of this paper include the following: (1) To explore the effect of glucocorticoids on postoperative rest pain and morphine consumption in patients after TKA; (2) To explore the effect of glucocorticoids on range of knee's motion and length of hospital stay in patients after TKA; (3) To explore the effect of glucocorticoids on peripheral inflammation in patients after TKA; (4) To explore the adverse complications of glucocorticoids in patients after TKA, including PONV, high blood glucose, wound infection and venous thrombosis. Meanwhile, to investigate the impact of glucocorticoid dosage on PONV and compare the effect of the glucocorticoid by periarticular injection and system administration.

### Editorial commentary: postoperative corticosteroid injections after knee arthroscopy increase the risk for infection the closer they are administered to surgery [^114FQ2NB]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the known immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids, the relationship between corticosteroid injections (CSIs) and postoperative infection risk has been frequently studied in the literature to date. The period within 4 weeks after knee arthroscopy has been identified as a particularly high-risk time to receive a CSI, and caution has been recommended as a result of the increased risk for infection that patients who receive a CSI during this time experience. CSIs given within 4 weeks prior to knee arthroscopy and at the time of knee arthroscopy have been shown to increase postoperative infection risk as well. As surgeons seek to better understand this association to be able to counsel patients about an appropriate interval between surgery and injection-as CSIs have been proven to accelerate postoperative recovery and reduce prolonged inflammation-questions remain, nonetheless. For example, while superficial infections may be localized and treated with a short course of oral antibiotics, deep infections can involve hospitalizations, intravenous antibiotics, and reoperation in the form of procedures like irrigation and debridement. Thus, the severity of infections associated with CSIs administered around the time of knee arthroscopy remains unclear. One explanation for these unanswered questions is the relatively low frequency with which these complications occur and the fact that many studies that seek to address them rely on large commercial claims databases to do so. These databases frequently lack granularity but, due to the large sample size they offer, frequently provide the best available option to address such questions. Nevertheless, their limitations should be understood to avoid overstating clinical significance in the context of statistical significance and ensure conclusions are interpreted in their proper context.

### Intraarticular corticosteroid for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee [^116VXfat]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disorder. In the knee, injections of corticosteroids into the joint (intraarticular (IA)) may relieve inflammation, and reduce pain and disability.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of IA corticosteroids in treatment of OA of the knee.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (to January (week 1) 2006 for update), EMBASE, PREMEDLINE (all to July 2003), and Current Contents (Sept 2000). Specialised journals, trial reference lists and review articles were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of IA corticosteroids for patients with OA of the knee: single/double blind, placebo-based/comparative studies, reporting at least one core OMERACT III outcome measure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Methodological quality of trials was assessed, and data were extracted in duplicate. Fixed effect and random effects models, giving weighted mean differences (WMD), were used for continuous variables. Dichotomous outcomes were analysed by relative risk (RR).

Main Results

Twenty-eight trials (1973 participants) comparing IA corticosteroid against placebo, against IA hyaluronan/hylan (HA products), against joint lavage, and against other IA corticosteroids, were included. IA corticosteroid was more effective than IA placebo for pain reduction (WMD -21.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) -29.93 to -13.89) and patient global assessment (the RR was 1.44 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.82)) at one week post injection with an NNT of 3 to 4 for both, based on n = 185 for pain on 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and n = 158 for patient global assessment. Data on function were sparse at one week post injection and neither statistically significant nor clinically important differences were detected. There was evidence of pain reduction between two weeks (the RR was 1.81 (95% CI 1.09 to 3.00)) to three weeks (the RR was 3.11 (95% CI 1.61 to 6.01), but a lack of evidence for efficacy in functional improvement. At four to 24 weeks post injection, there was lack of evidence of effect on pain and function (small studies showed benefits which did not reach statistical or clinical importance, i.e. less than 20% risk difference). For patient global, there were three studies which consistently showed lack of effect longer than one week post injection. However, all were fairly small sample sizes (less than 50 patients per group). This was supported by another study which did not find statistically significant differences, at any time point, on a continuous measure of patient global assessment (100 mm VAS). In comparisons of corticosteroids and HA products, no statistically significant differences were in general detected at one to four weeks post injection. Between five and 13 weeks post injection, HA products were more effective than corticosteroids for one or more of the following variables: WOMAC OA Index, Lequesne Index, pain, range of motion (flexion), and number of responders. One study showed a difference in function between 14 to 26 weeks, but no differences in efficacy were detected at 45 to 52 weeks. In general, the onset of effect was similar with IA corticosteroids, but was less durable than with HA products. Comparisons of IA corticosteroids showed triamcinolone hexacetonide was superior to betamethasone for number of patients reporting pain reduction up to four weeks post injection (the RR was 2.00 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.63). Comparisons between IA corticosteroid and joint lavage showed no differences in any of the efficacy or safety outcome measures.

Authors' Conclusions

The short-term benefit of IA corticosteroids in treatment of knee OA is well established, and few side effects have been reported. Longer term benefits have not been confirmed based on the RevMan analysis. The response to HA products appears more durable. In this review, some discrepancies were observed between the RevMan 4.2 analysis and the original publication. These are likely the result of using secondary rather than primary data and the statistical methods available in RevMan 4.2. Future trials should have standardised outcome measures and assessment times, run longer, investigate different patient subgroups, and clinical predictors of response (those associated with inflammation and structural damage).

Recommendations Regarding Injection-Based Therapies

Corticosteroid Injections

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IAC or IACS) injections were pioneered by Dr Jollander in 1953. The first trial for IAC injections was performed by White and Norton in 1958. IAC injections have become standard therapy for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, there is still debate on the efficacy of IAC injections for knee OA. A Cochrane review in 2015 evaluated 27 trials with a total of 1767 participants comparing IAC injections with a sham injection or no treatment for patients with knee OA. The quality of evidence was "low" due to a high or unclear risk of bias in many studies. There was also a significant amount of inconsistencies regarding the dosage of corticosteroid and the type of corticosteroid used. The review did find IAC injections reduced pain and improved function more effectively than control interventions. The authors reported an improvement of pain after IAC injection was moderate at 1–2 weeks post-injection, mild to moderate at 4–6 weeks, and minor at 13 weeks. There was no statistically significant evidence of treatment effect at 26 weeks. The Cochrane review concluded, given the poor quality and variability in the studies, it is uncertain if there is a significant advantage of IAC injections for knee OA after 6 weeks post-injection.

Conversely, a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the magnitude and duration of the effect of IAC for knee OA found moderate evidence for IAC injections to reduce pain related to knee OA. The treatment effect was up to 3 months after the injection in the meta-analysis. The number needed to treat was 10. Unfortunately, as was such the case in the Cochrane review, there is significant heterogeneity between studies evaluating IAC for knee OA. The inconsistency between the Cochrane review and the meta-analysis underscores the need for RCTs with specific corticosteroids used and a fixed-dose to consider further the efficacy of pain relief and duration of effect (see Table 11).

Evidence Table Regarding Intra-Articular Corticosteroid Injections

In summary, IAC may provide short-term mild-to-moderate pain relief for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^11462RG7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The analgesic effect of the IA injection presented in this trial is similar to the previous trials of Conaghan et aland Deyle et al, but larger than the effect (at 2 weeks) reported in the trial of Henriksen et al. A possible reason for the difference could be that Henriksen et alrecruited a group of patients with less pain at baseline than in this present trial, and patients with milder pain were reported to experience a smaller benefit from glucocorticoid injection.

For clinical practice, interpretation should also include the adverse events, patient preference, and clinician's skills. Combined with the results of a previous trial, a single IM injection of triamcinolone, 40 mg, should be considered safe because no injection-related serious adverse event was reported in patients with either hip or knee OA. In addition, according to the baseline assessment of this study, more patients preferred IM to IA injection (47% vs 19%). These findings should be mainly considered as slight preferences and might not be extrapolated to the general population, because patients with strong preferences would probably have declined to participate in this trial. Nevertheless, this selection reflects the fact that the IM injection is a preferable approach in some cases from the perspective of the patients. Furthermore, effect sizes of between-group differences were small at all time points, and no significant differences were found in any of the primary and secondary outcomes, including joint pain, function, stiffness, patient sport level, and quality of life. It may be best to inform patients on these outcomes, especially when clinicians feel incompetent in administering an IA injection. Taken together, the findings of this trial suggest that a shared decision-making process between clinicians and patients with knee OA would be useful when a glucocorticoid injection is indicated.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection and peri-articular corticosteroid injection are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. Results vary by musculoskeletal region, but most studies report short-term benefit with mixed results on long-term relief. Publications showed adverse events from single corticosteroid injections. Recommended effective doses were lower than those currently used by clinicians.

Methods

Development of the practice guideline for joint injections was approved by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the participating societies. A Corticosteroid Safety Work Group coordinated the development of three guidelines: peripheral nerve blocks and trigger points; joints; and neuraxial, facet, and sacroiliac joint injections. The topics included safety of the technique in relation to landmark-guided, ultrasound-guided, or radiology-aided injections; effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on the efficacy of the injectate; and adverse events related to the injection. Experts on the topics were assigned to extensively review the literature and initially develop consensus statements and recommendations. A modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed. A modified Delphi process was adhered to in arriving at a consensus.

Results

This guideline focuses on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid joint injections for managing joint chronic pain in adults. The joints that were addressed included the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet. All the statements and recommendations were approved by all participants and the Board of Directors of the participating societies after four rounds of discussion. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain. A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for both shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections. The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone. Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. Overall, IACS injections result in short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months. The adverse events include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection.

Conclusions

In this practice guideline, we provided specific recommendations on the role of corticosteroids in joint, bursa, and peritendon injections for musculoskeletal pain.

### Common practices in intra-articular corticosteroid injection for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: a survey of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons membership [^111ESBR7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis nonoperative management options remain limited. Our aim is to define the current American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) members' practices and perceptions in terms of the frequency, formulation, use of concomitant aspiration, maximum lifetime number of injections, efficacy, interval between injection and surgery and complication rates.

Methods

A 22-question survey based on Likert scale response anchors was approved and distributed by the AAHKS Research Committee to its membership by email during the Spring 2019 meeting. Data were managed with REDCap software.

Results

Membership response totaled 537 of 2365 (22.7%) members. Highlights include every respondent using intra-articular corticosteroid injections (ICIs) in their practice, and most use a three-month minimum interval, although the preferred interval is longer. Near consensus was found waiting three months before surgery. There was a great variability in the number of injections allowed, and injections before surgery were very common. Nearly all responders use a local anesthetic mixture with the cortisone injection, but there was great variation in corticosteroid type: methylprednisolone (42%), triamcinolone (41%), betamethasone (13.3%), and dexamethasone (3.7%).

Conclusion

The results of our survey indicate the majority of the AAHKS members who completed the survey use ICIs routinely for treatment of knee osteoarthritis. There was near consensus in ICIs, which is effective with decreasing efficacy over serial injections, and an absolute minimum interval between injections was believed by most to be three months with no clearly defined lifetime limit and strong consensus for a three-month preoperative interval. The formulation of steroid, local anesthetic, and skin preparation technique varied greatly.

### Peripheral pain mechanisms in osteoarthritis [^111YQGTU]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids, either delivered intra-articularly or orally, are assumed to target the synovium primarily, although it is worth remembering that several tissues of the joint express glucocorticoid receptors, including chondrocytes. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using intra-articular or oral steroid show that the clinical response is mixed. Recent studies show that a long-acting intra-articular steroid preparation, FX0006, did demonstrate statistically significant superiority over placebo, although the Phase II study failed to meet its primary endpoint (improvement over placebo at 12 weeks). An RCT of intra-articular steroid in hand OA, in which lignocaine alone was used as a placebo, met 2 out of 11 coprimary endpoints. A recent RCT of 10-mg daily oral prednisolone did show significant improvement over placebo for the duration of treatment, reverting back to pretreatment levels of pain within 3 weeks. Few studies have examined the effect of repeated intra-articular steroid in patients with OA. In the study by McAlindon et al. 3 monthly triamcinolone intra-articular injections to individuals with knee OA over 2 years not only failed to register symptomatic improvement over placebo at any of the 3 monthly assessments, but also showed a small but significant increase in cartilage degradation in repeat steroid injected joints. This study may have missed a transient analgesic response to the steroid injection occurring within the 3-month follow-up period. Similar data have been observed in the Osteoarthritis Initiative, collectively highlighting the potential risks associated with this commonly delivered treatment. Most of the above studies also had imaging outcomes that showed inconsistent responses when examining synovial volume and vascularity.

### Effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis on the rates of subsequent knee replacement and post-operative outcomes: a national cohort study of england [^115q88Qo]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis is an irreversible musculoskeletal condition associated with pain, morbidity, functional decline, and reduced quality of life. It is a significant public health problem and leads to substantial healthcare system and societal costs.

In the United Kingdom (UK), osteoarthritis is mainly managed by general practitioners (GPs) in primary care, with patients proceeding to secondary (hospital) care for surgical management if considered necessary. Following a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, there is an estimated 30% average lifetime risk of knee replacement. As the prevalence of osteoarthritis is increasing, the need for joint replacement surgery is expected to increase considerably over the coming decades. Intermediate surgical procedures such as arthroscopy and debridement are also routinely offered, although these have been discouraged given growing evidence of lack of benefit and potential harms.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on the management of osteoarthritis states referral for joint replacement should only be made after trying all other appropriate treatments. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection (IACI) is an established treatment option for providing short-term pain relief and can be considered when other treatments are ineffective or unsuitable. NICE and Cochrane state there is no evidence of IACI therapeutic benefit on pain lasting beyond the short-term (3–6 months), although high heterogeneity of evidence is noted. There is a lack of longer-term follow-up in most studies of the effects of IACI, meaning there is scarcity of data on the impact of IACI on outcomes, including the subsequent need for joint replacement. Whilst the pain relief afforded by IACI could be expected to delay the need for surgical management, there are emerging reports of recurrent use of IACI being associated with adverse outcomes such as radiological osteoarthritis progression and joint damage, although inconsistent findings have been reported.

There have also been some reports of patients who receive an IACI prior to knee replacement surgery being at increased risk of post-operative infection, although findings have not been consistently replicated and more research is needed.

Our aim was therefore to use quasi-experimental methods applied to a large primary and secondary care linked electronic health record database to assess the effects of IACI for knee osteoarthritis on the incidence of subsequent joint surgery and on post-operative patient-reported outcomes and adverse events.

### The efficacy and duration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review of level I studies [^111qoaWJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of the current literature to determine the efficacy and duration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection in reducing pain caused by knee osteoarthritis and to determine whether the type of corticosteroid used affected these results. Following an electronic search of multiple databases and a review of reference lists from various articles, we found six trials in five papers that compared corticosteroid versus placebo and four papers that compared different corticosteroids. Results of corticosteroid compared with placebo showed both a statistically and clinically significant reduction in pain at 1 week, with an average difference between groups of 22%. Two of four trials showed triamcinolone to be more effective in pain reduction than other corticosteroids. We concluded that intra-articular corticosteroids reduce knee pain for at least 1 week and that intra-articular corticosteroid injection is a short-term treatment of a chronic problem.

### Cell-based versus corticosteroid injections for knee pain in osteoarthritis: a randomized phase 3 trial [^116bXLeY]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Significant measures were taken to eliminate potential bias in our study, including blinding of authors to original data before final analysis. The primary analyses and the sensitivity analyses allowed us to evaluate all scenarios including subject loss, as we designed the study as intent to treat. However, selection bias may arise from differences between participants who selected to start the trial and those who did not. With interventions for knee OA, there is a well-described placebo effect that we must acknowledge. When trying to account for this placebo effect, one must look at studies where saline was used. It is debatable as to whether saline is a true control or has some therapeutic effect by diluting and washing away inflammatory mediators as well as aspiration of joint fluid, which occurs before any intervention. It is unclear whether different solutions and cellular therapies have this same dilution effect or if there is a reactionary byproduct from cellular injectates over saline. This placebo effect has been studied extensively in this area, with overall data suggesting there could be upwards of 50% response rate as well as up to 6 months improvement in pain and possibly even longer improvement in function. It is unclear if there was a placebo effect given the fact that patients were blinded to their treatment and underwent sham procedures (for example, they may have assumed it worked because they got 'stem cells' or did not work because they got 'steroids'). There were clearly some patients who did not respond to cellular or steroid therapies, and it is unclear whether these patients were subject to a placebo type effect.

Although no study is perfect, our study identified that at 1 year post injection there was no cellular therapy that was more effective than CSI for knee OA. In addition, the study demonstrates in a large cohort the relative safety of these cellular procedures without evidence of severe AEs. It should be noted that a multiarm clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of cellular biologics as compared to corticosteroid is exceedingly complex with multiple viewpoints and perceptions. A large team of scientists including expert opinion, critiques and requirements from the FDA shaped this study into its current form. Additional conclusions and responder analyses will be discussed more in future papers.

### Dry needling versus cortisone injection in the treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a noninferiority randomized clinical trial [^113y5qwj]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design Prospective, randomized, partially blinded. Background Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is the current terminology for what was once called greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. Cortisone (corticosteroid) injection into the lateral hip has traditionally been the accepted treatment for this condition; however, the effectiveness of injecting the bursa with steroids is increasingly being questioned. An equally effective treatment with fewer adverse side effects would be beneficial. Objective To investigate whether administration of dry needling (DN) is noninferior to cortisone injection in reducing lateral hip pain and improving function in patients with GTPS. Methods Forty-three participants (50 hips observed), all with GTPS, were randomly assigned to a group receiving cortisone injection or DN. Treatments were administered over 6 weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the numeric pain-rating scale (0–10). The secondary outcome measure was the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (0–10). Medication intake for pain was collected as a tertiary outcome. Results Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. A noninferiority test for a repeated-measures design for pain and averaged function scores at 6 weeks (with a noninferiority margin of 1.5 for both outcomes) indicated noninferiority of DN versus cortisone injection (both, P < .01). Medication usage (P = 0.74) was not different between groups at the same time point. No adverse side effects were reported. Conclusion Cortisone injections for GTPS did not provide greater pain relief or reduction in functional limitations than DN. Our data suggest that DN is a noninferior treatment alternative to cortisone injections in this patient population. Level of Evidence Therapy, level 1b.

### Cost-effectiveness of physical therapy vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection for knee osteoarthritis: a secondary analysis from a randomized clinical trial [^1167fTGD]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Physical therapy and intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are common treatments for knee osteoarthritis. Data from large health care systems suggest that they are infrequently delivered together, indicating that patients or their practitioners are more likely to choose one or the other. Exercise therapy, a core nonpharmacological intervention for knee osteoarthritis, is a staple of physical therapy programs. Manual therapy also has proven to be an effective treatment in several clinical trials. A single glucocorticoid injection typically delivered during the same consultation with the diagnosing clinician may be initially less expensive and less time intensive than a course of physical therapy. However, there is concern that glucocorticoid injections may accelerate degenerative changes in the longer term and may not add to the benefit of physical therapy in the short term. Consideration for both short- and longer-term outcomes, treatment risks and adverse effects, and the downstream effect of each treatment choice should influence and inform these decisions instead of initial cost alone. Value is defined by the cost incurred to generate a change in outcome. Some interventions with lower initial costs may not carry that cost-effectiveness into the long term. Although physical therapy was clinically more effective than glucocorticoid injection in a recent trial, a typical course is usually more costly than a single injection ($99-$172 for a primary care office visit and injection procedure and $557-$919 for a low-complexity physical therapy evaluation and 7 additional physical therapy sessions consisting of manual therapy and 30 minutes of exercise per the 2020 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule). Given the high prevalence of knee osteoarthritis and the frequency of practical decisions made about best treatment options, we aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of physical therapy compared with glucocorticoid injection from the health care perspective.

Outcomes

We measured outcomes at baseline (the day of completing baseline assessments), and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after administration of the injection via digital or paper questionnaires. Two of us (Q.W. and P.K.B.) did the baseline Kellgren and Lawrence grade scoring blinded to the allocated treatment (interrater reliability: prevalence-adjusted κ value: 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93). A consensus meeting was held for making final decisions for discrepant grades. The primary outcome was the severity of knee pain at 4 weeks measured with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain subscale (0–100; 0 indicates extreme pain).

Secondary outcomes included the KOOS pain score at 2, 8, 12, and 24 weeks; KOOS symptom, function, sport and recreation, and quality-of-life scores (0–100; 0 indicates extreme symptoms); Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, function, stiffness, and total scores (0–100; 0 indicates no pain); numeric rating scale of knee pain during the past week (0–10; 0 indicates no pain); Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (0–100; 0 indicates no pain); and EuroQol with 5 dimensions and 5 response levels (−0.446 to 1.000; −0.446 indicates worst health-related quality of life). In addition, we measured perceived recovery and the percentage of responders defined by the OMERACT-OARSI criteria. Patients' perceived recovery was measured with a 7-point Likert scale, and results were dichotomized into recovered (complete recovery, much improved, and slightly improved) or not recovered (no change, slightly worse, much worse, and worse than ever). The OMERACT-OARSI responders are those with high improvements (≥ 50% and absolute increase ≥ 20 points from baseline) in KOOS pain or function score; if that level is not achieved, then improvement in at least 2 of the 3 following domains: greater than or equal to 20% and greater than or equal to 10-point improvement in the KOOS pain score, greater than or equal to 20% and greater than or equal to 10-point improvement in the KOOS function score, and patient-perceived recovery in global assessment (complete recovery, much improved, and slightly improved). We measured adverse events at 2 weeks' follow-up and asked patients about cointerventions (oral medication, additional IA injection, and visit to medical care professional) at all follow-up times.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injection frequency and cumulative dose — survey practice and suggestion: An American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons survey of common injection practices yielded 537 members' responses, and most used a 3-month minimum interval between repeat IACS in the same joint. Based on the available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks, up to 3 months, and the series of injections should be stopped when there is complete or acceptable pain relief or when the relief has plateaued, taking into consideration the maximum cumulative dose. Almost all responders used a local anesthetic mixture with the CSI, there were no distinctly defined early or lifetime limits, and there was a strong consensus for a 3-month corticosteroid-free preoperative interval.

### A randomized trial of intra-articular injection therapy for knee osteoarthritis [^111Rav8k]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The predicted graph shows that the greatest reduction in pain occurs in the hyaluronic acid and glucocorticoid group after 1 week, but the glucocorticoid effect vanishes completely after 3 months, the placebo effect after > 21 months. Interestingly, patients with low NRS pain values at baseline showed no or only little improvement (Fig. 2 B). The post hoc contrasts for the effect model showed no significant differences between the effects of placebo or glucocorticoid and the other drugs within the first 6 months after injection (see Supplementary Table S2).

Secondary Outcomes

All results in this section refer to the model-based (LMM) approach.

WOMAC (Pain)

The calculated difference to baseline pain values can be seen in Figure 2 C. There was no evidence that drug effects differed over time (P = 0.75). Post hoc contrasts showed no significant differences between the effects of placebo or glucocorticoid and other drugs (P = 0.21–0.98).

WOMAC (Stiffness and Physical Function) and Tegner Activity Scale

Difference to baseline values can be seen for WOMAC stiffness in Figure 2 D, for WOMAC physical function in Figure 2 E, and for Tegner Activity Scale in Figure 2 F. The post hoc contrasts for the effect model showed no significant differences, and there was no evidence that the drug effects differed over time (P = 0.31–1.00).

Clinical Parameters

Knee mobility did not differ significantly between baseline and at the follow-up examination (3 months after the injection): mean range of motion difference was −0.7 degrees (standard deviation: ± 7.2 degrees) for active knee extension, 0.5 degrees (± 9.9 degrees) for active knee flexion, 0.2 degrees (± 9.0 degrees) for passive knee flexion, and −0.3 degrees (± 6.8 degrees) for passive knee extension. The mean difference in thigh circumference was −0.1 cm (± 2.8) on the right side and 0 cm (± 2.3) on the left side.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections — Adverse events and quality of life: SRs and an RCT found no significant differences between groups in total adverse events at six months; another study showed a significantly higher rate of total adverse events in the saline group compared to the triamcinolone group at two years, with no significant difference in serious adverse events. Quality of life data were mixed, with FX006 extended-release CSI demonstrating improved quality of life at one and three months, whereas an SR found no significant difference versus placebo; one study suggested no differences in joint space narrowing, but a separate RCT demonstrated greater change (i.e., worsening) in some radiographic measures in patients receiving triamcinolone given every three months versus saline at two-years follow-up.

Modified US Preventive Services Task Force levels of certainty regarding net benefit — definitions for evidence strength are outlined for joint pain interventions. High certainty is described as evidence with "consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative care populations with joint pain", with conclusions "unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies". Moderate certainty is when "the available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the intervention on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors", and "the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low certainty indicates "the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes".

### HYADD 4 versus methylprednisolone acetate in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: a single-centre single blind prospective randomised controlled clinical study with 1-year follow-up [^1168qZUJ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the present study was to compare the clinical results and the quality of life in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis randomised to either a new HA (HYADD 4) or corticosteroid (CS). A separate rationale was to evaluate the safety profile of HYADD 4.

Methods

All the patients presenting for unilateral symptomatic primary knee osteoarthritis were prospectively randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of either HYADD 4 or CS, and were evaluated before the injections and at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Primary end point was WOMAC score at 26 weeks; secondary end points were WOMAC score, VAS for pain, and SF-36 score at any time point.

Results

There were 53 females and 22 males in the HYADD 4 group (mean age 71.5 ± 10.6 years), and 50 females and 25 males in the CS group (mean age 68.6 ± 9.9 years). The observed sided effects were mild and their incidence was similar in the two groups. Patients in the HYADD 4 group reported significantly better WOMAC scores at 26 weeks. The patients improved in all considered outcomes after the injections, with a peak of therapeutic effect between 6 and 12 weeks. Patients in the HYADD 4 group obtained significantly better scores than the CS group up to 26 weeks. At the 1-year follow-up no statistically significant differences between treatments were detected.

Conclusions

HYADD 4 did not have significantly higher side effects when compared to CS injections and provided better short-term (but not long-term) control of symptoms in patients with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. Patients with less pain and dysfunction at baseline may be the best candidates for HYADD 4 injections.

### Joint and soft tissue injection [^113Q4FR2]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Injection techniques are helpful for diagnosis and therapy in a wide variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Diagnostic indications include the aspiration of fluid for analysis and the assessment of pain relief and increased range of motion as a diagnostic tool. Therapeutic indications include the delivery of local anesthetics for pain relief and the delivery of corticosteroids for suppression of inflammation. Side effects are few, but may include tendon rupture, infection, steroid flare, hypopigmentation, and soft tissue atrophy. Injection technique requires knowledge of anatomy of the targeted area and a thorough understanding of the agents used. In this overview, the indications, contraindications, potential side effects, timing, proper technique, necessary materials, pharmaceuticals used and their actions, and post-procedure care of patients are presented.

### Stem cell injections for osteoarthritis of the knee [^112b3T1R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Stem cells are specialised precursor cells that can replace aged or damaged cells and thereby maintain healthy tissue function. Stem cell therapy is increasingly used as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis, despite the lack of clarity around the mechanism by which stem cell therapy may slow down disease progression in osteoarthritis, and uncertainty regarding its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of stem cell injections for people with osteoarthritis of the knee. A secondary objective is to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase on 15 September 2023, unrestricted by date or language of publication. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for relevant trial protocols and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or trials using quasi-randomised methods of participant allocation, comparing stem cell injection with placebo injection, no treatment or usual care, glucocorticoid injection, other injections, exercise, drug therapy, surgical interventions, and supplements and complementary therapies in people with knee osteoarthritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected studies for inclusion, extracted trial characteristics and outcome data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary comparison was stem cell injection compared with placebo injection. The primary time point for pain, function and quality of life was three to six months, and the end of the trial period for participant-reported success, joint structure changes and adverse event outcomes. Major outcomes were pain, function, quality of life, global assessment of success, radiographic joint progression, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events.

Main Results

We found 25 randomised trials (1341 participants) comparing stem cell injections with placebo injection (eight trials), no treatment or usual care (analgesia, weight loss and exercise) (two trials), glucocorticoid injection (one trial), hyaluronic acid injection (seven trials), platelet-rich plasma injections (two trials), oral acetaminophen (paracetamol) (one trial), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs plus physical therapy plus hyaluronic acid injection (one trial) and stem cell injection plus intra-articular co-intervention versus co-intervention alone (three trials) in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Trials were predominantly small, with sample sizes ranging from 6 to 252 participants, with only two trials having more than 100 participants. The average age of participants across trials ranged from 51 to 66 years, and symptom duration varied from one to 10 years. Placebo-controlled trials were largely free from bias, while most trials without a placebo control were susceptible to performance and detection biases. Here, we limit reporting to the main comparison, stem cell injection versus placebo injection. Compared with placebo injection, stem cell injection may slightly improve pain and function up to six months after treatment. Mean pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) was 4.5 out of 10 points with placebo injection and 1.2 points better (2.5 points better to 0 points better) with stem cell injection (I 2 = 80%; 7 studies, 445 participants). Mean function (0 to 100 scale, 0 best function) was 46.3 points with placebo injection and 14.2 points better (25.3 points better to 3.1 points better) with stem cell injection (I 2 = 82%; 7 studies, 432 participants). We are uncertain whether stem cell injections improve quality of life or increase the number of people who report treatment success compared to placebo injection, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Mean quality of life was 45.3 points with placebo injection and 22.8 points better (18.0 points worse to 63.7 points better) with stem cell injection (I 2 = 96%; 2 studies, 288 participants) at up to six months follow-up. At the end of follow-up, 89/168 participants (530 per 1000) in the placebo injection group reported treatment success compared with 126/180 participants (683 per 1000) in the stem cell injection group (risk ratio (RR) 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53; I² = 0%; 4 trials, 348 participants). We downgraded the evidence to low certainty for pain and function due to indirectness (as the source, method of preparation and dose of stem cells varied across studies), and suspected publication bias (up to three larger RCTs have been conducted but withdrawn prior to reporting of results). For quality of life and treatment success, we further downgraded the evidence to very low certainty due to imprecision in addition to indirectness and suspected publication bias. We are uncertain of the potential harms associated with stem cell injection, as there were very low event rates for serious adverse events. At the end of follow-up, 5/219 participants (23 per 1000) in the placebo injection group experienced serious adverse events compared with 4/242 participants (16 per 1000) in the stem cell injection group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.64; I² = 0%; 7 trials, 461 participants) and there were no reported withdrawals due to adverse events. We downgraded the evidence to very low certainty due to indirectness, suspected publication bias and imprecision. Radiographic progression was not assessed in any of the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared with placebo injections and based upon low-certainty evidence, stem cell injections for people with knee osteoarthritis may slightly improve pain and function. We are uncertain of the effects of stem cell injections on quality of life or the number who report treatment success. Although the putative benefits of stem cell therapies for osteoarthritis include potential regenerative effects on damaged tissues, particularly articular cartilage, we remain uncertain of the effect of stem cell injections on structural progression in the knee (measured by radiographic appearance). There is also uncertainty regarding the safety of stem cell injections. Serious adverse events were infrequently reported, although all invasive joint procedures (including injections) carry a small risk of septic arthritis. The risk of other important harms, including potential concerns related to the use of a therapy with the theoretical capacity to promote cell growth, or to the use of allogeneic cells, remains unknown.

### Monoarticular corticosteroid injection versus systemic administration in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients: a randomized double-blind controlled study [^116AmWwN]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of intraarticular glucocorticoid injection to its systemic use for treatment of knee synovitis in rheumatoid patients.

Methods

A randomized double-blind controlled study was conducted including 60 patients with RA. Patients were randomized to receive either a single intraarticular knee injection with triamcinolone hexacetonide 60 mg (3 ml) and xylocaine chloride 2% (1 ml) associated to a single intramuscular injection of 1 mL of xylocaine chloride 2% (IAI group) or 1 mL of xylocaine chloride 2% by intraarticular injection and a intramuscular injection of triamcinolone acetonide 60 mg (3 ml) and xylocaine chloride 2% (1 ml) (IM group). All patients were blindfolded for the procedure. Evaluations were performed at baseline and 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-intervention. The following instruments were used: VAS for knee pain, as primary outcome, VAS for knee morning stiffness and edema; the ACR 20, 50 and 70% improvement criteria; knee circumference and goniometry; Likert's scale of improvement; daily use of oral glucocorticoid and NSAIDs, blood pressure and adverse effects.

Results

Patients in the IAI group had significantly better results for VAS for knee pain, edema and morning stiffness as well as for improvement evaluation after intervention according to the patient (p < 0.001) and physician (p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Our results demonstrate that intraarticular injection with glucocorticoids is superior to its systemic use for the management of monoarticular synovitis in rheumatoid patients. The intraarticular approach showed better results in terms of local inflammatory variables and improvement evaluation by the patient and physician.

### Peri-articular steroid injection in total knee arthroplasty: a prospective, double blinded, randomized controlled trial [^115ENvHd]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2013). Low credibility.

Total knee arthroplasty is a painful operation. Peri-articular local anesthetic injections reduce post-operative pain and assist recovery. It is inconclusive whether intra-operative injections of peri-articular corticosteroids are of benefit. Therefore our clinical question was: in patients with osteoarthritis who are undergoing TKA, does the addition of high or low dose corticosteroid to peri-articular injections of local anesthetic and adrenaline improve post-operative pain and range of motion? We performed a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of two different doses of triamcinolone acetate (N = 42 in each group) added to local anesthetic in TKA for osteoarthritis. There were no significant differences in pain scores or ROM between the control and corticosteroid groups. Differences in secondary outcomes were also non-significant. Peri-articular corticosteroids do not appear to be of benefit in TKA.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections increase the risk of requiring knee arthroplasty [^112ziRAh]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Recent studies have suggested that corticosteroid injections into the knee may harm the joint resulting in cartilage loss and possibly accelerating the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to assess whether patients with, or at risk of developing, symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee who receive intra-articular corticosteroid injections have an increased risk of requiring arthroplasty.

Methods

We used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a multicentre observational cohort study that followed 4,796 patients with, or at risk of developing, osteoarthritis of the knee on an annual basis with follow-up available up to nine years. Increased risk for symptomatic OA was defined as frequent knee symptoms (pain, aching, or stiffness) without radiological evidence of OA and two or more risk factors, while OA was defined by the presence of both femoral osteophytes and frequent symptoms in one or both knees. Missing data were imputed with multiple imputations using chained equations. Time-dependent propensity score matching was performed to match patients at the time of receving their first injection with controls. The effect of corticosteroid injections on the rate of subsequent (total and partial) knee arthroplasty was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards survival analyses.

Results

After removing patients lost to follow-up, 3,822 patients remained in the study. A total of 249 (31.3%) of the 796 patients who received corticosteroid injections, and 152 (5.0%) of the 3,026 who did not, had knee arthroplasty. In the matched cohort, Cox proportional-hazards regression resulted in a hazard ratio of 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 1.81; p < 0.001) and each injection increased the absolute risk of arthroplasty by 9.4% at nine years' follow-up compared with those who did not receive injections.

Conclusion

Corticosteroid injections seem to be associated with an increased risk of knee arthroplasty in patients with, or at risk of developing, symptomatic OA of the knee. These findings suggest that a conservative approach regarding the treatment of these patients with corticosteroid injections should be recommended.

Conclusion

High molecular weight HA was the only treatment to surpass the MID for both pain and function outcomes. Extended-release corticosteroids may provide additional clinical benefit over standard-release corticosteroids. Platelet-rich plasma demonstrated possibly beneficial results; however, wide confidence intervals and sensitivity analyses made the conclusions of efficacy uncertain. Treatment-related adverse events may be less prevalent with the use of corticosteroids, but events seen in all therapies were primarily minor events that resolved on their own.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^115dgTTi]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Concern has been expressed about possible deleterious effects on articular cartilage volume of repeated joint injections with corticosteroid in people with knee osteoarthritis, but there is little evidence in people with IA. EULAR recommendations for intra-articular therapies advise avoiding > 3–4 corticosteroid injections in the same joint per year while acknowledging the lack of evidence to underpin this.

Conscious sedation, such as nitrous oxide, provides safe and effective short-term relief of pain and anxiety during intra-articular injections and can therefore be considered when administering local corticosteroid injections in children and young people with IA. General anaesthesia may be more suitable in certain cases (e.g. younger children or those requiring multiple injections).

Local corticosteroid injections are well tolerated, and serious side effects are rare. Recognized complications include infection, lipoatrophy, hypopigmentation and temporary worsening of diabetes control. No serious adverse effects took place during the injection procedure or follow-up for all patients included in the systematic review of the five studies mentioned above (n = 120). A minority of patients (n = 7) reported a mild cold feeling during the injection and one patient developed mild local atrophoderma at the point of entry after the treatment. Administration of local corticosteroid injections is also standard practice in other joints in IA (e.g. knees, shoulders), with evidence from RCTs for reduction in joint swelling, improved disease activity scores and DAS28 remission. There is no evidence to support any specific corticosteroid agent over another in the foot.

### A randomized trial of intra-articular injection therapy for knee osteoarthritis [^117BFr9b]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular injections are widely used for conservative treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, rigorous data are lacking regarding the comparative therapeutic effectiveness of these injections.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes after intra-articular injections of glucocorticoid, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or placebo in patients with mild or moderate OA of the knee.

Materials and Methods

In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single-center trial, we randomly assigned knees with early- to middle-stage knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1–3) to an intra-articular injection with one of these substances: glucocorticoid, hyaluronic acid, PRP, or placebo. Primary outcome was pain reduction within 6 months after the injection, assessed with the numeric rating scale (NRS; range, 0–100). Secondary outcome parameters included WOMAC scores, Tegner Activity Scale, knee mobility, and adverse events. Finally, a linear mixed-effects model was calculated and corrected for possible patient and covariate effects.

Results

One hundred twenty knees (30 knees per treatment group) in 95 patients (41 female) were included in the final analysis. The median age of patients was 60 years (interquartile range, 54.0–68.0). There was no evidence that the drug effects of primary and secondary outcome parameters differed over time. The median pain at baseline was 32.5 (interquartile range, 15.00–50.00) on NRS. The changes in pain level during the first 6 months compared with baseline were small (within ± 5 points on NRS), whereas the intrapatient variability was large between -20 and +20 points. Secondary outcome parameters did not differ significantly among the groups. Kellgren-Lawrence grade did not have a statistically significant effect on pain reduction (P = 0.61).

Conclusions

There is no evidence that knee injections with glucocorticoid, PRP, or hyaluronic acid have superior short- or long-term effects in patients with low pain level at baseline and early- to middle-stage knee OA when compared with placebo.

### Physical therapy vs. glucocorticoid injection in patients with meniscal tears and knee osteoarthritis: a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial [^114SQJCC]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A meniscal tear is a common degenerative alteration of the knee that can be caused by minor twisting or stress while the individual is participating in competitive sports. Degenerative tears in the knee are more common in older individuals because of the age-related loss of elasticity in the menisci. Previous studies have shown that severe meniscus injuries can lead to knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Furthermore, deterioration of the meniscus has been associated with the deterioration of cartilage in the knee joint, indicating a significant relationship between these two forms of joint pathology. Meniscal tears are particularly common among individuals who suffer from KOA, which is a common cause of joint pain and dysfunction among middle-aged and older people. The scourge of plagiarism afflicts countless individuals globally, imposing immense strain upon both those affected directly and our collective social fabric through its pervasiveness and financial implications. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that KOA may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.

The most common approach for managing meniscus injuries usually focuses on addressing symptoms alone until the injuries progress to the point where knee replacement is necessary due to the worsening of KOA. Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are commonly administered to treat degenerative meniscus injuries associated with KOA. A variety of treatment methods, such as intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma, have been proposed for the nonsurgical management of KOA. These therapeutic approaches are designed to alleviate pain and enhance functionality in individuals who are affected by KOA.

Intra-articular corticosteroids are highly effective anti-inflammatory agents that are injected directly into the knee joint. These injections can help alleviate inflammation and provide significant relief for individuals who suffer from KOA. Nonetheless, intra-articular corticosteroid injections are associated with certain risks, such as infection, joint cartilage deterioration, and subchondral insufficiency fractures. Therefore, it is important for patients to discuss these risks with them healthcare provider before proceeding with treatment. Exercise-based physical therapy has become the cornerstone for treating osteoarthritis. Studies have shown that physical therapy provides both short-term and long-term pain relief and improves functionality. Both physical therapy and steroid injections have been recommended by medical professionals for the treatment of knee arthritis. However, there is no consensus about which method is more effective for relieving pain and improving joint function over time. Previous clinical trials have shown that physical therapy combined with glucocorticoid injections does not provide further benefits.

### Injectable corticosteroids in modern practice [^116yLZDz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Long-lasting, crystalline suspensions of injectable corticosteroids have been used to treat joint and soft-tissue disorders for many years; they decrease inflammation by reducing local infiltration of inflammatory cells and mediators. Depot formulations differ in their characteristics. Compounds with low solubility are thought to have the longest duration of action but may cause tissue atrophy when used in soft tissues. Intra-articular corticosteroids are commonly used to treat osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis: meta-analyses confirm their benefit in reducing pain and symptoms. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been shown to be safe and effective for repeated use (every 3 months) for up to 2 years, with no joint space narrowing detected. Fewer clinical trials are available for extra-articular uses for injectable corticosteroids, although there is evidence of efficacy in a variety of soft-tissue conditions. The accuracy of injections affects outcomes. Postinjection flare, facial flushing, and skin and fat atrophy are the most common side effects. Systemic complications of injectable corticosteroids are rare.

### Steroid distancing in interventional pain management during COVID-19 and beyond: safe, effective and practical approach [^114hho22]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the late 1940s, corticosteroids have been a mainstay class of agents in multiple interventional techniques and intra-articular injections. Exogenous glucocorticoids are structurally and pharmacologically similar to the endogenous hormones. As such, multiple actions of corticosteroids are exhibited, including those of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Epidural injections, with or without steroids, have been extensively used throughout the world. There are reports of epidural injections starting in 1901, with steroids being added to the local anesthetic since 1952, when steroids were administered into the sacral foramen.

Purpose

Due to the extensive side effects of steroids in various injections, some have proposed limiting their use in epidurals and intraarticular injections. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the multiple side effects of the steroids have elevated the level of concern and recommendations have been made to utilize local anesthetic alone or the lowest dose of steroids. Fashioned from common expressions of the day, the term "steroid distancing" began to be used and proposed for intraarticular injections of the knee. Consequently, we sought to evaluate the evidence and feasibility of steroid distancing in interventional pain management.

Methods

This focused review of local anesthetics and steroids utilized in interventional pain management for epidural injections, peripheral nerve blocks, and intraarticular injections by multiple database searches. This is a focused narrative review and not a systematic review. Consequently, evidence synthesis was not performed traditionally, but was based on an overview of the available evidence.

Results

No significant difference was identified based on whether steroids are added to local anesthetic or not for epidural as well as facet joint injections. However, there was not enough evidence to compare these two groups for peripheral intraarticular injections.

Limitations

The present review is limited by the paucity of literature with bupivacaine alone or bupivacaine with steroids local anesthetic alone or with steroids of intraarticular injections of knee, hip, shoulder and other joints, and intraarticular facet joint injections.

Conclusion

This review shows an overall lack of significant difference between lidocaine alone and lidocaine with steroids in epidural injections. However, available evidence is limited for bupivacaine alone or with steroids. Evidence is also not available comparing local anesthetic alone with steroids for facet joint or peripheral joint intraarticular injections. Thus, it is concluded that local anesthetic with lidocaine may be utilized for epidural injections, with appropriate patient selection and steroids reserved for non-responsive patients with local anesthetic and with significant radiculitis.

### Effect of intra-articular triamcinolone vs saline on knee cartilage volume and pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^116QqUi7]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Synovitis is common and is associated with progression of structural characteristics of knee osteoarthritis. Intra-articular corticosteroids could reduce cartilage damage associated with synovitis but might have adverse effects on cartilage and periarticular bone.

Objective

To determine the effects of intra-articular injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide every 3 months on progression of cartilage loss and knee pain.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two-year, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of intra-articular triamcinolone vs saline for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis with ultrasonic features of synovitis in 140 patients. Mixed-effects regression models with a random intercept were used to analyze the longitudinal repeated outcome measures. Patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, Kellgren-Lawrence grades 2 or 3, were enrolled at Tufts Medical Center beginning February 11, 2013; all patients completed the study by January 1, 2015.

Interventions

Intra-articular triamcinolone (n = 70) or saline (n = 70) every 12 weeks for 2 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Annual knee magnetic resonance imaging for quantitative evaluation of cartilage volume (minimal clinically important difference not yet defined), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index collected every 3 months (Likert pain subscale range, 0 [no pain] to 20 [extreme pain]; minimal clinically important improvement, 3.94).

Results

Among 140 randomized patients (mean age, 58 [SD, 8] years, 75 women [54%]), 119 (85%) completed the study. Intra-articular triamcinolone resulted in significantly greater cartilage volume loss than did saline for a mean change in index compartment cartilage thickness of -0.21 mm vs -0.10 mm (between-group difference, -0.11 mm; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.03 mm); and no significant difference in pain (-1.2 vs -1.9; between-group difference, -0.6; 95% CI, -1.6 to 0.3). The saline group had 3 treatment-related adverse events compared with 5 in the triamcinolone group and had a small increase in hemoglobin A1c levels (between-group difference, -0.2%; 95% CI, -0.5% to -0.007%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, 2 years of intra-articular triamcinolone, compared with intra-articular saline, resulted in significantly greater cartilage volume loss and no significant difference in knee pain. These findings do not support this treatment for patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^114QFfUC]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) corticosteroid injection (CSI) — In an SR by McCabe et al. (2016), three of the five RCTs found no significant between-group differences in pain between CSI and placebo at 3–12 weeks follow-up, with substantial heterogeneity among individual study effect sizes ranging from no effect to a very large effect favoring CSI; regarding safety, four RCTs that included 310 patients found only one serious adverse event (i.e., deep vein thrombosis three months post-CSI), and one trial found similar adverse event rates between groups (51% in the CSI group versus 52% in the placebo group); McCabe et al. (2016) further found clinically significant between-group differences in OMERACT-OARSI responders favoring CSI over placebo at eight weeks.

### Triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension (Zilretta) [^1154FRvE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Triamcinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. It binds to and activates the glucocorticoid receptor, leading to activation of anti-inflammatory transcription factors such as lipocortins and inhibition of inflammatory transduction pathways by blocking the release of arachidonic acid and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Studies indicate that following a single intramuscular dose of 60 to 100 mg of immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, adrenal suppression occurs within 24 to 48 hours and then gradually returns to normal, usually in 30 to 40 days. To assess potential effects of the systemic levels of triamcinolone acetonide associated with a single intra-articular (IA) administration of ZILRETTA on hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function, serum and urine cortisol levels were monitored over 6 weeks post injection. Adrenal suppression with ZILRETTA occurred within 12–24 hours and then gradually returned to normal, within 30–42 days.

Corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations.

In a study where 18 patients with osteoarthritis knee pain and controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus received a single IA injection of ZILRETTA into the knee, the change from baseline in average blood glucose over the 72 hours after injection as measured by a continuous glucose monitoring device was 8.2 mg/dL (95% confidence interval 0.1, 29.2).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

ZILRETTA is an extended-release dosage form consisting of microspheres of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) containing triamcinolone acetonide. Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for triamcinolone acetonide following IA administration of ZILRETTA or 40 mg immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide into the knee are provided in Table 4.

Knee IACS — dose comparison and durability of effect are detailed: In a 12-week double-blind RCT, 80 mg of IA TA was compared with 40 mg of TA and 80 mg was not found to be superior to 40 mg for IA in terms of pain relief or functional improvement; neither IA corticosteroid nor hyaluronic acid provided sustained symptom relief over 2 years. Evidence syntheses concluded that IACS for knee OA may be associated with moderate improvement in pain and a small improvement in physical function up to 6 weeks after injection, confirmed short-term (up to 6 weeks) superiority with a trend towards superiority of control at long-term follow-up (24 weeks or longer), noted short-lived improvement (< 4 weeks) in guidelines, and found no difference in outcomes between IACS and NSAID injection with both improving at 1 and 3 months; research to date has not demonstrated long-term superiority of one corticosteroid preparation for IA knee injections.

Corticosteroid injections for adult chronic joint pain are described with use, techniques, and safety considerations. Pain in the shoulder, hip, knees, or fingers is common in patients over 40 years of age, and peripheral joint injections are used after failure of conservative management with the objective of reducing pain and improving function. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) and other musculoskeletal injections alleviate inflammation and reduce pain, improve function, facilitate rehabilitation, or give some temporary relief until definitive treatment, for example, surgery, can be undertaken, and injections include local anesthetic, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), mesenchymal stromal cells, and corticosteroid. For patients with joint pain, such injections are performed using landmark techniques or guided by ultrasound (US) or fluoroscopy. Clinical studies revealed corticosteroid-related adverse events; these include decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary axis, increase in blood sugar, and postoperative joint infection, and these events are compounded by clinicians injecting amounts higher than minimally effective doses; moreover, there has been no publication that compared the safety of the different procedures with landmark, US, or fluoroscopy across the joints' spectrum.

Postinjection activity after knee CSI — Survey data indicate variability in weight-bearing advice: 29% did not restrict weight bearing, 80% restricted for up to 1 week, and 42% recommended avoidance of weight bearing; rheumatologists were more likely to advise limited weight-bearing for 1 or 2 days than general practitioners or orthopedic surgeons (71% vs 57% vs 39%). A Cochrane review found low-quality evidence to support splinting/resting a knee after injection, but not the wrist.

### Effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis on the rates of subsequent knee replacement and post-operative outcomes: a national cohort study of england [^112DHUs8]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

However, our secondary analyses using propensity score matching did not replicate this protective effect. Likewise, a previous matched analysis found continuous use of IACI to be associated with an increased risk (HR > 3) of radiographic osteoarthritis progression, although Latourte et al. subsequently concluded from their cohort study that IACI conferred no significant risk increase of radiographic worsening or knee replacement, but that replication of findings was required in other cohorts. A previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested no effect of repeated IACI on pain reduction over a 2-year period, but one of greater cartilage loss (although between-group differences in cartilage loss were halved and no longer significant amongst the subset who completed the trial).

In terms of post-operative outcomes, it was reassuring to find no association between IACI use prior to knee replacement surgery and rates of post-operative complications, re-operations, or PROMs. A recent meta-analysis on this topic reported a small and non-statistically significant increase in the risk of post-operative prosthetic joint infection following knee replacement associated with any IACI use prior to surgery, which became larger and statistically significant when the time interval between injection and surgery was less than 3 months. Following exploratory analyses, we opted to use a composite outcome for complications owing to the small number of outcome events, however in a post-hoc analysis specifically of post-operative wound or prosthetic joint infections, there was no association between prior IACI use and incidence rates of infection (Additional File 1: Fig. S4). During 1-year follow-up, these rates (per 100 PYs) were: no IACI = 3.1 (95% CI: 2.4, 4.0), single IACI = 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.9), and repeat IACI = 3.9 (95% CI: 2.2, 6.6). We were unable to specifically investigate injections given less than 3 months before surgery owing to very few injections given within this timeframe, which reflects the existing caution in clinical practice given the potential risk of infection.

Methods

Data and participants

We obtained and used English primary care health data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD for the period 01/01/2005 to 28/08/2020. CPRD GOLD contains electronic primary care health records capturing data on patient demographics, symptoms, referrals, test results, diagnoses, clinical measurements, and prescribed medicines. Clinical data are entered into the database by general practice staff in the form of Read codes — a hierarchical classification system that's been in use for over 30 years. At the time of data extraction (September 2020), CPRD GOLD covered 4.8% of the UK population, and cumulatively contained data covering approximately 19 million current and historical people from over 900 GP practices spread across the country. All-cause mortality data were linked to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) based on the Lower Layer Super Output Area of the patient's postcode. Secondary care Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data were also linked, containing hospital diagnoses and procedures for admitted patient care (APC), and associated Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Curator software was used to perform pre-analytical data curation.

Incident knee osteoarthritis patients diagnosed between 01/01/2005 and 31/12/2019 were identified using Read code lists (Additional File 1: Table S1). Only patients whose data quality was flagged as acceptable for clinical research and registered at a GP practice with at least 1 year of 'up to standard' (the date of which is defined by CPRD in the dataset) clinical records were included. People with osteoarthritis at other anatomical joints were excluded as it was otherwise difficult to confidently ascertain which joint received an IACI from the Read code data. Further exclusion criteria, measured at knee osteoarthritis diagnosis date, were: age < 20 years old, body mass index (BMI) < 15 kg/m, prior referral to orthopaedic surgery (given it could be reasonably expected that in these cases injection may be being offered as a pain management strategy during the waiting period for joint replacement), prevalent inflammatory arthritis, and patients for whom HES APC linkage was not available.

Exposure

The exposure of interest was IACI. This was defined using a Read code for IACI in the knee joint or in an unspecified joint location (given the preponderance of such codes and the exclusion of patients with osteoarthritis affecting other sites).

### Physical therapy vs. glucocorticoid injection in patients with meniscal tears and knee osteoarthritis: a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial [^112w9QXP]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial procedures

Participants were recruited via hospital advertising and clinician referrals. All advertising strategies directed potential participants to a preliminary online screening form on the clinician. Those who passed the initial screening underwent full screening over the telephone with a member of the research team. All the participants received education classes, with the aim of providing abasic understanding of meniscus tears and knee osteoarthritis and reducing the degree of fear associated with pain symptoms. Simple strategies to reduce the risk of pain and improve function and instructions on how to self-manage any minor symptoms were discussed.

We performed block randomization at a 1:1 ratio, and we used a central computer-generated randomization scheme based on an electronic data capture (EDC) system. The randomization list was securely locked away and stored on EDC servers, and the allocation information was kept hidden. An investigator who was not involved in the randomization procedure prepared all sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes containing the assigned interventions to ensure that the sequence was concealed. After the sample size was determined, a third party randomly opened the envelopes to assign participants to either the physical therapy group or the glucocorticoid injection group sequentially.

To minimize bias and ensure the integrity of the study, in this study, the two groups of patients were blinded to the other treatment groups, as they were treated in different departments and rooms. As masking participants to their treatment assignment was impossible, participants were reminded to avoid discussing their treatment assignment with assessors or other participants. Physiotherapists delivered the intervention but played no role in data collection other than recording session attendance.

None of the study funders had any role in data collection, storage, or analysis; in the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

Glucocorticoid injections

Orthopedists or rheumatologists perform intra-articular injections according to clinical standards. One of the orthopedic providers administered an injection into one knee. The injection included 1 mL of triamcinolone acetonide (at a concentration of 40 mg per milliliter) combined with 7 mL of 1% lidocaine. A sterile technique was used. This injection aimed to reduce inflammation and pain while ensuring patient safety during the procedure. The same treatment providers examined patients again at 2 months and 6 months to discuss the continued plan of care, including the appropriateness of additional glucocorticoid injections. Patients could receive up to three injections over the 1-year trial period at the discretion of the clinician. Satisfactory treatment adherence in the glucocorticoid injection group was defined as the completion of the injection.

Box 7 — Adverse events from intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injections — states that clinically significant increases in blood glucose may follow IACS injection with effects noted within hours and peak blood glucose possibly delayed for up to 2 days; extended-release corticosteroid preparations may mitigate the impact of IACS on systemic blood glucose in patients with diabetes; adrenal suppression may follow an intra-articular corticosteroid injection; for warfarin patients with an international normalization ratio in the therapeutic range (2.0–3.0), the risks of withholding anticoagulation prior to IACS related to thromboembolism are greater than the risks of bleeding; when there is strict adherence to standard infection control practices, the risk of infection due to IACS is low; and there is an increased risk of postoperative deep joint infection when IACS is administered within 3 months of a joint replacement surgery, especially if performed prior to that surgery.

### Efficacy and safety of multiple intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis-a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies [^113eAWEC]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of multiple intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injections for the treatment of OA.

Methods

We conducted electronic searches of several databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Standard mean difference was calculated for efficacy, whereas hazard ratio (HR) was used for adverse effects. Results were combined using the random effects model. Heterogeneity was measured using I2 statistics.

Results

Six RCTs were included for efficacy assessment. The use of multiple IACS appeared to be better than comparator (standard mean difference for pain -0.47, 95% CI -0.62, 0.31). However, there was considerable heterogeneity (I2 92.6%) and subgroup analysis by comparator showed no separation of regular IACS from placebo, though timing of pain assessments was questionable. Fourteen RCTs and two observational studies were assessed for the safety of multiple IACS. Minor local adverse events were similar in both groups. One RCT found that regular IACS every 3months for 2years caused greater cartilage loss compared with saline injection (-0.21 vs 0.10mm). One cohort study found that multiple IACS injections associated with worsening of joint space narrowing (HR 3.02, 95% CI 2.25, 4.05) and increased risk of joint replacement (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.81, 3.57).

Conclusion

Multiple IACS injections are no better than placebo for OA pain according to current evidence. The preliminary finding of a detrimental effect on structural OA progression warrants further investigation. Efficacy and safety of multiple IACS reflecting recommended best practice has yet to be assessed.

Peri-arthroplasty considerations for corticosteroid injections — This CPG's systematic evidence review did not identify any new SRs or RCTs examining whether CSI should be avoided in the three months before joint replacement surgery of the knee. Although infection is a known complication arising from both joint injection and arthroplasty, limited data shows an increased risk of deep joint infection in patients who have undergone intra-articular CSI before joint arthroplasty, and patient factors that may increase this risk include prior open surgical procedure.

Corticosteroid pharmacology — choice of intra-articular preparation: The three most used corticosteroid preparations for intra-articular injection are methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone hexacetonide, and triamcinolone acetonide (Level of certainty: moderate). Various corticosteroid preparations have similar effectiveness but may differ in their duration of action (Level of certainty: moderate). Extended-release corticosteroid preparations have not demonstrated clinical superiority to standard preparations except for improved blood glucose stability in populations with diabetes (Level of certainty: moderate). There is insufficient evidence to recommend one preparation of intra-articular corticosteroid over another (Grade I).

### Follow up… [^116T2DAL]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are believed to modify the vascular inflammatory response to injury, inhibit destructive enzymes, and restrict the action of inflammatory cells. Intrasynovial steroid administration is designed to maximize local benefits and minimize systemic adverse effects. Local corticosteroid injections can provide significant relief and often ameliorate acute exacerbations of knee osteoarthritis associated with significant effusions |Uncontrolled bleeding disorder or coagulopathy| Judicious use of corticosteroids rarely produces significant adverse effects. The introduction of infection after injection is believed to occur in less than 1 in 10, 000 procedures. The concept of steroid arthropathy is largely based on studies in subprimate animal models, and it is an unusual occurrence in humans if the number of injections is limited to three to four per year in weight-bearing joints.

More conservative researchers have even advocated limiting knee injections to three or four over an individual's lifetime. Some physicians advocate that steroid injection should not be performed before excluding joint infection. The Patient Complains That the Joint Hurts Much Worse the Day After the Injection Than It Did Before the Injection. A recognized complication of steroid injections to joints is the postinjection flare. The flare reaction represents an increase in joint pain occurring in 1 to 2 percent of persons. The steroid crystals can induce an inflammatory synovitis that usually begins about six to 12 hours after the injection. The postinjection flare can present with swelling, tenderness, and warmth over the joint that persists for hours or days. If the patient takes anti-inflammatory medications immediately after the injection, they may reduce or abort this reaction. Aspiration should be performed to rule out joint sepsis if symptoms persist beyond two to three days.

The Patient Develops Joint Instability From Repeated Injections. The most serious complication of repeated injections is joint instability from the development of osteonecrosis of juxta-articular bone and weakened capsular ligaments. Some physicians advocate placing an elastic wrap around the knee immediately after large effusion drainage. The Patient's Pain Returned Just a Few Weeks After the Injection. A major disadvantage to intra-articular corticosteroid injections is the short duration of action. The average duration of benefit may be only two to three weeks; however, a small percentage of patients with osteoarthritis may have sustained relief after one or two injections.

### Corticosteroid injections for common musculoskeletal conditions… [^1121QGHZ]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid injections are beneficial in improving short-term outcomes. 35–38 Triamcinolone injections result in improved symptom scores and functional status at one week compared with placebo injection. 35 Methylprednisolone injection reduces symptom severity at 10 weeks compared with placebo. 36 At two weeks, systemic corticosteroids and local injections provide similar improvements in symptoms; however, patients who receive injections have significantly better symptom scores by eight and 12 weeks. 39 Local corticosteroid injection and oral NSAIDs with a neutral wrist splint result in similar short-term improvements in symptom severity. 40 Two corticosteroid injections provide no additional improvement compared with only a single injection.
41. 48 Symptom relapse occurred in 12% of patients who received one injection, 18% of those who received a second injection, and none who underwent surgery.

48 However, a Cochrane review notes that studies of corticosteroid injections for trigger finger are limited by sample size and short duration of follow-up. 47 Physicians should offer a corticosteroid injection for patients with trigger finger who are seeking a nonsurgical treatment option. 55 Treatment with intra-articular corticosteroid injections in the outpatient setting is challenging given the need for radiographic guidance. 56 A small double-blind study comparing corticosteroid and placebo injections using an ultrasound-guided anterolateral approach showed improvement in pain on walking at two and four weeks for the corticosteroid group, although that improvement disappeared by three months. 57 Fluoroscopically guided corticosteroid injections provide improvement in pain, stiffness, and physical function at two months compared with placebo injections.

55 Most primary care physicians should consider orthopedic referral for patients who desire injection treatment for hip osteoarthritis. Knee Osteoarthritis Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology conditionally recommend the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for treatment of knee osteoarthritis. 51 The duration of pain relief is one to two weeks in most trials, with a few showing improvements lasting three to four weeks. 60–63 Research uniformly supports the safety of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for treatment of knee osteoarthritis; however, these studies are limited by lack of histologic data and poor long-term follow-up. 64 A Cochrane review found weak evidence for the use of corticosteroid injections for the treatment of knee rheumatoid arthritis. 52 Physicians may consider intra-articular corticosteroid injections before orthopedic referral for surgical evaluation in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

### Joint and soft tissue injections… [^115HQqci]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Timing. Corticosteroid injections are appropriate when pain prohibits activities of daily living, leisure activities, or fitness. They may be performed as an adjunct to rehabilitation. 25 For patients with knee osteoarthritis, rehabilitation outperforms corticosteroid injections at one year, 26 and corticosteroid injection plus rehabilitation provides no greater pain relief than placebo injection plus rehabilitation.
27. 36 The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends against the routine use of hyaluronic acid. 37 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed minimal clinically significant improvement in pain or function and significant adverse reactions with hyaluronic acid knee injections. 38 Similarly, the American College of Rheumatology recommends against hyaluronic acid injections for knee osteoarthritis, noting that it can be considered in patients who have not been treated successfully with topical NSAIDs or corticosteroids.

57 A 2021 meta-analysis of 34 RCTs confirmed the superiority of platelet-rich plasma over other injections for knee osteoarthritis but did not meet the authors' prespecified minimal clinically significant difference. 58, 59. Complications Immediate complications may include pain, swelling, redness, stiffness, or soreness involving the injection site. These reactions can last from a few hours to several days and have been noted in 3% to 25% of patients receiving intra-articular corticosteroids and 2% to 6% of patients receiving intra-articular hyaluronic acid for knee osteoarthritis. Cartilage damage from corticosteroid injections is time-dependent and dose-dependent. 66, 67 One study found that repeated treatments with intra-articular triamcinolone acetonide contributed to higher rates of cartilage loss and progressive joint space narrowing over two years compared with placebo.

31 However, this study does not reflect routine care because patients were treated with corticosteroid injections regardless of symptoms. 31, 66 A population-based cohort study followed patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis over five years who received intra-articular corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid injections only when symptomatic; there was no significant change in cartilage thickness when corticosteroid injections were used only for symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis flare-ups.
67. Corticosteroid injections into soft tissue can cause depigmentation and atrophy, which usually develop days to weeks following injection. 11, 34 Inaccurate placement of the needle and injectate can lead to injury of adjacent structures and potential tendon trauma. 3 Plantar fascia rupture and heel pad atrophy are rare complications associated with corticosteroid injections for plantar fasciitis.
