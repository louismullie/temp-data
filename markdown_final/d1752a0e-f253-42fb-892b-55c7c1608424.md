## Question

diverticulum esophagus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about esophageal diverticula, including classification, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and management, with attention to special scenarios and complications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions and classification framework. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and how it differs by type. Next, I will review clinical manifestations and red flags. After that, I need to check the diagnostic algorithm and where guidelines fit. Then, I will examine management by subtype, including when to operate and when to observe. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, complications, and follow-up, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these together.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions and classification, because everything else hinges on getting this right. Esophageal diverticula are saccular outpouchings of the esophageal wall, and they are classically categorized by mechanism as pulsion versus traction, by esophageal layer involvement as false versus true, and by anatomic location such as Zenker's, midesophageal, and epiphrenic, with Zenker's being the most common in adults and epiphrenic typically near the gastroesophageal junction; I should also remember the less common variants like Killian-Jamieson and Laimer's diverticula, and the entity of esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis, which is radiologically distinct and not a true diverticulum [^111eFuZY] [^113z3oEW] [^116gHhbJ].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology next, because treatment decisions depend on it. Pulsion diverticula are false diverticula caused by increased intraluminal pressure forcing mucosa and submucosa through a point of muscular weakness, whereas traction diverticula are true diverticula resulting from extrinsic inflammatory traction, classically from mediastinal granulomatous disease; importantly, midesophageal and epiphrenic diverticula are frequently associated with esophageal motility disorders, with achalasia being the dominant association for epiphrenic diverticula, and Zenker's arises at Killian's triangle due to cricopharyngeal dysfunction and elevated hypopharyngeal pressure [^112GGhfa] [^111eFuZY] [^113BzaQs] [^1165V3Nf] [^112DJPXy].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation, and I need to ensure I tie symptoms to mechanism and location. Zenker's typically causes dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, halitosis, choking, and aspiration symptoms, with larger diverticula correlating with more severe dysphagia and post-swallow hypopharyngeal reflux; epiphrenic and midesophageal diverticula present with dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and sometimes weight loss, and symptoms often reflect the underlying motility disorder as much as the pouch itself; intramural pseudodiverticulosis may be subtle or present with dysphagia and strictures, and I should remember that symptoms can persist for years before diagnosis [^116M99Vr] [^116GTg3S] [^1165V3Nf] [^117PEZCh].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic workup and not jump to conclusions. For suspected Zenker's, barium esophagram with videofluoroscopy is the first-line test and is guideline-recommended, whereas esophageal manometry is not recommended in the diagnostic evaluation of Zenker's; for epiphrenic and midesophageal diverticula, a barium esophagram defines size and location, endoscopy excludes malignancy and evaluates mucosa, and high-resolution manometry identifies underlying motility disorders that change management; CT is helpful when complications like fistula or perforation are suspected, and I should double-check that endoscopic ultrasound is reserved for select cases where depth or alternative pathology is in question [^113himMT] [^116fbFT7] [^1165V3Nf] [^117KVbRA].

> Next, I should review management principles, and I need to ensure I separate observation from intervention. Asymptomatic diverticula, regardless of size, can be observed with counseling, whereas symptomatic diverticula warrant therapy directed at both the pouch and the underlying pathophysiology; for Zenker's, endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy or septotomy is preferred over open surgery in most centers, with high technical and clinical success when performed cooperatively by ENT and gastroenterology; for epiphrenic diverticula, addressing the motility disorder with a myotomy is essential, and diverticulectomy is added for large or complicated pouches, with laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus partial fundoplication as the standard approach and POEM emerging as a minimally invasive alternative in selected patients [^115QT9Hz] [^114Uzkju] [^1165V3Nf] [^115tnmGH].

> But wait, what if the epiphrenic diverticulum is small and the motility disorder is the real driver of symptoms; can I avoid resection. Let me reconsider the evidence: a comparative study suggests that myotomy without diverticulectomy can still resolve symptoms in many patients, implying that the motility disorder is the dominant pathophysiologic factor; however, larger diverticula, food retention, or prior failed therapy still favor concomitant diverticulectomy, so I should individualize based on size, symptoms, and prior interventions [^116ykXWL] [^1165V3Nf].

> I should confirm the role of endoscopic therapy beyond Zenker's. Flexible endoscopic septum division and Z-POEM are effective for Zenker's, and D-POEM has been described for mid to distal esophageal diverticula, including epiphrenic pouches, though experience is more limited and patient selection is critical; in select cases, endoscopic submucosal dissection with closure has been used for mid-esophageal diverticula, but I need to ensure that local expertise and risk of perforation are weighed carefully [^114Dpiof] [^115tnmGH] [^112LvVeV].

> Let me think about special scenarios and complications, and I should double-check the high-risk entities. Bronchoesophageal fistula secondary to esophageal diverticulum is rare but serious, often arising from the midthoracic esophagus to the right lower lobe bronchus, and MSCT is superior to esophagography or endoscopy for delineating the tract and lung involvement; bleeding from an epiphrenic diverticulum is uncommon, and positional maneuvers during endoscopy can facilitate hemostasis by improving visualization; malignancy within a diverticulum is rare but carries a higher risk of transmural spread due to thin walls, so meticulous endoscopic staging is essential; and I should remember that medications like alendronate can lodge in a Zenker's pouch and cause caustic injury, so medication review is part of safe management [^117KVbRA] [^111yEBqD] [^113hZowd] [^11473B9F].

> I need to ensure I cover postoperative care and follow-up. After endoscopic or surgical therapy for Zenker's, a cooperative follow-up plan with speech therapy and interval assessment of swallowing is prudent, and recurrent symptoms should prompt repeat contrast imaging; after epiphrenic diverticulum surgery, a contrast esophagram is typically obtained before resuming oral intake to confirm integrity, and long-term outcomes after minimally invasive approaches are favorable when the underlying motility disorder is addressed [^116oNwmJ] [^1147Yy2C].

> Let me synthesize this into a practical approach, and I should double-check that it aligns with guidelines. Suspected esophageal diverticulum begins with a careful history focused on dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration, and weight change, followed by barium esophagram with videofluoroscopy to define anatomy and function; endoscopy excludes malignancy and evaluates mucosa, and high-resolution manometry is added for midesophageal and epiphrenic diverticula to detect motility disorders; asymptomatic cases are observed, while symptomatic Zenker's is treated with endoscopic myotomy or septotomy, and symptomatic epiphrenic or midesophageal diverticula are managed with myotomy plus selective diverticulectomy, with POEM as a promising option in experienced hands; throughout, I should remain vigilant for complications like fistula, bleeding, and caustic injury, and tailor therapy to patient comorbidity and local expertise [^113himMT] [^1165V3Nf] [^115tnmGH].

Esophageal diverticula are outpouchings of the esophageal wall, classified by location and mechanism as **Zenker's (upper), midesophageal, and epiphrenic (lower)** [^112rME8H]. Zenker's is most common and presents with dysphagia, regurgitation, halitosis, and aspiration risk [^112GGhfa]; midesophageal and epiphrenic are often linked to motility disorders such as achalasia [^113BzaQs] [^112DJPXy]. Diagnosis relies on **barium esophagram** [^113himMT] and endoscopy; manometry is used when a motility disorder is suspected [^1165V3Nf]. Management is based on symptoms and size: small, asymptomatic diverticula may be observed, while symptomatic or large lesions require intervention — endoscopic myotomy for Zenker's [^114Dpiof] and laparoscopic diverticulectomy with myotomy for epiphrenic or midesophageal [^1165V3Nf]. Complications include aspiration pneumonia, perforation, and rare malignancy; recurrence is minimized by addressing the underlying motility disorder [^113BzaQs].

## Classification and pathophysiology

Esophageal diverticula are classified by **location and mechanism** [^111eFuZY]:

| **Type** | **Location** | **Mechanism** | **Pathophysiology** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Zenker's diverticulum | Upper esophagus (Killian's triangle) | Pulsion | - Cricopharyngeal dysfunction <br/> - Increased intraluminal pressure [^111LYoUN] |
| Midesophageal diverticulum | Mid esophagus | Traction or pulsion | - Mediastinal inflammation <br/> - Motility disorders [^111o53yx] [^112DJPXy] |
| Epiphrenic diverticulum | Lower esophagus (above LES) | Pulsion | - Motility disorders (e.g. achalasia) <br/> - Increased distal pressure [^111o53yx] |

---

Pulsion diverticula result from **increased intraluminal pressure** and mucosal herniation through a weak point, whereas traction diverticula result from external inflammatory or fibrotic pull [^111o53yx].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms vary by **size, location, and underlying motility disorder**:

- **Zenker's diverticulum**: Dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, halitosis, aspiration pneumonia, neck mass (Boyce's sign) [^112GGhfa] [^116M99Vr].
- **Midesophageal diverticulum**: Dysphagia, chest pain, regurgitation, respiratory symptoms [^notfound].
- **Epiphrenic diverticulum**: Dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn, weight loss, respiratory symptoms [^1165V3Nf].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on **clinical evaluation and imaging**:

- **Barium esophagram**: Gold standard; identifies size, location, and food retention [^111LYoUN].
- **Upper endoscopy**: Direct visualization, biopsy, and exclusion of malignancy [^1165V3Nf].
- **Esophageal manometry**: Detects motility disorders (e.g. achalasia) [^112nfsGc].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **symptoms, size, and complications**:

| **Diverticulum type** | **Asymptomatic** | **Symptomatic or large** |
|-|-|-|
| Zenker's | Observation | Endoscopic myotomy (Z-POEM, flexible endoscopic septum division) [^116oNwmJ] [^114Uzkju] |
| Midesophageal | Observation | Surgical diverticulectomy with myotomy [^1147Yy2C] |
| Epiphrenic | Observation | Laparoscopic diverticulectomy with myotomy and fundoplication [^117X19dX] |

---

Endoscopic therapy is **minimally invasive** with high success, whereas surgery is preferred for large or complex diverticula [^112rME8H].

---

## Complications

Untreated esophageal diverticula can cause **significant complications**:

- **Aspiration pneumonia**: Common with Zenker's [^111Vczrq].
- **Perforation**: Rare but serious [^111o53yx].
- **Malignancy**: Rare squamous cell carcinoma in longstanding diverticula [^111TH9F3].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis after treatment is **excellent**, with low recurrence when the underlying motility disorder is addressed [^111c46ws]. Recurrence is **higher** if the motility disorder is not treated [^113BzaQs].

---

Esophageal diverticula are outpouchings classified by location and mechanism; **management is symptom-guided**, with endoscopic or surgical intervention for symptomatic or large diverticula, and prognosis is excellent when the underlying motility disorder is treated [^notfound].

More than 50 years ago, two investigators described a rare case of multiple esophageal diverticula, which they named esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis (EIPD). To this day, the pathogenesis of this condition remains obscure. Several coexisting conditions, such as strictures, esophageal dysmotility, or infection, require medical treatment. We present two typical cases of EIPD and one case of a rare single esophageal intramural diverticulum.

Oesophageal diverticulum occurring secondary to motility disorders or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in adults but true congenital oesophageal diverticula are rare in infants and children. We present a case of a toddler boy who presented with dysphagia and vomiting after feeds after weaning was attempted starting at 6 months of age. Barium esophagogram revealed a diverticulum in the upper one-third of the oesophagus within the thoracic cavity. The child underwent multiple interventions elsewhere without definitive surgery that highlights the rarity of this condition. Thoracotomy and repair were performed by us with a satisfactory outcome. The review of the literature on the clinical presentation and management of this rare condition has been discussed, highlighting similar reported cases.

Pathophysiology of diverticular disease: from fiber hypothesis to mucosal inflammation.

Although the diagnosis of diverticular disease can be relatively straightforward, randomized controlled trials of clinical management are scarce and management often follows tradition rather than principles of evidence-based medicine. Some practice guidelines do exist, – but most of them are relatively old and rely mainly on expert opinion.

The aim of this symposium was to review the clinical presentation of diverticular disease, to discuss the role of dysbiosis in its pathogenesis and to define its treatment, by examining the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the currently used drugs.

To render the symposium more dynamic and deliver key messages in a more efficient way, an innovative formula of 'questions and answers', first developed by the Scientific Committee of the World Organization for Specialized Studies on Diseases of the Esophagus (OESO), and successfully used now for some decades, has been adopted.

### Esophageal strictures and diverticula [^112WthnQ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Esophageal disease and dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) manifesting as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) particularly, is the most common of all gastrointestinal conditions impacting patients on a day-to-day basis. LES dysfunction can lead to anatomic changes to the distal esophagus, with GERD-mediated changes being benign stricture or progression of GERD to Barrett's esophagus and even esophageal cancer, and LES hypertension impairing esophageal emptying with subsequent development of pulsion esophageal diverticulum. This article details the causes, clinical presentation, workup, and treatment of esophageal stricture and epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum. Other types of esophageal diverticula (Zenker's and midesophageal) are also covered.

Mid-esophageal diverticulum is a medical rarity. Only patients in whom the condition is symptomatic should receive treatment. Minimally invasive surgery via a thoracoscopic approach is currently the preferred treatment for the condition. This case report describes a 63-year-old woman with a symptomatic mid-esophageal diverticulum, which was successfully treated by endoscopic diverticulotomy using a needle-knife through a flexible endoscope.

### Zenker's diverticulum in an 85-year-old Ugandan man [^116M99Vr]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Esophageal diverticula are rare, with a radiologic and endoscopic prevalence of 0.06–4%, in which Zenker's is the most common. It is usually diagnosed between the seventh and eighth decades of life. In this case, the patient presented in his mid-eighties.

The commonest symptoms of ZD at presentation are dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, choking, borborygmi in the cervical region, chronic cough, halitosis, weight loss, and less commonly hoarseness. The most consistent sign, however, is dysphagia. Physical examination finding that is rarely seen is a swelling in the neck that my gurgle on palpation (Boyce's sign). In the reported cases, there is variable time of presentation, from onset to diagnosis, ranging from weeks to years. The patient presented with odynophagia and dysphagia initially to solid and later to fluids. Then he developed regurgitation of undigested food. There were complaints of weight loss but no signs of malnutrition. There was no palpable neck swelling on examination and the duration of symptoms at presentation was only one year.

### Achalasia and epiphrenic diverticulum [^113BzaQs]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Epiphrenic diverticula are a rare disease almost always associated with an underlying motility disorder of the esophagus, such as achalasia. Treatment of any underlying motility disorder must be included in the management of epiphrenic diverticula to prevent postoperative complications and recurrences. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to describe the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and proper methods of diagnosis and treatment of patients with epiphrenic diverticula. In addition, we aim to provide an overview of the surgical management and discuss the indications for surgery and choice of surgical approach. In general, surgical intervention is favored for symptomatic patients and the optimal surgical approach depends on the size and location of the diverticulum. Surgery is not without seemingly high rates of morbidity when a myotomy is not performed together with the diverticulectomy, even in those with normal manometry. The risk of carcinoma is exceedingly rare and it is usually discovered at later stages; therefore, no surveillance programs have been established in asymptomatic patients with unresected diverticula.

### Upper esophageal dysphagia [^111x9P5R]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Esophageal dysphagia presents acutely, most frequently as a food impaction, or in a progressive fashion. Anatomic changes are frequently responsible. Although the history may be suggestive, diagnosis is made from imaging or endoscopic studies. In asymptomatic cases, observation is most appropriate. Treatment is frequently accomplished endoscopically. Strictures, cricopharyngeal hyperfunction, and Zenker diverticulum are potential etiologic causes. For the purpose of this article focused on upper esophageal dysphagia, delineation between the upper and lower parts is the crossing of the aortic arch but also includes the most distal aspects of the hypopharynx including the inferior pharyngeal constrictors and upper esophageal sphincter.

Esophageal diverticula can cause disabling symptoms. The authors describe here our preferred surgical approach for Zenker's and epi-phrenic diverticula. For most patients, excision of the diverticulum and addition of a myotomy will result in a favorable functional outcome and a low recurrence rate.

### A review on gastric diverticulum [^114yNZFW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

A high clinical index of suspicion is needed to diagnose and effectively manage patients with gastric diverticulum. This condition typically present with a long history of vague symptoms such as upper abdominal pain and dyspepsia. It does not always resolve with PPIs and can even be missed on OGD or CT scanning. A focused investigation to look for this particular condition is needed to identify it and subsequently manage it.

We particularly recommend that keep a high index of suspicion in mind especially in patients with a long history of upper abdominal pain and dyspepsia that does not resolve with PPIs and with an insignificant OGD. Although the literature does not describe a standarised approach for the management of this condition, however, we consider laparoscopic repair to be a safe and suitable procedure for this in symptomatic patients who have not responded to medical therapy.

### Therapeutic strategies for epiphrenic diverticula: systematic review [^111HJh3C]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Most patients with epiphrenic diverticula are asymptomatic. When dysphagia or regurgitation is limited and respiratory complaints are absent, these patients usually can live with the diverticulum left in place. Fewer than one-third of the diverticula produce symptoms severe enough to seek medical attention or to warrant surgery. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the therapeutic strategies for epiphrenic diverticula-from a nonsurgical alternative such as endoscopic dilatation for symptomatic patients unfit for surgery, to the traditional approach of surgical resection (left thoracotomy), and finally to the minimally invasive techniques (thoracoscopy, laparoscopy) used more recently. Whatever treatment and approach are used for the patient with epiphrenic diverticula, a tailored protocol always involves detailed study of the esophageal morphology and function.

### Giant esophageal diverticula after laparoscopic band placement [^114za4Gt]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

An esophageal diverticulum is seen in a variety of gastroesophageal conditions, with most having an underlying motility disorder. The diverticulum is diagnosed by combining the patient's history, physical examination, computed tomographic chest scan, and barium radiography. We present an unusual case of a 43-year-old patient with a history of leiomyoma resection of the esophagus and an ensuing placement of a laparoscopic band for weight loss. One year after banding, persistent dysphagia led to the diagnosis of a large esophageal diverticulum. We believe that this esophageal diverticulum is the largest reported secondary to a laparoscopic band.

Conclusion

Endoscopic treatment options for ZD and similar esophageal diseases are rapidly expanding. There is heterogeneity in techniques and equipment used. However, the techniques are highly modifiable, and with careful tailoring to individual patient characteristics, our expanding arsenal of options has resulted in the ability to treat a broader spectrum of patients and conditions.

### Zenker's diverticulum in an 85-year-old Ugandan man [^111LYoUN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Zenker's diverticulum (ZD), is a rare disorder with an estimated prevalence ranging between 0.01 and 0.11% in the general population. It is an acquired outpouching of the mucosal and submucosal layers originating in a region of relative weakness known as Killian's triangle or Killian's dehiscence. The most common pathogenesis relates to increased intraluminal pressure leading to an outpouching in an area of relative wall weakness when compared with surrounding tissues. This area of weakness is located in the hypopharynx between two strong pharyngoesophageal muscles, the cricopharyngeus muscle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor. It occurs between the seventh and eighth decade of life and rarely before the age of 40. It occurs with aging specifically due to changes in fibrosis and muscle necrosis of the upper esophageal sphincter. Symptoms may present for weeks to years before presentation and diagnosis. Most patients present with a complaint of dysphagia. Two mechanisms have been proposed by which the diverticulum can cause dysphagia: incomplete opening of the upper esophageal sphincter and extrinsic compression of the cervical esophagus by the diverticulum. As the diverticulum enlarges, the symptoms become more severe with resultant weight loss. A sudden increase in severity of hematemesis may signal the development of ulcer. Esophagography is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of ZD. Several surgical options are available for the management of ZD. Herein, a typical case of ZD diagnosed through barium swallow examination is reported in an elderly man.

### Current management of diverticulitis [^117NrpLH]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Diverticulosis and diverticulitis remain common diagnoses in western countries, and the incidence continues to rise. Diverticulitis accounts for roughly one-third of admissions to acute care hospitals annually, with even more patients being treated as outpatients due to improved understanding of risk stratification and the natural history of disease progression. Thus, having a thorough understanding of the etiology of the disease in conjunction with computed tomography findings and patient presentation can help dictate the appropriate treatment.

### Congenital esophageal diverticulum-a case report and review of literature [^113cYe5g]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Zenker's Diverticulum (ZD) is a false diverticulum located in the posterior esophagus between the cricopharyngeus and inferior constrictor. Few cases have been reported in the pediatric population. Congenital esophageal diverticulum is commonly associated with additional esophageal anatomical deformities or iatrogenic injury in the early post-natal period. TD was born at 39 5/7 weeks gestational age and did well at home with the exception of "choking during feeds 2–4 times per day" with mild cyanosis. Flexible bronchoscopy performed under sedation revealed a retropharyngeal mass protruding towards the epiglottis resulting in upper airway obstruction. Esophogram demonstrated upper esophageal diverticulum. Patient underwent left neck dissection with cervical myotomy from the cricopharyngeus to the level of the thoracic inlet. A postoperative repeat esophogram illustrated resolution of the diverticulum. Currently, the patient is 9 months postoperative and is tolerating feeds by mouth, gaining weight and has no pulmonary symptoms. There have been a few reports of ZD in children occurring in combination with anatomical abnormalities or esophageal manipulation. This case is one of the youngest reported and occurs in a patient without any previous manipulation of the esophagus. This condition is exceedingly rare but should be included in the differential diagnosis for both pharyngoesophageal and tracheal symptoms.

### MSCT study for adult esophageal diverticulum with secondary broncho-esophageal fistula [^113a9Q5U]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Broncho-esophageal fistula (BEF) is the pathological connection between the esophagus and the bronchus, which can be acquired or congenital. The BEF diagnosed in adulthood is usually acquired. Malignancies, most commonly esophageal cancer followed by lung cancer, account for more than half of cases in adults. Benign BEF caused by tuberculosis, injury, surgical operation, and tracheal intubation balloon compression are rare in adults. Esophageal diverticulum is a blind-ended tube covered with epithelium that communicates with the esophageal lumen, and can be classified into congenital and acquired types based on various factors. Based on its pathogenesis, esophageal diverticula can be divided into traction and pulsion types. Traction diverticula are formed due to adhesion and traction of the esophageal wall caused by adjacent mediastinal lymphadenitis or granulomatous inflammation. They typically involve all layers of the esophageal wall, and are referred to as true diverticula. Sometimes, due to inflammatory necrosis, a fistula can occur between the esophageal diverticulum and the respiratory airways, or even a vascular structure. In fact, BEF secondary to esophageal diverticulum is a rare clinical entity which can manifest as non-specific presentations such as mimicking pneumonia, bronchiectasis, prolonged coughing, and lung abscess. The presence of BEF has a severe impact on the health and survival of individuals due to prolonged dysphagia, bucking following oral fluid intake, recurrent aspiration pneumonia and weight loss. Symptoms and signs of BEF vary according to different etiologies and the size, location, and shape of fistulous tract. Therefore, this disease entity is often misdiagnosed or missed for a long time.

### MSCT study for adult esophageal diverticulum with secondary broncho-esophageal fistula [^111o53yx]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

BEF, which manifests as a direct channel between the esophagus and bronchus, is commonly caused by congenital malformations or pathological factors such as malignancy, tuberculosis, candidiasis, trauma and so on. BEF associated with esophageal diverticulum is a rare clinical entity with only a few case reports in previous studies. Esophageal diverticulum is a blind-ended tube covered with epithelium that communicates with the esophageal lumen and can be congenital or acquired due to various factors. Based on their pathogenesis, esophageal diverticula can be categorized into traction and pulsion types. Pulsion-type esophageal diverticula result from increased intraluminal pressure within the esophagus, causing partial protrusion of the esophageal mucosa and submucosa through a weakened point in the muscular layer. These diverticula do not involve the entire esophageal wall and are referred to as false diverticula. Traction-type diverticula, on the other hand, develop as a result of adjacent mediastinal lymphadenitis or granulomatous inflammation causing adhesion and traction on the esophageal wall. They typically involve all layers of the esophageal wall and are termed true diverticula. The relationship between underling esophageal motility disorders and esophageal diverticulum formation has also been highlighted in previous studies. When an esophageal diverticulum, due to diverticulitis or chronic inflammation with adhesion and traction on the esophageal wall, leads to chronic perforation and connection with the adjacent respiratory tract, it can result in mediastinitis or BEF. In short, it is believed that esophagobronchial fistula secondary to esophageal diverticulum is a result of an inflammatory necrosis process that leads to the formation of a passage between the esophagus and the bronchus. According to our study, most diverticula occur in the mid-thoracic esophagus and lead to serious consequences, and a small minority in the low thoracic esophagus. This is closely related to its anatomy, because the lungs are immediately beside the esophagus at this level. In general, these diverticula have no specific clinical manifestations and no intervention is necessary. Nevertheless, severe complications such as hemorrhage, perforation or fistulous formation with adjacent bronchi may occur due to chronic inflammation and tissue necrosis. After the formation of fistula, some components will enter the lung parenchyma through the fistulous tract when the patient ingests non-solid food. Prolonged aspiration results in recurrent pneumonia and related clinical presentations such as chronic cough, fever and hemoptysis, which will seriously affect the patients' life quality.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1135U56Z]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Diverticular hemorrhage — diverticular bleeding is arterial, typically presents as painless hematochezia, and usually occurs from either the neck or the dome of the diverticulum. Patients with diverticular bleeding are candidates for endoscopic treatment if active bleeding (spurting or oozing), a non-bleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot (that cannot be removed with vigorous washing and suctioning) is found at the time of colonoscopy, and these stigmata of hemorrhage predict a high risk of rebleeding without treatment.

Methods

Patients reporting typical symptoms as described earlier are comprehensively evaluated with a full clinical history, contrast swallow study, and diagnostic upper endoscopy. If there is any concern for impaired swallow initiation or coordination, patients are referred for a modified barium swallow and review by speech/language therapy. If there is concern for esophageal dysmotility, patients undergo high-resolution esophageal manometry. Symptomatic patients with ZD as confirmed on contrast swallow study and/or upper endoscopy are offered treatment. Procedures are performed with the patient under general anesthesia and in a supine position.

The traditional method of flexible endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy (FECM) involves the division of the entire common wall or septum of the ZD, aiming for a complete myotomy of the cricopharyngeus. Zenker's peroral endoscopic myotomy (Z-POEM) uses a proximal submucosal tunnel to provide direct visualization and exposure of the cricopharyngeus and septum. Because the mucosa is kept intact, aggressive myotomy can then be performed. We demonstrate a modification to simplify the technique by performing submucosal injection and mucosal incision directly over the septum. Proposed advantages of this technique include shorter procedure time and potentially decreased risk, although this remains to be proven in prospective comparative studies.

### Rarer than rare: managing an epiphrenic diverticulum in achalasia [^111TH9F3]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

An epiphrenic diverticulum is an extraordinarily rare condition, occurring in approximately 1 per 500.000 people per year. It is often associated with esophageal motility disorders (achalasia in 60% of cases) and, when large (i.e. > 5 cm), undoubtedly causes symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, weight loss, and aspiration pneumonia. Malignant transformation, mostly into squamous cell carcinoma, occurs in about 0.6% of cases. When a symptomatic diverticulum is associated with a motility disorder, subsequent management must address both conditions: minimally invasive surgery usually includes resection of the diverticulum, myotomy of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and an antireflux procedure.

A 77-year-old man presented to the emergency room with progressive dysphagia and food regurgitation. Following two unsuccessful esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) attempts at another hospital, a barium esophagogram showed a dilated esophagus with a prominent diverticulum above the LES (Fig. 1). An EGD was eventually completed, revealing a markedly dilated, atonic esophagus filled with partially digested food, and a large epiphrenic diverticulum (Video 1). The esophagogastric junction was passed with slight resistance using a 11.6-mm wide, high definition gastroscope (Pentax EG34-i10). A "Contents, Anatomy, Resistance, and Stasis" (CARS) score of 7 was highly suggestive of achalasia. Type II achalasia was diagnosed via high resolution manometry (HRM), according to Chicago classification 4.0 (Fig. 2).

### Frequency and etiology of midesophageal diverticula at barium esophagography [^112DJPXy]. Clinical Imaging (2006). Low credibility.

Midesophageal diverticula were identified at 8 of 218 (3.6%) esophagrams performed over a 3-year period in adult patients with no prior history of gastroesophageal surgery. All eight patients received a final diagnosis of esophageal dysmotility with secondary pulsion diverticula, and seven of eight (88%) patients had abnormal peristalsis noted during the esophagram. We conclude that most, if not all, midesophageal diverticula are pulsion in etiology, and the detection of a midesophageal diverticulum should prompt a careful search for underlying dysmotility.

### Septal wall divides esophagus into double lumen: successful endoscopic septotomy [^1165Kwi2]. VideoGIE (2022). Medium credibility.

Intraluminal esophageal diverticulum is a rare condition identified by a collection of intraluminal barium with surrounding radiolucent halo on barium swallow. Historically, management has comprised proton pump inhibitor therapy, lifestyle modification, and esophageal dilation. Limited literature exists on the endoscopic management of this condition. Our case highlights the use of minimally invasive endoscopic techniques to manage intraluminal esophageal diverticulum.

A 27-year-old man with a history of GERD and gastric ulcer presented with progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids leading to 50-pound weight loss over 3 months. Medical therapy with proton pump inhibitor provided mild symptomatic improvement. Initial upper endoscopy revealed an esophageal stricture with double lumen. Repeat endoscopy using a pediatric endoscope (GIF-XP190N, Olympus, Center Valley, Pa, USA) showed a true and false lumen divided by a septal wall located 25 cm from the incisors. Multiple diverticula were also seen within the false lumen in the middle and lower thirds of the esophagus. A barium swallow study confirmed these endoscopic findings. Owing to persistent symptoms, the patient was referred for further endoscopic evaluation and management.

### Achalasia and epiphrenic diverticulum [^117X19dX]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Esophageal epiphrenic diverticulum (EED) is a pseudodiverticulum of pulsion type located in the distal 10 cm of the esophagus and frequently associated to achalasia. The symptoms and the pathophysiology of achalasia and EED may overlap, leading to the speculation that achalasia may be responsible for the symptoms. Similarly to patients with achalasia without EED, a careful preoperative evaluation is essential in patients with EED. Endoscopy and an esophagram are mandatory in the workup of these patients, while esophageal manometry confirms the associated motility disorder. Treatment is indicated in all patients fit for an operation except those who are asymptomatic with a small EED and no prior history of aspiration. Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy and partial fundoplication is the most adequate therapy. Diverticulectomy must be added to the procedure in large diverticula. Experience with endoscopic therapy is very limited.

### Non-neoplastic pathology at the crossroads between neck imaging and cardiothoracic imaging [^113z3oEW]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Degenerative

Degeneration is a gradual deterioration of specific tissues, cells, or organs with impairment or loss of function due to injury, disease, or aging. This process occurs in all organ systems and in the thoracic inlet; this condition is most evident in the musculoskeletal, vascular, and digestive systems.

Esophageal diverticulum

Esophageal diverticula are saccular protrusions or outpouchings of the esophagus, classified according to their direction of protrusion and location. Zenker's diverticula extend inferiorly behind the esophagus, just proximal to the upper esophageal sphincter (Fig. 13). Killian-Jamieson diverticula, conversely, are anterolateral protrusions into the Killian-Jamieson space, area of weakness just below the cricopharyngeal muscle (Fig. 14). These outpouchings can be unilateral or bilateral and are typically smaller than Zenker's diverticulum, ranging from 3 to 20 mm. In both cases, patients typically present with dysphagia, regurgitation, and aspiration of undigested food, halitosis, hoarseness, and neck mass. Imaging can demonstrate an air-fluid level or contrast-filled outpouching in the thoracic inlet.

### Treatment of achalasia and epiphrenic diverticulum [^1165V3Nf]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Epiphrenic diverticulum (ED) is a pulsion pseudodiverticulum found in the distal 10 cm of the esophagus. Motility disorders are present in the majority of patients with ED explaining the pathophysiology of this rare disease. Achalasia is the most common underlying disorder. We present a review on the diagnosis and management of ED in the setting of achalasia.

Methods

Literature review.

Results

Symptoms are most related to the underlying motility disorder. The diagnostic workup should always include an upper digestive endoscopy and a barium esophagogram. Esophageal manometry identifies the motility disorder in most patients. Therapeutic options include laparoscopic, thoracoscopic and endoscopic procedures. While a myotomy must always be performed, diverticulectomy is not always necessary.

Conclusions

Epiphrenic diverticulum is a rare condition whose pathophysiology involves an underlying motility disorder-achalasia in most cases. Symptoms usually include dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn, and respiratory complaints and correlate with the motility disorder rather than the diverticulum per se. Upper digestive endoscopy and barium esophagogram are needed for the diagnosis-manometry may add useful information but is not imperative for the treatment. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with a partial fundoplication is the procedure of choice, with satisfactory symptom relief and several advantages over the thoracic approach. Diverticulectomy may be performed in selected patients. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) are novel techniques, effective and minimally invasive that can be an option for patients unfit for surgery.

### Epiphrenic diverticula: an added source of complexity in achalasia management [^111BTQsb]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Medium credibility.

Epiphrenic (pulsion) esophageal diverticula can occur in the setting of underlying esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia and present a unique management challenge to the gastroenterologist. Asymptomatic diverticula do not require treatment, but symptomatic diverticula require therapy targeted to the underlying esophageal motility disorder, or else the diverticula will recur. Generally, laparoscopic or combined laparoscopic/thoracoscopic myotomy, diverticulectomy, and anterior fundoplication are required. However, therapeutic options for epiphrenic diverticula are evolving as peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) becomes more commonplace. We review two cases of achalasia complicated by epiphrenic diverticula at our institution. In the first case, type II achalasia was identified and the patient underwent laparoscopic myotomy. In the second case, type III achalasia was present and the patient underwent successful POEM. We discuss the presentation, pathophysiology, and management of epiphrenic diverticula as well as the expanding role for POEM in diverticula.

### Zenker's diverticulum in an 85-year-old Ugandan man [^113vN6FJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) is an uncommon disorder due to an outpouching of tissue through the Killian triangle that is thought to be caused by dysfunction of the cricopharyngeal muscle.

Case Presentation

An 85-year-old male patient presented with odynophagia and dysphagia of initially solid food followed by fluids that was associated with a significant weight loss over a one-year period. Barium swallow videofluoroscopy demonstrated a posterior outpouching of proximal esophagus that was 2 cm from the epiglottis. With the diagnosis of medium sized ZD, the patient underwent endoscopy guided diverticulotomy. Six months after the procedure, he was asymptomatic and had gained weight.

Conclusions

Dysphagia and weight loss raises a clinical suspicion for a malignancy. Barium swallow examination is an inexpensive method for the diagnosis of ZD.

### Treatment of an epiphrenic diverticulum [^113NDiYs]. VideoGIE (2019). Medium credibility.

Epiphrenic diverticulum is a rare condition. The prevalence across the population is between 0.2% and 0.8%. Symptoms are due to the diverticulum itself or to associated motility disorders. The most frequent symptoms are dysphagia, regurgitation, epigastric pain, halitosis, vomiting, and weight loss. The treatment, diverticulectomy, is surgical, with a left thoracic route. The mortality associated with surgery ranges from 0% to 11% and adverse events from 0% to 37%. A transoral endoscopic approach could dramatically simplify the therapeutic approach. The use of magnets has been reported to be promising, but they are not yet commercially available.

In this video case report (Video 1, available online at), we describe the use of the Endomina to treat an epiphrenic diverticulum. The Endomina triangulation platform (Endotools SA, Gosselies, Belgium) is Comformité Européenne marked for endoluminal suturing and was used to perform endoscopic full-thickness suturing. We use another version of the Endomina with a 35°-angled needle and a smaller diameter to be able to move in the narrow lumen of the esophagus. The idea is to ensure tissue apposition between the bottom of the diverticulum and the esophagus before cutting the bridge in between.

A 55-year-old woman presented with a 6-cm epiphrenic diverticulum (Fig. 1). Her symptoms were dysphagia for solid food and epigastric pain. Manometry did not reveal any abnormality. After the Endomina was introduced over guidewires, the device was placed across the diverticulum (Fig. 2). Once the top of the arm was in the bottom of the diverticulum, a first piercing was done through the esophageal lumen (Fig. 3).

### Diverticulum of the midthoracic esophagus: pathogenesis and surgical treatment [^112nfsGc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Midthoracic esophageal diverticula represent 15% of all esophageal diverticula. Gastrointestinal endoscopy, barium swallow, esophageal manometry (indispensable for detecting any motor alterations often at the root of the pathogenesis of the diverticulum and for selecting the best surgical option), and 24-h pHmetry are the correct examinations to perform. Simple diverticulectomy performed via thoracoscopy can be sufficient for small diverticula without associated motor alterations. In other cases, it is best to combine diverticulectomy with a longitudinal extramucous myotomy extending at least 3 or 4 cm above and below the neck of the diverticulum or to the entire esophageal body for diffuse esophageal spasm. We report the case of a 67-year-old male patient with a sacciform diverticulum at the mid-third on the anterior wall of the thoracic esophagus. Manometric examination showed peristaltic waves with an amplitude and duration that were above normal at the inferior third of the esophagus. Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) were essentially normal. The diagnosis was pulsion-type midthoracic esophageal diverticulum. We performed a diverticulectomy with endoGIA via right thoracoscopy and extramucous myotomy extended from the upper margin of the diverticulum to the esophageal inlet in the hiatus, corresponding to the area showing motor alteration. After 3 months, the patient reported complete remission of symptoms and had gained 4 kg. Radiography of the digestive tube showed a normal transit at the distal esophagus. Manometric follow-up revealed the presence of peristaltic waves with a normal amplitude and duration along the entire esophagus.

### Concurrent killian-jamieson and zenker's diverticula [^111Vczrq]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

ZD is often compared with KJD in epidemiology, manifestations, and management (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1). KJD usually presents clinically in the middle-aged population with an average age of 58 years and an increased likelihood in women. Patients with KJD are unlikely to develop aspiration pneumonia, as the CPM, which forms a major part of the upper esophageal sphincter, is located above the diverticula and prevents the reflux of retained food to the hypopharynx. Complications of untreated KJD include esophageal perforation, recurrent diverticular pouch infection, esophageal obstruction, diverticular pouch ulceration, fistula formation, and malignancy.

ZD, compared with KJD, is usually present in older adults with a mean age of 72 years; it has a 1.5-fold male predominance. Typical symptoms include dysphagia to solid food, regurgitation of undigested food debris, cough, aspiration (as the diverticulum is located above the CPM), halitosis, globus sensation, hoarseness, soft tissue swelling on the left side of the neck (Boyce sign), and cervical borborygmi. In advanced cases, reported complications include aspiration pneumonia, poor oral medication absorption, malnourishment, and weight loss. Our patient complained of long-standing regurgitation and foul odor like KJD and ZD without symptoms and signs of advanced stage.

Esophageal foreign body impaction (EFBI) is a rare condition in childhood which needs urgent removal. However, if left untreated, its chronic impaction may lead to serious secondary complications. Symptoms associated with chronic EFBI are attributed to airway disease or gastroesophageal reflux, which further delays definitive diagnosis and management. We present a girl with ingestion of a bottle cap diaphragm that was embedded in her esophagus resulting in esophageal narrowing and a secondary diverticulum formation. As the disk was unable to be removed using standard grasping forceps, the authors used an injector needle to impale the disk and successfully removed it without any complications.

### Diagnosis and open surgical management of laimer's diverticulum: case series and review of the literature [^112fshbZ]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives: Laimer's diverticulum (LD) is a very rare clinical entity originating between the cricopharyngeus muscle (CPM) and circular muscular fibers of the esophagus. Its diagnosis and management remain to be elucidated. This article summarizes our experience in its diagnosis and open surgical management. Methods: A retrospective review of LD cases treated at our tertiary medical institution was conducted between July 2018 and May 2023. The clinical and demographic data were retrieved from case notes. Results: Three cases were included in this review. There were 2 male patients and 1 female patient. The average and median ages were 47.3 and 54years, respectively. Presenting symptoms included hoarseness, pharyngeal foreign body sensation, and neck mass. All 3 diverticula were on the left side, with the first 2 cases discovered accidentally on gastric endoscopic or cervical MRI examinations. After evaluating esophageal swallowing with barium sulfate or urografin contrast media, all the patients consented to undergo an open surgical procedure. During surgical exploration, the diverticula were found to be on the posterior part of the cervical esophagus, below CPM, and away from the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and only then, could the diagnosis of LD be established. Then, diverticulectomy and manual suturing of the esophagus was performed. Recovery of all 3 patients was uneventful. Nasogastric tube feeding lasted 7 to 12days until esophageal examinations demonstrated no leak, and then, oral liquid feeding resumed. The median duration of follow-up was 50months. No recurrence of symptoms or diverticulum was observed, and the swallowing function of all 3 patients was excellent. Conclusions: An open surgical approach is not only important for the diagnosis of LD, but can also be utilized as a safe and effective treatment.

A preoperative abdominal computed tomography scan confirmed dilatation of the proximal and mid esophagus and a 6 × 5-cm diverticulum (Video 1). The patient underwent laparoscopic transhiatal diverticulectomy, Heller myotomy, and Dor fundoplication under intraoperative endoscopic guidance. No perioperative complications occurred. Histology was subsequently negative for malignancy. A postoperative contrast esophagogram showed no leaks and good transit, allowing oral feeding and discharge within a week. At 3-month follow-up, a barium esophagogram confirmed normal passage of barium and resolution of the diverticulum (Fig. 3).

This case adds to the limited literature documenting epiphrenic diverticula in patients with achalasia, and their management. A comprehensive diagnostic workup and a tailored surgical approach addressing both the diverticulum and the underlying motility disorder are essential to achieve optimal outcomes.

The patient underwent an EGD (Fig. 1), a CT scan (Fig. 2), high-resolution manometry (Fig. 3), barium esophagogram (Fig. 4), and 24-hour pH monitoring. EGD showed an epiphrenic diverticulum and resistance in passing through the esophagogastric junction.

A CT scan revealed that the diverticulum occurred just above the esophagogastric junction and was located at the left side of the esophagus and behind the heart. There was no organic disease, such as presence of malignancy and extrinsic compression. High-resolution manometry showed almost normal peristalsis. Barium esophagogram showed delay in the passage of barium and stasis of barium in the diverticulum. The 24-hour pH monitoring revealed no evidence of GERD.

The patient was diagnosed with an epiphrenic diverticula with esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction. We suspected that direct reflux of food and saliva remaining in the diverticulum caused his reflux symptoms, in addition to the obstruction. Hence, we performed standard POEM and endoscopic esophageal diverticulum resection. This procedure was approved by the Showa University Research Ethics Committee.

### A review on gastric diverticulum [^114xQwMh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gastric diverticulum (GD) is an outpouching of the gastric wall. GDs are rare and they are commonly detected incidentally during routine diagnostic testing. Prevalence ranges from 0.04% in contrast study radiographs and 0.01% - 0. 11% at oesophagogastrodeudenum (OGD). The incidence of gastric diverticulum is equally distributed between males and females and typically may present in the fifth and sixth decades. However it is worth mentioning that it may present in patients as young as 9 years old.

The lack of exact pathogonomic symptoms and the vague long history of presenting complaints that can range from dyspepsia to major upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed make this condition a diagnostic challenge.

We conducted a literature search using the "Pubmed" search engine. The following terms "gastric diverticulum" and "Stomach diverticulum" were used to identify the appropriate papers.

In this review, our emphasis is to highlight on the presentation, the pathophysiology, investigations and different management options for this condition.

Presentation of gastric diverticulum

Symptoms of GD vary and can imitate those of other common disorders. It is important to note that most GD are asymptomatic but may present with a vague sensation of fullness or discomfort in the upper abdomen. Presenting complaint might also be the result of a major complication of GD. This includes acute upper gastrointestinal bleed or perforation (Table 1).

### Is resection of an esophageal epiphrenic diverticulum always necessary in the setting of achalasia? [^116ykXWL]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Esophageal epiphrenic diverticulum (ED) is usually secondary to a primary esophageal motility disorder, such as achalasia. Whereas the recommended surgical treatment includes esophageal myotomy and diverticulectomy, the outcome of patients in whom a myotomy without ED resection is performed is not known. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome of ED patients who underwent ED resection and myotomy and those of ED patients who had a myotomy only.

Methods

Retrospective review of a prospective database. Thirteen ED patients had symptom evaluation, barium swallow, endoscopy, and esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM). All patients underwent laparoscopic myotomy and Dor fundoplication. In six patients, the ED was resected (excised ED group), whereas in seven it was left in place (nonexcised ED group): in three because it was small and in four for technical reasons.

Results

Preoperatively all patients had dysphagia and 85% had regurgitation. The mean preoperative Eckardt score was 6.5 ± 2.1 in excised ED group and 6.6 ± 3.3 in nonexcised ED group (p = 0.95). HRM showed type II esophageal achalasia in 85% of patients. One excised ED group patient had a staple line leak (17%). At a median follow-up of 2 years, the Eckardt score was 0 in excised ED group and 0.1 in nonexcised ED group (p = 0.56).

Conclusions

The results of this study showed that patients in whom a myotomy without ED resection was performed had resolution of their symptoms. These findings suggest that in patients with achalasia and ED the underlying motility disorder rather than the ED may be the cause of symptoms. Studies with a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up will determine the validity of this approach.

### UK guidelines on oesophageal dilatation in clinical practice [^117E9zMc]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Patient preparation

Oesophageal dilatation is best undertaken as a planned procedure in patients who have been appropriately investigated, prepared and consented. An assessment of the patient's nutritional status and referral to a dietician should also be considered.

Predilatation investigations

(a) Should all strictures be biopsied before dilatation?
Obtain biopsy specimens from all strictures for histological analysis to exclude malignancy and eosinophilic oesophagitis (GRADE of evidence: moderate; strength of recommendation: strong).

Obtaining a definitive diagnosis before dilatation is desirable, because this will influence the overall management and estimation of perforation risk. Oesophageal biopsy samples can be safely obtained immediately before oesophageal dilatation; however, if the stricture is tight or when the endoscopic features suggest malignancy, the results of biopsies are best awaited.
Repeat biopsy after cross-sectional imaging (CT or with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in cases where biopsies are negative, but clinical or endoscopic features are atypical or suspicious for malignancy (GRADE of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: strong).

EUS may be a more sensitive test than CT, but passage of the EUS probe is often not successful in the case of a stricture.
Obtain oesophageal biopsy specimens in young patients with dysphagia or history of food impaction to exclude eosinophilic esophagitis (GRADE of evidence: moderate; strength of recommendation: strong).

(b) Are there any other recommended tests?
Perform barium swallow in patients with suspected complex strictures (such as post-radiation therapy or history of caustic injury) in order to establish the location, length, diameter and number of strictures (GRADE of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: strong).

Barium swallow is also useful to evaluate the presence of associated pathology such as an oesophageal diverticulum or a hiatus hernia. This information will aid selection of the dilating technique, estimation of the number of sessions required and counselling the patient about the expected risks.

### Midesophageal pulsion diverticulum resulting from Hypercontractile (jackhammer) esophagus [^114wZ3LJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

We report a patient with significant dysphagia from hypercontractile "jackhammer" esophagus and a midesophageal pulsion diverticulum. This was treated with a thoracoscopic diverticulectomy and a long esophageal myotomy sparing the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). We describe the clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment of this uncommon esophageal motility disorder. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of a midesophageal diverticulum caused by jackhammer esophagus. We propose that in the setting of normal LES function, successful treatment should include diverticulectomy with an LES-sparing myotomy.

### Concurrent killian-jamieson and zenker's diverticula [^111vte13]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Various diseases such as laryngopharyngeal reflux, esophageal motility disorders, diverticulum, and psychological causes should be suspected when patients complain of recurrent reflux, regurgitation, and dysphagia. Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) is relatively rare, with a prevalence of 0.11%, whereas Killian-Jamieson diverticulum (KJD) is less common than ZD.ZD has been studied extensively in the literature, and reports on KJD are still limited (< 70 reported cases). Most patients with hypopharyngeal diverticula present with varying degrees of dysphagia, primarily to solid food and foreign body sensations in the throat.

KJD originates in the Killian–Jamieson's space, a weak area inferior to the cricopharyngeus muscle (CPM) and lateral to the cervical esophagus. In contrast, ZD typically occurs in the Killian space, another weak anatomic area located inferior to the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and superior to the CPM. Both conditions have similar clinical presentations and pathophysiologies but slightly different management approaches and potential postoperative complications. We report a rare case of a patient with concurrent KJD and ZD, who initially complained of dysphagia and was treated surgically using a transcervical approach.

### Surgical treatment of epiphrenic diverticula: a 30-year experience [^1125n97x]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Epiphrenic diverticula are rare and associated with esophageal motility abnormalities. Their optimal surgical treatment is debated, mortality being 9% in the largest reported surgical series of 33 patients. Our experience with a traditional thoracic approach was reviewed to provide benchmark data against which newer surgical techniques can be measured.

Methods

A retrospective review of 35 patients operated on for epiphrenic diverticula from 1976 to 2005 was conducted. All underwent open transthoracic operations: resection of the diverticulum, long esophagomyotomy, and antireflux operations (modified Belsey, 29 patients; Nissen, 4 patients) in 33 patients; resection and long myotomy alone in 1 patient; and plication, long myotomy, and Collis-Nissen in 1 patient. Preoperative assessment included barium esophagogram, flexible esophagoscopy, manometry, and standard acid reflux test. Operative complications and functional results were assessed.

Results

Median age was 71 years (range, 36 to 87 years). Diverticulum size averaged 6.4 cm (range, 3 to 14 cm). Sixty-eight percent presented to the right of the esophagus. The median duration of symptoms was 3 years. Presenting complaints included dysphagia (83%), regurgitation (69%), and chest pain (26%). Eighteen had a mean weight loss of 19 pounds. There was 1 perioperative death (2.8%) from a plicated diverticulum leak and one nonfatal suture line leak. Median hospital stay was 7 days. Mean follow-up was 45.3 months. Twenty-six patients (74%) had an excellent result (no residual symptoms). Seven required a periodic esophageal dilatation for intermittent mild dysphagia.

Conclusions

Traditional transthoracic resection, long esophagomyotomy, and an antireflux procedure provide excellent long-term functional results with relatively low postoperative morbidity in patients with epiphrenic diverticula.

### Severe dysphagia due to an esophageal duplication cyst in sixth decade, unusual presentation of a rare pathology [^111cZxAr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Esophageal duplications cysts share a common muscular wall with the native esophagus and are attached to it. Two smooth muscle layers surround the cysts; this is essential to differentiate them from bronchogenic cysts that contain cartilage in their wall. They can be lined by squamous, cuboid, columnar, or ciliated columnar epithelium. (1) Ectopic GI mucosa of the esophagus can confuse the diagnosis as it can mimic many gastrointestinal pathologies, especially those involving the ileum, such as Meckel diverticulum.

Esophageal duplications cysts tend to appear in the right posterior-inferior mediastinum or lower-middle esophagus. As it was found in our patient.

Preoperative diagnosis needs several imaging methods like CT or MRI. Nonetheless, endoscopic ultrasonography is the best available tool since it can easily differentiate between a solid and a liquid mass and specify which layer of the esophagus is compromised. Other studies like barium swallow can aid in the diagnosis to determine the precise location of the lesion and its relationship with the esophageal hiatus. Still, it won't be able to distinguish between a duplication cyst and a leiomyoma. A Tc-99 m scan can also be helpful if the gastric epithelium is present. In our case, as the endoscopic ultrasound wasn't available, a CT, bronchoscopy, and endoscopy were done to reach a final diagnosis.

Observation may be possible in asymptomatic patients, especially in patients at high surgical risk; nonetheless, complete resection is mandatory if symptoms are present. Open, endoscopic, and thoracoscopic approaches are available. Nevertheless, extreme care must be considered when dissecting the cyst and the esophagus to prevent perforation. As it was done with our patient.

Esophageal duplication cysts are still rare in adults and are frequently located in the distal esophagus; since larger cysts are more likely to cause symptoms, we should always keep this pathology among the differential diagnoses to achieve an accurate diagnosis and avoid cases such as our patient's. Interestingly, this case also proves that the doctor–patient relationship is essential; if we can connect with our patients and investigate more about their pain instead of just reviewing exams, we can improve our practice and get to know the patients better.

### Dysphagia revisited: common and unusual causes [^114mmHZz]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a common clinical problem whose prevalence is increasing with the aging population in the United States. The term dysphagia is commonly used to describe subjective awareness of swallowing difficulty during the passage of a bolus from the mouth to the stomach or the perception of obstruction during swallowing. Dysphagia may be further classified as oropharyngeal or substernal, depending on the location of this sensation. It can be due to benign or malignant structural lesions, esophageal motility abnormalities, oropharyngeal dysfunction (including aspiration), neuromuscular disorders, or postsurgical changes and is also associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Pathologic conditions of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and proximal stomach can manifest with dysphagia. Imaging remains the preferred method for evaluating patients with dysphagia, and dysphagia is an increasingly encountered indication for radiologic evaluation. Fluoroscopic studies, including the modified barium swallow and esophagography in particular, are often used in the assessment of patients with dysphagia, and the techniques used for these studies should be tailored to the patient's needs. Fluoroscopic studies can be used to evaluate the esophagus for structural abnormalities (eg, webs, diverticula, strictures, masses) and to assess function (eg, the swallowing mechanism and esophageal motility). Knowledge of the imaging spectrum of disease entities that may cause dysphagia and thorough radiologic assessment with a tailored approach may help avoid misdiagnosis.

### Delayed esophageal perforation diagnosed 12 years after anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion: a case report and review of current literature [^112tMb58]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, this patient was diagnosed with a Zenker diverticulum years after his index ACDF. Zenker diverticulum, a false diverticulum involving the esophageal mucosa and submucosa, is a very rare complication after anterior spine surgery. Alternatively, ACDF-related diverticulum, a true diverticulum involving the esophageal mucosa, submucosa, and muscular layers, is thought to be due to dense scar tissue adhering the esophagus to the vertebral body and surgical hardware. As a true diverticulum, there is increased risk of esophageal perforation compared with Zenker. However, ACDF-related diverticulum can be easily misdiagnosed as a Zenker diverticulum. For these reasons, any diverticulum after ACDF should be considered an ACDF-related diverticulum until proven otherwise to allow prompt treatment and prevent complications such as perforation.

Regarding treatment, both nonoperative and operative management for perforations are used. The criteria for nonoperative management include early diagnosis or delayed diagnosis with contained leak, perforation not in the abdomen, contained in the mediastinum, not involving neoplasm or obstruction, absence of sepsis, presence of experienced thoracic surgeon, and contrast imaging in the hospital. Nonoperative management involves supportive care with nil per oral status and IV antibiotics. Although nonoperative management can be successful in the appropriate setting, most esophageal perforations require surgical intervention.

Rueth et aldevised an algorithm for management of esophageal perforation after anterior cervical spine surgery. For intraoperative perforation, they recommend primary repair. For suspected perforation after surgery, they recommend diagnosis with clinical examination, esophagoscopy, and contrast swallow studies. If these studies suggest perforation, surgical débridement with primary repair should be performed. If repeat studies in 2 to 3 weeks show residual leak, surgical revision with or without flap coverage should be performed.

### Zenker's diverticulum complicating achalasia: a' cup-and-spill'oesophagus [^117JxZVj]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 72-year-old woman presented with long-standing gastro-oesophageal reflux, regurgitation of swallowed food and worsening cervical dysphagia. Fluoroscopic barium oesophagography revealed a posterolateral pharyngeal pouch (Zenker's diverticulum (ZD)) complicating a 'cup and spill' oesophageal deformity with a smoothly tapered segment at the gastro-oesophageal junction. CT and high-resolution manometry confirmed that the underlying abnormality was a massively dilated oesophagus with aperistalsis and pan-oesophageal pressurisation, consistent with a diagnosis of oesophageal achalasia (type II). She underwent endoscopic stapled diverticulotomy, with good symptomatic relief. We discuss the aetiology of ZD, its management and the association here with oesophageal achalasia.

### Magnet-assisted diverticuloplasty for treating the symptomatic esophageal diverticulum: a case series (with video) [^112rME8H]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal diverticulum was a rare disease characterized by the bulging of the esophageal wall. As the diverticulum enlarges, it easily leaded to food retention within the diverticular cavity, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. According to the anatomical location, esophageal diverticulum was categorized into three types: Zenker's, middle, and lower diverticulum. Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) was the most common type in Western countries, with an estimated overall prevalence of between 0.01% and 0.11% in the American population. Approximately 37–63% of patients with esophageal diverticulum had symptoms, such as dysphagia, regurgitation, chest discomfort, and weight loss.

For small or asymptomatic esophageal diverticulum, follow-up observation should have been performed, while large or symptomatic esophageal diverticulum (SED) needed to perform surgery. Although open surgery could altogether remove the diverticulum, it was an atraumatic procedure with a high incidence of serious complications, such as bleeding, infection, esophageal fistula, and stenosis. Therefore, the endoscopic operation has gradually replaced traditional transthoracic surgery as the primary treatment option for the esophageal diverticulum. There were a series of novel endoscopic procedures for SED, such as flexible endoscopic septum division (FESD), Zenker's peroral endoscopic myotomy (Z-POEM) and diverticular-peroral endoscopic myotomy (D-POEM). The clinical success and recurrence rates of FESD were 91% and 10.5%, respectively. In two international multicenter studies, Z-POEM demonstrated high clinical success rates in treating ZD, particularly in relieving dysphagia. Another retrospective study showed that D-POEM had a 90% (9/10) clinical remission rate in patients. The results of these studies suggested that these procedures were effective alternatives for treating esophageal diverticulum, but were all difficult procedures that required experienced endoscopists to perform. Similarly, these procedures carried the risk of perforation, bleeding and other complications.

### Laparoscopic repair of epiphrenic diverticulum [^111LHZp7]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Epiphrenic diverticulum of the esophagus is an uncommon disease, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. Surgical repair of this disease is warranted only for symptomatic patients because treatment carries high risk of morbidity. Over the past decade, the laparoscopic approach to epiphrenic diverticulectomy has been shown to be safe and effective. The aim of the study was to describe our specific approach to the procedure and results. From 1994 to 2012, 30 patients with symptomatic epiphrenic diverticulum underwent laparoscopic surgery. There were no conversions to open surgery. The postoperative course was uneventful in 28 patients (93.3%). One patient had a suture line leak, which required repair through right thoracotomy, and 1 patient had a hemoperitoneum, which needed an open splenectomy. The median follow-up was 52 months (2–144). To date, no patient has presented with a recurrence. Laparoscopic transhiatal surgery is in our opinion the preferred approach to treatment of epiphrenic diverticulum of the esophagus. The procedure has proven to be feasible and safe in experienced hands. Long-term results, both clinical and with an objective evaluation, are satisfactory.

### A cooperative approach for treatment of zenker's diverticulum [^114Uzkju]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptomatic Zenker's diverticulum management has evolved from an open intervention to an endoscopic management. At our center, both an otolaryngologist and a gastroenterologist are present in the operating room when treating these lesions. An intra-procedural consensus is reached to undergo either rigid endoscopy or flexible endoscopic diverticulotomy with ENT guidance. We evaluated the real-world efficacy with a cooperative gastroenterology-otolaryngology approach.

Methods

Single-center retrospective study of patients who underwent a cooperative endoscopic diverticulotomy by a gastroenterologist and otolaryngologist at Cleveland Clinic Florida between 2012 and 2019. Demographic and clinical data, intra-procedural findings/complications, post-procedural symptoms, recurrence rate, and reintervention variables were extracted. Patients included in the study were > 17 years old, with symptomatic confirmed typical single Zenker's diverticulum.

Results

63 subjects were identified. Patients were predominantly males (63.5%) and white (84.1%), with mean age 73.5 years (53–95). Most subjects presented dysphagia (98.4%), mostly to solids (79.4%). Other demographic and clinical data are described in Table 1. The diverticula had a mean size of 36.3 mm. In 30.1% of the cases food debris was found during the procedure. The mean procedure length was 38.4 minutes. All cases were performed as outpatient. Technical success was achieved in all cases. Patients were followed for a mean of 3.24 months post-procedure. Clinical success was achieved in 92% subjects. One intra-procedural perforation was treated with endoclip. Table 1 Pre-procedural demographic and clinical variables in patients undergoing Zenker's diverticulum cooperative approach Variable Value (n = 63) Sex, n (%) Male Female 40 (63.5) 23 (36.5) Ethnicity/Race, n (%) Non-Hispanic White Hispanic Black 53 (84.1) 7 (11.1) 3 (4.8) Smoking status, n (%) Never Former Active 29 (46.0) 26 (41.3) 8 (10.7) Previous intervention for Zenker's diverticulum, n (%) 12 (19.1) Dysphagia, n (%) Only to solids Only to liquids Both solids and liquids 50 (79.4) 0 (0) 12 (19.0) Regurgitation of food, n (%) Chronic cough, n (%) 13 (20.6) Halitosis, n (%) 9 (14.3) CONCLUSION: A cooperative endoscopic approach by gastroenterology and otolaryngology for symptomatic Zenker's diverticulum management offered excellent technical and clinical success. This approach proved to be safe and effective.

### Endoscopic management of a tubular esophageal duplication in a young adult [^111kQozk]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Esophageal duplications account for 20% of all digestive tract duplications. They are rare congenital malformations, presenting in cystic, tubular, or diverticular forms, the latter of which is the rarest of the 3. Esophageal duplications can remain asymptomatic for decades, and clinical manifestations can occur at any time.

We present the case of a 24-year-old man with a symptomatic tubular esophageal duplication who received successful endoscopic treatment. The patient had mental retardation and a history of occasional dysphagia since childhood. Dysphagia had worsened recently and was associated with abdominal pain and frequent regurgitation. For this reason, he underwent barium esophagram and EGD, which showed a long paraesophageal diverticulum on the right side of the distal esophagus extending to the diaphragm. Because of his severe symptoms, open surgery was attempted in another center; however, the diverticulum was not excised because no extraluminal diverticulum was found and because the resection was considered too dangerous. The patient was referred to our unit, where a diagnosis of tubular esophageal duplication was made.

Preliminary EGD confirmed the presence of a tubular duplication of the distal tract of the esophagus, extending for 7 cm and starting 35 cm from the upper incisors (Figs. 1 and 2). A cap-assisted septotomy was performed (Video 1, available online at), similar to the treatment usually performed for Zenker's diverticulum. The endoscopic procedure was done with the patient supine and under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The septum between the original esophageal lumen and the duplication was carefully cut with a needle-knife (KD-10Q-11; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and Endo-cut current (VIO 300D; ERBE, Tubingen, Germany) (Figure 3, Figure 4 and 4). Occasional bleeding during the procedure was stopped by using hemostatic forceps on the visible vessels. At the end of the procedure, 3 endoscopic clips were placed at the base of the incision to prevent delayed bleeding (Fig. 5). The procedure was completed in less than 20 minutes (Fig. 6).

### Esophageal perforation with a locking screw: a case report and review of the literature [^115m8x1y]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report with a review of the literature.

Objectives

Anterior cervical spine surgery (ACS) has received widespread acceptance, and as a result, a variety of complications have been reported. Several cases of esophageal complications, arising from the use of various implants and grafts, have been described. The purpose of this article is to provide insight into the clinical presentation, diagnosis, types of involved implants, and the treatment of this entity.

Summary Of Background Data

Previous reports of esophageal complications (esophageal perforation, diverticula, and stricture) after ACS are reviewed.

Methods

Retrospective case study and literature review.

Results

Redundant locking screws should be removed due to the potential for extrusion into the esophagus.

Conclusions

Regular, long-term follow-up of the patient undergoing anterior spine surgery is crucial. The wide range of possible complications mandates thorough workup. Early surgical treatment is imperative in the majority of esophageal complications.

Aberrant subclavian artery (ASCA) — presentation, prevalence, and treatment indications are outlined. An aberrant subclavian artery (ASCA) is commonly an incidental finding but may present with compressive symptoms (including dysphagia and dyspnea) because it courses posterior to the esophagus and trachea and may associate with aneurysm disease. A normal left aortic arch with a right ASCA occurs in ~1% of the population, whereas a right aortic arch with a left ASCA is much rarer and may form a vascular ring. Dilation of the origin of either a right or left ASCA occurs in 20% to 60% of cases and is known as a Kommerell diverticulum; such diverticula may lead to aortic dissection, rupture, or embolization. Indications for treatment of ASCA relate to symptoms and aneurysm size.

### Zenker's diverticulitis secondary to alendronate ingestion: a rare cause of recurrent dysphagia [^11473B9F]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute dysphagia/odynophagia developed in a 79-year-old female patient secondary to what we believe was a caustic injury to a large Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) in the setting of long-term alendronate use. She reported severe dysphagia and odynophagia of 1-week duration. She had experienced a similar episode 10 months earlier that had resolved after stopping alendronate temporarily. Although she was able to handle secretions, she was unable to swallow solids or liquids. She was noted to be dehydrated. On endoscopy, a large and markedly inflamed ZD was identified. There was no visual esophageal mucosal injury within the esophagus. Alendronate therapy was discontinued, and parenteral nutrition and proton pump inhibitors were initiated. Her symptoms resolved within 1 week, and she was able to resume oral intake.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University Hospital.

Limitations

Case report.

Discussion

Bisphosphonate therapy is commonly used to treat osteoporosis and is therefore an increasingly prevalent component of the medication list of elderly patients. These medications may cause significant caustic injury and are therefore administered with strong caution in the setting of dysphagia or known structural abnormalities of the esophagus. The fear is that tablets may become entrapped within a diverticulum and lead to intense acute inflammatory changes.

Conclusions

Health care providers should be aware of potential complications with ulcerogenic medications in patients with ZD. These medications should be administered with caution in the setting of dysphagia or known structural abnormalities of the esophagus. When patients with history of dysphagia are evaluated for their suitability to receive oral bisphosphonate therapy, care should be taken to investigate the etiology of dysphagia. Evaluation should focus not only on the tubular esophagus, but also on excluding a Zenker's pharyngeal diverticulum with appropriate contrast imaging.

### Dysphagia characteristics in zenker's diverticulum [^116GTg3S]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate dysphagia characteristics in patients with Zenker's diverticulum (ZD).

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Outpatient tertiary care dysphagia clinic.

Subjects and Methods

All ZD cases surgically treated over a 6-year period were identified and reviewed for dysphagia history and dysphagia characteristics on initial presentation using fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Dysphagia symptoms and swallowing abnormalities were compared across groups based on diverticulum size (small < 1 cm, medium 1–3 cm, and large > 3 cm).

Results

Forty-six patients underwent a total of 52 procedures during the study period. ZD size was available in 49 cases (6 small, 26 medium, 17 large). Regurgitation symptoms were less frequent in patients with small (17%) compared with medium (68%) or large diverticula (76%; p = 0.03). Postswallow hypopharyngeal reflux (PSHR) was less frequent in patients with small (17%) compared with medium (91%) and large diverticula (87%; P < .01). PSHR was present on all FEES available for patients who presented with a recurrent or residual ZD (n = 7). In all cases, PSHR resolved after successful treatment of ZD. Pharyngeal residue indicating possible weakness was present in 24% of all patients at initial presentation.

Conclusions

Preoperative assessment of dysphagia characteristics in ZD patients reveals that PSHR is predictive of a ZD larger than 1 cm and may be useful in surgical planning. PSHR is also helpful in identifying patients with recurrent or residual symptomatic ZD following surgical treatment. Pharyngeal weakness is present in a subset of ZD patients.

### Zenker's diverticulum [^112GGhfa]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) is an outpouching of tissue through the Killian triangle that is believed to be caused by dysfunction of the cricopharyngeal muscle. ZD is a relatively uncommon disorder occurring in the elderly. The predominant symptom of ZD is dysphagia, and the most serious consequence is pulmonary aspiration. Videofluoroscopy confirms the diagnosis. Therapy of symptomatic ZD has evolved from an open surgical approach to less invasive transoral endoscopic techniques. Transoral endoscopic therapy using rigid instruments is performed primarily by otorhinolaryngologists, whereas transoral therapy using flexible endoscopes is performed by surgical endoscopists and gastroenterologists. The common goal of all modalities is severing of the septum between the esophageal lumen and the diverticulum containing the cricopharyngeal muscle. Although flexible endoscopic therapy was described nearly 20 years ago, it has experienced a recent resurgence paralleling the advancements of therapeutic endoscopy in other areas, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection. Direct head-to-head comparisons of rigid and flexible endoscopic therapy are lacking, and each approach has variations in techniques as well as advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we review the pathophysiology and management of patients with ZD with an emphasis on flexible endoscopic therapy.

### Management of bleeding from a left-sided epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum: role of positional adjustment in clot removal [^111yEBqD]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum is a rare condition, typically located within 10 cm of the gastroesophageal junction and is commonly right-sided. It is also an infrequent cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There is no established method for achieving hemostasis in esophageal diverticular bleeding.

A 65-year-old man was admitted for treatment of a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm. During hospitalization, the patient developed hypotension, melena, and progressive anemia. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an esophageal diverticulum on the left side of the distal esophagus with active extravasation from this site (Fig. 1). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed the diverticulum filled with large blood clots, obstructing visualization of its interior. Attempts to remove the clots with grasping forceps were unsuccessful (Fig. 2). The patient's position was then changed from a left lateral decubitus position to a right lateral decubitus position using gravity to facilitate clot removal. This maneuver cleared the blood clots, enabling full inspection of the diverticulum. An exposed vessel and nearby erosions were identified as the sources of bleeding (Fig. 3). Endoscopic hemostasis was achieved using endoclips (Fig. 4, Video 1).

Fig. 1
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum on the left side of the distal esophagus, with active extravasation from the site (arrow).

Fig. 2
The esophageal diverticulum was filled with large blood clots, and removal of the clots using grasping forceps was difficult.

Fig. 3
An exposed vessel was identified as the source of bleeding.

Fig. 4
Hemostasis was achieved using clips.

This case highlights the rarity of bleeding from a left-sided epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum. In this case, the standard endoscopic position (left lateral decubitus) caused blood clots to pool in the diverticulum, obstructing the view. Changing to the right lateral decubitus position provided a simple and effective method to use gravity to clear the diverticulum without needing specialized tools. This positional adjustment proved crucial for visualizing the bleeding source and achieving hemostasis. Endoscopic treatment of bleeding from esophageal diverticula presents unique challenges owing to anatomical constraints and the risk of incomplete visualization. Positional changes are a valuable strategy for improving visibility in straight structures like the esophagus.

### MSCT study for adult esophageal diverticulum with secondary broncho-esophageal fistula [^117KVbRA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Broncho-esophageal fistula (BEF) secondary to esophageal diverticulum is a rare clinical condition, which is often misdiagnosed for a long time. The aim of our study is to summarize and clarify the advantages of MSCT in diagnosing BEF secondary to esophageal diverticulum.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients clinically diagnosed with BEF from January 2005 to January 2022 at Jilin University First Hospital. Only those patients with BEF secondary to esophageal diverticulum and complete clinical data met our enrolled standard. All patients' clinicopathologic characteristics and MSCT features were systemically evaluated.

Results

17 patients were eligible for our cohort study, including male 10 and female 7. The patient's mean age was 42.3 ± 12.5. The chronic cough occurred in all seventeen patients and bucking following oral fluid intake was documented in nine patients. MSCT distinctly suggested the fistulous tract between the bronchi and the esophagus in all patients. The mean diameter of the orifices in the wall of the esophagus was 4.40 ± 1.81 mm. The orifice in the midthoracic esophagus side was 15 cases and 2 cases at the lower thoracic esophagus. The involved bronchus included 13 cases at the right lower lobe bronchus, 1 at the right middle lobe bronchus and 3 at the left lower lobe bronchus. The contrast agent was observed in the pulmonary parenchyma in 10 of 13 patients who underwent esophagogram. No definite fistula was observed in 3 of 11 who underwent gastroscopy, while the intra-operative findings supported the existence of fistula.

Conclusions

BEF secondary to esophageal diverticulum tends to occur between the midthoracic esophagus and the right lower lobe bronchus. Compared with esophagography and gastroscopy, MSCT shows more comprehensive information about the fistulous shape, size, course and lung involvement, which are helpful for establishing diagnosis and guiding subsequent treatment.

### A superficial esophageal cancer in an epiphrenic diverticulum treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection [^113hZowd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Cancers arising within esophageal diverticulum may be diagnosed at advanced stage despite their small size. As the muscular coat of a diverticulum is extremely thin or none, cancer arising within an esophageal diverticulum can easily extend into the mediastinal space relative to those arising from the normal mucosa apart from the diverticulum. This case was easily detected with the help of magnifying image-enhanced endoscopy in its early stage. Our case illustrates the importance of meticulous endoscopic evaluation of depth invasion of esophageal cancers before removal, as surgery may be avoided in some cases. The changes in the IPCL pattern observed by magnifying NBI were reported to be useful for the qualitative diagnosis of cancerous/non-cancerous lesions and endoscopic diagnosis of invasion depth of cancers. Here we performed endoscopic resection of the lesion, as magnifying image-enhanced endoscopy provided an endoscopic diagnosis of a superficial cancer limited within the lamina propria (m2). It is commonly accepted that esophageal cancers limited within m2 are extremely rarely associated with lymph node metastasis and therefore are good candidates for endoscopic resection.

Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is commonly used for predicting the depth of tumor invasion in patients with superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We did not utilize EUS in this case as part of the diagnostic workup, as it was difficult to appropriately approach the lesion located at the base of the diverticulum. Furthermore, diverticulum has a characteristically thin wall, which may be associated with higher risk of perforation during EUS.

Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) might be an alternative for local resection. There are three representative methods of EMR: endoscopic esophageal mucosal resection (EEMR)-tube method, EMR using a cap-fitted endoscope (EMRC) method and two-channel EMR method. Generally, the incidence of perforation is lower than that of ESD. However, the lesion described here was not amenable to EMR as pulling the lesion back for resection would have resulted in frank perforation, likely 10 mm or larger in size, making endoscopic closure technically very difficult. Meanwhile, perforation during ESD is always smaller and linear, as the submucosal layer could be dissected under direct visualization. To avoid undesirable perforation, we therefore planned to discontinue ESD if non-lifting sign positive was seen after appropriate submucosal injection. To achieve an appropriate submucosal dissection plane under the tumor for complete removal, mucosal incision and submucosal dissection were started from the oral side of the normal mucosa outside of the diverticulum as both of the submucosal and muscular layers of the diverticulum were expected to be much thinner than those of the normal esophagus histologically.

### A rare cause of dysphagia due to esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis: a case report and review of literature [^117PEZCh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Radiologic imaging is the primary modality for the diagnosis of EIP, a single contrast barium swallow examination is the study of choice, as the thin barium enters pouches better than the higher density agent used in double contrast studies. EIP is characterized by numerous, 1–4 mm, flask shaped diverticula, which represent outpouchings from the esophagus and may appear to float adjacent to the esophageal wall. These outpouchings are segmented in the majority of cases but may also be diffuse throughout the esophagus. Intramural tracking can also be visualized on barium swallow as linear tracks, suggestive of pseudodiverticula interconnecting and bridging to one another. Cases of fistulisation, abscesses, as well as tract and sinus formations have been reported in infectious causes of EIP. However, scant literature exists regarding the prevalence of infectious causes of EIP. It is further postulated that in some cases, underlying polymicrobial infection may be the cause of EIP and reports have shown symptomatic improvement of patients after empiric antimicrobial therapy. It is important to be aware of these possible findings in order to characterize and treat the pseudodiverticula especially when caring for immunocompromised patients.

ACC/AHA 2022 aortic disease — Aberrant subclavian artery (ASCA): An ASCA is commonly an incidental finding but may present with compressive symptoms (including dysphagia and dyspnea) because it courses posterior to the esophagus and trachea and may associate with aneurysm disease. A normal left aortic arch with a right ASCA occurs in ∼ 1% of the population, whereas a right aortic arch with a left ASCA is much rarer and may form a vascular ring. Dilatation of the origin of either a right or left ASCA occurs in 20% to 60% of cases and is known as a Kommerell diverticulum, which may lead to aortic dissection, rupture, or embolization.

### Endoscopic management of an esophagomediastinal fistula arising from a cervical esophageal diverticulum after blunt chest trauma [^115EzgrM]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Esophagomediastinal fistula (EMF) is a rare but serious adverse event after trauma or chest surgery. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism is unclear but is presumed to be associated with compressive injury to the esophagus, with subsequent ischemia and inflammation leading to fistula formation. Prompt recognition is crucial because a delay in management increases morbidity and mortality. In this video (Video 1, available online at), we present a case of an EMF arising from a cervical esophageal diverticulum after blunt chest trauma and surgery.

A 39-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital after sustaining blunt trauma to the chest and abdomen in a motor vehicle accident. CT revealed extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall, pneumomediastinum, and bilateral pneumothoraces (Fig. 1). She underwent bilateral chest tube placement but required repeat thoracotomy, lung decortication, and mechanical pleurodesis in the setting of a moderate-sized right multiloculated empyema.

Upon discharge, the patient continued to experience progressive dysphagia and coughing. Speech pathology evaluation did not show aspiration, but a limited esophagram identified a cervical esophageal diverticulum. Because of recurrent fevers, a CT chest film was obtained, which showed a posterior mediastinal abscess (Fig. 2). Abscess drainage revealed polymicrobial growth, raising suspicion of an EMF. Repeat esophagram demonstrated contrast pooling within the diverticulum and extravasation into the abscess cavity (Fig. 3). The patient declined surgery and was referred for endoscopic evaluation.

### Endoscopic submucosal dissection with metal clip closure for the treatment of a mid-esophageal diverticulum: a case report [^112LvVeV]. Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, the primary technique employed for endoscopic treatment of a mid-lower esophageal diverticulum is diverticular peroral endoscopic myotomy (D-POEM). The surgery dissects the diverticulum septum through a submucosal tunnel, thereby preventing food and liquid retention. However, the pouch persists and may continuously cause symptoms. Since 2023, our team has been innovatively utilizing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) with metal clips to treat Zenker's diverticulum and reporting corresponding complications. Here we further applied the surgery to treat a mid-esophageal diverticulum and ultimately resolved the symptoms.

The case presented a 54-year-old man diagnosed four years previous with a 2.0-cm mid-esophageal diverticulum and adjacent mucosal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) treatment and recovered satisfactorily. After discharge, the patient occasionally experienced 5- to 10-minute episodes of chest pain, tightness, and palpitations, relieved by rest. Angina was suspected, but percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty did not alleviate it. Symptoms worsened over the past month, becoming more frequent and severe. An upper gastrointestinal barium radiography revealed a 3.0-cm mid-esophageal diverticulum (Fig. 1). Considering the symptoms are caused by the enlarged diverticulum pressing on the heart, D-POEM may result in esophageal cystic dilation, which remains near the heart and poses challenges in relieving symptoms. ESD was therefore performed (Video 1).

Fig. 1
Preoperative upper gastrointestinal barium radiography showed a 3.0-cm mid-esophageal diverticulum.

After marking the surrounding mucosa of the esophageal diverticulum and submucosal injection, we gradually dissected the mucosal and submucosal layers inside the diverticulum (Fig. 2 a–d). Significant adhesions at the diverticulum base limited dissection space. The mucosal layer was excised in two stages using a snare trap (Fig. 2 e, h). Finally, we use through-the-scope twin clips (TTS-TCs) and multiple metal clips to close the diverticulum and repair the esophageal muscular layer (Fig. 2 f, g). The patient had no chest tightness or fever post-operation and experienced less severe chest pain than before. Repeat upper gastrointestinal radiography showed resolution of the esophageal diverticulum (Fig. 3). The patientʼs preoperative symptoms disappeared and did not recur within a month on a regular diet.

### Taming type III achalasia and coexisting diverticula with complex surgical history with peroral endoscopic myotomy [^115Z4EZb]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

We present a 71-year-old woman who underwent several procedures in the past, including laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair with conversion to open surgery and Nissen fundoplication; Heller myotomy and open Nissen removal a few months later; and a Dor fundoplication surgery, posterior rectus sheath closure with separation of the abdominal components, and open surgery for recurrent hiatal hernia after 1 year. She came to our clinic 5 years later complaining of progressive dysphagia, as well as nighttime regurgitation. At presentation, she had an Eckardt score of 7 (Video 1, available online at).

A barium esophagogram showed narrowing at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction, esophageal dysmotility, and tertiary contractions in the mid- to distal esophagus, along with a 1- to 2-cm pulsion-type diverticulum in the distal esophagus. Findings of a high-resolution esophageal manometry were most consistent with type III achalasia, with an estimated hypercontractile segment of 12 cm. A pre-POEM endoluminal functional lumen imaging probe showed decreased esophagogastric junction distensibility of 2.1 mm²/mm Hg. Before the procedure, the patient received 1 dose of piperacillin tazobactam as a preprocedural prophylaxis. EGD was performed, which demonstrated an open GE junction and a nondilated, tortuous esophageal lumen with hypercontractile segments that correlated with previous manometric studies. The patient was assessed by the thoracic surgery team for possible esophagectomy. After discussing risks and benefits, the decision was made to refer the patient to a GI clinic for a POEM procedure.

### MSCT study for adult esophageal diverticulum with secondary broncho-esophageal fistula [^1131jraW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic methods for BEF include multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT), upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, bronchoscopy, and contrast esophagogram. Among these imaging modalities, esophagogram with non-barium agent remains a preliminary radiographic investigation for the diagnosis of BEF. The shape, size and location of diverticula and fistulas can be easily visualized on esophagography. However, the image may sometimes be normal for orifices which are cabined owing to inflammation and edema. Although bronchoscopy can indicate the status of bronchus and obtain biopsy, its application is limited due to great pain to the patient. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is helpful in assessing the BEF, and large orifices in the wall of esophagus can be clearly seen. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of small fistulas hidden between the esophageal mucosal folds keeps not accurate. MSCT is able to diagnose the BEF by directly or indirectly showing the course and shape of the fistulous tract between the esophagus and bronchus. Furthermore, MSCT scan is also capable of evaluating the lung and mediastinal involvements among those patients, which are unavailable in esophagogram and endoscopy. Meanwhile, it is the principal alternative in patients who are difficult to swallow, cooperate, tolerate fluoroscopy or endoscopy, like those patients with an altered mentation or on ventilator support. BEF that was previously not diagnosed or suspected can be further identified on MSCT scan for patients with recurrent respiratory symptoms.

Regarding this disease entity, most studies are only confined to limited case report in English literature. Therefore, our aim is to explore the advantages of MSCT in diagnosing BEF secondary to esophageal diverticulum, and provide a reference regarding therapeutic strategies for those patients with BEF.

### Tracheal diverticula after tracheoesophageal fistula repair: case series and review of the literature [^113NB4pz]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is the most common congenital tracheal abnormality, frequently associated with esophageal atresia. Respiratory symptoms are associated with all types of TEF, even after surgical repair of the fistula. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with aspiration of gastric contents, structural instability of the airways (tracheomalacia), abnormal respiratory epithelium, abnormal esophageal motility, recurrent TEF, and esophageal stenosis contribute to postsurgical complications.

Methods

We review 7 patients between 4 and 14 years of age with a history of TEF repair and persistent or worsening respiratory symptoms despite conventional airway clearance techniques and treatment of GER.

Results

Bronchoscopic evaluation in all 7 patients revealed tracheomalacia and a diverticulum on the posterior wall of the trachea at the fistula repair site.

Conclusion

We hypothesize that the diverticula impaired airway clearance and contributed to persistent respiratory symptoms. Possible mechanisms for the diverticulum contributing to poor airway clearance include facilitating the pooling of secretions and acting as a "barrier" to the lower airway clearance mechanism. The diagnosis of a diverticulum should be considered early in patients with persistent respiratory symptoms after management of GER and tracheomalacia. Early obliteration of tracheal diverticula might improve respiratory status in some patients.

### Thoracic esophageal diverticula: a 15-year experience of minimally invasive surgical management [^1147Yy2C]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thoracic esophageal diverticula are uncommon, and controversies exist regarding their management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of a relatively large cohort of patients with thoracic esophageal diverticula treated with minimally invasive surgical techniques.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent minimally invasive surgical treatment for symptomatic esophageal diverticula during a 15-year period. The primary end point was 30-day mortality. In addition, we evaluated the morbidity, improvement in dysphagia (score: 1, best to 5, worst), and quality of life (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life score: 0, best to 50, most symptoms).

Results

Fifty-seven patients underwent minimally invasive surgical treatment of symptomatic thoracic esophageal diverticula. The most common symptom was dysphagia (45 of 57; 79%). A motility disorder or distal mechanical obstruction was identified in 49 patients (86%). Approaches used included video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (n = 33), laparoscopy (n = 18), and combined video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and laparoscopy (n = 6). The most common procedure performed was diverticulectomy and myotomy (47 of 57 patients; 82.5%). The 30-day mortality was 0%. There were 4 patients (7%) with postoperative leaks requiring reoperation. During follow-up, the median dysphagia score improved from 3 to 1 (p < 0.001). The median Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life score after surgery was 5 (excellent).

Conclusions

A minimally invasive surgical approach for the management of thoracic esophageal diverticula is safe and effective during intermediate-term follow-up when performed by surgeons experienced in esophageal surgery and minimally invasive techniques. Further follow-up is required to assess the durability of these results. The optimal approach and procedures performed should be determined on an individualized basis after a thorough investigation.

### Greater-curvature peroral endoscopic myotomy with diverticuloseptotomy for the treatment of achalasia in a patient with a large epiphrenic diverticulum [^115tnmGH]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Epiphrenic diverticula occur in the distal esophagus and are considered pulsion-type diverticula inasmuch as they occur secondary to a congenital weakness of the esophageal wall in conjunction with an esophageal motility disorder. They have been associated with esophageal dysmotility, predominantly achalasia. Symptomatic epiphrenic diverticula are usually managed surgically with laparoscopy involving diverticulectomy, myotomy, and anterior fundoplication. Alternative therapeutic options are limited for patients deemed poor surgical candidates. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has proved to be successful in treating patients with achalasia, with newer reports suggesting that a similar approach can be considered in patients with a concomitant epiphrenic diverticulum. Two methods of POEM have been described for this clinical scenario: salvage POEM, or S-POEM, and diverticular POEM, or D-POEM. S-POEM involves performing a submucosal endoscopic myotomy on the wall opposite the epiphrenic diverticulum.D-POEM involves submucosal tunneling to expose and isolate the diverticular septum, followed by a septotomy.

A 93-year-old man presented to our institution 2 years after his initial presentation for ongoing intermittent dysphagia and food regurgitation. As part of his initial evaluation, standard upper endoscopy found evidence of a large epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum and high-resolution esophageal manometry revealed type III achalasia (Fig. 1). After this evaluation, he subsequently sought care elsewhere and underwent an anterior POEM. He returned to our institution for evaluation, given his lack of symptom improvement after POEM. A repeated barium esophagram revealed severe esophageal dysmotility, suggesting ongoing functional esophageal obstruction and a persistent, large esophageal diverticulum above the esophagogastric junction with intermittent passage of contrast material (Fig. 2). He underwent surgical evaluation but was thought to be a suboptimal surgical candidate in the setting of his advanced age and poor functional status. He subsequently underwent repeated POEM with diverticuloseptotomy (Video 1, available online at).

### Taming type III achalasia and coexisting diverticula with complex surgical history with peroral endoscopic myotomy [^115bh72h]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum is a rare condition often linked to an underlying motility disorder, typically achalasia. Symptoms primarily mirror the underlying motility issue and include dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn, and respiratory problems. Diagnosis relies on EGD and barium esophagogram, with manometry offering supplementary insights. Surgical options were previously preferred, including laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication. Diverticulectomy may be considered selectively.

Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) offers effective symptom relief with minimal invasiveness, particularly for patients who are ineligible for surgery. A small prospective study on 7 patients who declined surgery showed preferred results with a high safety profile. In another retrospective study on 14 patients with esophageal diverticulum and achalasia who underwent POEM, all patients had improved postoperative Eckardt scores. A recent meta-analysis showed that POEM is an effective and safe technique among both patients with and without Zenker's diverticulum and has better clinical success than flexible endoscopic septum division.

### Intermittently symptomatic tracheal diverticulum: a case of a rare clinical phenomenon [^11329mCx]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Tracheal diverticula are rarely encountered, and only a handful of cases have been described in the literature. In most of these cases the patient was asymptomatic. When symptoms have occurred, they usually had an airway component such as cough, dyspnea, and recurrent respiratory infection. Imaging techniques-particularly computed tomography-are beneficial for diagnosing a tracheal diverticulum because bronchoscopy can sometimes miss the point of communication with the trachea. We report the case of a 62-year-old woman with a tracheal diverticulum that manifested as an intermittent, painful right neck mass with associated cough, dysphonia, dysphagia/odynophagia, and an occasional strangulation/choking sensation.

### Pharyngeal diverticulum as a sequela of anterior cervical fusion [^115G1p2E]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

A rarely diagnosed etiology of dysphagia is a pharyngeal diverticula occurring after anterior cervical fusion. Here we review 2 cases where patients developed pharyngeal diverticula following anterior cervical fusion. The first patient was a 28-year-old female who presented with regurgitation following C5 through C6 cervical fusion. She was diagnosed with a pharyngeal diverticulum and underwent open repair, but began to experience symptoms again a few months later. A barium swallow showed a recurrent pharyngeal diverticulum. Endoscopic repair was attempted; however, because of the thick scar band between the diverticulum and the esophagus, the operation had to be converted to an open repair with cricopharyngeal myotomy. The second case involved a 63-year-old male who presented with dysphagia and regurgitation 6 months after anterior cervical fusion. Esophagram demonstrated a small diverticulum at the right lateral border of the upper esophagus. Open repair of the diverticulum with cricopharyngeal myotomy was successfully performed. Pharyngeal diverticula after anterior cevical fusion have only been reported in 2 prior cases in the literature. Here we describe 2 additional cases at our institution, both requiring open repair. Radiographic studies demonstrate the diverticulum at the site of scarring from the cervical fusion. Because of the thick scar band and the atypical location of these diverticula, endoscopic repair with stapping (as done for Zenker's diverticula) may not be feasible. These cases highlight the importance of considering a diverticulum in the differential of posoperative patients presenting to the otolaryngologists with complaints of dysphagia following cevical spine surgery.

Colonic diverticulosis and diverticular disease are among the most common gastrointestinal disorders encountered in clinical practice. These Italian guidelines focus on the diagnosis and management of diverticulosis and diverticular disease in the adult population, providing practical and evidence-based recommendations for clinicians. Experts from five Italian scientific societies, constituting a multidisciplinary panel, conducted a comprehensive review of meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, and observational studies to formulate 14 PICO questions. The assessment of the quality of the evidence and the formulation of the recommendations were carried out using an adaptation of the GRADE methodology. The guidelines covered the following topics: i) Management of diverticulosis; ii) Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment; iii) Acute diverticulitis: diagnosis and treatment; iv) Management of diverticular disease complications; v) Prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis; vi) Interventional management of diverticular disease.

A fistula between a Zenker's diverticulum and the trachea has only been reported once, in 1983. Here, we report a case of a fistula between a large Zenker's diverticulum and the trachea with complete occlusion of the esophagus. The fistula was repaired, first by an esophageal myotomy, followed by proximal resection of the diverticulum, completion of the esophageal myotomy, transection of the fistula, and repair of the trachea. The surgical repair provided complete resolution of symptoms without complications.

### Esophageal diverticula… [^115W8WYe]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The esophagus is a dynamic neuromuscular tube suspended in the chest between its muscular attachments in the neck above and the diaphragm and phrenicoesophageal ligament below. It is served by smooth and striated muscle divided into 2 layers and by enervation from the voluntary and involuntary nervous systems. It is a pressure-developing chamber that must work efficiently in pressure gradients ranging from atmospheric in the pharynx to negative in the chest to positive in the abdomen. Food is discharged into the esophagus by voluntary contraction of the pharyngeal muscles, and is then carried to the stomach by precise smooth muscle integration. Derangement of this integrated function may lead to the formation of esophageal diverticula. There has been much discussion related to the etiology of esophageal diverticula, but very little objective evidence for the standard theories of causation has been forthcoming. It is almost too elementary to mention that the usual.

### Pharyngo-esophageal diverticula… [^111eFuZY]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In 1840, Rokitansky described two types of diverticula of the esophagus, traction and pulsion, and Oekenomides, in 1882, added the traction-pulsion variety. The traction diverticula are usually situated in the region of the left main bronchus, and caused by extension of inflammation from a mediastinal lymphadenitis. When healing occurs, contraction of scar tissue pulls out a portion of the wall of the esophagus and produces a small sacculation. This type of diverticulum is, as a rule, symptomless, but may give rise to mediastinal abscess with esophagobronchial fistula, or, if obstruction occurs in the esophagus distal to it, a pulsion force is added which may cause the formation of the traction-pulsion type of sacculation. 1 This inflammatory traction type is rather frequently seen at necropsy but is rarely recognized during life. When the pulsion type of diverticulum occurs in the lower portion of the esophagus just above the cardia, it may VINSON PP.

My object in this paper is to review the literature on diverticula of the pharynx and esophagus, to mention their probable mode of development, to call attention to the frequency of their occurrence, to discuss their diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and to add an additional twenty-three cases as studied in the Esophageal Clinic at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. A diverticulum may be defined as a blind pouch that has developed from a viscus or normal canal and may consist of one or more layers of the part involved. BRANCHIAL CLEFT ANOMALIES Branchial cleft anomalies must be mentioned in this paper to complete all the pouch formations in the pharynx. The only congenital diverticula in this region are those of branchial cleft origin. Only rarely do they cause obstruction and contain food. In one patient examined there were two lateral pharyngeal pouches and one posterior, the two lateral pouches. MACMILLAN AS. POUCHES OF THE PHARYNX AND ESOPHAGUS. JAMA. 1932; 98: 964–969.
