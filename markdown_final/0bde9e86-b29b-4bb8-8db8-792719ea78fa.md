## Question

Tooth infection that's in roof of mouth

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach, diagnose, and manage a tooth infection presenting on the roof of the mouth. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely anatomical source and whether this represents palatal extension of a periapical abscess. Then, I should verify red flags and potential complications that require urgent action. Next, I will consider imaging to define the extent of spread. After that, I need to check indications for antibiotics versus when drainage and definitive dental care are the priority. Finally, I will outline management by severity, follow-up, and prevention of recurrence, making sure to double-check each step against guidelines and the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical and pathophysiological basis for a "roof of mouth" infection, because if I misattribute the source, management will be off. A lesion on the hard palate in this context most commonly reflects a maxillary tooth periapical abscess that has perforated the palatal cortical plate and is now draining intraorally; palatally displaced canines are orthodontic anomalies and not typically the source of an acute infection, so I should not conflate these entities [^111J8XFr] [^1115kY8h].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the classic progression to ensure I'm mapping the patient correctly. Caries leads to pulpal inflammation and necrosis, followed by apical periodontitis and then an acute apical abscess that can extend through buccal or palatal cortical bone, creating a palatal abscess or sinus tract that drains on the palate, with associated tenderness, fluctuance, and sometimes a fistulous opening; if the abscess is not drained, it may extend into fascial spaces with potentially life-threatening complications, so I need to check carefully for spread [^111J8XFr] [^111cMKii].

> Wait, let me verify the key history and exam elements that separate simple disease from complicated infection. I need to check which maxillary tooth is involved (usually a lateral incisor, canine, or premolar), look for caries, large restorations, or prior endodontics, palpate for fluctuance or a draining fistula on the palate, assess trismus, dysphagia, dysphonia, and systemic signs such as fever and malaise; unilateral facial or periorbital pain with purulent nasal drainage raises concern for odontogenic sinusitis and extrasinus complications, so I should confirm those red flags and document lymphadenopathy if present [^114rXbd4] [^1133KFsk].

> I need to ensure I do not miss high-risk presentations that require emergent action. Rapidly spreading floor-of-mouth swelling with induration and drooling suggests Ludwig's angina and imminent airway compromise, which mandates immediate airway management, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, and surgical drainage; orbital or periorbital signs, ophthalmoplegia, or vision changes suggest cavernous sinus thrombosis and require urgent dental source control plus neurosurgical/ENT involvement; persistent or deep pain with bone exposure after dental procedures in an immunocompromised host raises concern for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw and should trigger oral and maxillofacial surgery referral and culture-directed antibiotics [^111Cg5qE] [^116hReSJ] [^116wkApe].

> Next, I should review imaging because the clinical exam underestimates the extent of spread. Panoramic radiography can identify periapical lucency and sinus involvement, but if there is diffuse swelling, trismus, suspected deep space spread, or orbital/intracranial symptoms, contrast-enhanced maxillofacial and neck CT is preferred to delineate the source tooth, fascial space involvement, and to plan surgical access; CT is particularly helpful for odontogenic sinusitis and for identifying extrasinus complications [^111gKNz7] [^115KcAcC] [^1133KFsk].

> I will now examine antibiotic indications, but wait, I should double-check guideline nuance because overtreatment is common. For a localized palatal abscess without fever, malaise, diffuse swelling, or lymphadenopathy, the evidence supports source control (incision and drainage with extraction or endodontic therapy) without routine antibiotics; systemic antibiotics are indicated when there is spreading infection, systemic involvement, or the patient is immunocompromised, and when used, amoxicillin is preferred over penicillin V for better anaerobic coverage and tolerability, with penicillin allergy management per risk category [^117R6kXZ] [^113W1Ugm] [^114GKzfc].

> Let me think about the first-line antibiotic regimen and dosing, and I should confirm the preferred agent. For immunocompetent adults with spreading or systemic signs, amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for 3–7 days is recommended; if penicillin-allergic without anaphylaxis, cephalexin 500 mg four times daily for 3–7 days is reasonable; if there is a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, azithromycin or clindamycin are alternatives, though I need to counsel about higher resistance and the significant C. difficile risk with clindamycin; if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, I should broaden to include metronidazole or switch to amoxicillin-clavulanate [^113W1Ugm] [^114GKzfc] [^1131S6Bf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought azithromycin would be equivalent to amoxicillin for odontogenic infections, but I should verify resistance patterns. The ADA notes higher resistance rates with azithromycin for oral infections and cautions against routine use when better options exist, reinforcing amoxicillin as preferred first-line and reserving azithromycin for true penicillin anaphylaxis when clindamycin is not suitable, with explicit counseling on C. difficile risk if clindamycin is chosen [^1131S6Bf] [^113W1Ugm].

> I should confirm the principle of source control because antibiotics alone are insufficient. The mainstay is drainage of the palatal abscess, extraction of the nonvital tooth when indicated, or endodontic therapy if the tooth is restorable; immediate extraction in the setting of acute infection is acceptable and may hasten resolution when performed with appropriate drainage and technique, so I need to coordinate with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or endodontist for definitive care [^111J8XFr] [^116ZoxV3].

> Next, I should review duration and follow-up to avoid unnecessarily prolonged antibiotics. The guideline advises reevaluating at 48–72 hours and stopping antibiotics 24 hours after complete resolution of systemic signs and symptoms; if symptoms are not improving by 48–72 hours, I should reassess for undrained collections, resistant organisms, or alternate diagnoses and consider escalating therapy or obtaining cultures, particularly in refractory or immunocompromised patients [^114pCM8F] [^113W1Ugm].

> Let me consider special populations because management pivots on host status. In immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV/AIDS, on immunosuppressive therapy, or with malignancy, antibiotics are generally indicated even for localized disease, and early source control should be coordinated with the treating medical team; in children, management is similar but I should be cautious with clindamycin and tailor dosing to weight; in patients with head and neck radiation history or on antiresorptives, I need to weigh extraction risks and consider alternatives to avoid osteoradionecrosis or MRONJ, ideally with specialist input [^115c68ZG] [^115iqAkJ] [^113itPWP].

> I should double-check prevention and patient education because recurrence is common without risk modification. Emphasize prompt dental care for caries, improved oral hygiene, smoking cessation, and control of systemic diseases like diabetes; in older adults, oral infections are frequent and carry systemic risks, so reinforcing preventive strategies and arranging dental follow-up reduces morbidity and downstream complications [^115HFEhH] [^1115C4fv].

> Putting this together, my practical pathway is as follows: confirm a maxillary periapical abscess draining to the palate on history and exam; screen for systemic signs and complications; obtain a panoramic radiograph for all patients and escalate to contrast-enhanced maxillofacial and neck CT if there is concern for deep space or orbital/intracranial spread; if localized and systemically well, proceed with incision and drainage and definitive dental treatment without routine antibiotics; if spreading or systemic, start amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for 3–7 days, manage penicillin allergy per guideline, and arrange urgent source control; reassess at 48–72 hours and stop antibiotics 24 hours after complete resolution; refer to oral and maxillofacial surgery or endodontics for definitive care and coordinate with ENT, neurosurgery, or ophthalmology if complications are suspected [^111gKNz7] [^113W1Ugm] [^114pCM8F].

A tooth infection extending to the roof of the mouth is a **palatal abscess** from a maxillary tooth, most often a canine or first premolar, and can spread to deep facial spaces, causing airway compromise, orbital cellulitis, or even cavernous sinus thrombosis [^116hReSJ]. Immediate care includes **incision and drainage** with **source control** (extraction or root canal) and antibiotics for systemic signs or immunocompromise [^111J8XFr] [^117R6kXZ] [^115iqAkJ] [^116ZoxV3]. Amoxicillin is first-line; add metronidazole or use amoxicillin-clavulanate if anaerobes are suspected or if there is no improvement in 48–72 hours [^113W1Ugm] [^114naVSC]. CT imaging is indicated for deep-space involvement or airway risk [^111gKNz7]. Prompt treatment prevents serious complications, and patients should be monitored closely for deterioration [^116dAGm8] [^111Cg5qE].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Palatal abscesses typically present with the following **signs and symptoms**:

- **Localized swelling**: A firm, fluctuant swelling on the hard palate, often centered over the affected tooth.

- **Pain**: Severe, throbbing pain localized to the palate, often radiating to the upper teeth, nasal region, or periorbital area.

- **Erythema and warmth**: The overlying mucosa appears red, inflamed, and warm to touch.

- **Pus discharge**: A sinus tract or fistula may form, allowing pus to drain into the oral cavity, sometimes relieving pain temporarily.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy may be present, particularly if the infection is spreading.

- **Tooth-related symptoms**: The offending tooth may be tender to percussion, discolored, or mobile, indicating pulpal necrosis or periodontal involvement [^111J8XFr].

---

## Potential complications

If left untreated, palatal abscesses can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Airway compromise**: Infection can spread to the deep spaces of the head and neck, including the sublingual, submandibular, and retropharyngeal spaces, potentially causing Ludwig's angina and airway obstruction [^116hReSJ].

- **Orbital cellulitis**: Extension into the orbit can cause proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and vision loss [^116hReSJ].

- **Cavernous sinus thrombosis**: A rare but life-threatening complication characterized by severe headache, cranial nerve palsies, and systemic sepsis [^116hReSJ].

- **Osteomyelitis**: Infection of the maxillary bone, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with poor dental hygiene [^11541vid].

- **Sepsis**: Systemic spread of infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [^111J8XFr].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Accurate diagnosis and assessment of the extent of infection are critical. The following **diagnostic methods** are commonly employed:

- **Clinical examination**: Thorough intraoral examination to identify swelling, sinus tracts, tooth mobility, and tenderness to percussion [^111J8XFr].

- **Radiographic imaging**: Panoramic radiographs, periapical radiographs, and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) are essential to identify the source tooth, periapical pathology, and extent of bone involvement [^115KcAcC].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: CT imaging is indicated if there is suspicion of deep-space infection, orbital involvement, or airway compromise [^111Cg5qE].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be elevated in systemic infections [^114L69qn].

---

## Treatment options

Effective management of palatal abscesses requires a combination of **surgical and medical interventions**:

### Surgical management

- **Incision and drainage**: Primary treatment to decompress the abscess, relieve pain, and prevent spread of infection [^117R6kXZ].

- **Source control**: Extraction of the offending tooth or root canal therapy to eliminate the source of infection [^116ZoxV3].

- **Surgical exploration**: In cases of deep-space infection, surgical exploration and drainage of involved fascial spaces may be necessary [^112SQFuo].

---

### Medical management

Medical management centers on **antibiotic therapy** — amoxicillin is first-line for immunocompetent patients; add metronidazole or use amoxicillin-clavulanate if anaerobes are suspected or if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^113W1Ugm] [^114naVSC]. Clindamycin is an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients, but it carries a higher risk of Clostridioides difficile infection [^1131S6Bf]. Supportive care includes analgesics, antipyretics, and strict oral hygiene to prevent secondary infection [^116VzPDR].

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

The prognosis for palatal abscesses is **generally favorable** with prompt and appropriate treatment. Recovery typically occurs within 1–2 weeks, though this may be prolonged in immunocompromised patients or when complications occur. Persistent infection may result in chronic sinus tracts, recurrent abscesses, or osteomyelitis [^111J8XFr].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventing palatal abscesses primarily involves maintaining **good oral hygiene** — regular brushing, flossing, and professional dental cleanings [^115HFEhH]. Routine dental visits enable early detection and treatment of caries and periodontal disease. Prompt treatment of dental caries, pulpitis, and periodontal disease prevents progression to abscess formation [^114RrXib].

A tooth infection extending to the roof of the mouth is a serious condition requiring prompt intervention. Early **diagnosis, surgical drainage, and appropriate antibiotic therapy** are essential to prevent complications and ensure a favorable prognosis [^114y8foB].

In the everyday practice of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, empiric antibiotics are prescribed in the face of uncertainty. Is there a highly resistant organism present? Are the old-line antibiotics no longer effective? Should a broad-spectrum antibiotic be used just to cover all the bases in this case? The surprising result of this systematic review is that when combined with appropriate surgery, the usual antibiotics are all effective. Safety and cost become the differentiating factors in this clinical decision.

### Should teeth be extracted immediately in the presence of acute infection? [^116ZoxV3]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Immediate extraction of teeth in the setting of an acute infection has shown to be beneficial for many reasons. It results in faster resolution of the infection, decreased pain, and earlier return of function and oral intake. The risk of seeding the infection into deeper spaces by performing immediate extraction is low.

### Oral manifestations in the post COVID-19 condition: a Systematic review with meta-analysis [^113XrYew]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

The prognosis of post‐COVID‐19 conditions remains unclear and is likely influenced by the severity of clinical symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and individual treatment responses. In a 2‐year follow‐up study after COVID‐19 infection, recovery of smell and taste was found to be most significant within the first 100 days post‐acute phase, with little or no improvement thereafter. This suggests that the post‐COVID‐19 condition may become established after this period, and therapeutic interventions before the chronic phase could be more effective.

Ongoing training and continuing education for oral health professionals are essential. Training courses should address diagnostic methods, treatment, and follow‐up for post‐COVID‐19 conditions. Given that post‐COVID‐19 involves a wide range of potential multisystemic manifestations, all healthcare professionals should be prepared for appropriate oral health diagnosis and timely treatment or referral. Interprofessional collaboration aims to improve care delivery, reduce healthcare system burden, and avoid resource exhaustion, which had already been under significant strain during the pandemic.

More than 50% of the studies included in this review were cohort studies, suggesting a research interest in understanding the temporal role of post‐COVID‐19 oral manifestations and providing methodological potential for informing symptom and condition prognosis. Longer follow‐up periods may offer more information on symptom duration and disease outcomes but are subject to recall or measurement bias. Moreover, self‐reported symptoms may not always be attributable to the post‐COVID‐19 condition. Future studies should include interventional designs, clinical monitoring, and laboratory data, and when possible, follow healthy cohorts to test causal hypotheses about oral manifestations in the post‐COVID‐19 condition. Multidisciplinary research teams are necessary to broadly investigate the subject, enabling diagnosis and therapeutic options in post‐COVID‐19 clinical care.

The length of follow‐up after the acute phase of the disease remains a controversial element in defining post‐COVID‐19 conditions. This inconsistency may act as a methodological confounder in studies on the topic, and a global standardisation for disease definition is recommended. The scarcity of studies in Latin America and other regions with fewer research resources highlights the challenges posed by limited funding and difficulties in publishing in high‐impact journals. During the pandemic, many dental surgeons likely prioritised clinical care over research due to socioeconomic pressures and activity disruptions. A 2020 review on taste and smell disorders included only studies from North America, Europe, and Asia, and this geographic imbalance persists in the current review.

### Pediatric odontogenic infections [^111X3RJB]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Odontogenic infections are a broad group of head and neck conditions that arise from the teeth and surrounding periodontium. These largely preventable infections disproportionately affect members of ethnic and racial minorities and low-income/uninsured groups, and result in significant costs to our health care system. Left untreated, odontogenic infections can spread to deep spaces of the head and neck and can result in life-threatening complications. The mainstay of treatment includes timely treatment of the affected teeth. These infections are a global public health concern that could be diminished with improved access to routine dental care.

For odontogenic sinusitis (ODS), appropriately treating the infectious dental pathology and sinusitis leads to disease resolution in greater than 90% of cases. Importantly, managing the sinusitis of ODS is distinct from non-odontogenic rhinosinusitis. The main factors affecting ODS management decision-making include whether patients present with complicated ODS (extrasinus infectious spread), whether they have treatable dental pathology, and whether they have high dental versus sinusitis symptom burdens. This article will provide an evidence-based approach to the multidisciplinary management necessary to manage the purulent sinusitis characteristic of ODS.

FIGURE 2
Apical periodontitis.

Inflammation near the root may stimulate proliferation of the periapical epithelial cells, resulting in formation of a periapical cyst (Fig. 3). These cysts are lined with stratified squamous epithelium and filled with protein-rich fluid and cellular debris. They slowly enlarge and are often asymptomatic, although symptoms may arise if inflammation increases or if the cyst grows significantly. Treatment of periapical cysts is the same as that for periapical granulomas. Residual periapical cysts (which persist after removal of the affected tooth) should be excised. Periapical abscesses may develop de novo or from chronic periapical granuloma transformation, and are characterized by collection of inflammatory cells and infected tissue at the apex of a non-vital tooth. If the abscess extends into the alveolus, the patient may experience progressive pain, tenderness, sensitivity to percussion, swelling of adjacent tissue, extrusion of the affected tooth, and systemic signs of infection. Radiographs often demonstrate apical periodontal ligament broadening and an ill-defined radiolucency, but no significant bony defects. Sequelae of an inappropriately treated or untreated abscess include intraoral sinus tract formation, head and neck fascial space abscesses or cellulitis, and osteomyelitis. Management of periapical abscess focuses on drainage, possible tooth extraction with curettage of the cavity, or endodontic therapy if the tooth is thought to be salvageable. Antibiotics are usually unnecessary for treatment of localized abscesses unless there are systemic symptoms, involvement of fascial spaces or osteomyelitis. Intraoral sinus tracts often resolve spontaneously after appropriate treatment of the offending tooth, and require no further intervention.

Complications of Pulpal and Periapical Disease

If a periapical abscess is not drained (either surgically or spontaneously), it can perforate through the cortical bone of the maxilla or mandible and extend along soft tissue fascial planes. The head and neck have multiple fascial spaces delineated by different anatomic structures, including muscles, bone, tendons, ligaments, and so on. Odontogenic infections have the potential to spread into these spaces and result in superficial or deep space infection. Depending on their anatomic location and surrounding structures, these infections have varying degrees of severity and propensity to cause systemic harm. The most common complication and most frequent cause of death from odontogenic infections is airway compromise. Additional complications may also include, but are not limited to, visual disturbances/blindness, sinusitis, mediastinitis, septic thrombus formation, and systemic sepsis.

Osteomyelitis of the jaws is an uncommon infection of the maxillofacial area. The disease is often difficult to diagnose, and thus delays in treatment are common, increasing its morbidity. The clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings of the disease; its forms; and treatment modalities are reviewed. Suggestions for contemporary diagnosis and surgical treatment of acute and chronic suppurative osteomyelitis are discussed.

Oral fungal infections are opportunistic and due to impaired host resistance. The increasing number of immunosuppressed individuals contributes to rising numbers of mycoses worldwide, and the ease of global migration has allowed the geographic range of endemic mycoses to expand. Deep fungal infections can clinically mimic other pathologic conditions including malignancy. This review highlights the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations of eight fungal infections that can be encountered in the dental setting.

Management

The identification and management of dental needs prior to initiating hemato-oncologic therapy are prudent for all patients, including those who regularly receive oral health care. The dental evaluation should include a clinical and radiological assessment. Ideally, periodontal assessment should be performed if the medical background and blood counts permit (see below).
The pre-cancer dental management is determined by the following goals: o To eliminate dental sources of infection to the extent of reducing the risk of acute dental infection or reactivation of chronic infection until immune reconstitution occurs and to prevent systemic spread of dental and oral pathogenic micro-organisms during this period. o To reduce oral discomfort or pain that may be a burden during cancer treatment. o To reduce local irritation from the teeth, dental restorations or prostheses to the oral mucosa while the tissue is at risk for OM. o To reduce the risk for aspiration of loose dental structures. o To educate the patient about the importance of self-care, oral hygiene during the hemato-oncologic cancer therapy, and briefly prepare the patient for common anticipated oral complications. o Ultimately, to improve oral intake, reduce pain, prevent interruption in cancer therapy, improve quality of life, and possibly reduce mortality. Indirectly, this may also reduce costs of care.
Accordingly, the treatment plan should prioritize dental needs that may develop into active infection, may cause uncontrolled pain or irritation of the oral mucosa during the immunosuppression, or pose a risk for aspiration.
Examples of dental needs at high priority to be addressed pre hemato-oncologic therapy include symptomatic teeth, advanced dental caries approaching the pulp, unrestorable teeth, inflamed or necrotic pulp, symptomatic apical periodontitis, symptomatic apical abscess, gingival or periodontal abscess, advanced chronic periodontitis with purulent exudate or with severe tooth mobility, periimplantitis with purulent exudate or with severe implant mobility, pericoronitis during the last three months, loose contact point with food impaction, a sharp structure (e.g. fractured tooth or restoration and ill-fitting prosthesis or orthodontic appliances) that are traumatic to the soft tissue, or pathologies that typically deem an immediate excision. A "symptomatic" dental need denotes symptoms occurring within the last three months.
Poor oral hygiene (OH) is an aggravating factor for oral infection that drives more determinative dental treatment decisions. OH instruction (OHI) and professional OH treatment are key elements in the dental treatment plan that will help to set a healthy plaque-control at baseline and educate the patient on how to maintain it. Given that fatigue is a common complication following hemato-oncologic treatments, particularly CAR T-cell therapy, as part of their education, patients should be encouraged to maintain good OH despite this challenge.
There is no reservation regarding continuing tooth brushing. Inter-dental brushing/flossing should be continued during the HCT or cytopenia period if a patient is proficient with these techniques. The toothbrush should be rinsed thoroughly with water and allowed to air-dry and should be replaced at the first signs of bristle wear. Removable dentures or appliances should be cleaned daily mechanically and with agents specifically designated for this purpose. Chlorhexidine (CHX) rinse may be an effective adjunct in plaque control. Alcohol-free CHX may be used if the oral mucosa is sensitive to standard CHX preparation.
Fluoride application, either office-based or home-based, may be offered as a preventive measure in dentate patients.
The time constraints prior to initiation of cancer therapy dictate modifications to the dental treatment plan. The burden of the dental disease, the urgency of the cancer treatment, and the risk of complications due to the dental treatment are the main considerations in prioritizing the dental treatment before the initiation of the cancer therapy. Insufficient time for post-operative healing or for re-treatment if the first attempt fails drives a more determinative approach over a conventional dental treatment plan in healthy patients. Multi-visit, time-consuming endodontic treatment is unfavored, especially when additional high-priority dental needs are present.
The dental treatment plan should address present dental needs as well as dental conditions that are anticipated to deteriorate within 6–12 months following the hemato-oncologic therapy, until routine dental treatment may be resumed (see below the section about the considerations to restart routine dental care).
Considering the time constraints, efforts should be made to consolidate multiple treatments into a single session to efficiently manage the limited timeframe available. It is advised to schedule dental extractions as early as possible to maximize the postoperative healing period before the initiation of the hemato-oncologic therapy. Ideally, tooth extractions should be performed with sufficient time before hemato-oncologic therapy to allow the socket to heal with epithelium, thereby reducing the risk of pathogen penetration. This is estimated to happen within 2–3 weeks following the extraction.
The decision about tooth extraction is a delicate balance, and the dentist should be mindful of its impact. Post-extraction adverse sequelae (e.g. infection and dry socket) may potentially postpone the oncologic treatment. Additionally, a radical treatment plan may negatively impact oral function in the immediate term. Furthermore, the patient may have compromised oral function for a long term because routine dental care is held.
Ideally, if time allows, a dental treatment plan should extend beyond mere tooth extraction to include restorative treatment, which may potentially reduce the risk of bacteremia and would improve the patient's quality of life.
If time constraints do not allow delivering all planned dental care, the patient should be informed about unresolved dental needs posing a low risk of immediate complications. These dental needs should be addressed following the hemato-oncologic therapy when the medical condition permits, for example during the next remission phase. For unresolved incipient dental caries, an in-office fluoridation and at-home high-concentration fluoride toothpaste may be offered. There may be geographic variation in the availability of these fluoride agents.
The hematologist should be informed about the dental needs which pose a high risk of complications and should be addressed in the immediate term. Communication about the invasiveness of the planned treatment and expected healing time is of great value in order for the physician to advise on the delivery of the dental treatment or to postpone the chemotherapy, HCT, or CAR T-cell therapy.
When dental treatment is deemed necessary prior to the hemato-oncologic therapy, adjustment of the treatment plan may be needed based on the patient's hematologic profile and medical status.
Risk of spread of oral pathogenic micro-organisms during dental treatment. Clinician discretion regarding antibiotic prophylaxis in dental patients at risk for infection is needed (Table 1).
Risk of bleeding. In thrombocytopenic patients, major bleeding may develop following surgical or non-surgical intervention, such as scaling (Table). In addition, cancer patients are at risk of coagulation disorders, and some may receive anti-coagulant treatment. The clinician should assess the bleeding risk and prepare for intra-operative and post-operative bleeding complications.
Risk of anemia-related complications. Patients with anemia may experience fatigue and dizziness, especially upon position change (Table). Additionally, anemia may also delay healing.
Approach to indwelling catheter. Often patients prior to hemato-oncologic therapy undergo indwelling catheter insertion. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated prior to dental intervention in immunocompetent patients with indwelling catheter. o Risk of osteoradionecrosis (ORN). The radiotherapy dose in patients with orofacial lymphoma or plasmacytoma is relatively low. However, if the cumulative dose to the jawbone at the site of extraction exceeds 44 Gy, ORN may develop. Thus, the treatment approach for these hematologic patients will be similar to patients with head and neck cancer. It is advised to assess if extraction is needed prior to the radiotherapy and complete the extractions > 2 weeks prior to the radiotherapy. Dosimetry mapping may assist in determining the risk of developing ORN in a particular jaw segment, and accordingly in the planning of dental treatment. o Comorbidities. The patient's medical records may identify medical comorbidities and medications that require additional modifications in the dental treatment plan. For example, history of treatment with bone modifying agents (e.g. bisphosphonates and denosumab) poses a higher risk for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), and therefore, the dental treatment plan should be adjusted according to standard recommendations.
Given the complexity of the decision-making in the dental management of hemato-oncology patients prior to the cancer therapy, a consultation with an oral medicine specialist or a hospital dentist with expertise in managing this patient population is advised.
The dental practitioner should educate the patient on managing the common oral complications associated with upcoming hemato-oncologic therapy. Detailed information on these complications is outside the scope of this CPS paper; clinicians are referred to other MASCC/ISOO publications for guidance on managing these issues (see Suggested Reading as Electronic Supplementary Material).
Routine dental treatment may be resumed after immune reconstitution.
In hemato-oncologic patients treated with chemotherapy, bone marrow recovery is expected within about 2–3 weeks following the last dose of chemotherapy, as can be indicated by the white blood cell (WBC) count, and particularly neutrophil counts.
In patients undergoing HCT, the immune reconstitution status is usually substantiated by the WBC, CD4 count, and immunoglobulin levels, among other tests. Often, this is attained at about 3 months post autologous HCT and about 6 months post allogeneic HCT. The transplant physician may choose to postpone the dental intervention beyond this period to assure the patient's immunocompetence and ability to undergo dental treatment safely.
In the setting of CAR T-cell therapy, cytopenia may develop later and last longer than post conventional HCT. Blood counts should be tested prior to invasive dental treatment during the first 2 years following the CAR T-cell therapy. Given the unpredictable risk for cytopenia, the patient should be motivated to practice good oral hygiene especially while routine dental treatment cannot be performed.
If an acute dentoalveolar infection develops prior to immune reconstitution, nonsurgical intervention including systemic antibiotics and local antimicrobials are the mainstay of treatment. Intervention for dental complications during cancer therapy and prior to immune reconstitution is reserved for exceptional cases and requires a consultation between the dental care provider and the hematologist.
Following CAR T-cell therapy, if a dental emergency develops while the patient suffers prolonged cytopenia, and topical antimicrobial and systemic antibiotic treatment is ineffective in controlling the infection, dental treatment may be delivered as a last resort. In such cases, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be considered to support dental interventions, provided that the patient does not have a concurrent diagnosis of cytokine release syndrome.
Preparatory treatment with G-CSF may be considered on an individual basis in other neutropenic patients in need of dental intervention, for example, patients post HCT with delayed engraftment. When G-CSF treatment is considered, the hematologist should be consulted.
In pediatric patients, there are a few unique considerations prior to chemotherapy or HCT in addition to the removal of foci of infection:
Oral hygiene aids should be adjusted to the patient's age. The parents should be actively involved in the daily oral hygiene care. In younger or critically ill pediatric patients who are unable to brush teeth or use mouth rinses, the dental plaque can be mechanically removed by gently massaging the gumline with a gauze soaked with saline or CHX.
Primary teeth should be allowed to exfoliate naturally. However, extremely mobile teeth should be removed as part of the dental clearance. The rationale is to reduce the risk for pain, ensure oral intake, and avoid potential bleeding during thrombocytopenia.
Given the time constraints and behavioral challenges in pediatric patients, silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may be considered a non-restorative treatment to arrest superficial carious lesions on primary teeth. Patients and their parents should be informed about the possible side effects of SDF treatment and that future restoration will be needed to restore the cavitated tooth or that SDF treatment may need to be repeated periodically.
The treatment delivery should be adjusted to the pediatric patient population in order to achieve the patient's collaboration. For example, behavioral-cognitive techniques, sedation, or involvement of supporting services (medical clowns, animal-therapy). When there is an abundance of dental needs, general anesthesia may be required. Pediatric dental specialists are well experienced and equipped to manage this patient population.
Orthodontic brackets and appliances that may be plaque-retentive or traumatic to the soft tissues should be removed.
In elderly patients, there are a few unique considerations prior to chemotherapy or HCT in addition to the removal of foci of infection:
Removable dentures and implant-based prostheses are common in elderly patients.
In removable denture users, denture-induced traumatic contacts on a mucosal-bearing area should be removed prior to cancer therapy. Relining may be needed to fix ill-fitting/unstable dentures.
Patient should be educated about the optimal care for the denture. Briefly, regular rinses of the dentures in water are recommended. Additionally, periodic decontamination of the dentures with sodium bicarbonate, CHX, or other commercial products designated for denture cleaning is advised. Likewise, the patient should be educated about the adequate use of the denture specifically the removal of the denture at night.
In patients with implant-based fixed prostheses, the importance of self-oral hygiene adjacent to the dental implants should be stressed, and adjusted dental hygiene aids should be recommended.

### Imaging of dental infections [^111gKNz7]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Dental infections are a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). To help guide clinical management for these infections, the radiologist must be familiar with the anatomy of the oral cavity and neighboring structures, the range of appearance of dental infections, and the routes along which they may spread. Computed tomography (CT) is often performed when severe dental infections are suspected. This pictorial essay reviews the anatomy pertinent to the imaging evaluation of dental infections and depicts a spectrum of pathology that may be encountered, ranging from simple dentoalveolar infections to complex multispatial infections.

### Is dental treatment of an infected Tooth a risk factor for locally invasive spread of infection? [^114L69qn]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the impact of antecedent dental procedures and dental health on the course of odontogenic maxillofacial infections requiring hospital care.

Patients and Methods

In this retrospective cohort study in a referral center, we evaluated medical records and panoramic radiographs of all patients admitted because of odontogenic maxillofacial infection (n = 84). The predictor variables were preceding dental treatment, antimicrobial therapy, and dental health. The outcome variables comprised infection parameters, length of stay, need for intensive care, and management during hospitalization.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 43.2 ± 16.5 years and 60% were men. Dental procedure preceded the spread of the infection in 49 cases (58%): endodontic treatment (n = 22), tooth extraction (n = 19), and minor first aid (n = 8). Twenty-seven patients had not received any dental or antimicrobial treatment in the recent past. Antimicrobial treatment alone had been given to 8 patients. Patients without preceding treatment had the highest C-reactive protein levels on admission and at maximum (P = 0.020 and P = 0.011) and the highest white blood cell counts on admission (P = 0.011). Their length of stay was also longer, and they needed intensive care more often than the other patients. Maximum C-reactive protein levels and white blood cell counts between treatment groups did not significantly differ from each other.

Conclusions

The systemic response to the infection was strongest and the course of the infection most severe in the absence of preceding dental treatment and in patients with poor dental health. All types of dental treatment contributed to a less severe course of infection.

### Dental topics for plastic surgeons, part three: infection and trauma of the dentition [^114JKeUQ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Delays in the treatment of a tooth with irreversible pulpitis may eventually progress to pulpal necrosis, an end-stage pathology. The affected teeth may initially show a pinkish discoloration that can progress to persistent gray with failure to return to normal color. This process may be accompanied by prolonged periapical inflammation, increased tooth sensitivity, tenderness to percussion, and arrested root development. Treatment of primary necrotic teeth should strive to reduce the impact on the succedaneous permanent tooth. Depending on the condition of the tooth, the patient's age, and the position of the permanent succedaneous tooth, the pediatric dentist may recommend endodontic therapy or extraction of the affected tooth to prevent damage to its permanent successor. Permanent teeth with pulpal necrosis are addressed with endodontic therapy or tooth extraction. If the infective process spreads beyond the tooth structure and into the surrounding bone, it may expand into the soft tissues of the head and neck. Pathophysiologically, the pulp chamber within the tooth acts as a direct conduit to the underlying sterile alveolar bone and soft tissue and may result in periapical disease and associated complications.

Periapical Disease

In the setting of irreversible pulpitis and non-vital/necrotic teeth, the area surrounding the tooth apices may become inflamed with the development of cysts or abscesses. These pathologies are closely related and often transition reversibly from one to another. Apical periodontitis (often referred to as "periapical granuloma", although there is no histologic granuloma formation) (Fig. 2) can be divided into acute and chronic stages. Bacterial contamination in the root can easily spread into the apex of the tooth root. The acute phase is characterized histologically by a neutrophil-predominant infiltrate and osteoclast-driven bone resorption, and clinical may manifest with dull throbbing pain exacerbated by biting or percussion. Radiographs may show bony resorption surrounding the root apex and a characteristic periapical radiolucency. As the process transitions to chronic apical periodontitis, neutrophils are replaced by chronic inflammatory cells. At this stage the symptoms typically diminish, but there may be acute exacerbations. Because of this, chronic periapical granulomas are often discovered incidentally. Treatment focuses on eradicating the offending infection and eliminating the associated toxic products. If the tooth is salvageable, root canal therapy is undertaken. Otherwise, extraction with soft tissue curettage is performed for non-restorable teeth.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^117R6kXZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dental pain can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with these conditions should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics in the absence of these signs. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies within both the individual and the community. This review is an update of the original version that was published in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 26 February 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 26 February 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 26 February 2018), Embase Ovid (1980 to 26 February 2018), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 26 February 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. A grey literature search was conducted using OpenGrey (to 26 February 2018) and ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1993 to 26 February 2018). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of systemic antibiotics in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, with or without surgical intervention (considered in this situation to be extraction, incision and drainage or endodontic treatment) and with or without analgesics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We calculated mean differences (MD) (standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data. A fixed-effect model was used in the meta-analysis as there were fewer than four studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included two trials in this review, with 62 participants included in the analyses. Both trials were conducted in university dental schools in the United States and compared the effects of oral penicillin V potassium (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention (total or partial pulpectomy) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth. The patients included in these trials had no signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). We assessed one study as having a high risk of bias and the other study as having unclear risk of bias. The primary outcome variables reported in both studies were participant-reported pain and swelling (one trial also reported participant-reported percussion pain). One study reported the type and number of analgesics taken by participants. One study recorded the incidence of postoperative endodontic flare-ups (people who returned with symptoms that necessitated further treatment). Adverse effects, as reported in one study, were diarrhoea (one participant, placebo group) and fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant, antibiotic group). Neither study reported quality of life measurements. Objective 1: systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscessTwo studies provided data for the comparison between systemic antibiotics (penicillin VK) and a matched placebo for adults with acute apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention. Participants in one study all underwent a total pulpectomy of the affected tooth, while participants in the other study had their tooth treated by either partial or total pulpectomy. Participants in both trials received oral analgesics. There were no statistically significant differences in participant-reported measures of pain or swelling at any of the time points assessed within the review. The MD for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3) was -0.03 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours; and 0.08 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours. The SMD for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours; and 0.02 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours. The body of evidence was assessed as at very low quality. Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscessWe found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-quality evidence that is insufficient to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics on adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.

### Controversies in the management of oral and maxillofacial infections [^114qh9yE]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The management and treatment of odontogenic infection, and its frequent extension into the head and neck, remains an important section of oral and maxillofacial surgical practice. This area of maxillofacial expertise is widely recognized by the medical community and an essential component to the hospital referral system. Although the general principles of infection management have not changed, there have been modifications in the timing of treatment sequences and treatment techniques. These modifications are influenced by the development of diagnostic methods and advances in bacterial genetics and antibiotic usage. This article reviews treatment considerations and controversies surrounding this subject.

### Imaging of odontogenic infections [^115KcAcC]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Odontogenic infections represent a common clinical problem in patients of all ages. The presence of teeth enables the direct spread of inflammatory products from dental caries, trauma, and/or periodontal disease into the maxilla and mandible. The radiographic changes seen depend on the type and duration of the inflammatory process and host body response. Imaging plays a central role in identifying the source of infection and the extent of the disease spread and in detecting any complications. Many different imaging modalities can be used. The radiographic features associated with acute and chronic inflammatory processes are discussed.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^115jNXbM]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation framework — recommendations versus good practice statements (GPS) and strength: Recommendations are informed by a comprehensive search for the best available evidence and a formal process for assessing the certainty of the evidence, whereas GPS are appropriate when there is an excess of indirect evidence suggesting that their implementation will result in large and unequivocal net positive or negative consequences; recommendations are associated with a certainty of the evidence in contrast to GPS. The expert panel graded the strength of recommendations (that is, strong or conditional) and these recommendations and GPS aim to help clinicians, policy makers, and patients make decisions about antibiotic use for immunocompetent adults (most typical patients) who have the target conditions; clinicians should use informed clinical judgement to identify the appropriate course of action in situations that deviate from these recommendations and GPS.

American Dental Association guideline — management when initial antibiotics do not respond and cautions: For cases that do not respond promptly to antibiotics, clinicians may consider either complementing first-line treatment with oral metronidazole or discontinuing first-line treatment and prescribing oral amoxicillin and clavulanate to enhance the efficacy against gram-negative anaerobic organisms; an antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to those recommended in Table can be continued if the antibiotic was initiated before the patient sought treatment, patients should be informed about symptoms that may indicate lack of antibiotic efficacy and adverse drug events, and while other antibiotics such as moxifloxacin have a reasonable spectrum of activity for the treatment of oral infections, there are US Food and Drug Administration black box warnings (indicating a serious safety hazard) for this antibiotic.

American Dental Association guideline — follow-up and duration of antibiotic therapy: There is little to no evidence supporting the common belief that a shortened course of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance; clinicians should reevaluate or follow up with their patient after 3 days to assess if there is resolution of systemic signs and symptoms, and if the patient's signs and symptoms begin to resolve, clinicians should instruct the patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 hours after complete resolution, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 days; prescription medications, including antibiotics, should not be saved for later use nor shared with others, and the panel emphasizes the importance of patients' discarding antibiotics safely at local disposal centers.

### The prevention of infections in older adults: oral health [^1115C4fv]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

The oral cavity is exposed to the external environment and from a very young age is colonized by infectious agents. Under certain circumstances including poor oral hygiene, dry mouth, trauma, and the use of antibiotics, oral infections can occur. They can result in damage to the oral cavity including teeth and their support structures. Oral infections can also lead to the extension of infection into surrounding tissues and to systemic infections. Chronic oral infection is a recognized risk factor for heart disease. Older adults are at high risk for oral infections and associated complications. Tooth loss, for which infection is the most significant cause, leads to cosmetic changes and a decreased ability to masticate certain foods that can lead to malnutrition. Chronic oral infections and the manipulation of teeth and supporting structures can lead to the hematogenous spread of infection including the infection of artificial joints and endocardial implants. Good oral hygiene, the use of fluoride, regular dental care, and the appropriate use of antibiotics can all reduce oral infections and their associated complications.

Regarding preventative measures for osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, more specifically with respect to dental care (invasive dental procedures), ASCO/ISOO/MASCC 2024 guidelines recommend to offer alternatives to dental extraction, such as root canal, crown, or filling, for teeth in areas at high risk for osteoradionecrosis unless the patient has recurrent infections, intractable pain, or other symptoms that cannot be alleviated without extraction. Avoid using dental implants in high-risk zones for osteoradionecrosis unless alternatives to restoring oral function are not possible.

Antibiotic safety and patient instructions — Patients should be instructed to closely monitor symptoms and contact a dentist or primary care provider if infection worsens during therapy; clindamycin carries a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for Clostridioides difficile infection, which can be fatal, and patients should call their primary care provider if they develop fever, abdominal cramping, or ≥ 3 loose bowel movements/d. If a patient is already taking an antibiotic within the same spectrum as the one indicated, additional antibiotics do not need to be prescribed; if the current antibiotic is outside the spectrum, the intended antibiotic still can be prescribed considering potential contraindications, and a similar-spectrum antibiotic already started can be continued, with counseling on symptoms that may indicate lack of efficacy and adverse drug events.

### Dentoalveolar infections [^111cMKii]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Dentoalveolar infections represent a wide spectrum of conditions, from simple localized abscesses to deep neck space infections. The initial assessment of the patient with a dentoalveolar infection requires considerable clinical skill and experience, and determines the need for further airway management or emergent surgical therapy. Knowledge of head and neck fascial space anatomy is essential in diagnosing, understanding spread, and surgically managing these infections. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must make use of their wide spectrum of clinical skill and knowledge to effectively evaluate and treat patients with dentoalveolar infections.

### Dental topics for plastic surgeons, part three: infection and trauma of the dentition [^116hReSJ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Two of the most important and dangerous sequelae of cellulitis arising from odontogenic infections are Ludwig angina and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Ludwig angina is a rapidly progressive infection of the sublingual, submandibular, and submental regions bilaterally. It most often develops from infected mandibular molars and fractures, parapharyngeal space abscesses, oral lacerations, and tongue piercings. Once the submandibular region is involved, the infection can also spread to the retropharyngeal space, potentially extending along that fascial plane into the mediastinum with severe consequences, including mediastinitis, pericarditis, pneumonia, empyema, and death. Clinical features include airway obstruction, mouth and neck pain, restricted neck movement, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, and copious oral secretions. Fever, chills, leukocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers may also be seen. Treatment of Ludwig angina centers on airway maintenance and infectious management with surgical intervention and/or intravenous antibiotics. Some clinicians recommend surgical decompression only for patients who are refractory to antibiotic therapy or have developed a localized abscess, while others believe surgery should be utilized in all cases.

Cavernous sinus thrombosis (Fig. 4) refers to septic thrombus development within the of the cavernous sinus, an area located lateral to the sella-turcica and medial to the temporal bone. The cavernous sinus contains the oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve (V1 and V2), abducens nerve (VI), and internal carotid artery; infection and thrombosis of the sinus can affect any of these structures. Odontogenic infections are responsible for 10% of cavernous sinus thrombosis cases. This condition may develop from an anterior pathway initiating at the maxillary anterior teeth, or through a posterior pathway originating from maxillary premolar or molar teeth. Cavernous sinus thrombosis manifests as edematous periorbital enlargement, proptosis, ptosis, induration, and swelling of the adjacent forehead and nose, mydriasis, lacrimation, photophobia, vision loss, and facial pain. As the condition progresses, patients may develop meningitis and localized brain abscesses, altered mental status, and sepsis. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is treated by surgical extraction of infected teeth, drainage of any abscess, and a high-dose antibiotic regimen. Some experts also recommend anticoagulation to prevent further thrombosis and septic emboli.

### Oral infections and antibiotic therapy [^112tpWpn]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Oral infections commonly originate from an odontogenic source in adults and from tonsil and lymphatic sources in children. Odontogenic infections arise from advanced dental caries or periodontal disease. Oral trauma, radiation injury, chemotherapy mucositis, salivary gland infection, lymph node abscess, and postoperative infection are potential nonodontogenic sources of infections that could potentially be life threatening. This article reviews the serious nature and potential danger that exists from oral infection and the antibiotics available to treat them are reviewed. Successful treatment requires an understanding of the microflora, the regional anatomy, the disease process, the treatment methods available, and interdisciplinary team collaboration.

### Update on antimicrobial therapy in management of acute odontogenic infection in oral and maxillofacial surgery [^116k1M3x]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

This article focuses on the antimicrobial therapy of head and neck infections from odontogenic origin. Odontogenic infections are among the most common infections of the oral cavity. They are sourced primarily from dental caries and periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). Many odontogenic infections are self-limiting and may drain spontaneously. However, these infections may drain into the anatomic spaces adjacent to the oral cavity and spread along the contiguous facial planes, leading to more serious infections. Antibiotics are an important aspect of care of the patient with an acute odontogenic infection. Antibiotics are not a substitute for definitive surgical management.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^113DW4FB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dental pain can have a considerable detrimental effect on an individual's quality of life.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^111ZxEmb]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Values and preferences — urgent management of pulpal- and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: Patients often view antibiotics as a noninvasive, inexpensive option and may be unaware of the magnitude of harms associated with antibiotic use. Clinicians often encounter patients with expectations for receiving antibiotics, and this is a common reason clinicians deviate from clinical practice guidelines recommending against antibiotic use. During the panel meeting, experts discussed that antibiotics may be considered an appropriate treatment choice owing to access-to-care issues affecting many communities; for example, if a patient is visibly in pain, upset, and unable to receive definitive, conservative dental treatment within a short time, a clinician may consider antibiotics as an option, regardless of the potential negligible benefits and likely large harms. Evidence suggests that health care providers should also consider shared decision making as a way to incorporate their patients' values into treatment planning.

### Common dental emergencies [^116DrWcy]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Dental caries, a bacterial disease of teeth characterized by destruction of enamel and dentine, is often the underlying cause of dental pain. When a carious lesion impinges on the dental pulp, pulpitis follows and, ultimately, necrosis of the pulp occurs. Untreated necrosis may lead to a localized abscess or a spreading infection into the surrounding soft tissue that results in cellulitis. Immediate treatment involves antibiotic therapy for cellulitis, perhaps with drainage of abscesses, while definitive treatment requires root canal therapy or extraction of the involved tooth. Pericoronitis is an inflammation of the soft tissue overlying a partially erupted tooth. Localized cases respond to irrigation. Secondary cellulitis can develop. Definitive treatment may require surgical extraction of the underlying tooth or excision of the gum flap. Avulsion of a permanent tooth secondary to trauma is a true dental emergency. The tooth should be reimplanted on the spot, and the patient should be seen immediately by a dentist for splinting and antibiotic prophylaxis. Most dental problems can be prevented with regular dental care and steps to minimize risks of oral trauma.

American Dental Association guideline — follow-up, discontinuation, preferences, and safety notes for adjunctive antibiotics with DCDT: "DCDT refers to pulpotomy, pulpectomy, nonsurgical root canal treatment, or incision for drainage abscesses". The panel advises "Clinicians should reevaluate within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call)" and "Dentists should instruct patients to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after their symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d". Among first-line options, "amoxicillin is preferred over penicillin because it is more effective against various gram-negative anaerobes and is associated with lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects". Cautions include "Bacterial resistance rates for azithromycin are higher than for other antibiotics, and clindamycin substantially increases the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile infection even after a single dose", and "clindamycin has a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for Clostridioides difficile infection, which can be fatal". Patients receiving azithromycin "should be instructed to closely monitor their symptoms and call a dentist or primary care provider if their infection worsens while on therapy", and patients should "call their primary care provider if they develop fever, abdominal cramping, or ≥ 3 loose bowel movements/d". The text also notes "If the patient currently is taking an antibiotic within the same spectrum as the one indicated, additional antibiotics do not need to be prescribed. If the patient currently is taking an antibiotic outside of the spectrum as the one indicated, the intended antibiotic still can be prescribed, considering potential contraindications".

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: a 2023 update [^115XqvoZ]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Oral and dental complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) — evaluation by a dentist or oral medicine specialist at 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter may be beneficial, with more frequent dental consultations and screening (every 6 months) for those with a high risk for oral cancer (eg, Fanconi anemia [FA], radiation to head/ neck, refractory cGVHD); oral/ radiologic tooth development assessment for children. Inform regarding preventive oral health, routine dental hygiene, and risks/ symptoms of oral cancer. At each survivorship visit screen for cGVHD by history and again about high-risk habits; head/ neck/ oral exam. Symptoms: dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, pain in the oral cavity. Council to avoid smoking, vaping, and chewing tobacco, decrease regular intake of sugar containing beverages, avoid intraoral piercing, pursue post-HCT human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination. Patients with xerostomia should receive meticulous oral hygiene, undertake preventive measures for dental/ periodontal disease, and aggressive treatment of oral infections. Trauma to oral mucosa should be avoided. Mouthguards may be useful. Avoid medications that can cause or exacerbate xerostomia.

### Dental topics for plastic surgeons, part three: infection and trauma of the dentition [^111doiMm]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Periodontal Disease

Periodontal disease refers to a group of pathologies that affect the supporting tissues of the teeth, namely the gingiva, periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone. Local risk factors include malocclusions, traumatic dental injuries, conditions causing plaque retention, and ectopic tooth eruption. General risk factors include genetic, metabolic, and hematological conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and smoking. High levels of progesterone, stress, substance abuse, vitamin C deficiency, medications (calcium channel blockers, phenytoin, cyclosporine), and immune dysfunction may increase susceptibility to periodontal disease. The main management strategy of periodontal disease is optimizing gingival health, which involves eliminating causative factors, improving oral hygiene to reduce plaque, periodic professional plaque removal, and perhaps surgical recontouring of the affected gingiva. Two of the most common types of periodontal diseases are gingivitis and periodontitis.

Gingivitis (Fig. 6) refers to inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding the teeth, excluding the alveolar ridge, periodontal ligament, and cementum.

FIGURE 6
Gingivitis.

There are many forms of gingivitis and an in-depth discussion is beyond the scope of this paper. However, there are 2 entities worth mentioning. One of the most severe forms of acute gingivitis is acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), also known as Vincent infection or trench mouth (Fig. 7). The most common causative organisms include fusiform bacteria, spirochetes, and gram negative anaerobes such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella species, and Selenomonas species. ANUG is associated with smoking, malnutrition, and stress, and characteristically presents with necrosis and ulceration in areas of pre-existing gingivitis, leading to halitosis, pain, spontaneous hemorrhage, and necrosis. If inadequately treated, ANUG will persist in a cyclic pattern of acute symptoms followed by chronic remission and may eventually spread to the alveolar crest, causing necrotizing periodontitis with bone resorption and gingival recession. In very rare cases, children and adults whom are extremely malnourished may develop an ANUG-like condition called necrotizing ulcerative stomatitis or Noma (Fig. 8). Unlike ANUG that is confined to the periodontium, NOMA may spread to the adjacent soft tissues causing necrosis of the cheeks and/or lips. However, ANUG usually demonstrates quick resolution with appropriate treatment including mechanical debridement, optimal oral hygiene, mouth rinses, and occasionally antimicrobials.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^1131S6Bf]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic safety and patient instructions — immunocompetent adults with pulpal- and periapical-related dental infection: Bacterial resistance rates for azithromycin are higher than for other antibiotics, and clindamycin substantially increases the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile infection even after a single dose; clindamycin has a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for C. difficile infection, which can be fatal. Patients who receive azithromycin should be instructed to closely monitor their symptoms and call a dentist or primary care provider if their infection worsens while receiving therapy, and patients should be instructed to call their primary care provider if they develop fever, abdominal cramping, or 3 loose bowel movements per day. An antibiotic with a similar spectrum of activity to those recommended above can be continued if initiated before treatment, and as with any antibiotic use, the patient should be informed about symptoms that may indicate lack of antibiotic efficacy and adverse drug effects.

### Diagnosis and management of Ludwig's angina: an evidence-based review [^111Cg5qE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ludwig's angina is a potentially deadly condition that must not be missed in the emergency department (ED).

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a summary of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of Ludwig's angina with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

Ludwig's angina is a rapidly spreading infection that involves the floor of the mouth. It occurs more commonly in those with poor dentition or immunosuppression. Patients may have a woody or indurated floor of the mouth with submandibular swelling. Trismus is a late finding. Computed tomography of the neck soft tissue with contrast is preferred if the patient is able to safely leave the ED and can tolerate lying supine. Point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful adjunct, particularly in those who cannot tolerate lying supine. Due to the threat of rapid airway compromise, emergent consultation to anesthesia and otolaryngology, if available, may be helpful if a definitive airway is required. The first line approach for airway intervention in the ED is flexible intubating endoscopy with preparation for a surgical airway. Broad spectrum antibiotics and surgical source control are keys in treating the infection. These patients should then be admitted to the intensive care unit for close airway observation.

Conclusion

Ludwig's angina is a life-threatening condition that all emergency clinicians need to consider. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

American Dental Association antibiotic guideline — Question 4 scope and evidence basis for SIP with or without SAP: The question asks, for immunocompetent adults with SIP with or without SAP, whether to recommend the use versus nonuse of oral systemic antibiotics as adjuncts to DCDT to improve health outcomes. The panel did not identify any studies specific to patients with SIP with or without SAP who have immediate access to DCDT, used the same body of evidence used for Question 3, and rated down the certainty owing to serious issues of indirectness due to differing patient populations, resulting in very low certainty. For undesirable effects, the panel used the same body of observational evidence summarized above to inform harms. For values and preferences, one additional consideration was that removing the pulp tissue by means of DCDT may alleviate symptoms, and the panel hypothesized these procedures may reduce patients' expectations for receiving antibiotics.

### Jaw osteomyelitis [^113xQsB5]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Mandibular osteomyelitis is caused most commonly by members of the oral flora in the setting of dental infection or dental manipulation, often in patients with underlying mandible pathology. Recognizing and treating mandible infections is especially challenging when they are associated with osteonecrotic conditions that are themselves difficult to manage and that may be associated with symptoms and testing results that mimic infection. Optimized diagnosis and management of mandible infections require collaboration between specialists in surgical and medical aspects of care, with the goal of clearing or controlling infection while maximizing function.

### Common dental infections in the primary care setting [^114RrXib]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Family physicians commonly encounter patients with dental infections, such as dental caries and periodontal disease. Dental caries is caused by bacteria that destroy the enamel and dentin; it can be detected by an oral examination that shows stained pits or fissures on the tooth surface. Use of fluoride is the most effective prevention measure for dental caries. Untreated caries may progress to pulpitis and, eventually, to necrosis of the pulp. In irreversible pulpitis, the tooth dies and the patient may have a localized abscess that can spread to surrounding tissue. Periodontal infections are caused by bacteria in the subgingival dental plaque. In gingivitis, the inflamed gums bleed easily with brushing or flossing; the condition can be controlled with good oral hygiene. Periodontitis is characterized by a loss of supportive bone structure caused by chronic gingivitis; it is also associated with some systemic diseases. Localized periodontitis is treated with mechanical debridement and good oral hygiene, whereas generalized periodontitis requires adjunct antibiotic therapy. Pericoronitis results when food particles become trapped under the gum of an impacted tooth. This condition can be controlled by removal of food debris and good oral hygiene. For patients in whom dental infections are disseminated and have invaded the deeper oral spaces, antibiotic treatment should be initiated at the time of referral.

### Periapical lucency around the tooth: radiologic evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116dAGm8]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

Periapical lucencies are often seen incidentally at head and neck imaging studies performed for indications not related to the teeth. These lesions are, however, occasionally manifestations of diseases that have a wide range of effects and may at times represent the source of symptoms that prompted the study. The vast majority of periapical lucencies are the result of apical periodontal or pulpal disease. If found in an advanced state or left untreated, disease related to the tooth may spread to adjacent tissues, including the sinuses, orbits, deep fascial spaces of the neck, and intracranial structures, and result in a significant increase in patient morbidity and mortality. Although the majority of periapical lucencies seen on radiographs and computed tomographic images occur secondary to apical periodontal or pulpal disease, not all lucencies near the tooth root are due to infection. Lucency near the tooth root may be seen in the setting of other diseases of odontogenic and non-odontogenic origin, including neoplasms. Although imaging findings for these lesions can include periapical lucent components, awareness of the varied secondary imaging features can aid the radiologist in developing an accurate differential diagnosis. Familiarity with the imaging features and differential diagnoses of diseases or conditions that cause lucency around the tooth root results in appropriate referral and prompt diagnosis, management, and treatment, and can prevent unnecessary additional imaging or intervention. In addition, early recognition and appropriate treatment of infectious processes will result in improved clinical outcomes and a decrease in morbidity and mortality.

### Autosensitization dermatitis: a case of rosacea-like id reaction [^114NACpw]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, all previous reported cases of rosacea-like id reactions triggered by dental sources have been associated with frank dental abscesses and visible periodontal disease that were noted on examination in the mouth and in most cases treated by drainage or removal of dentition and thus the nidus of infection. In this case, there was no obvious site of infection identified, and throughout continued rosacea symptoms over the course of a year and a half, the patient never reported any dental symptoms or informed any of her providers that she had false teeth. This illustrates the importance of considering rosacea-like id reactions in the differential diagnosis and obtaining an oral/dental history in addition to oral examination in patients with refractory cases of rosacea. Furthermore, in patients who have false teeth or history of similar dental work, even in cases in which they may be asymptomatic and not have obvious oral lesions, the possibility of subclinical oral infections should be considered, as patients may benefit from treatment options that include coverage for oral anaerobes.

### Odontogenic orofacial infections [^113bNp7S]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute dental abscess is a frequent and sometimes underestimated disease of the oral cavity. The acute dental abscess usually occurs secondary to caries, trauma, or failed endodontic treatment. After the intact pulp chamber is opened, colonization of the root canals takes place with a variable set of anaerobic bacteria, which colonize the walls of the necrotic root canals forming a specialized mixed anaerobic biofilm. Asymptomatic necrosis is common. However, abscess formation occurs when these bacteria and their toxic products breach into the periapical tissues through the apical foramen and induce acute inflammation and pus formation. The main signs and symptoms of the acute dental abscess (often referred to as a periapical abscess or infection) are pain, swelling, erythema, and suppuration usually localized to the affected tooth, even if the abscess can eventually spread causing a severe odontogenic infection which is characterized by local and systemic involvement culminating in sepsis syndrome. The vast majority of dental abscesses respond to antibiotic treatment, however, in some patients surgical management of the infection may be indicated. In the present work, a retrospective analysis of the patients with dental orofacial infections referred to the Unit of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Verona from 1991 to 2011 has been performed.

### Case of a cerebral abscess caused byin a subject with periodontitis [^113xqoXf]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Brain abscesses of odontogenic origin are rarely seen and account for only a small fraction of all reported cerebral abscesses. The incidence of cerebral abscesses ranges from 0.4 to 0.9 cases per 100 000 people and is more frequent in immunocompromised patients. Oral pathogens cause 3–10% of abscesses, while other causative pathogens are non-oral bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi or parasites. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Contiguous spread of a pathogen is the most frequent route of infection. Haematogenous or lymphatic dissemination is seen in a limited number of cases. The initial presentation, symptoms and results from clinical and radiological investigations vary widely and are non-specific for the causative pathogen. Morbidity and mortality have improved in recent years due to better imaging techniques and therapeutic options. Mortality ranges from 0 to 24% for odontogenic brain abscesses. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative oral pathogen, has rarely been reported in subjects with cerebral abscess formation, but has been widely associated with periodontitis. Its pathogenesis is still being investigated, but includes a wide variety of immunological escape mechanisms.

We searched databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane library) and manually searched reference lists for relevant articles and related cases. Well-accepted reviews served as the foundation for this article. Additional original articles were selected by reading the abstract and obtaining the full text when needed. Search terms included: brain abscess, cerebral abscess, P. gingivalis, odontogenic, periodontitis, parodontitis, tooth infection and oral pathogen. Five articles were selected that discussed intracranial abscess formation by P. gingivalis.

Question 3: Which of the following is true regarding the prognosis of this condition?
A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting
B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80%
C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases
D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed
E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50%

Answers:

A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting – Incorrect. This refers to the prognosis of erysipelas, which is usually managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Importantly, hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics may be considered in severe cases affecting those who are immunocompromised, infants, and the elderly.
B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80% – Incorrect. There are 4 widely recognized types of KS; however, they differ in epidemiology and prognosis. The 5-year relative survival rate for KS, which compares people with the same type and stage of KS to people in the overall population, is 80%.
C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases – Incorrect. The prognosis described here is in reference to angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Although spontaneous regression may occasionally occur, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia tends to persist for years, with recurrence after treatment in more than 40% of cases. Early age of onset, long disease duration, multiple lesions, and symptomatic disease have been associated with higher recurrence rates.
D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed – Incorrect. Cutaneous dental sinus tract is frequently misdiagnosed due to its rarity of occurrence and lack of associated symptoms. Once diagnosed, however, definitive treatment through oral therapy to eliminate the source of infection, whether it is through endodontic treatment or extraction, is effective and provides a cure.
E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50% – Correct. Angiosarcomas make up less than 1% of all sarcomas, with approximately 2 to 3 new cases per 1 million diagnoses yearly. Importantly, many angiosarcomas are highly aggressive, with a 5-year survival between 10% and 50% and a median overall survival ranging from 30 to 50 months. The clinical variability of these tumors contributes to delayed diagnosis, and that, coupled with their genetic heterogeneity, makes them difficult to treat. Surgical excision with wide margins is considered the mainstay of therapy in localized disease; however, the infiltrative and satellite foci often lead to difficulty in obtaining negative margins and frequent local recurrences. Thus, a multimodal approach, which often includes radiation, is often necessary. Our patient was treated with wide local excision followed by adjuvant radiation given positive margins. He remains without evidence of disease at 2 years.

### Community-associated outbreak of COVID-19 in a correctional facility-Utah, September 2020-January 2021 [^117LGQUD]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SARS-CoV-2 might have been introduced into correctional facility A by DHCP1 or other staff members with community-acquired infection. The detection of 46 cases just 11 days after the first potential introduction by DHCP1 suggests that infection spread quickly. Infection might also have spread through undetected chains of transmission from staff members working in block 1 to other areas, especially because N95 respirators and eye protection were not usually worn before September 23, 2020.

The possibility of transmission from staff members to incarcerated persons at facility A indicates a need for serial testing for both staff members and incarcerated persons, as well as careful attention to infection control guidance, including in health care settings, where dental treatment is provided, and in correctional settings. Screening of nonfacility HCPs with rapid antigen tests, testing incarcerated persons 5–7 days after receiving treatment from nonfacility HCPs, or stopping nonemergency procedures requiring nonfacility staff members could all be considered to reduce introduction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Ten incarcerated persons were exposed to the index patient (DHCP1) on the date of the index patient's symptom onset and were not immediately quarantined or isolated; two of 10 appeared to be infected by DHCP1. The interval between patient R2's exposure to R1 (his roommate) and R1's symptom onset (September 14–21, 2020), suggests a mean 3.5-day incubation for these cases, consistent with previous estimates. Although only surgical tooth extractions resulted in 15-minute (the longest) exposures to DHCP1, other procedures that require manipulation or prolonged close contact with a patient's eyes, nose, or mouth might pose a higher risk for transmission during a shorter time frame. A COVID-19 outbreak among nursing home residents after receiving dental treatment was also reported in New York.

### Preventing, identifying, and managing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: a practical guide for nurses and other allied healthcare professionals [^116wkApe]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical management of MRONJ

If MRONJ is suspected, the patient should be referred to either an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or a specialist oncology center with experience of MRONJ. In the interim, a 0.12% chlorhexidine mouth rinse and/or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid 500/125 mg three times daily can be prescribed by a dentist or other qualified healthcare professional to treat any related infection (Fig. 2). Patients should be reassured that if MRONJ is diagnosed, the condition is treatable. They should be advised that the oral and maxillofacial surgeon will discuss the treatment options with them, and that this treatment may include surgery.

The AAOMS position paper has assigned treatment strategies according to the stage of MRONJ, the goals of which are to prioritize and support continued oncologic treatment and preserve quality of life through patient education and reassurance, and to control infection, progression of bone necrosis, and pain. For the initial treatment of MRONJ, the MASCC/ISOO/ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend non-surgical treatments, such as antimicrobial mouth rinses, effective oral hygiene, antibiotics if clinically indicated (i.e. when signs and symptoms of infection are present), and conservative surgical procedures, followed by aggressive surgical interventions for refractory cases. Notably, longer exposure time to bisphosphonates and more advanced stages of MRONJ significantly reduce MRONJ healing rates with non-surgical treatments; therefore, it is important to identify and treat MRONJ early. While non-surgical interventions may be appropriate or necessary in certain situations (for example, if the aim of therapy is a reduction of symptoms, or if the patient has no symptoms, or has severe symptoms but does not qualify for surgery), mucosal healing is rarely achieved with non-surgical treatments alone, and with regard to this outcome, surgery may be more effective.

### Odontogenic sinusitis: current concepts in diagnosis and treatment [^115RBXVU]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Odontogenic sinusitis is a unique cause of sinus disease that deserves special consideration. An astute clinician can elicit historical findings such as recent dental work, and symptoms such as unilateral facial pain and foul drainage, despite a relatively benign oral cavity examination. Otolaryngologists and dental professionals who care for these patients must be able to interpret imaging studies for dental disorder such as periapical abscesses and periodontal disease. Treatment is frequently some combination of antibiotic therapy, dental procedures, and endoscopic sinus surgery. More prospective studies are needed to determine the best approach to caring for this patient population.

### Preventing, identifying, and managing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: a practical guide for nurses and other allied healthcare professionals [^112PbHH9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

An example of MRONJ before and after treatment (i.e. healthy tissue) is shown (Fig. 1b, c). MRONJ is staged from "at risk" to stages 0–3 (Table 1). The signs and symptoms of MRONJ, which can result in difficulties with chewing, eating, and speaking, may include the following: exposed necrotic bone; sinus fistula; signs of infection (e.g. recurrent abscesses, localized bone pain, and bone/gum swelling); bad breath; loose teeth; fracture of the jaw; maxillary sinus pain; and lower lip/chin numbness/heaviness (Fig. 1d). With the exclusion of exposed necrotic bone, these signs/symptoms may also be caused by dental or other jawbone diseases, which should be excluded before suspecting MRONJ. Jaw pain was reported in over three-quarters of patients who developed MRONJ in an integrated analysis of data from 5723 patients with bone metastases associated with solid tumors/multiple myeloma (MM) in three phase 3 trials of high-dose denosumab or zoledronic acid. Oral infections associated with tooth extractions were reported for nearly one-half of patients with MRONJ. The most common site of MRONJ was the mandible (less frequently in the maxilla). In a small number of patients (< 5%), MRONJ was observed in both locations.

To enable early detection of MRONJ, nurses can proactively ask "Are there any areas of soreness, numbness or signs of damage in your mouth?" Patients should be prompted to report symptoms such as difficulty with eating and/or speaking. If in doubt, nurses should discuss possible signs and symptoms of MRONJ with the treating physician/dentist, and the patient can be referred to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or an experienced oral oncology center.

### Control and prevention of anthrax, Texas, USA, 2019 [^117WCa66]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Cutaneous anthrax lacking systemic manifestations such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, leukocytosis, or leukopenia can usually be treated with 7 days of an oral antibiotic. Patients with cutaneous anthrax should only continue oral antibiotics for PEP after antibiotic treatment is complete if the patient was also exposed to aerosolized spores; this would rarely be indicated for naturally acquired cutaneous infections because aerosol exposures are unlikely (Table 1).

Systemically ill patients should be evaluated for meningitis; if meningitis can be ruled out, they should be treated with at least 2 intravenous antibiotics (1 that is bactericidal and 1 that inhibits protein synthesis to block toxin production). Antibiotic therapy should continue for > 2 weeks or until the patient is stable. If meningitis is present, > 3 antibiotics should be used (> 1 should be bactericidal, > 1 should inhibit protein synthesis, and all should have good central nervous system penetration). Antibiotic options for treatment and prevention of anthrax are listed in Tables 1 and 3.

Table 3
Intravenous antimicrobials for treatment of adults with severe anthrax*

*Bold type indicates preferred agent. Nonbolded type indicates alternative selections, which are listed in order of preference for therapy for patients who cannot tolerate first-line therapy or if first-line therapy is unavailable.
†Severe anthrax includes anthrax meningitis, inhalation, injection, and gastrointestinal anthrax; and cutaneous anthrax with systemic involvement, extensive edema, or lesions of the head or neck.
‡Increased risk for seizures associated with imipenem/cilastatin therapy.
§Linezolid should be used with caution in patients with thrombocytopenia because it might exacerbate it. Linezolid use for > 14 d carries additional risk for hematopoietic toxicity.
¶A single 10–14 d course of doxycycline is not routinely associated with tooth-staining.
# Rifampin is not a protein synthesis inhibitor, it may also be used in combination therapy based on in vitro synergy.
Should only be used if other options are not available, due to toxicity concerns.

Systemically ill patients (whether from cutaneous, ingestion, inhalation, or injection exposures) are candidates for 1 of the Food and Drug Administration–approved anthrax antitoxins. The antitoxins are available through the Strategic National Stockpile pending a consultation with an anthrax subject matter expert at CDC, which can be reached by calling the Emergency Operations Center (770–488–7100).

Surgery might occasionally be indicated for lesions complicated by compartment syndrome. However, surgery usually is not necessary for cutaneous anthrax.

### Efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of Sjögren's syndrome [^113szE6d]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current evidence on the therapeutic management of primary-2002 SjS patients is based on 9 RCTs (only four including ≥ 100 patients randomised to drug/PLA), 18 prospective cohort studies (all including ≤ 30 patients per study) and 5 case-control studies.

For oral topical therapies, available evidence is limited to five studies carried out in SjS patients (only one in primary-2002 patients) and one Cochrane SLR that assessed the management of dry mouth. Xerostomia is a subjective symptom with wide interindividual variation, and a satisfactory output of unstimulated whole saliva in one patient may lead another to complain of symptoms of dry mouth. All studies have shown significant within-group improvement in comparison with baseline subjective oral outcomes. Mechanical stimulation (chewing gum) was associated with increased saliva production in patients with residual capacity, but there is no evidence that gum may have more or less efficacy than saliva substitutes in reducing dry mouth symptoms. Due to the wide range of interventions, small trials (mean of 45 participants per trial), the RoB and the range of outcome measures for oral dryness, there is no strong evidence to support any specific intervention over another, and the conclusion is that, in the absence of an effective topical treatment, we recommend that the treatment of xerostomia should be directed towards improving patients' complaints rather than increasing saliva production, including improvements in tooth health and the prevention of oral infections. The cost of long-term topical therapy is another important consideration, but there are no available studies on this issue. Other therapeutic interventions are under investigation. A recent double-blind, crossover-design study has evaluated the effects of intraoral electrostimulation, and further studies in primary-2002 patients are required to make a specific recommendation on its use.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^113Rsgsp]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Community-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (C. difficile) outcomes with systemic antibiotic exposure — burden, mortality, and hospitalizations are quantified as follows: Of estimated community-associated C. difficile infections in 2011, approximately 64% were exposed to antibiotics, representing 102,409 of 159,700 cases (95% CI, 85,056 to 119,040). In 2011, approximately 2,000 of 159,700 people with community-associated C. difficile infection died within 30 d of diagnosis (95% CI, 1,200 to 2,800), and with approximately 64% exposed to antibiotics, 1,280 deaths were due to community-associated C. difficile infection related to exposure to antibiotics (95% CI, 768 to 1,792), which represents a 0.8% mortality rate due to community-associated C. difficile infection related to exposure to antibiotics. Approximately 12.7% were admitted to hospital for community-associated C. difficile infection, representing 20,287 (95% CI, 16,878 to 23,622) of 159,700 total cases.

Dental health

Endodontic infections

Children and adult patients with XLH might present with spontaneous endodontic infections on apparently intact teeth. Dental abscesses can develop on deciduous as well as on permanent teeth. The endodontic infection might be asymptomatic for months or years or it might evolve into dental abscesses, causing pain and swelling. Spread to surrounding anatomical structures causes maxillofacial cellulitis.

Dental complications in patients with XLH are secondary to poorly mineralized dentin. On dental radiographs, the pulp chambers of deciduous or permanent teeth are larger than usual with long pulp horns extending to the dentino–enamel junction. XLH is not associated with increased susceptibility to caries.

Periodontitis

The frequency and severity of periodontitis is increased in adult patients with XLH and can lead to tooth loss. Cementum thickness, a central component of the periodontium, is reduced and associated with mineralization defects of the alveolar bone, which impairs the attachment of the ligament fibres. On radiographs from adult patients, the lamina dura might be absent and the alveolar bone around teeth is frequently reduced.

Dry mouth and sicca syndrome

Dry mouth (or xerostomia) may occur as a separate irAE, or it may be a symptom of another irAE such as ICI-induced sicca syndrome. Dry mouth may also be linked to infections such as oral candidiasis — this is of particular concern in patients treated with ICIs, since oral corticosteroid use (commonly used to combat some ICI toxicities) is a risk factor for oral candidiasis. Dry mouth may be the cause of complications including infection and dental pathologies, including the loss of teeth, in severe cases of sicca syndrome. For this reason, it is important to account for the possibility of infection during diagnosis and monitoring. A systematic review determined that many clinical trials did not report the overall incidence of dry mouth, but that incidence varies from 3%–24% depending on the study. For initial management of dry mouth or painful sores, oral rinses with doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash (sometimes called 'magic mouthwash') have been shown to reduce radiotherapy-related mucositis pain, but data are lacking on their efficacy in ICI-treated patients. Sialogogue therapy, cevimeline, pilocarpine, or other systemic acetylcholinergic agents have been anecdotally reported as helpful when symptoms are persistent and bothersome and refractory to topical mouth rinses.

ICI-induced sicca syndrome may feature severe symptoms, including dry eyes and dry mouth. Sicca accompanied by true Sjögren syndrome (typically with the presence of ANAs, anti-Ro, and/or anti-La antibodies) is rare, occurring at a rate of < 1% in a registry study of grade ≥ 2 irAEs. The median time to onset of dry mouth, indicative of sicca syndrome, is 70 days. Patients who develop sicca syndrome often do not experience full resolution of their symptoms, and they may require long-term care for salivary hypofunction as well as being at risk for loss of teeth.

What should I avoid while getting IMLYGIC?

IMLYGIC virus can spread to other areas of your body or to your close contacts (household members, caregivers, sex partners, or persons sharing the same bed).

Do the following to avoid spreading IMLYGIC to other areas of your body or to your close contacts:

Avoid direct contact between your treatment sites, dressings, or body fluids and close contacts (for example, use condoms when engaging in sexual activity, avoid kissing close contacts if either has an open mouth sore).
Wear gloves while putting on or changing your dressings.
Keep treatment sites covered with airtight and watertight dressings for at least 1 week after each treatment (or longer if the treatment site is weeping or oozing).
If the dressing comes loose or falls off, replace it right away with a clean dressing.
Place all used dressings and cleaning materials in a sealed plastic bag and throw them away in the garbage.
Do not touch or scratch the treatment sites.

What are possible side effects of IMLYGIC?

The most common side effects of IMLYGIC include:

Tiredness
Chills
Fever
Nausea
Flu-like symptoms

### MRSA infection of masticatory spaces in a paediatric patient [^1121dSVH]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of source of maxillofacial infection in paediatric patients can be challenging due to difficulty in eliciting a proper history and multiple potential sources of infection. Identification and removal of the nidus of infection with decompression and institution of antibiotic therapy as per the culture-sensitivity report form the mainstay treatment of the infection. Deviation from it may result in persistence or even progression of infection, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. In the past decade, the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in the oral cavity has seen an upward trend. This has further led to an increase in complexity in the diagnosis of maxillofacial infections. In this case, the authors want to bring to light the challenges faced in managing a paediatric patient with persistent fascial space infection even after removal of the offending tooth, which signifies the importance of managing the infection by the time-tested protocol.

### Postextraction mucormycosis in immunocompromised-patient management and review of literature [^116pbVY8]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Mucormycosis is an uncommon aggressive, opportunistic infection that can produce widespread orofacial tissue necrosis. This primarily affects immunocompromised individuals. It is the deadliest and most rapidly progressing type of human-affecting fungal infection. The aim of the study is to investigate the diagnostic criteria and treatment approach in 10 cases of mucormycosis in the author's institute from 2008 to 2019. Moreover, a review of the English literature presents all cases of mucormycosis after tooth extraction.

Materials and Methods

Ten patients at our institute have been treated. They were evaluated and discussed as per their diagnostic criteria, surgical treatment, and mortality rates.

Results

All 10 immunocompromised patients had a primary hematologic malignancy. The criteria for a positive diagnosis were clinical symptoms and a biopsy for microbiological culture and histologic analysis. Each patient was subjected to vigorous surgical resection and underwent antifungal treatment. Seven patients died because of their main disease. Owing to the unregulated spread of mucormycosis, 2 patients died. Four cases were diagnosed after maxillary tooth extraction.

Conclusions

The most important factor for patient survival tends to be the management of the underlying disease with early detection and active surgical and antifungal action. Four of 10 cases diagnosed with mucormycosis appeared after tooth extraction, a relatively high number compared with the literature. Therefore, it is the dental profession's obligation to be familiar with the possibility of the potentially severe and possibly fatal complication.

### The acute orbit: etiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^114y8foB]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Extension of dental abscesses to distant areas of the head and neck has been repeatedly reported in the medical literature. Subsequent involvement of the orbit still remains a rarity, resulting in protracted onset of therapy because of inaccurate diagnosis. Considering the possible lasting damage that can result from insufficient therapy, like blindness or even death, the need to extensively educate practicing physicians becomes evident.

Materials and Methods

With the help of a comprehensive review of the medical literature underlined with a clinical case, the etiology, diagnosis, and therapy of the acute orbit are highlighted with emphasis on the new imaging modalities as well as the broad spectrum antibiotics currently available on the market.

Results

Orbital infections of odontogenic origin are the rarest sequelae, with a prevalence of 1.3%. Correct diagnosis, adequate antibiotic therapy, and surgical drainage are the keys to success.

Conclusion

The acute orbit continues to be a medical challenge. With the proposed diagnostic and therapy guidelines, this affliction can be identified and contained with a high degree of certainty.

The global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is increasingly becoming a major challenge in clinical and public health settings. To date, the treatment for serious CRE infections remains difficult. The intelligent use of antimicrobials and effective infection control strategies is crucial to prevent further CRE spread. Early consultation with experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms is valuable in patient management. This brief review will focus on the current, yet limited, treatment options for CRE infections.

### Complicated odontogenic sinusitis: extrasinus infectious spread [^112qfi2E]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Odontogenic sinusitis (ODS) is a common cause of orbital, intracranial, and osseous infectious extrasinus complications. Dental infections can spread to the orbital or intracranial spaces though the sinuses via thrombophlebitis or direct extension, or from the dentition or oral cavity via vascular channels in the maxillary alveolar bone. ODS typically presents with unilateral involvement both clinically and radiographically. Any suspicion for extrasinus spread based on history and physical examination should be followed by appropriate imaging, formal dental evaluation, and, when appropriate, ophthalmology and neurosurgery consultations. This multidisciplinary approach ensures appropriate management of both the acute orbital and intracranial complications.

### Radiolucent lesions of the mandible: a pattern-based approach to diagnosis [^116jCimT]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Radiolucent lesions with well-defined borders

Radicular cyst

Odontogenic cysts are true cysts arising from the epithelium left over from tooth development. Radicular cysts, also called periapical cysts or apical periodontal cysts, are the most common odontogenic cysts. Tooth infection may lead to necrosis of the pulp cavity and may spread to the tooth apex with ulterior development of a periapical granuloma or periapical abscess. The latter may subsequently give rise to a radicular cyst. Radicular cysts arise from epithelial cell rests of the periodontal ligament, which are stimulated by the inflammatory products. Most often, radicular cysts are asymptomatic. They may be seen in all age groups, however, more often between 30 and 60 years of age and are typically associated with a non-vital tooth. Imaging features are straightforward and include a unilocular periapical lesion with well-defined, sclerotic borders in close vicinity of the apical portion of the root of a non-vital tooth. No contrast material enhancement is seen on CT or MRI. In atypical cases with latero-dental location, CT or CBCT is very helpful for the correct diagnosis (Fig. 1). Treatment options include apical surgery, tooth extraction and endodontic treatment.

### Open versus closed surgical exposure of canine teeth that are displaced in the roof of the mouth [^1115kY8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Palatally displaced canines or PDCs are upper permanent canines, commonly known as 'eye' teeth, that are displaced in the roof of the mouth. This can leave unsightly gaps, cause damage to the surrounding roots (which can be so severe that neighbouring teeth are lost or have to be removed) and, occasionally, result in the development of cysts. PDCs are a frequent dental anomaly, present in 2% to 3% of young people. Management of this problem is both time consuming and expensive. It involves surgical exposure (uncovering) followed by fixed braces for two to three years to bring the canine into alignment within the dental arch. Two techniques for exposing palatal canines are routinely used in the UK: the closed technique and the open technique. The closed technique involves uncovering the canine, attaching an eyelet and gold chain and then suturing the palatal mucosa back over the tooth. The tooth is then moved into position covered by the palatal mucosa. The open technique involves uncovering the canine tooth and removing the overlying palatal tissue to leave it uncovered. The orthodontist can then see the crown of the canine to align it.

Objectives

To assess the effects of using either an open or closed surgical method to expose canines that have become displaced in the roof of the mouth, in terms of success and other clinical and patient-reported outcomes.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 February 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 February 2017), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 February 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing young people receiving surgical treatment to correct upper PDCs. There was no restriction on age, presenting malocclusion or type of active orthodontic treatment undertaken. We included unilaterally and bilaterally displaced canines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing data or clarification where feasible. We followed statistical guidelines from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for data synthesis.

Main Results

We included three studies, involving 146 participants. Two studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias. The main finding of the review was that the two techniques may be equally successful at exposing PDCs (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.06; three studies, 141 participants analysed, low-quality evidence). One surgical failure was due to detachment of the gold chain (closed group). One study reported on complications following surgery and found two in the closed group: a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate. We were unable to pool data for dental aesthetics, patient-reported pain and discomfort, periodontal health and treatment time; however, individual studies did not find any differences between the surgical techniques (low- to very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, the evidence suggests that neither the open or closed surgical technique for exposing palatally displaced maxillary canine teeth is superior for any of the outcomes included in this review; however, we considered the evidence to be low quality, with two of the three included studies being at high risk of bias. This suggests the need for more high-quality studies. Three ongoing clinical trials have been identified and it is hoped that these will produce data that can be pooled to increase the degree of certainty in these findings.

Knowledge of the management of infections of the deep spaces of the neck is essential to the daily practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Timely decisions must be made through the acute course of the disease. Interventions must be performed with the appropriate surgical skill. The surgeon must decide on medical and surgical management, including antibiotic selection, how to employ supportive resuscitative care, when to operate, what procedures to perform, and how to secure the airway. To make these decisions the surgeon must understand the anatomy of the region and the etiology of infection, appropriate diagnostic workup, and medical and surgical management. This article provides a review of these pertinent topics.

The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect". For implications of strong versus conditional recommendations, patients: strong — "Most patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; patients: conditional — "Most patients in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". Clinicians: strong — "Most patients should receive the intervention. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator"; clinicians: conditional — "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that the clinician must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". Policy makers: strong — "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations"; policy makers: conditional — "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders".

### Should prophylactic antibiotics be used for patients having removal of erupted teeth? [^114qZXLk]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Generally, antibiotics should not be required before the removal of erupted carious or periodontally involved teeth unless a significant risk of postoperative infection is present. The decision to use prophylactic antibiotics in noninfected cases should also be based on whether patients have any significant medical risk factors that could adversely affect their humoral and cellular defense mechanisms, and whether any systemic risks are associated with the bacteremia that accompanies tooth extraction. This article discusses the various indications for using prophylactic antibiotics in patients having erupted teeth extracted based on a consideration of these factors.

### Surgical techniques for the removal of mandibular wisdom teeth [^117W6mzf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The surgical removal of mandibular wisdom teeth is one of the most common operations undertaken in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The most common indication for surgery is infection about a partially erupted tooth that is impacted against bone or soft tissues. Other indications include unrestorable caries, pulpal and periapical pathology, fracture of the tooth and cyst development, amongst others. Most commonly the benefits of surgical removal of a wisdom tooth include alleviation of the symptoms and signs of pericoronitis and its potential consequences. However, surgery is frequently associated with postoperative pain, swelling and trismus. Less commonly complications include infection, including dry socket, trigeminal nerve injuries and rarely fracture of the mandible.

Objectives

To compare the relative benefits and risks of different techniques for undertaking various aspects or stages of the surgical extraction of mandibular wisdom teeth.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 March 2014), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 21 March 2014) and EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 21 March 2014). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication in the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing surgical techniques for removal of mandibular wisdom teeth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors conducted assessment of relevance, risk of bias and data extraction. Study authors were contacted for additional information. RRs were used for dichotomous data and MDs for continuous data, unless the event rate was very low and Peto ORs were used. The pairing of the split-mouth studies was taken into account in the analysis for both dichotomous and continuous outcomes, and parallel group and split-mouth studies were combined using the generic inverse variance method. Random-effects models were used provided there were more than three studies (fixed-effect models otherwise).

Main Results

A total of 35 trials (2569 patients) were included. The interventions under consideration fell into seven broad categories, with many comparisons including only a small number of trials. Twenty-one of the trials were assessed at high risk of bias, the remaining 14 as unclear. The results are described in the summary of findings tables. Triangular flaps were associated with a 71% reduction in alveolar osteitis at one week (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.78; three trials, moderate quality) and reduction in pain at 24 hours (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10; two trials, moderate quality) compared with envelope flaps. There was no evidence of a difference in overall infection rates, in maximum mouth opening or in permanent sensation. However, there was some evidence that residual swelling after one week was slightly increased in the triangular flap groups compared to envelope flap types (MD 0.66 mm, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.07; two trials, low quality). We found no data on temporary sensation, or adverse events. There was low quality evidence from two studies, looking at the use of a retractor during third molar surgery, to indicate more cases of temporary altered sensation (up to one month) when a retractor was used (Peto OR 5.19, 95% CI 1.38 to 19.49; two trials, low quality). One study reported that this did not persist for more than six months in either group. We found no data for use of a retractor on other primary outcomes or adverse effects (including fracture of the mandible). Due to the small number of studies, the different comparisons evaluated, the variable outcomes reported and the paucity of useful data for all primary outcomes we were not able to draw any conclusions concerning bone removal in third molar surgery. There was insufficient evidence from single studies of very low quality on irrigation method (manual versus mechanical) or irrigation volume (low or high) to determine whether there were differences or not for the outcomes of alveolar osteitis or postoperative infection. We found no data for any of the other primary outcomes. There was insufficient evidence (low to very low quality) that any wound closure technique (primary versus secondary) was superior to another for the outcomes of alveolar osteitis, postoperative infection or maximum mouth opening achieved after seven days, or reactionary bleeding. There was evidence that secondary wound closure was associated with reduced pain at 24 hours (MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.24; four trials, moderate quality) and slightly reduced swelling after one week (MD 0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.57; seven trials, moderate quality). We found no data on other primary outcomes. There was some evidence that the use of a surgical drain was associated with less postoperative swelling (MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.19; five trials, moderate quality) and greater maximum mouth opening one week after surgery (MD 3.72 mm, 95% CI 2.84 to 4.59; two trials, moderate quality). There was insufficient evidence from a single study (low quality) to determine whether the presence of a drain made any difference to pain at 24 hours postoperation. There were no data for the other primary outcomes. Although two RCTs compared coronectomy with complete extraction, flaws in the design and the unit of analysis of these studies meant that there were no reliable data available for inclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

The thirty-five included trials looked at a range of different surgical techniques. The comparisons related to seven broad aspects of the surgical procedures for impacted mandibular third molars: type of surgical flap raised, use of retractors, techniques for bone removal, wound irrigation, wound closure, wound drainage, and complete/incomplete tooth removal. The quality of the body of evidence for each of these comparisons was very low to moderate due to the small number of trials and patients, and the majority of the trials being at high risk of bias (65%) with the remainder at unclear risk of bias. The evidence for making changes to surgical practice is therefore limited. However, it is useful to describe the state of the research evidence supporting practice so that surgeons can make an informed choice in adopting new techniques, or continuing with established techniques.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals with suspected untreated head lice, and their household contacts, from entering the family-centered residential facility until they have received a medical evaluation. If medical evaluation rules out head lice, allow the individual to enter the facility. If medical evaluation confirms head lice, the individual should undergo treatment as recommended by a licensed clinician. Once treatment is complete, the individual may enter the facility. Encourage bedmates of individuals with confirmed head lice to also be treated for having head lice, even if they do not have symptoms. Instruct guests and family members to keep the affected individual's personal items (e.g. combs, brushes, hats, and pillows) inside their private room.
Refer any guest who develops symptoms of head lice for medical evaluation. Restrict the symptomatic individual and their family members to their private room until they have been medically evaluated and confirmed to not have head lice. If they are confirmed to have head lice, follow the recommendations above.
Launder bed linens with water that is hotter than 130° F
Thoroughly clean the surfaces in the affected person's room and vacuum the floor and furniture
Place any items that cannot be laundered (e.g. stuffed animals and pillows) in a plastic bag for 2 weeks prior to reuse.

Measles

Background

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection. Measles is spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, sending droplets containing the virus into the air or onto a surface. Infection can occur if someone breathes the air containing the infectious droplets (the virus stays in the air for up to two hours) or touches a contaminated surfaces and then touches their own eyes, noses or mouths. Measles commonly presents with symptoms of fever, cough, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and a red rash that begins on the face then spreads to the entire body. The measles virus (rubeola) can also cause ear infections, pneumonia, croup, hepatitis, encephalitis, and diarrhea.

Individuals are contagious from 4 days before the onset of rash through 4 days after the rash appears.

Measles remains a leading cause of childhood disease and death globally. Outbreaks have occurred during the past several years due to importation of disease by travelers and infections in individuals who are immunized incompletely. The measles vaccine is safe and effective and is routinely recommended for all healthy children aged 12 months and older.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^1159NmEu]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Prophylaxis

Conventional treatment improves dentin mineralization, reduces the number of dental abscesses and decreases the frequency and severity of periodontitis, (Box 10). Reducing the size of the pulp chambers, as demonstrated by dental radiographs, is a useful sign of successful treatment. Continued supplementation through adulthood may be beneficial, as the number of dental abscesses and severity of periodontitis vary according to the percentage of adult life with treatment.

To prevent bacterial invasion of the dentin and pulp via enamel microcracks, we suggest sealing the occlusal surfaces of both deciduous and permanent teeth in children with XLH. This approach can be achieved with flowable resin composite placed in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surface and should be performed regularly as soon as the eruption of the tooth allows acceptable isolation of the occlusal surface.

Acute abscesses might require antibiotic treatment depending on the extent and severity of the infection. For deciduous teeth, the decision to extract or treat endodontically will depend on the extent of the infection, recurrence and the expected timing of normal exfoliation of the permanent tooth. For permanent teeth, endodontic treatment or re-treatment of the tooth are the preferred options, although healing after endodontic treatment might not be as favourable as in healthy patients.

Prevention, treatment and supportive care of periodontitis in adult patients should follow standard management, as in the general population. Treatment of periodontitis should aim to decrease gingival inflammation and suppress periodontal pockets. The opportunity to resume or start conventional medical treatment should be discussed in the presence of periodontitis.

Acute thyroiditis — presentation and treatment note that patients are generally euthyroid, though on occasion it presents as destructive thyrotoxicosis, most frequently due to bacterial infection via hematogenous spread or a fistula from an infected pyriform sinus. Therapy involves systemic antibiotics, abscess drainage or removal, and excision or occlusion of the pyriform sinus; thyrotoxicosis should be treated symptomatically with beta-blocking agents, and there is no role for antithyroid drugs.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^115iMCiz]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Ringworm (tinea) management in residential facilities notes that ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungi and ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone who has a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus; it also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat. Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body, with over-the-counter topical medication used for infections on the skin but a prescription medication taken by mouth used to treat infections on the scalp. Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection, and a rash should not be used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks. Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Rampant increase in cases of mucormycosis in India and Pakistan: a serious cause for concern during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [^1123arC3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

ACTION PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS

With the number of mucormycosis cases steadily rising both in India and Pakistan, it is crucial to take steps to help mitigate the outbreak. The Indian Council of Medical Research has recently released an advisory for the effective screening, diagnosis, and management of the disease during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Predisposing conditions for mucormycosis include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, long-term steroid use, prolonged intensive care unit stay, post-transplant patients, and individuals on voriconazole therapy. It is therefore imperative for these patients to exercise caution and be more vigilant by adhering strictly to public health guidelines and advice for COVID-19 as well as for mucormycosis. A few critical acts of prevention, such as 1) using masks when visiting construction sites; 2) wearing shoes, long trousers, long sleeve shirts, and gloves while handling soil, moss, or manure; and 3) maintaining personal hygiene by thorough scrubbing while taking a bath, are all believed to be at the forefront in effectively preventing the spread of mucormycosis infection.

Because mucormycosis has a high propensity to turn fatal if left uncared for, it is important to be aware and not overlook the signs and symptoms of the disease, especially in individuals with COVID-19 and in diabetic and immunosuppressed individuals, for timely diagnosis and treatment. Symptoms such as nasal blockage or congestion, nasal discharge (blackish or bloody), local pain over the cheekbone, unilateral facial pain, numbness or swelling over the face, blackish discoloration over the bridge of nose or the palate, toothache, loosening of teeth, pain in the jaw, blurred or double vision, fever, skin lesion resembling that of eschar, chest pain, hemoptysis, and worsening of respiratory symptoms necessitate immediate concern, and one should try to report to the nearest health facility as soon as possible.

Considerations for included studies — bias and generalizability issues for C. difficile infection and antibiotic prescribing are highlighted, including possible underestimation of events, potential overdiagnosis due to highly sensitive tests, and reliance on administrative codes rather than laboratory results. The page notes "there is the possibility for an underestimation of both recurrences and mortality", "there is a potential overdiagnosis or an overestimation of the burden of C. difficile infection owing to diagnostic tests being highly sensitive", and "there are potential issues of generalizability to the US population". It also reports that "International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes were used instead of laboratory results on bacterial cultures"; and that "Greater awareness of drug resistance among hospital coding departments may have prompted more attention to adding these codes to discharge records of patients who were relatively healthy and discharged without incident".

Key points
- Periodontal diseases, such as gingivitis and periodontitis, are largely preventable and treatable. The key is good oral hygiene, overall self-care, and regular care from a dental health care provider.
- Periodontal disease refers to conditions that involve inflammation and infection of the tissues that surround and support the teeth. Overview Periodontal disease is a broad term for conditions involving inflammation and infection of the tissues that surround and support the teeth. Gingivitis is a type of gum disease that involves inflammation of the gums. It is largely preventable and treatable with a combination of routine oral hygiene and professional cleanings. Types Two of the most common types of gum disease are gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis The mildest form of gum disease is gingivitis, an inflammatory condition where the gums become red, swollen, and may easily bleed.

Gingivitis is a reversible condition. But if left untreated, it can lead to a gum disease called periodontitis. Causes It is normal for some bacteria to live in a healthy mouth. Bacteria in the mouth constantly produce and dwell within a sticky, removable film on tooth surfaces called plaque. If plaque is left to build up on a tooth, it can lead to inflammation around the tooth and result in gingivitis. Plaque can be removed regularly with toothbrushing and flossing. If it is not removed, it will usually harden into tartar. Tartar buildup cannot be removed with toothbrushing. Professional treatment is needed to remove it. Bacteria in buildup can spread below the gumline and lead to the formation of a periodontal "pocket. " This pocket is an abnormal deepening of the space between tooth surfaces and gum tissues. Bacteria can release toxins in the pocket that make inflammation worse.

As this process continues, it contributes to the destruction of gum tissues and bone loss around the teeth, which is a main feature of periodontitis. Treatment and recovery Treatment for periodontitis might include:

- A non-surgical procedure commonly known as "scaling and root planing" or "deep cleaning" of the affected tooth and root surfaces.
- Prescribed medication, such as an oral rinse or medicine placed directly under the affected gums.
- Surgical procedures. How to Find Low-Cost Dental Care.
