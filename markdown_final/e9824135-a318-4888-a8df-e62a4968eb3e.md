## Question

A 26-year-old G1P0 mother is in the delivery room in labor. Her unborn fetus is known to have a patent urachus. Which of the following abnormalities would you expect to observe in the infant?
A. Gastroschisis
B. Omphalocele
C. Meconium discharge from umbilicus
D. Urine discharge from umbilicus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which abnormality to expect in a newborn with a patent urachus, given the options of gastroschisis, omphalocele, meconium discharge from the umbilicus, and urine discharge from the umbilicus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the embryology and definition of a patent urachus. Then, I should verify the classic clinical presentation in neonates. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis of umbilical discharge to ensure I'm not missing a look-alike. After that, I should consider the pathophysiology that would make urine leakage the expected finding. Finally, I will eliminate the incorrect options and confirm the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the embryology and definition. The urachus is a midline embryonic channel that normally connects the fetal bladder to the umbilicus and should obliterate before birth to become the median umbinal ligament; failure of obliteration results in a patent urachus, which is a persistent bladder–umbilicus communication, not an abdominal wall defect or a bowel remnant anomaly [^115S4XBM] [^116xZBx3].

> Wait, let me verify the expected neonatal presentation. Multiple sources consistently describe a patent urachus presenting with urine leakage from the umbilicus due to the direct communication between bladder and umbilicus; this can be continuous or intermittent depending on bladder pressure and urine flow, and is the hallmark bedside finding prompting diagnosis in the newborn period [^114hpuEz] [^114Fr4gU] [^113HpEug].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any umbilical discharge being the same. I need to check the differential of umbilical drainage: meconium or feculent material suggests an omphalomesenteric duct remnant (vitelline duct), whereas clear or yellowish fluid with a urinary odor points toward a urachal fistula; urachal anomalies can also present with umbilical granulation, erythema, or infection, but urine leakage is the characteristic of a patent urachus rather than meconium or bowel content [^115bZzvn] [^116HTXC6] [^113HpEug].

> I will now examine the incorrect options to ensure I'm not overlooking a confounder. Gastroschisis and omphalocele are anterior abdominal wall defects with herniation of abdominal viscera; they are anatomically distinct from a urachal anomaly and do not cause urine discharge from the umbilicus, so they do not fit the pathophysiology of a patent urachus [^113VpWaE] [^1114Ba2w] [^1164H8SS]. Meconium discharge from the umbilicus would imply a persistent omphalomesenteric duct allowing intestinal content to reach the umbilicus, which is a different embryologic problem than a urachal fistula [^116HTXC6].

> Let me think about the mechanism to be sure. Because the patent urachus maintains a patent lumen from bladder dome to umbilicus, bladder pressure during filling and voiding can force urine through the tract to the skin, producing visible leakage at the umbilicus; this is why bedside observation of urine at the umbilicus is so specific for a patent urachus in the newborn and why imaging such as ultrasound or VCUG confirms the tract when needed [^114hpuEz] [^116N2ZDx] [^116xZBx3].

> But wait, what if there is an associated umbilical mass or unusual umbilical appearance? In some cases, particularly when an allantoic cyst is present prenatally, there may be progression to bladder prolapse through the patent urachus with a midline umbilical mass; even then, the underlying pathology remains a patent urachus with potential urine leakage, reinforcing that urine discharge is the expected neonatal manifestation rather than meconium or abdominal wall herniation [^114pU8AE] [^113t5qFj] [^112kG8Eg].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the best answer. Given a patent urachus, the expected abnormality in the infant is urine discharge from the umbilicus, corresponding to option D, whereas gastroschisis, omphalocele, and meconium discharge reflect different embryologic entities and are not expected with a urachal fistula [^114hpuEz] [^114Fr4gU] [^113HpEug].

---

The expected abnormality in an infant with a patent urachus is **urine discharge from the umbilicus** [^115S4XBM] due to a persistent urachal tract connecting the bladder to the umbilicus [^116xZBx3]. This continuous or intermittent leakage is the hallmark clinical finding and distinguishes patent urachus from other umbilical anomalies [^notfound]. Gastroschisis and omphalocele are **abdominal wall defects** [^113VpWaE] with herniated viscera, not urachal anomalies, and meconium discharge from the umbilicus suggests an **omphalomesenteric duct remnant**, not a urachal anomaly [^112bRWXh].

---

## Clinical presentation of patent urachus

Patent urachus typically presents with the following clinical features:

- **Urine discharge from the umbilicus**: Continuous or intermittent leakage of urine from the umbilicus is the hallmark clinical finding in infants with patent urachus [^113HpEug] [^114hpuEz].

- **Umbilical granulation tissue**: The persistent moisture at the umbilicus can lead to the formation of granulation tissue, which may appear as a pink, moist, friable mass at the umbilical site [^115S4XBM].

- **Umbilical erythema and irritation**: Chronic moisture and urine exposure can cause skin irritation, erythema, and excoriation around the umbilicus [^113HpEug].

- **Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)**: Due to the abnormal communication between the bladder and the umbilicus, infants may present with recurrent UTIs [^113HpEug].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnosis of patent urachus is primarily clinical, supported by imaging studies:

- **Ultrasound**: Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice, demonstrating a patent tract between the bladder and the umbilicus [^112o3d2z].

- **Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)**: VCUG is highly sensitive in confirming the diagnosis by demonstrating contrast material passing from the bladder through the patent urachus to the umbilicus [^116N2ZDx].

- **Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: These modalities may be reserved for complex cases or when additional anatomical detail is required [^116N2ZDx].

---

## Differential diagnosis

It is essential to differentiate patent urachus from other umbilical anomalies, including:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Differentiating factors** |
|-|-|-|
| Gastroschisis | - Lateral abdominal wall defect <br/> - Exposed bowel loops without a covering sac | - No umbilical discharge <br/> - No communication with bladder [^116YdnsX] |
| Omphalocele | - Midline abdominal wall defect <br/> - Herniated viscera covered by a membranous sac | - No umbilical discharge <br/> - No communication with bladder [^116YdnsX] |
| Meckel's diverticulum | - Umbilical discharge of meconium or intestinal contents <br/> - Associated with omphalomesenteric duct remnant | - Discharge of meconium rather than urine <br/> - No communication with bladder [^116HTXC6] |
| Umbilical granuloma | - Small, pink, moist mass at the umbilicus <br/> - No discharge of urine | - No communication with bladder <br/> - No urine discharge [^notfound] |

---

## Management

Management of patent urachus depends on the severity of symptoms and associated complications:

- **Conservative management**: In some cases, particularly in neonates, conservative management with bladder drainage (urethral catheterization) may lead to spontaneous closure of the patent urachus [^114hpuEz].

- **Surgical intervention**: Definitive treatment involves surgical excision of the patent urachal tract, often accompanied by bladder cuff excision to prevent recurrence and complications [^114gDDiu].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Antibiotics are indicated if there is associated infection or recurrent UTIs [^117BAcXN].

---

## Potential complications

If left untreated, patent urachus may lead to several complications, including:

- **Recurrent urinary tract infections**: Due to the abnormal communication between the bladder and the umbilicus [^113HpEug].

- **Umbilical skin irritation and excoriation**: From chronic urine exposure [^115S4XBM].

- **Urachal cyst formation**: Incomplete regression may lead to the formation of urachal cysts, which can become infected or complicated [^114JUGet].

- **Rarely, malignant transformation**: Although extremely rare, chronic inflammation and epithelial metaplasia may predispose to malignant transformation later in life [^113aKopa].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for infants with patent urachus is **generally excellent** with appropriate management. Surgical excision of the patent urachal tract effectively prevents recurrence and complications, and long-term outcomes are favorable [^114DVRoZ].

---

The expected abnormality in an infant with a patent urachus is **urine discharge from the umbilicus** [^113HpEug], resulting from a persistent urachal tract connecting the bladder to the umbilicus. This condition is distinct from other umbilical anomalies such as gastroschisis, omphalocele, and Meckel's diverticulum, and requires specific diagnostic evaluation and management strategies [^113VpWaE] [^116HTXC6].

### Nonoperative management of a patent urachus [^114hpuEz]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Patent urachus accounts for 10% to 15% of all reported urachal abnormalities in the literature. Treatment in the past has relied on immediate surgery. Conservative therapy with bladder catheter drainage, resulting in spontaneous closure, has not been described. We report a case of patent urachus in a 6-day-old infant who presented with urine drainage from the umbilicus. Radiographic studies confirmed a patent urachus. One week of urethral catheterization resulted in spontaneous closure of the patent urachus. This case suggests that initial treatment should consist of urethral catheterization for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by repeat voiding cystourethrogram. If the patent urachus still persists, one should proceed to surgical correction.

### Imaging of the urachus: anomalies, complications, and mimics [^116xZBx3]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Urachal anomalies are more common than previously thought, with more cases discovered incidentally, because of the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Although an abnormal persistence of an embryologic communication between the bladder and the umbilicus is often recognized and managed in childhood, it may persist into adulthood, with a greater risk of morbidity. Congenital urachal anomalies that are detected early can benefit from an optimized management including surgical approach with a complete resection of the urachal remnant in cases when spontaneous resolution or medical management has failed. At imaging, the different types of urachal anomalies have a distinct appearance. A patent urachus is recognized as an elongated patent connection between the bladder and the umbilicus. An umbilical-urachal sinus is depicted as a blind focal dilatation at the umbilical end, whereas a vesicourachal diverticulum is a focal outpouching at the vesical end. Urachal cysts are visualized as midline fluid-filled sacs most frequently located near the bladder dome. Complications of urachal anomalies have nonspecific clinical findings and can mimic other abdominal and pelvic processes. Potential complications, such as infection and tumors, should be recognized early to ensure optimal management. Understanding of the embryonic development of the urachus is necessary for the radiologist to diagnose the wide variety of urachal disease. © RSNA, 2016.

### Anomalies, abnormalities, and care of the umbilicus [^115bZzvn]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

This article discusses various anomalies and abnormalities of the umbilical cord and issues related to cord care. The issue of screening newborns with an isolated single umbilical artery for renal abnormalities is addressed. The clinical presentation of infants with omphalomesenteric and urachal duct remants along with the more common umbilical granuloma is reviewed. All three of these abnormalities can present with a wet or draining cord. The need for umbilical cord treatment with antimicrobial/antiseptic agents versus dry cord care is discussed, as are serious infections that involve the cord.

### Abnormal appearance of the umbilicus: an indicator of urachal anomalies [^1113ZVXx]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

The urachus is an intra-abdominal fibrous remnant of the allantois. The non-involution of the allantois can result in urachal anomalies. The abnormal appearance of the umbilicus may be a sign of such anomalies. We have observed 3 cases of term neonates with atypical appearance of the umbilical stump, all of which manifested urachal anomalies, as documented by ultrasound scan. These appearances are rarely described in the literature, and seem to regress at around 2months. Therefore, it is important that healthcare professionals should be aware of the possible implications of atypical umbilical stumps, evaluate each case accordingly and, if an urachal anomaly is diagnosed, refer the patient to a paediatric surgery centre, as such malformations carry an underlying risk of infection or malignancy.

Discussion

The urachus is a lower midline abdominal structure that extends from the dome of the bladder toward the umbilicus, or the median umbilical ligament within the space between the peritoneum and the transversalis fascia. The bladder initially extends all the way to the umbilicus. The apical portion of the bladder slowly narrows to a small, fibro epithelialized strand during gestation. Urachal remnants are a result of incomplete regression of the intraembryonic connection between the allantois and the cloaca.

Based on the location of residual patency along the urachal tract, five types of congenital UAs are present, including patent urachus/urachal remnant, urachal sinus, urachal cyst, urachal diverticulum, and alternation sinus. Most UAs are detected incidentally and usually remain asymptomatic, while some may be misdiagnosed as other abdominal and pelvic diseases in the emergency room. Still others present with non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, umbilical discharge, fever, or infection. Sato et al. found that the most common symptom was umbilical granulation in infants and abdominal pain in older children. Basuguy et al. found the most common symptom in their cohort to be abdominal pain, followed by discharge. In our cohort, the most common presenting symptom when UAs were symptomatic was umbilical drainage (53.4%), followed closely by abdominal pain (48.3%).

### Infected umbilical urachal sinus in a neonate [^117E9YW7]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The urachus is an embryonic tube that connects the upper portion of the bladder to the umbilicus and normally obliterates during embryonic development, forming the median umbilical ligament. Incomplete obliteration of the urachus can result in various anomalies such as congenital patent urachus, umbilical urachal sinus, vesico-urachal diverticulum and urachal cyst. We report a term neonate who presented with swelling and discharge from the umbilical region, which through clinical evaluation and radiological investigations, was diagnosed as an infected umbilical urachal sinus.

### Allantoic cyst: a prenatal clue to patent urachus [^111HkDFk]. Pediatric Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

A patent urachus, which is typically diagnosed as leakage from the umbilicus postnatally, can present as an allantoic cyst in the umbilical cord antenatally. We report a case of a patent urachus with an allantoic cyst diagnosed via fetal MR imaging at 24 weeks' gestation. Early detection allowed for appropriate counseling and prompt corrective surgery after birth.

The following constitutes key background information on urachal remnant:

- **Definition**: A urachal remnant is a persistent segment of the urachus, a midline embryologic structure that normally obliterates before birth. Its persistence results in various urachal anomalies, including urachal sinus, urachal cyst, vesico-urachal diverticulum, and patent urachus.
- Pathophysiology: The urachus is derived from the allantois, a projection from the yolk sac that appears around day 16 of gestation and connects the fetal bladder to the umbilicus. As the bladder descends during fetal development, the urachus normally narrows and obliterates by birth to form the median umbilical ligament. Failure of this process results in persistent urachal tissue, giving rise to anomalies such as urachal sinus, cyst, diverticulum, or a patent urachus. The urachus typically measures 3–10 cm in length and 8–10 mm in diameter and is composed of three layers: a transitional epithelial lining, a connective tissue core, and an outer muscular layer continuous with the detrusor muscle. Resected specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients may contain epithelial components, and some may show signs of inflammation or cystic degeneration, highlighting the potential for clinical complications even in previously unremarkable remnants.
- **Epidemiology**: The reported prevalence of urachal remnants varies widely depending on diagnostic criteria and study methodology. In surgical series, such as patients undergoing laparoscopy for inguinal hernia repair, visible residual urachal tissue has been observed in up to 35.4% of cases, particularly in infants under 1 year of age, suggesting physiologic regression with age. In contrast, ultrasonographic studies in patients under 18 years report a much lower prevalence of around 0.2%. Urachal remnants are slightly more common in males. Reported subtype distributions include patent urachus (10–48%), urachal cyst (31–43%), urachal sinus (18–43%), and urachal diverticulum (3–4%).
- **Risk factors**: Urachal remnants are congenital anomalies more frequently diagnosed in males.
- **Disease course**: Urachal remnants are most often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. When symptomatic, presentations vary by age and remnant type. In infants, the most common signs include umbilical granulation tissue, discharge, and erythema. A patent urachus may cause continuous or intermittent urine leakage from the umbilicus, leading to persistent irritation. In older children, abdominal pain is a more frequent symptom. Urachal cysts may present either incidentally or when infected, leading to umbilical discharge of pus, suprapubic pain, or recurrent UTIs if the cyst communicates with the bladder. Infected urachal anomalies can present with high fever, abdominal tenderness, LUTS, or a palpable abdominal mass. Urachal diverticula are typically asymptomatic and found during imaging for unrelated conditions. Associated anomalies, including vesicoureteral reflux, may coexist and have been reported in up to 37% of pediatric patients with urachal remnants.

### Disorders of the umbilical cord [^115SkTqD]. Pediatrics in Review (2018). Low credibility.

The umbilical cord, a vital conduit between the placenta and the fetus, loses much of its significance after birth. However, newborns can often present with various abnormalities of the umbilicus, such as benign granulomas or more serious lesions due to persistent remnants, many of which can change the normal course of cord separation and may be associated with significant morbidities if left unrecognized and uncorrected. Although not uncommon, sanguineous drainage from the umbilical stump can be quite alarming to new parents. Parental counseling regarding normal umbilical cord changes, as well as abnormal findings, such as discharge and skin changes, are important for the recognition and timely treatment of potentially significant umbilical cord disorders.

### Imaging of the urachus [^111hQ1E2]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

The urachus is a remnant fibrous cord of the allantois and the ventral aspect of the cloaca that connects the urinary bladder to the anterior abdominal wall at the level of the umbilicus. The authors explore the embryologic origins of the urachus and delineate its normal anatomy, followed by a discussion of urachal pathologic conditions seen with different imaging modalities-including US, CT, and MRI-using a case-based approach. Although it is a vestigial structure, the urachus can harbor significant disease, including congenital anomalies arising secondary to varying degrees of incomplete involution of the urachus and ranging from focal patency (urachal cyst, diverticulum, and sinus) to complete patency (patent urachus). The spectrum of congenital abnormalities can manifest with various clinical findings and is often discovered at imaging when infected. Understanding the embryogenesis of the urachus is therefore crucial for understanding the imaging manifestations of urachal abnormalities. Nonneoplastic urachal masses can be inflammatory and sometimes difficult to differentiate from malignancy. In women, the urachus can be involved by endometriosis. Neoplastic urachal entities can include mucinous cystadenoma, which can rupture with associated mucinous ascites. Adenocarcinoma is the most common urachal malignancy and frequently can extend to involve the urinary bladder. Other malignant urachal entities include urothelial carcinoma and metastasis. Mimics of urachal pathologic conditions can cause diagnostic misperception and include primary bladder malignancy, infections, and dropped gallstones or appendicoliths. This comprehensive overview aims to enhance radiologists' proficiency in recognizing and interpreting urachal abnormalities, thus contributing to improved patient outcomes. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Her belly button is leaking: a case of patent urachus [^114Fr4gU]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Patent urachus is one of the least commonly seen of the urachal anomalies. In this report, we present a case of a patent urachus in a15-day-old female who presented with leakage from the umbilical site. The purpose of this article is to discuss the embryology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of patent urachus.

### From prenatal detection to postnatal evaluation: a retrospective observational ultrasound study of patent urachus with allantoic cyst [^113WZ1yq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PUAC is a rare congenital anomaly. Despite its potential impact on urinary tract development, the overall prognosis is generally favorable. Prenatal ultrasound plays a crucial role in its monitoring, providing guidance for prenatal assessment and postnatal surgical management.

### Urachal remnants in patients presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain [^11634GC1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Rare causes of abdominal pain include abnormalities of the urachus, including patent urachus and urachal cyst with or without infection. However, reviews discussing etiology of abdominal pain, even in children, may completely omit mention of urachal remnants.

Objectives

Determine the incidence of symptomatic urachal remnants in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED), including common presenting findings and method of diagnosis.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients presenting to the ED with abdominal pain who were diagnosed with urachal remnants, including patent urachus or urachal cyst or abscess over a period of 11 years and 7 months in one hospital.

Results

There were a total of 833,317 ED visits over the time period of the chart review, with 76,954 patients or 9.2% presenting with a complaint of abdominal pain. Twenty-four patients were identified, or 0.03% of those presenting with abdominal pain. Ages ranged from 16 days to 59 years. Among those 18 years or older, there was a male-to-female ratio of 1:1 of 14 patients. Thirteen patients (54.2%) initially presented with drainage from the umbilicus.

Conclusions

Although rare, symptomatic disorders of urachal remnants may present at any age. These disorders should be kept in mind by the emergency physician among the broad list of differential diagnoses accounting for abdominal pain. Urachal cyst and abscess may present with or without drainage from the umbilicus. Drainage from the umbilicus is highly suggestive, but not pathognomonic, of a urachal anomaly, and patients should be imaged to make a definite diagnosis and assist in the management plan.

### Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus: fetal and neonatal features [^114pU8AE]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

We report a term male neonate who was born with a large, red, tubular, mucosa-lined umbilical mass containing a patent lumen. Prenatal ultrasonographic screening at 20 to 28 weeks of gestation revealed a large cyst at the umbilicus, communicating with the urinary bladder. The cyst resolved at 32 weeks, and a small solid mass was newly seen on the fetal abdominal wall, inferior to the umbilical cord insertion. At operation, the mass was discovered to be the prolapsed, open, everted dome of the urinary bladder. The dome was resected, and the bladder was repaired in 2 layers after identification of the ureteral orifices. Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus can be predicted by prenatal ultrasound and has a distinct neonatal appearance.

### Management of urachal anomalies in children: insights from a retrospective cohort study [^112Zf1Kz]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The urachus is an embryological connection between the early fetal bladder and the allantois that typically obliterates during fetal development or in the early neonatal course. Failure of involution to occur completely results in the abnormal persistence of a urachal remnant that can be subtyped into different morphological anomalies including patent urachus, vesicourachal diverticulum, urachal cyst, and urachal sinus. It was previously thought that urachal anomalies (UAs) were a rare occurrence, but increased utilization of modern imaging has revealed that UAs are much more common. In 2015, Gleason et al. reported a 1.03% prevalence in the general pediatric population. Another study observed the incidence of UA in children below the age of 15 years to be 1.6%.

Patient presentation with UA varies widely from most patients presenting with no symptoms to others presenting with non-specific symptoms such as umbilical drainage, fever, abdominal pain, and infection.

Current management strategies for UA include non-operative management and follow-up to ensure symptom resolution/non-recurrence or surgical management in which the UA is excised (either in an open, laparoscopic, or robot-assisted approach). Both options are pursued with approximately equal preference as there are no clear set of guidelines for management in the pediatric population. Recent literature has shown that malignancy later in life is rare and therefore prophylactic excision is not warranted.

We hypothesize that symptomatic patients, especially those with infectious symptoms, are more likely to undergo surgical intervention.

### Ultrasound evaluation of urachal abscess in a young infant [^114d1y8U]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The urachus is a tubular structure extending from the dome of the bladder to the umbilicus. Normally, this allantoic and cloacal remnant obliterates into a fibrous band by late fetal development. Urachal abnormalities include a patent urachus, urachal cyst, umbilical urachal sinus, and a vesicourachal diverticulum. These abnormalities are most often asymptomatic and only come to clinical attention when associated with infection. A 2-month-old male infant presented to our tertiary pediatric hospital with several days of intermittent fevers and a focal region of swelling and erythema over the umbilicus. On physical examination, a tender mass was palpated in the umbilical region. Ultrasound revealed a long tubular structure coursing from the dome of the bladder anteriorly and superiorly to the subumbilical region. This tubular structure was fluid filled with internal echoes suggestive of infection with abscess formation. The urachal abscess was drained surgically, at which time a patent urachus was also excised. This case demonstrates the importance of having a thorough understanding of urachal anomalies when evaluating infants presenting with umbilical pathology.

### Congenital bladder prolapse through a patent urachus: two institutions' experience [^116fnj2X]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

We describe our experience in 2 institutions handling bladder prolapse through a patent urachus (PU), together with a brief review of published literature. Case 1: A term neonate with congenital prolapsed bladder via PU. Ultrasound at 21 weeks gestation revealed a male fetus with a large midline pelvic cyst communicating with the bladder which disappeared on subsequent 27 weeks ultrasound. Case 2: A term female neonate with congenital prolapsed bladder via PU with no prenatal diagnosis. In both cases the bladder closure was undertaken during the newborns' first days of life.

### Persistent omphalomesenteric duct and urachus presenting as an umbilical hernia [^112bRWXh]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Vitellointestinal duct anomalies, although one of the most frequent malformations to be found (2%-3% in population), they are most unlikely to cause symptoms. A persistent Vitellointestinal duct can induce abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, intestinal haemorrhage and umbilical sinus, fistula or hernia which commonly occurs in children. Patent vitellointestinal duct or persistent omphalomesenteric duct is a very unusual congenital anomaly which occurs in 2% of the population related to the embryonic yolk stalk. Similarly, urachal anomalies remain a rare finding, with the most common being a cyst or sinus followed by patent urachus and rarely a urachal diverticulum. Presenting symptoms include periumbilical discharge, pain and a palpable mass. Here, we report a case of an adult patient with patent vitellointestinal duct and urachus identified intraoperatively on diagnostic laparoscopy when being operated for umbilical hernia repair.

### Laparoscopic radical excision of urachal sinus [^113g6RtZ]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

Persistent urachus is a rare congenital anomaly. Various types of remnants have been described including cyst, alternating sinus, patent urachus, diverticulum, and sinus. The most common presenting symptom of urachal sinus is umbilical discharge. Radical excision of the remnant, with or without a bladder cuff, is essential to prevent future malignant degeneration or recurrence of the remnant. Although open surgical excision has been the treatment of choice for many years, the laparoscopic approach has become an attractive alternative because of its association with less postoperative pain, better cosmesis, and rapid convalescence. Laparoscopic radical excision of a urachal sinus was performed in a 16-year-old female patient who presented with umbilical discharge.

### From prenatal detection to postnatal evaluation: a retrospective observational ultrasound study of patent urachus with allantoic cyst [^115qXCeN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The urachus is a tubular structure formed during early embryonic development that originates from the bladder dome, traverses the umbilical ring, and terminates at the proximal end of the umbilical cord. Patent urachus is one of congenital urachal anomalies, which usually associated with allantoic cysts in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. A "dumbbell-shaped" anechoic structure within the umbilical region represents a characteristic sonographic finding of this condition during the first trimester. It is reported that the incidence is low in children after birth. To date, the relevant literature is scarce, which primarily consists of case reports. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial to prevent complications like recurrent infections, sepsis, or malignancy. This study conducted a retrospective analysis of prenatal sonographic progression and postnatal follow-up in fetuses diagnosed with patent urachus with allantoic cysts (PUAC), with dual objectives: (1) to assess the effects of PUAC on fetal genitourinary development, genetic associations, and pregnancy outcomes, and (2) to provide evidence-based insights for optimizing prenatal counseling and clinical decision-making.

### Nonoperative management of symptomatic urachal anomalies [^117MvxLc]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Symptomatic urachal anomalies are rare disorders that consist of urachal remnants or fistulas with or without an associated cyst. Traditionally, when a urachal anomaly was recognized, operative excision was performed. There has been a shift toward the nonoperative management of urachal anomalies at many centers, although there is little in the literature to support this practice.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients with urachal anomalies was performed from January 2002 to March 2008. Children with a draining umbilicus and no radiographic or surgical confirmation of a urachal anomaly were excluded.

Results

Fifteen patients with symptomatic urachal anomalies were identified. The average age was 3.5 years (4 weeks to 14 years). Symptoms included umbilical drainage (n = 10), abdominal pain (n = 6), omphalitis (n = 4), intraabdominal mass (n = 3), dysuria (n = 1), recurrent urinary tract infections (n = 1), and fever (n = 4). The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound (n = 13) and/or computed tomographic scan (n = 4). The surgically treated cases included 7 urachal cysts (5 uninfected, 2 infected) and 1 patent urachal fistula. Mean follow-up is 37 months, and there have been no reported recurrences. Those treated without surgical excision included 4 patent urachal fistulas (mean follow-up, 20 months-no recurrences) and 3 infected urachal cysts (percutaneous drainage [n = 2] and laparoscopic drainage [n = 1]-no recurrences on ultrasound at 26 months).

Conclusion

Nonoperative management of urachal anomalies is a reasonable approach and may be extended to infected urachal cysts after initial drainage. Infected cysts that are adequately drained seem to obliterate with time. Modern ultrasonography facilitates thorough follow-up. We propose a treatment algorithm for the management of suspected urachal anomalies.

### Congenital and hereditary cystic diseases of the abdomen [^114JUGet]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Urachal cyst

The urachus is a ductal remnant that originates from the involution of the allantois and cloaca. It extends from the bladder dome to the umbilicus. In the late stages of gestation, it involutes and obliterates and observed as a median umbilical ligament in the postgestational period. The failure of this mentioned involution may result in persistent of this canal after birth. The most common types of this failed involution are patent urachus and urachal cyst.

Urachal cysts form when both the umbilical and bladder ends of the urachus are obliterated with nonobliterated segment in between. These urachal cysts are typically small and asymptomatic; however, infection of the cysts may cause symptoms.

On imaging, the diagnosis of an uncomplicated cyst may be easily made by detecting the cyst in the midline along the trajectory of the urachus. The detection of inhomogeneous cyst content and inflammatory stranding adjacent to the cyst may indicate infection (Fig. 37).

### From prenatal detection to postnatal evaluation: a retrospective observational ultrasound study of patent urachus with allantoic cyst [^112kG8Eg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PUAC is a rare antenatal malformation, occurring in 1 to 2.5 per 100,000 deliveries, with a male predominance. It is not associated with pubic diastasis or external genital abnormalities. During embryonic development, the atresia and disappearance of the urachus form the median umbilical ligament, however, the failure of atresia may lead to urachal abnormalities such as urachal sinus, urachal cyst, urachal diverticulum, and patent urachus. During the first trimester, the allantoic cyst and distended bladder exhibit comparable dimensions, forming a characteristic "dumbbell" configuration via the patent urachus. This sonographic hallmark provides a definitive diagnostic criterion.

We documented the prenatal trends associated with allantoic cysts, as well as their postpartum manifestations, a topic that has received scant attention in previous literature. As the production of urine continues, the allantoic cyst progressively enlarges during the second trimester of pregnancy. In some cases, retrograde micturition through the patent urachus from bladder to allantoic cyst could even be observed. However, the cyst wall exhibits relative fragility. When the fluid pressure within the cyst reaches its threshold, the allantoic cyst ruptures and disappears, resulting in the prolapse of the bladder from the abdominal wall. Allantoic cysts disappear between 22 and 35 weeks of gestation according to prior reports. In our study, this period extended from as early as 19 weeks of gestation to as 35 weeks of gestation. While the precise mechanism remains elusive, we propose that the delayed rupture of the cyst, its small size, and the stabilization of the fetal abdominal wall may impede the development of bladder prolapse.

### Belly button piercings: a saving grace? A patent urachus presenting in a 17-year-old girl [^113SK299]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 17-year-old girl who presented to the accident and emergency department with dysuria and foul smelling, bloody discharge from her umbilicus. The definitive diagnosis was that of a patent urachus, which is a fistulous communication between the bladder and the umbilicus, usually diagnosed in early infancy. The incidence of a patent urachus is approximately 1 in 70,000 in the general population. It is highly likely that removal of a recent belly button piercing resulted in the acute presentation by completing the fistulous tract to the skin. This case is of clinical relevance as the diagnosis was missed 18months prior with a milder presentation. The recommended treatment option is surgical excision due to the potential risk of malignant change, with urachal adenocarcinoma accounting for 0.3% of all bladder cancers.

### Complicated urachal cyst in two pediatric patients: a case report [^112vzLyx]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

There are five subtypes of congenital urachal anomalies: patent urachus, umbilical-urachal sinus, vesicourachal diverticulum, urachal cyst, and alternating sinus. A urachal cyst is defined as a sac-like pocket of tissue that develops within the urachus, a canal from the bladder to the umbilicus of a developing fetus. Urachal remnants result from incomplete regression of intra-embryonic connection of the allantois to the cloaca. On about day 16, the allantois appears as a finger-like projection with the ventral cloaca at one end and the umbilicus at the other. The ventral portion of the cloaca eventually develops into the bladder following cloacal division by the urogenital septum. When exactly the urachus closes is uncertain but it is thought that once the bladder descends into the pelvis during the fourth or fifth month of gestation, the urachus narrows and eventually obliterates to a thin fibrous cord in postnatal life to become the median umbilical ligament.

### Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus presenting as an umbilical mass in the newborn: characteristic prenatal sonographic findings and the diagnostic benefit of postnatal cystography [^113t5qFj]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus is rare. We present a newborn with an unusual exophytic, erythematous umbilical mass. Voiding cystography readily demonstrated continuity of the bladder dome with the umbilical mass, confirming bladder prolapse through a patent urachus. The diagnosis of bladder prolapse was rapidly made in a second newborn with similar imaging and clinical findings and confirmed by cystography. We discuss the embryology of this condition including the association with a vesico-allantoic cyst in utero. Pre- and postnatal images are presented. The use of cystography in diagnosis is emphasized.

### A diagnostic algorithm for urachal anomalies [^116N2ZDx]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Urachal anomalies are rare. Variable presentations can be a diagnostic challenge. We combine our series with a review of literature to delineate the most common presentations, highest yield diagnostic studies and a diagnostic algorithm.

Methods

We reviewed records of 22 boys and 15 girls with the diagnosis of a urachal anomaly from 2000 through 2005. This revealed 19 cysts, seven patent urachuses, five sinuses, four patients with unspecified "urachal anomalies", and two patients with no urachal anomaly by surgical exploration. Ultrasound was the most common diagnostic study, followed by computed tomography (CT), voiding cystourethrogram and sinogram. Thirty-five of 37 patients underwent surgery.

Results

Clinical presentation included periumbilical leakage in 54%, pain in 30%, periumbilical mass in 22% and irritative voiding symptoms in 14%. In many patients diagnosis was made on clinical examination alone. When an ultrasound was used it was diagnostic for 82% of cysts, 100% of sinuses and 100% of patent urachuses. A voiding cystourethrogram was diagnostic for 100% of patent urachuses, but less successful in the other anomalies. CT scans correctly diagnosed 71% of cysts. Overall complication rate was 9%, all wound infections.

Conclusion

Reviewing the results of this and four other large series showed that the most common anomaly is the urachal cyst followed by urachal sinus and patent urachus. Periumbilical drainage is the most common presentation. Physical exam alone can be diagnostic. When this is not possible ultrasound is our recommended initial study, followed by a CT scan if unsuccessful.

### Transperitoneal laparoscopic umbilical resection of urachal remnants: a feasible surgical method [^114gDDiu]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The urachal remnant is a rare congenital anomaly. The urachus is a duct, present before birth, that serves as a communication between the umbilicus and bladder. This duct usually disappears after birth, leaving behind fibrous tissue. Full-length urachal remnants, such as patent urachus, are observed in rare cases. The urachal sinus and vesicourachal diverticulum are observed at the sides of the umbilicus and bladder, respectively, and the urachal cyst is observed at the midline. Conservative treatment of infected urachi with antibiotics as the only form of therapy risks re-infection. Thus, complete resection of the residual pouch (duct) is the most appropriate form of treatment.

While several surgical procedures (such as open, laparoscopic, and retroperitoneoscopic procedures) are available for urachal remnants, the best method for endoscopic surgery remains undetermined. For example, the best port position and appropriate approach (peritoneal or retroperitoneal) remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the operative indications of the patients' factors, effective surgical approach to repairing urachal remnants and present the operative outcomes of our cases in relation to the findings from the existing literature.

### Prenatal vesico-allantoic cyst outcome-a spectrum from patent urachus to bladder exstrophy [^111yzwwb]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to assess the prognostic significance of a cystic vesico-allantoic communication discovered on prenatal ultrasound in terms of its effect on the developing urinary tract.

Methods

Multi-institution review of prenatal screening ultrasound was performed between 2004 and 2015 to identify cases of in utero communication between the fetal urinary bladder and a cystic dilatation of the umbilical cord. Gestational age at diagnosis, perinatal evolution, and eventual urinary tract outcome are described and compared with existing literature.

Results

Five cases of cystic vesico-allantoic communication were identified on second-trimester screening ultrasound. Serial ultrasounds showed an increase in the size of the umbilical cystic component with gestational age, followed by its eventual rupture prior to delivery. All neonates had urinary leakage through the inferior portion of the umbilicus with bladder prolapse ranging from patent urachus to partial bladder exstrophy.

Conclusions

An isolated prenatal ultrasound finding of an hourglass communication between the fetal bladder and a cyst of the umbilical cord should be considered predictive of a spectrum from patent urachus to bladder exstrophy. Given the significant ramications on the developing urinary tract, the prenatal finding of vesico-allantoic cyst warrants referral to a high-risk obstetrical center with urologic consultation.

### Patent urachus with bladder eversion [^116AT182]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

An infant was born at term after having received a diagnosis of omphalacele on prenatal ultrasound scan. She did not have an omphalacele but rather had a patent urachus with bladder eversion onto the abdominal wall. The remainder of the genitourinary tract was normal, and it was possible to pass a soft catheter through the urethra and out of the evaginated bladder. The prolapse was repaired without complications, and the infant recovered uneventfully. A voiding cystourethrogram and renal ultrasound scan were normal at 2 month follow-up. The embryology and malformations of the urachus are discussed, and the rare case reports of similar anomalies are reviewed.

### Urachal anomalies in children: the vanishing relevance of the preoperative voiding cystourethrogram [^1147DY5B]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Children with a wet, draining, or infected umbilicus are often referred to pediatric surgeons. Unfortunately, uniform guidelines regarding diagnostic imaging are lacking. Historically, the persistence of the urachus was attributed to intrauterine distal urinary obstruction. Today, many surgeons continue to advocate preoperative voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).

Methods

Records of children with urachal abnormalities over the past 10 years were reviewed. Demographics, presentation, imaging, genitourinary anomalies, operations, length of stay, and complications were recorded. Statistical evaluation was by descriptive analysis.

Results

Fifty-six children were diagnosed with urachal anomalies. Age at operation was 2.5 years (1 day-13 years). Fifty percent of patients were less than 1 year. Ultrasound was used in 88% of cases. Voiding cystourethrogram (34%) and computed tomography (14%) were also used. Average hospitalization was 1.9 (0–13) days. Thirty-two percent underwent operations as outpatients. Seven percent developed wound infections. Eight children (14%) had genitourinary anomalies. However, no VCUG examination (n = 19) documented an obstructive process.

Conclusions

The current study represents the largest reported series of symptomatic urachal anomalies in children. Disorders of the urachus are variable in presentation with the diagnosis reliably made by history and ultrasound alone. Further testing, including VCUG, is not warranted, adding additional cost, an invasive procedure, and inconvenience to the child.

### Simultaneous occurrence of Meckel's diverticulum and patent urachus [^116j7GBu]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

The simultaneous occurrence of a Meckel's diverticulum and a patent urachus is very uncommon. We describe the occurrence and surgical treatment of Meckel's diverticulum and an urachal anomaly in a 1-year-old boy. The patient had intermittent production of clear fluid from the patent urachus, which disappeared after surgical resection.

### Prenatally diagnosed patent urachus with bladder prolapse [^114DVRoZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

We report 2 cases of patent urachus with bladder prolapse, which has a characteristic finding of "disappearance of cyst" antenatally. In the first case, a 34-year-old woman presented at 14 weeks gestation for evaluation of a cyst. Prenatal ultrasonography revealed a cystic mass at the base of the umbilical cord, communicating with the bladder. At 26 weeks gestation, the cyst had disappeared, and a solid mass bulged out inferior to the umbilical cord. At term, the patient delivered a male infant. Examination of the neonate demonstrated mucosal protrusion inferior to the umbilical cord. Catheterization confirmed communication with the bladder. We diagnosed patent urachus with bladder prolapse. In the second case, a 36-year-old woman presented at 19 weeks gestation for evaluation of moderate bilateral hydronephrosis and an abdominal cyst. Prenatal ultrasonography revealed a cystic mass at the base of the umbilical cord, communicating with the bladder. At 26 weeks gestation, the cyst had disappeared. At term, the patient delivered a male infant displaying patent urachus with bladder prolapse. Understanding of the development of urachus is important for prenatal diagnosis, which in turn allows surgery immediately after birth. We showed bladder function after surgery remains good at school age.

### From prenatal detection to postnatal evaluation: a retrospective observational ultrasound study of patent urachus with allantoic cyst [^116rf57e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the benign nature of PUAC, it needs to be distinguished from other structural anomalies like omphalocele, hernia, megacystis, cloacal exstrophy, etc. Reassuring findings from serial sonographic surveillance and amniocentesis can, to some extent, enhance maternal-familial confidence in continuing the pregnancy, particularly for precious fetuses achieved through assisted reproductive technology.

This study provided comprehensive insights into the prenatal progress and pregnancy outcomes of PUAC. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest and most comprehensive single-center analysis of fetal PUAC to date, spanning cases from the first trimester through the postnatal period and capturing the entire clinical trajectory of this condition.

In addition, our study has, for the first time, established numerical ranges for several important parameters, including allantoic cyst size, umbilical mass size, bladder size, and urachus diameter. Due to the retrospective nature and limited sample size, our study has some limitations. Firstly, the ultrasound examinations of all fetuses are not synchronized, making it difficult to determine the exact gestational age of the cyst rupture. Secondly, given the identification of only one case with fetal chromosomal abnormality and the pregnant woman's decision to pursue pregnancy termination, we were precluded from further investigating potential associations between PUAC and specific genetic syndromes. Thirdly, it is challenging to perform comprehensive urological evaluations, especially assessments of bladder compliance and active contractile function.

### An unusual localization of an infected urachal sinus [^112YgVUA]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Failure of obliteration of the urachus in intrauterine life results in anatomically recognizable distinct anomalies. The urachus is located between the umbilicus and apex of the bladder. However, this anatomic feature does not always exist, and this may lead to misdiagnosis of the urachal pathologies. A 5-year-old boy with infected urachal sinus is presented. The urachus showed an unusual anatomic course with its extension from the umbilicus to the right lateral side of the bladder instead of the apex of the organ.

### Megacystis associated with an umbilical cord cyst: a sonographic feature of a patent urachus in the first trimester [^111QrDga]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this series was to report the first-trimester sonographic findings, antenatal course, and outcome in fetuses with a patent urachus.

Methods

We conducted a review of ultrasound reports and medical charts from 3 pregnancies complicated by a congenital patent urachus detected in the first trimester.

Results

All 3 fetuses had megacystis and an umbilical cord cyst close to the fetal abdominal insertion that was detected in the first trimester. In 2 cases, the megacystis resolved spontaneously while the umbilical cord cyst worsened in appearance; among them, massive edema of the umbilical cord was documented in 1, and evidence of partial bladder exstrophy was detected in the third trimester in the other. Both cases required neonatal surgery with no complications. In the remaining case, the fetus died in the early second trimester. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of a patent urachus, an allantoic cyst, and thrombosis of the umbilical vessels.

Conclusions

Megacystis is a warning sign of a patent urachus in the first trimester. The prognosis of this condition is generally good; however, fetal death can occur secondary to compression of umbilical vessels due to the expanding allantoic cyst.

We report an infant who presented with a discharging single-lumen, tubular, and mucosa-lined umbilical mass and a large central abdominal mass, inferior to the umbilicus. At operation, the mass was discovered to be a prolapsed, open, and inflamed urachal sinus leading to a pyourachus. Primary total excision from dome of the bladder to the umbilicus led to smooth recovery with excellent results.

### From prenatal detection to postnatal evaluation: a retrospective observational ultrasound study of patent urachus with allantoic cyst [^115Qt6Sc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patent urachus with allantoic cyst (PUAC) is a rare abnormal embryonic development characterized by a prenatal umbilical mass and postpartum bladder prolapse. The current literature is mainly case reports, and there is a lack of consecutively observational studies of this disease.

Objectives

This study aims to investigate the impact of the disease on fetal development through a retrospective analysis of prenatal ultrasound progression, pregnancy outcomes, and postnatal follow-up, thereby establishing an evidence-based foundation for prenatal clinical recommendations.

Materials and methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of cases identified between January 2012 and December 2022, in which first-trimester sonographic screening demonstrated an umbilical cystic mass with anechoic tubular connections to the fetal bladder. Detailed clinical information about the pregnant individuals, prenatal ultrasonographic changes, genetic outcomes, abdominal appearance of newborns and stillbirths, comorbidities, surgical repair and neonatal follow-up were meticulously recorded and analyzed.

Results

Nine cases met the ultrasound inclusion criteria. Except for one lost to follow-up in second trimester, the remaining eight cases were confirmed as PUAC after birth or induction. Serial ultrasonography demonstrated progressive enlargement of the allantoic cysts with advancing gestational age, culminating in rupture during the second or third trimester and subsequent umbilical mass formation. In postnatal analysis, prolapsed bladder was identified as the predominant component of the umbilical mass, with intestinal involvement observed in some cases. Transient or persistent dilatation of the renal pelvis occurred in over 50% of the fetuses. During long-term follow-up, patients were observed to experience abdominal pain, urinary frequency, and urinary tract infections, with one case showing bilateral vesicoureteral reflux. Only one case showed abnormal genetic results, specifically a 17p12 duplication, which can lead to Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome Type 1 A (CMT1A).

Conclusion

This study highlights that isolated PUAC represents a fetal condition with a favorable prognosis. Dynamic prenatal ultrasound monitoring allows serial documentation of umbilical lesion progression, critically providing assistance for postpartum surgical intervention and prenatal counseling.

### A comprehensive review of pediatric urachal anomalies and predictive analysis for adult urachal adenocarcinoma [^111icJ1S]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examined the presentation, diagnosis and management of radiologically detected pediatric urachal anomalies and assessed the risk of malignant degeneration.

Materials and Methods

Our radiology database (2000 to 2012) was queried for all children younger than 18 years who were diagnosed with a urachal anomaly radiographically, and the operative database was used to determine those who underwent excision. Data collected included demographics, presenting symptoms, imaging modality and indication for excision. These data were compared to the Ontario Cancer Registry to determine the risk of malignancy.

Results

A total of 721 patients were radiographically diagnosed with a urachal anomaly (667 incidentally), yielding a prevalence of 1.03% of the general pediatric population. Diagnoses were urachal remnants (89% of cases), urachal cysts (9%) and patent urachus (1.5%). Ultrasonography was the most common imaging modality (92% of cases), followed by fluoroscopy/voiding cystourethrography (5%) and computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (3%). A total of 61 patients (8.3%) underwent surgical excision. Indications for imaging and treatment were umbilical drainage (43% of patients), abdominal pain (28%), palpable mass (25%) and urinary tract infection (7%). Mean age at excision was 5.6 years and 64% of the patients were male. Based on provincial data, the number needed to be excised to prevent a single case of urachal adenocarcinoma was 5,721.

Conclusions

Urachal anomalies are more common than previously reported. Children with asymptomatic lesions do not appear to benefit from prophylactic excision, as the risk of malignancy later in life is remote and a large number of urachal anomalies would need to be removed to prevent a single case of urachal adenocarcinoma.

### Management of urachal anomalies in children: insights from a retrospective cohort study [^111dypJ1]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

An IRB-approved single institutional urachal cyst database was retrospectively reviewed to identify all patients who underwent surgical management for urachal anomaly between July 2012 and December 2021. Patients who were found to have any of the common UAs (including urachal cyst, urachal abscess, urachal sinus, urachal diverticulum, and patent urachus as confirmed on ultrasound (US) reports), using the ICD (International Classification of Diseases)-9 codes 753.7 or ICD-10 codes Q64.4, were included as part of the initial list of patients.

Patients who underwent surgical intervention at any point in their follow-up during this time were included in the study as the excised group. Patients who were diagnosed with UA but did not have any subsequent surgical management were included as the non-excised group. Patients who were diagnosed with clinical mimickers of UA on US reports (including periumbilical skin lesions, umbilical granuloma) or who underwent excision of UA as part of another urological procedure (e.g. during a Mitrofanoff procedure), or those who underwent excision with general surgery were excluded from the cohort.

Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain baseline demographics, clinical symptoms, radiological imaging including diagnosis of UA subtype, as well as management of patient (only non-operative vs. non-operative followed by surgical intervention), perioperative, and postoperative outcomes.

Statistical software STATA V.17BE (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA) was used for data analysis when appropriate. Continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) and categorical and binary variables were presented as number and percentage (%). Comparative analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum for non-parametric continuous variables, t -test for parametric continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors that are more prominent in patients undergoing surgical intervention and the results were presented as odds ration (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A two-sided p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### A case of urethral atresia: emphasizing the role of parental engagement [^112udxrM]. Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital urethral atresia is generally considered to be incompatible with life unless there is either a patent urachus or vesicoamniotic shunt. Here we present the case of a male neonate with anhydramnios detected at 28weeks gestation due to urethral atresia, who was born without evidence of either a patent urachus or vesicoamniotic shunt, who has survived and is not requiring respiratory support at age 5months. While this is a thought-provoking clinical case, it also highlights the importance of early and effective parental engagement in cases of complex congenital anomalies of the urinary tract.

### Complicated urachal cyst in two pediatric patients: a case report [^114zyyh4]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous literature showed that when a cyst develops on this remnant, it seldom causes any symptoms unless it is accompanied by a secondary infection. The majority of patent urachal findings are incidental when patients present with other problems as they are frequently asymptomatic. Urachal anomalies were reported to be most common in infants between the ages of 1 day to 2 years of age and the incidence rate in males was found to be twice that of females. And when occurring in males posterior urethral valves or causes of bladder outlet obstruction should be investigated and the ideal investigations is micturating cystourethrogram. Moreover, other urinary tract anomalies should be investigated such as vesicoureteral reflux, in our patients according to ultrasound sound reports and follow up there were no associated urinary tract anomalies.

The presentation of these anomalies varies drastically in the clinical setting. Urachal cysts may present as an abdominal mass and develop into an abscess if infection occurs. Symptoms then may range from generalized abdominal pain, fever, to periumbilical pain, redness, or drainage. Rather, the presentation of a urachal cyst is nonspecific and presents similar to appendicitis, bowel obstruction, as in our second case, celiac disease, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A thorough history, physical examination, and proper imaging are needed to diagnose urachal anomalies. And resuscitative measures in infected complicated cases. An underlying condition that lowers immunity should be investigated such as diabetes mellitus. In our two patient they didn't have an underlying debilitating conditions.

### Urachal remnant diseases: spectrum of CT and US findings [^112o3d2z]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) are ideally suited for demonstrating urachal remnant diseases. A patent urachus is demonstrated at longitudinal US and occasionally at CT as a tubular connection between the anterosuperior aspect of the bladder and the umbilicus. An umbilical-urachal sinus manifests at US as a thickened tubular structure along the midline below the umbilicus. A vesicourachal diverticulum is usually discovered incidentally at axial CT, appearing as a midline cystic lesion just above the anterosuperior aspect of the bladder. At US, it manifests as an extraluminally protruding, fluid-filled sac that does not communicate with the umbilicus. Urachal cysts manifest at both modalities as a noncommunicating, fluid-filled cavity in the midline lower abdominal wall located just beneath the umbilicus or above the bladder. Both infected urachal cysts and urachal carcinomas commonly display increased echogenicity at US and thick-walled cystic or mixed attenuation at CT, making it difficult to differentiate between them. Percutaneous needle biopsy or fluid aspiration is usually needed for diagnosis and therapeutic planning. Nevertheless, CT and US can help identify most disease entities originating from the urachal remnant in the anterior abdominal wall. Understanding the anatomy and the imaging features of urachal remnant diseases is essential for correct diagnosis and proper management.

### From prenatal detection to postnatal evaluation: a retrospective observational ultrasound study of patent urachus with allantoic cyst [^113KJWuR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

General clinical information

We conducted a retrospective analysis of cases exhibiting ultrasonographic features consistent with PUAC during the first trimester of pregnancy in our hospital from January 2012 to December 2022. The recorded information included maternal demographic characteristics, gestational age at initial diagnosis and delivery, neonatal birth weight and Apgar score, outcomes of the fetal amniocentesis, manifestations of comorbidities, postnatal appearance of the umbilical region, surgical repair and follow-up of surviving infants.

Fetus ultrasonography

Fetal ultrasonograms in the first trimester were analyzed by two obstetric ultrasound doctors (Luo H & Ye L, with over 25 and 15 years of expertise in prenatal ultrasound diagnosis, respectively). The analysis included assessing the size of the allantoic cyst, the bladder, and the diameter of the patent urachus. Additional information involved nuchal translucency (NT) thickness, the continuity of the fetal abdominal wall, the allantoic arteries, and the distant umbilical cysts.

Another obstetric ultrasound doctor (Du L.X) followed up the developmental changes in the umbilical mass, bladder cavity, degree of hydronephrosis, amniotic fluid volume (AFV) and other comorbidities throughout the entire pregnancy.

### Prune belly syndrome associated with cloacal anomaly, patent urachal remnant, and omphalocele in a female infant [^112ZirVp]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Prune belly syndrome (PBS), megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis (MMIH), and omphalocele-exstrophy of the bladder-imperforate anus-spine abnormalities complex (OEIS) are rare congenital malformations of the newborn that lead to incomplete formation of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract systems. To date, incomplete mesodermal development is identified as the cause for all these complex genetic syndromes even if the etiology is still unknown. We present an original case sharing characteristics common to PBS, MMIH, and OEIS complex, without a clear inclination toward any particular one. This case hints toward a common pathway in the creation of the 3 syndromes. We hypothesize that they are a spectrum of malformations based on the time frame when the mesoderm fails to create a normal interaction between infraumbilical mesoderm, urorectal septum, lumbosacral somites in the formation of the abdominal wall and the genitourinary and lower gastrointestinal tracts.

### Management of urachal anomalies in children: insights from a retrospective cohort study [^111K4JKU]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Since surgical intervention is admittedly a subjective endpoint in clinical management, we sought to evaluate factors leading to observation versus intervention in a multisurgeon practice at our institution. We found that an infected UA on presentation, characterization of a UA as 'hyperemic' or 'cystic' on radiology reports, and the classification of a UA as a 'urachal cyst' by an interpreting radiologist, as well as symptoms such as fever, umbilical drainage, periumbilical erythema, and concurrent UTI were more common in the cohort that underwent surgical excision. These findings underscore that clinical presentations drive surgical decision-making, but the import of a radiologist's characterization of a UA cannot be understated. As a result of our analysis, we have initiated a direct dialogue with our pediatric radiology service once any UA is discovered, and surgical intervention for an asymptomatic UA never proceeds without multipractitioner consensus that a UA appears decidedly abnormal. We note that the absence of malignancy as a covariate in our study confirms that further studies are necessary to correlate 'abnormal' UA findings to future malignancy, even as we admit that structuring such a study would be supremely difficult indeed.

Notably, many non-excised lesions remain asymptomatic, and many involute over time without requiring surgical intervention. Observation is warranted in younger children when asymptomatic, as urachal cysts do not appear to progress in size or severity. Furthermore, a simple description of a cyst on US is insufficient justification for surgical excision. Surgeons must exercise diligence in assessing urachal cysts, engaging in discussions with radiologists to better characterize lesions, evaluate heterogeneity or calcification, and consider symptom history before proceeding with surgical management.

The retrospective nature of the study design introduces inherent biases and limitations, such as potential selection bias and incomplete documentation in medical records. Additionally, our study was conducted at a single institution, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other healthcare settings with different patient populations and management practices. Furthermore, the relatively small sample size of our cohort may have limited the detection of significant associations or differences, particularly in subgroup analyses. Moreover, the exclusion criteria applied in our study, such as excluding patients with clinical mimickers of UA or those undergoing excision as part of other urological procedures, may have inadvertently excluded relevant cases and introduced bias. Lastly, the absence of long-term follow-up data on patient outcomes limits our ability to draw conclusions.

### Prolapse of inverted ileal loops through a patent vitellointestinal duct [^116HTXC6]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We report a case of a prolapsed patent vitellointestinal duct (PVID) in a 2-month-old girl child who presented with sudden increase in size of a polypoidal lesion into a large, 'Y'-shaped reddish, prolapsing lesion, discharging gaseous and faecal matter at her umbilicus. The lesion was diagnosed as a prolapse of inverted ileal loops through the PVID. The child had no associated congenital anomalies. A transumbilical exploration was performed, followed by wedge resection and anastomosis. The child tolerated the procedure well and the postoperative course was uneventful. If the omphalomesenteric duct fails to obliterate a range of congenital defects related to the umbilicus, it can become clinically apparent. Meckel's diverticulum is the commonest of these defects but is most often asymptomatic. PVID is the most common symptomatic anomaly of the patent omphalomesenteric duct and requires prompt surgical correction to avoid complications.

### Complicated urachal cyst in two pediatric patients: a case report [^114qFXH1]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case 2

The second patient was a 3.5-year-old pediatric female patient who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, abdominal distention, as well as constipation, and vomiting. A general examination was performed revealing a generally ill appearance with body temperature of 38℃. Her abdomen was moderately distended, lax and tender upon palpation around the umbilicus in addition to a mass that was felt infra-umbilical.

Following admission, the patient was resuscitated placing a catheter and administering intravenous bolus fluids 20 ml/ kg until urine output established 1.5 ml/kg urine output followed by administration of maintenance fluids at the same time IV antibiotics ceprofloxacin, gentamicin and metronidazol. Lab findings were relevant for a total leukocytic count TLC of 11.6. Abdominal postro-anterior view erect x-ray showed moderate dilated bowel loops with an air-fluid level with no specific findings. An abdominal pelvic ultrasound was carried out showing a cyst filled with turbid fluid related to the urinary bladder and no abnormalities of urinary tract. This was followed by a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast which showed patent dilated urachus extending down to the superior aspect of the urinary bladder with inflammatory process measuring 3.8 × 2.9 × 2.7 cm as well as ileo-ileal intussusception.

Upon exploration, there was no evidence of intussuception as stated in CT and an infected urachal cyst was found between the umbilicus and the urinary bladder, but it was not connected to the bladder. Evacuation and excision of the cyst were done and it was separated from the bladder. Urinary bladder mucosa was intact Repair of sero-musculosa of the urinary was performed in two layers of 3/0 Vicryl with insertion of a 12 French urinary catheter. The patients were discharged with a scheduled follow-up in the outpatient clinic. The patient was admitted for 6 days post-operatively till clinical improvement.

The specimens from both patients were sent to pathology and shown no evidence of malignancy and confirmed inflammatory nature of the specimens.

### Preoperative imaging contributes to pathologically complete resection of the urachal remnant by determining an appropriate surgical approach without unnecessary and excessive surgical invasion: a retrospective study [^116KNA74]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The urachus is an embryonic structure that connects the bladder to the allantois during early embryonic development. Occasionally, it fails to disappear at birth, leading to a case of urachal remnant (UR), which is observed in up to 32% of all bladder examinations of adults aged > 32 years. UR treatment comprises conservative therapy and surgery. Historically, UR resection has been recommended to prevent urachal carcinomas; however, a recent study proposed that 5721 urachal remnants would need to be excised to prevent urachal adenocarcinoma. For symptomatic cases, surgical resection is an appropriate treatment option; however, excision of the bladder apex is controversial in some cases.

At our institution, surgical intervention is performed for symptomatic UR. Our policy regarding UR involves preoperative imaging to assess whether UR continues toward the bladder to ensure that complete resection can be performed and pathologically confirmed. If UR does not continue to the bladder apex, that is, in case of urachal sinus, the trans-umbilicus (TU) approach is selected to excise UR because it is enough to completely excise the urachal sinus. However, if UR continues to the bladder apex, that is, in case of a patent urachus, the TU approach is considered as the first option, and laparoscopy is added (laparoscopy-assisted trans-umbilicus [LATU] approach) if the bladder apex cannot be removed from the umbilical site by the TU approach. If preoperative imaging shows that the UR does not continue to the bladder apex and is limited near the umbilicus, and intraoperative findings are consistent with preoperative findings, UR is resected at the fibromuscular cord-like structure, and the bladder apex is not excised. If the UR continues to the bladder apex, the UR and bladder apex are both excised.

Several studies have evaluated the operative time, cosmetic appearance, and surgical outcomes of the TU and LATU approaches for UR excision. However, no studies have discussed whether an appropriate approach to UR excision can be determined using preoperative imaging and confirmed by pathological findings. This study aimed to evaluate pathological examination results to assess the validity of our policy of performing preoperative imaging to determine an appropriate UR resection approach.

### Clinical presentation and urachal remnant pathology: implications for treatment [^1113Aorh]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Symptomatic pediatric urachal remnants are frequently excised but to our knowledge it is unknown whether incidentally identified urachal remnants require removal. Urachal remnant excision in childhood is advocated to avoid future malignancy. Urachal anomalies that contain fibrostromal tissue without epithelium may have lower malignant potential and not require excision. In contrast, lesions with epithelium may have increased potential to undergo malignant transformation. We examined whether incidentally identified urachal remnants would be less likely to contain epithelial elements and not require removal.

Materials and Methods

At our institution 29 patients underwent surgical excision of a urachal anomaly from 1999 to 2008. We retrospectively investigated the presentation mode, radiographic findings, associated genitourinary abnormalities, operative approach, tissue pathology, complications and followup in each patient.

Results

The male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1. Patient presentation was incidental (5) or symptomatic (24). Symptomatic presentations included umbilical discharge without omphalitis in 13 cases, umbilical discharge with omphalitis in 7, omphalitis without umbilical discharge in 3 and urinary tract infection in 1. The epithelial types identified were transitional, gastrointestinal, squamous, metaplastic and mixed. Epithelium was present on pathological analysis in 3 of 5 patients who presented incidentally and in 17 of 24 who presented symptomatically. Statistical analysis showed no association between presentation mode and pathology (p = 0.63). Five patients 4 weeks to 2.5 months old had vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystourethrogram for urachal remnant evaluation.

Conclusions

Analysis of 29 patients with urachal anomalies showed no association between incidental presentation and fibrostromal pathology. Patients presenting without symptoms were as likely to have epithelial elements in the urachal remnant as those presenting with symptoms. We could not define treatment recommendations for incidentally identified urachal remnants based on predicting the histopathological composition.

### From prenatal detection to postnatal evaluation: a retrospective observational ultrasound study of patent urachus with allantoic cyst [^111xcEy1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

First trimester ultrasound findings

In the first trimester, all nine fetuses exhibited a dumbbell-shaped appearance on ultrasound images, which consisted of allantoic cyst, patent urachus, and bladder (Fig. 1 a). Except for one case (Case 9) in which regular prenatal examinations were abandoned from the second trimester onwards, the remaining eight cases were included in this study. Among them, case 5 involved one twin in a dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy, Case 6 involved conjoined twins in a dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy, where the two fetuses are umbilically conjoined and share a common bladder, while the remaining six cases were singletons. All fetuses exhibited normal NT thickness. PUAC was initially diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation, with a median gestational age of 13 weeks (interquartile range [IQR]: 12–15 weeks). The diameter of allantoic cysts ranged from 18 to 28 mm (median: 22 mm; IQR: 20.5–25 mm), and the diameter of fetal bladder ranged from 6 to 17 mm (median: 12 mm; IQR: 8–13 mm). The urachus width ranged from 1 to 2.5 mm. Color Doppler imaging revealed umbilical vessels surrounding the bladder and umbilical cyst (Fig. 1 b). Distant umbilical cord cysts were found in 7 cases, with diameters ranging from 13 mm to 47 mm (Fig. 1 c).

Prenatal ultrasound changes

Case 1–5 received serial antenatal ultrasonography. During the early part of the second trimester, these fetuses continued to exhibit a dumbbell-shaped appearance on ultrasound images (Fig. 1 d). The allantoic cysts gradually increased in size as gestational age progressed (Fig. 2). In the majority of cases (Cases 1–3 and 5), the cysts demonstrated progressive enlargement, attaining maximum diameters ranging from 26 to 53 mm during gestational weeks 19 to 29. Subsequent cyst rupture was accompanied by protrusion of small umbilical masses through defects in the lower abdominal wall (Fig. 1 e), with partial shrinkage or complete resolution of the umbilical cord cysts. Subsequently, during third-trimester monitoring, the small umbilical masses further enlarged in two cases (Case 1 and 5) (Fig. 1 f), slightly shrunk in one case (Case 3), and significantly shrunk in the other case which was invisible in 34 weeks of gestation (Case 2). Prenatal ultrasound progression of the umbilical mass was shown in Fig. 3. In case 4, the allantoic cyst reached its maximum diameter of 56 mm at 30 weeks of gestation, followed by a slightly reduction before delivery, without any evident mass protruding from the anterior abdominal wall throughout the pregnancy.

After the allantoic cysts ruptured, the changes of the umbilical mass were varied

In addition, we noticed that over half of the fetuses displayed transient or persistent dilatation of the renal pelvis (5–6 mm). There were no significant abnormalities in the size, cortex thickness, and echo intensity of the fetal kidneys. No significant lower urinary tract obstruction was detected in any of the cases, and the AFV was within the normal range throughout the pregnancy. Table 1 shows the demographics and ultrasonographic features of nine PUAC cases.

### Granulomatous inflammation masquerading as an infected urachal cyst [^113iK8WH]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Errors in urachal obliteration may result in 4 clinical anomalies: patent urachus, urachal cyst, urachal sinus, or vesicourachal diverticulum. Despite the fact that urachal cysts are one of the more common of these anomalies, most go undetected, presenting in the setting of infection. There are reports in the literature of cysts misdiagnosed as other inflammatory processes; however, the converse is reported with less frequency. We present the case of a 3-year-old girl who was admitted to our institution with a suspected urachal cyst. This was subsequently diagnosed as a granulomatous mass caused by the gram negative bacterium Bartonella.

### Management of urachal anomalies in children: insights from a retrospective cohort study [^117BAcXN]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Historically, surgical excision has been part of the standard protocol for management of UA due to the concern for infection and the rare chance of urachal malignancies later in life. However, urachal cancers are very rare, and no evidence exists demonstrating that UAs in pediatric patients increase the likelihood of future malignancy (Arora et al.). Gleason et al. reported that 5721 UAs would need to be excised in order to prevent a single case of urachal adenocarcinoma out of 65 000 patients studied. Surgical excision of UA solely as a preventative measure against later malignancy appears to have minimal support in literature. Thus, non-operative management of symptomatic patients has become the preferred reasonable alternative to surgical treatment in contemporary practice. One study reported that 44 (56.4%) symptomatic patients had resolution of symptoms under observation. Another reported successful resolution of symptoms in 9 out of the 13 total patients. A study by Lipskar et al. even found three patients who had infected cysts recovered successfully with non-operative management of abscess drainage and treatment with antibiotics. When surgery becomes required, recommendations vary as to the ideal age for intervention, ranging from 6 months to 1 years.

However, that does not address the risk of future infections in asymptomatic patients. A study by Ueno et al. was one of the first to recommend non-invasive management for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Zieger et al. posited that likely spontaneous involution of the UA during the first 6 months of life is common, so serial monitoring of UA in infants instead of excision is preferred in infancy. Naiditch et al. recommended non-operative management for asymptomatic UA without developing complications in the face of postoperative complication rate of 15% in 34 of their surgically treated patients, reported lower elsewhere in the literature. One study, while advocating for conservative treatment for asymptomatic UA, also recommends that patients with large cysts who do not achieve clinical or radiological resolution should undergo laparoscopic excision.

In recent years, clinicians have sought to formulate an algorithmic approach to managing UAs. Lipskar et al. suggested such an algorithm predicated on symptom presentation, type of UA, and whether UA resolution was achieved after conservative treatment. Gelikman et al. conducted a meta-analysis to investigate which predictive factors determine the need for surgical management. The analysis failed to identify any predictive factors to guide management of UA in pediatric patients.

### Preoperative imaging contributes to pathologically complete resection of the urachal remnant by determining an appropriate surgical approach without unnecessary and excessive surgical invasion: a retrospective study [^111iWsEc]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The urachus is an embryonic structure that connects the bladder to the allantois during early embryonic development. Occasionally, it fails to disappear at birth, leading to a case of urachal remnant (UR). This study aimed to determine whether our policy for selecting an appropriate UR resection approach is valid. We performed preoperative imaging to examine whether UR continued toward the bladder apex. If so, the UR and bladder apex were excised using the trans-umbilical approach, in addition to laparoscopy, if necessary. If preoperative imaging indicated that the UR ended near the umbilicus, the UR from the umbilicus to the duct end was resected. Pathological evaluations were performed to determine the appropriateness of the surgical approach indicated by preoperative imaging.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients with UR who underwent surgery between 2015 and 2021. Their background characteristics and surgical outcomes were evaluated.

Results

Twenty patients with UR were included (median age, 7 [interquartile range, 2–10.25] years). UR continued toward the bladder apex in 10 patients and ended near the umbilicus in 10 patients. Urachus tissue at the bladder site was observed when the UR and bladder apex were excised. When UR was resected from the umbilicus to the duct end, urachus tissue was not pathologically detected at the resection margin.

Conclusion

Our policy results in complete resection without excessive surgical invasion.

### Urachal anomalies: ultrasonography and management [^112EDfdP]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Fifty-six children with anomalies of the urachus remnant identified by ultrasound scan have been encountered in the authors' hospital over the last 4 years.

Methods

Twenty of these 56 cases were symptomatic urachal remnants, whereas the urachus remnants were seen incidentally by ultrasound scanning in the other 36 patients. Symptomatic cases were treated with antibiotics or observation. Then, symptomatic cases were divided into 2 groups. One group, surgical group, was treated with surgical resection of the urachal remnant. The other group, observation group, was followed up without its surgical resection. Forty-four patients, 11 cases of symptomatic urachal remnant and 33 asymptomatic cases, were followed up, excluding patients who had surgical treatment and who were lost to follow-up.

Results

Thirty patients underwent periodical ultrasonographic examination during follow-up. In 9 cases, including 2 symptomatic cases, urachal remnants have disappeared during the follow-up period spontaneously. No symptom had developed during follow-up from asymptomatic cases.

Conclusions

The patients with asymptomatic urachal remnants do not require follow-up, and urachal remnants, especially those under 1 year of age, do not require surgical resection unless the patient has multiple episodes.

### Urachal anomalies: a longitudinal study of urachal remnants in children and adults [^114rVCaq]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Urachal anomalies are often recognized in children but they may persist into adulthood and cause considerable morbidity. We reviewed the clinical findings associated with these embryological structures and evaluated risk factors for cancer to define the optimal timing for intervention.

Materials and Methods

We examined the medical records of 176 patients diagnosed with a urachal anomaly between 1951 and 2005. Association of clinicopathological features with malignancy for adults was evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression studies.

Results

Urachal remnants were identified in 46 children and 130 adults. Of the 46 children 20 (43%) presented with umbilical drainage and 23 (50%) could be diagnosed by physical examination. A total of 34 children (74%) underwent simple excision. In contrast, 65 of the 130 adults (50%) presented with hematuria, 78 (60%) required cystoscopy and 53 (41%) required computerized tomography. A total of 66 adults (51%) required more extensive surgical intervention with partial or radical cystectomy. Of adult urachal anomalies 66 (51%) were malignant. Patient age 55 years or older and hematuria were the strongest predictors of urachal malignancy (each p < 0.001). Cancer risk increased with advancing adult age.

Conclusions

Urachal anomalies present and progress differently in pediatric and adult populations. Adults are at high risk for urachal cancer but children usually incur lower morbidity. Urachal lesions noted early in childhood should be excised to prevent problems in adulthood.

### Management of urachal anomalies in children: insights from a retrospective cohort study [^113f1gvo]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study sheds light on the management of UAs in pediatric patients. While once considered rare, modern imaging has revealed their higher prevalence. Current management includes both observation and surgical excision, with no clear consensus. Prophylactic excision for malignancy prevention lacks evidence support. Further research is needed for evidence-based guidelines.

### Incidental findings in female pelvis MRI performed for gynaecological malignancies [^1165WifU]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Urachal cyst

During embryonic life, the urachus connects the foetal bladder to the allantois. Normally, it obliterates before birth, forming the median umbilical ligament, which connects the bladder to the umbilicus. Urachal abnormalities occur when this structure persists after birth. They have an approximate incidence of 1 in 5000 with a slight male predominance.

Urachal cysts (UC) represent 30% of urachal abnormalities. They are usually detected incidentally on imaging in asymptomatic patients but can rarely cause abdominal pain due to haemorrhage or rupture. On MRI, UC appear as round midline lesions, with thin walls and fluid content, showing high signal intensity (SI) on T2-WI and low SI on T1-WI, sometimes containing calcifications (Fig. 2). An associated umbilical-urachal sinus, which represents dilatation of the urachus umbilical end, can be found.

Prophylactic excision of UC in asymptomatic adult patients, though controversial, can be considered to prevent infections or malignant transformation.

Urethral diverticulum (UD)

UD represents a focal dilatation of the urethra, most commonly seen in women (0.6–6%). Congenital female UD is rare. Patients can be asymptomatic or present with urinary symptoms.

UD typically originates from the posterolateral wall of the middle third of the urethra. On sagittal T2WI, these lesions can elevate the bladder base, mimicking the shape of an enlarged male prostate.

On MRI, UD appears as a fluid-filled cavity, usually located anterior to the vagina, showing high SI on T2-WI (Fig. 2). Contrast administration can help detect complications such as infection or malignant transformation. In cases of infection, UD may demonstrate thickened walls, multiple enhancing septa and heterogenous endoluminal material. Cancers arising in the UD are extremely rare, with fewer than 100 cases described. Asymptomatic patients can be managed conservatively with follow-up, whereas surgery is usually the primary treatment option in cases of symptomatic UD.

### A case of urinary bladder agenesis and bilateral ectopic ureters: a case report [^116YMZeL]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We present a case of bladder agenesis associated with several other congenital anomalies. To our knowledge, this is the 26 th live-birth case of bladder agenesis reported in the literature.

The underlying etiology remains indeterminate and was postulated to be due to an insult at the 5th to 7 th week of embryogenesis, leading to urogenital sinus injury. Alternatively, the etiologymay be related to lack of urinary bladder distention with urine due to failure of integration of the ureters and mesonephric ducts into the trigone.

Age, presentation and outcome are variable and depend on the associated anomalies. Most cases present during infancy or childhood. Only one reported case presented as an adult, at the age of 22 years. There is female predominance, where girls are affected thirty times more than boys; reported cases have all been females except for four males. This predominance is explained by the anatomy of the reproductive system of females that enables them to maintain urine drainage, as opposed to male patients who are usually stillborn or die early. Male neonates with absent bladder can survive only if urine drainage is allowed through ectopic ureteric insertion into the rectum or a patent urachus. Similar to our case, patients with bladder agenesis frequently present with recurrent UTIs, or with symptoms related to other associated anomalies. Prognosis of these patients is variable but is poor overall. Only one-third of reported cases survive after birth.

Our case, as with most reported cases, is a female with a presentation of ambiguous genitalia and recurrent UTIs associated with several anomalies. Specifically, our case had urinary bladder agenesis, bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, ectopic insertion of the ureters into the vagina, dysplastic right kidney, uterus didelphys, low aortic bifurcation with superficial course of the right iliac artery posterior to the anterior abdominal wall, absent internal iliac vessels and a segmentation anomaly of the spine. There was a considerable delay in the patient's diagnosis with bladder agenesis, as she was diagnosed at the age of 6 months. This delay was due to the rarity of the condition, requiring an advanced center for management. Despite this limitation, we had good radiological tests, a good pediatric nephrology team and an expert pediatric urologist.

### Management of urachal anomalies in pediatric patients: a comparison of treatment strategies between pediatric urology and general surgery [^1136dKkz]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Persistence of embryonic urachal structures due to a failure of the urachus to involute into the median umbilical ligament is known as a urachal anomaly (UA). UAs may remain asymptomatic or lead to abdominal pain and recurrent infections. Management of UAs in pediatric patients has historically lacked a clear consensus between conservative and surgical management. While both urologists and general surgeons manage this pathology, a comparison of management style and outcomes between these specialties has not been published to our knowledge.

Objective

To (1) evaluate trends in management of UAs among pediatric urologists and general surgeons across three tertiary care children's hospitals and (2) identify factors that place patients at higher risk for requiring surgery.

Study Design

All patients diagnosed with a UA from 2016 to 2020 at our multi-site institution were identified by ICD-10 code Q64.4 "malformation of the urachus" and retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, treatment specialty, remnant subtype, and management strategy were recorded. Data was dichotomized between both urology and general surgery as well as between surgical and nonsurgical intervention to identify and compare management strategies.

Results

Overall, 143 patients diagnosed with UAs were identified. Of these patients, 74 were treated by urology and 69 were treated by general surgery. Patients who were treated by urology were significantly more likely to receive conservative treatment (66.2% treated conservatively vs. 33.8% treated surgically), while patients treated by general surgery were significantly more likely to undergo surgery (84.1% treated surgically vs. 15.9% treated conservatively, p < .0001). Though, urology was more likely to treat patients who presented incidentally (p < .01), and general surgery was more likely to treat patients who presented with an infected remnant (p < .01). Patients of male sex were more likely overall to receive surgery compared to female patients (p < .01).

Discussion

Management of UAs by urologists was more conservative than general surgeons. However, both specialties treat distinctly different patient presentations, with urology managing more incidental remnants and general surgery operating on more emergent, infected urachi. Limitations of the study included its retrospective nature and the insufficient reporting of urachal remnant subtypes and presence of infection among patients.

Conclusions

Management strategies of UAs differ among urology and general surgery, but surgical and conservative treatments are necessary to appropriately treat their distinct patient populations. This study provides valuable insight into current practices of UA management and may help to inform future treatment.

### Management of urachal anomalies in children: insights from a retrospective cohort study [^112H1R6m]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Seventy-eight patients met the inclusion criteria and were divided into non-excised (n = 43) group and excised (n = 35) group. The excised group had a higher median age at presentation compared with the non-excised group (73 months vs. 5 months, p = 0q.002).

In the non-excised cohort, 22 (51.2%) patients had a history of infection. Among them, 33.0% received medical management and responded to treatment, while 18.0% experienced symptom resolution at presentation, leading to continued observation without intervention.

Symptomatic presentation was more common in the excised group (85.7% vs. 65.1%, p = 0.038), with umbilical drainage (74.4%) and abdominal pain/tenderness (53.4%) being the most common symptoms. Radiological interpretation revealed hypoechogenic structure (32.0%) and heterogeneous/complex structure (25.3%) as the most common findings. Urachal remnant was reported more frequently in the non-excised group (72.1% vs. 48.6%, p = 0.034), while urachal cyst was more prevalent in the excised cohort (62.9% vs. 25.6%, p < 0.001) (table 1).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the study cohort

Laparoscopic excision was the primary surgical approach (80.0%), followed by robotic (11.4%). Histopathological analysis showed urothelium/urothelial lining (43.8%) and fibroadipose tissue (40.6%) as the most common findings, with no cases of pre or active malignancy. Postoperatively, 5.7% of children experienced Clavien-Dindo grade I complications. The excised group had a longer median follow-up duration compared with the non-excised group (7 months vs. 2.5 months, p = 0.025).

Multivariable regression analysis identified infection (p = 0.046) and urachal cyst classification on US (p = 0.008) as factors associated with surgical intervention (table 2).

### Endometriosis MR mimickers: T1-hyperintense lesions [^116a94UX]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Urachus

Urachal cysts

The urachus is a ductal remnant that forms during early embryological development, connecting the bladder dome to the umbilicus. Normally, the urachus undergoes involution and its lumen is obliterated. However, in some cases, remnants of the urachus can persist and result in various abnormalities such as urachal fistula, umbilical-urachal sinus, urachal cyst, and vesico-urachal diverticulum. These abnormalities are often discovered incidentally during MR imaging performed for unrelated reasons. Urachal cysts occur when a segment of the urachus fails to close, most commonly in the lower third of the urachal tract. These cysts are typically small and asymptomatic. On imaging, the presence of a fluid-filled structure along the midline of the urachal course indicates an uncomplicated cyst. The signal intensity within the cyst can vary, ranging from low to high signal intensity on T1-WI depending on the presence of mucoid material and proteinaceous content (Supplemental - Figure 8).

Artifacts

Having a thorough understanding of MRI artifacts is crucial when conducting pelvic imaging. Their presence can mask, distort, or mimic pathological lesions, potentially leading to misinterpretation of the images.

### Abdominal wall defects [^113VpWaE]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2 most common congenital abdominal wall defects are gastroschisis and omphalocele. Both are usually diagnosed prenatally with fetal ultrasonography, and affected patients are treated at a center with access to high-risk obstetric services, neonatology, and pediatric surgery. The main distinguishing features between the 2 are that gastroschisis has no sac and the defect is to the right of the umbilicus, whereas an omphalocele typically has a sac and the defect is at the umbilicus. In addition, patients with an omphalocele have a high prevalence of associated anomalies, whereas those with gastroschisis have a higher likelihood of abnormalities related to the gastrointestinal tract, with the most common being intestinal atresia. As such, the prognosis in patients with omphalocele is primarily affected by the severity and number of other anomalies and the prognosis for gastroschisis is correlated with the amount and function of the bowel. Because of these distinctions, these defects have different management strategies and outcomes. The goal of surgical treatment for both conditions consists of reduction of the abdominal viscera and closure of the abdominal wall defect; primary closure or a variety of staged approaches can be used without injury to the intra-abdominal contents through direct injury or increased intra-abdominal pressure, or abdominal compartment syndrome. Overall, the long-term outcome is generally good. The ability to stratify patients, particularly those with gastroschisis, based on risk factors for higher morbidity would potentially improve counseling and outcomes.

### Urachal remnant perforation during umbilical vein catheterization in a newborn [^112THaZE]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Urachal remnants are uncommon congenital anomalies of the bladder that can be injured during attempted catheterization of an umbilical artery or vein. We present the case of a newborn boy who developed urinary ascites after undergoing an attempted umbilical vein catheterization. He subsequently underwent successful surgical repair of a perforated urachal remnant.

### Conservative management of urachal anomalies [^111eWGZr]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends in management of urachal anomalies at our institution and the safety of nonoperative care.

Methods

Based on our experience managing urachal remnants from 2000 to 2010 (reported in 2012), we adopted a more conservative approach, including preoperative antibiotic use, refraining from using voiding cystourethrograms (VCUG), postponing surgery until at least six months of age, and considering nonoperative management. A retrospective analysis of urachal anomaly cases was conducted (2011–2016) to assess trends in practice. Charts indicating anomalies of the urachus were pulled and trends in management (nonoperative versus surgical treatment), VCUG and antibiotic use, and outcomes were reviewed.

Results

Data from 2000–2010 and 2013–2016 were compared. Our findings indicate care has shifted towards nonoperative management. A smaller proportion of patients from 2013–2016 was treated surgically compared to 2000–2010. Patients receiving nonoperative treatment exhibited lower rates of complication relative to surgically managed cases. VCUGs were eliminated as a diagnostic tool for evaluating urachal anomalies. Prophylactic preoperative antibiotic use was standardized. No patients with a known urachal remnant presented later with an abscess or sepsis.

Conclusions

We find that a shift towards nonoperative treatment of urachal anomalies did not adversely affect overall outcomes. We recommend observing minimally symptomatic patients, especially those under six months old.

### The crying sign: the winking umbilical cord [^113ucoR7]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A preterm baby girl, born at 34weeks gestation, with features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome was noted to have a relatively large umbilical stump. No fetal abnormalities had been detected on anatomy scan at 28weeks and only mild polyhydramnios and macrosomia were noted on a 32-week ultrasound scan. Although there was no obvious omphalocoele, clinical assessment of the umbilical cord revealed an abdominal wall defect through which bowel would protrude into the umbilicus when the infant was crying. In keeping with an abdominal wall defect α-fetoprotein was found to be elevated. Surgical consultation advised conservative management. Subsequently, detachment of the umbilical cord occurred 1week postdischarge and a large umbilical hernia persists. Genetic analysis confirmed a diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

### The anatomical compartments and their connections as demonstrated by ectopic air [^114JtHQS]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The umbilicovesical fascia runs inferiorly from the umbilicus, posterior to tranversalis fascia and anterior to parietal peritoneum, with a triangular configuration with its apex at the umbilicus. It surrounds the urachus and obliterated umbilical arteries. Courses on the pelvis below the peritoneal reflection and extends to the pelvis floor surrounding the urinary bladder, then blending with the endopelvic visceral fascia along the lateral aspects of the lower uterus or seminal vesicles and the rectum.

Pelvic cul-de-sacs between the rectum and bladder (the rectovesical space in males), and rectum and uterus (the Douglas cul-de-sac in females) are shaped by parietal peritoneum reflections. These reflections extend inferiorly, and their anterior and posterior sleeves are fused, originating septa that separate the urological or genital tract from the rectum: rectovesical and rectovaginal septum.

### A febrile infant with abdominal erythema and irritability [^113CEksE]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Omphalitis can rapidly progress, has high morbidity, and mortality ranges 7% to 15%, thus, early recognition is critical. Because of the cause associated with cutting and healing of the umbilical cord, it is uncommon for omphalitis to occur outside the newborn period. -, In these cases, the differential should be broadened, and internal sources that then infect the umbilical stump and surrounding tissues need to be considered, including infected remnants of prenatal structures associated with the umbilicus. As such, advanced imaging is typically required to identify the source, and surgical management is often warranted.

A perforated or ruptured Meckel's diverticulum is one of these rare causes of nonneonatal omphalitis. A Meckel's diverticulum is a true diverticulum that involves all 3 layers of the bowel wall. It is a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, also known as the vitelline duct or yolk stalk. Diagnosis of a Meckel's diverticulum is typically made only when pursued due to clinical complications, and is challenging since CT and ultrasound may conflate a diverticulum as normal bowel. A technetium-99m pertechnetate scan is considered the gold standard, but is not widely available, and is specific only to the Meckel's diagnosis. Ruptured Meckel's diverticulum is itself an uncommon complication. Although there are case reports and series occurring in the neonatal periodand in children older than 12 months, the incidence occurring in nonnewborn infancy has only been reported twice since 1975. Presenting symptoms are variable, but common complications include bloody stool, bowel obstruction, sepsis, peritonitis, and much less commonly, as reported in our case, omphalitis.

Final Diagnosis

Ruptured Meckel's diverticulum with resulting umbilical stalk abscess and omphalitis.

### A case report of single umbilical artery combined with fetal bladder exstrophy in singleton pregnancy and related literature review [^116YdnsX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Differentiating diagnosis

BE is not difficult to diagnose when there is a typical indication of absence of bladder filling. BE should be differentially diagnosed apart from omphalocele, gastroschisis and cloacal exstrophy, patent urachal prolapse with bladder prolapse or patent urachal cyst with allantoic cyst. The former two can show a normal bladder in the pelvis. However, when intestinal, anal atresia, spinal cord abnormalities and external genitalia are present at the same time, cloacal exstrophy should be suspected. The latter two usually exist in isolation, and they often do not appear together with symphysis pubis separation or external genital malformation.

### Non-invasive, low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma in the urachus [^1131H68b]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

The urachus is a duct connecting the allantois with the fetal bladder, forming the median umbilical ligament; it usually obliterates during fetal life. Carcinomas arising from urachal remnants are rare but associated with a poor prognosis. We present one case of non-invasive urachal papillary urothelial carcinoma, and through a systematic literature search, we identified 12 additional cases of urachal urothelial carcinoma reported in English literature in the past 20 years. The cases were compared according to the Sheldon Staging System and the Mayo Staging System presented by Ashley et al in 2006, and both Staging Systems tend to predict clinical outcome. The urachal carcinoma is an important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with haematuria or an infraumbilical mass, because the symptoms may be sparse and diagnosis at an early stage is essential for successful treatment.

### Vesicoureteral reflux in children with urachal anomalies [^1174pPVZ]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We report the largest known series of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children with urachal anomalies (UA).

Methods

Two institutions' records were reviewed for children with UA (1951‒2007).

Results

Of 30 girls and 36 boys with UA (34 urachal cysts, 14 patent urachus, 10 urachal diverticula, 7 urachal sinuses, and 1 unknown), 57 (86%) underwent surgical resection or drainage. A voiding cystourethrogram was obtained in 22 (33%). VUR was demonstrated in 14 of the 22 children (64%), and rates were similar among the various types of UA. The median age with versus without VUR was not different (1.3 vs 1.7 years, P = 0.97). Of 24 refluxing renal units, classification was grade ≤ 3 in 71%, 4‒5 in 12%, and unspecified in 17%. Four children (26%) underwent ureteroneocystostomy and 10 observed patients resolved spontaneously.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, this is the first series of VUR associated with UA. The increased incidence of VUR (64%) in this small subset of patients warrants prospective studies to determine if there is a positive correlation with UA. We believe thorough genitourinary and family histories are important when evaluating children with UA to help detect clinically significant VUR.

### Umbilical cord sparing technique of umbilicoplasty in infants with giant omphalocele [^1117v7j4]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

All patients underwent primary repair of the defect using a consistent new surgical technique. The size of the defect was measured at the time of surgery. The operation was performed under general anesthesia. Nasogastric tubes and urinary catheters were placed. The marker is marked along the midline of the body to facilitate the skin along the midline. The bulges were excised along the edge of the skin, retaining the 1 cm × 1 cm peritoneum and capsule at the root of the umbilical cord, breaking off and ligating the umbilical vein, and retaining the urethus and the umbilical artery on the second side of the umbilical cord. Then, the intestines, gallbladder, liver organs, and other organs for combined deformity were checked. The bilateral abdominal wall muscle layers were pulled back to enlarge the abdominal cavity volume and return to all the exposed organs. Absorbable suture was used to close the peritoneal layer and the muscle layer, trim the skin and free the skin and the muscle fascia layer, and close the muscle layer fascia. The suture was taken to vigorously ligate the peritoneum, capsule, urachus, and umbilical artery along the umbilical cord root. The fascia layer was stitched with 3–0 barbed lines or 5–0 sutures (figure 1).

Figure 1
(A) Preoperative abdomen; (B) intraoperative exploration; (C) intraoperative umbilical cord preservation; (D) postoperative abdomen and postoperative umbilical morphology; (E) postoperative 2-week re-examination; (F) postoperative 4-week re-examination; (G) postoperative March re-examination; and (H) postoperative June re-examination results show that the umbilical cord is well-formed.

In this study, primary closure of the fascial defect and umbilicoplasty were performed in 14 neonates with giant omphalocele. During the procedure, the fascial defect is easily closed through the umbilical skin defect without undermining the skin from the fascial edges and umbilical cord elements. The preserved umbilical cord is ligated by a line and usually falls spontaneously 2–3 weeks after surgery. The postoperative follow-up results showed that the umbilical morphology of the child was natural-looking, with no flattening or disappearance.

### Genitourinary imaging: part 1, congenital urinary anomalies and their management [^114Rz45j]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Congenital urinary anomalies may be symptomatic or encountered during imaging for other clinical indications. The array of abnormalities is related to the embryologic stage at the time of the developmental insult, and these abnormalities result in a spectrum of conditions ranging from insignificant to incompatible with life.

Conclusion

Understanding the implications of common congenital urinary anomalies is the key to detecting associated anomalies, initiating therapy, and avoiding both complications and unnecessary intervention.

### Inferior gastroschisis [^113sLPyJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Gastroschisis is a common defect of the central abdominal wall, nearly always located to the right of the umbilicus. We report a baby boy with gastroschisis who had a defect on the inferior side of an intact and normal umbilical cord which was managed by primary repair and an uneventful recovery. Such a case has never been reported in the literature. This case contributes towards enlarging the spectrum of gastroschisis.

We report an otherwise well developing 2-year-old girl who presented with a urachal sinus with its opening located at the midline between umbilicus and the pubic symphysis. Diagnosis was made by ultrasound preoperatively, and confirmed during surgery. Additionally, columnar epithelium was found in the portion of sinus tract traversing the abdominal wall. Metaplasia of the sinus tract is worrisome, as urachal carcinomas have been traditionally characterized to result from this process.

### Urachal anomalies in children: surgical or conservative treatment? [^1148RyNH]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To shed light on the current controversy regarding the best treatment option for managing urachal anomalies in children.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective follow-up of a case series comprising 13 children who were diagnosed with urachal anomalies was performed. All cases were diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 and followed up at the Pediatric Urology Unit of San Cecilio University Hospital in Granada (Spain). Information about the baseline and follow-up variables was collected from clinical records.

Results

Nine of the 13 patients were symptomatic (6 patients with urachal cysts and 3 patients with urachal persistency). Conservative management was originally used in all but one case. During follow-up, reinfection appeared in two cases, and these patients were treated surgically. Spontaneous resolution was achieved in eight cases (61.5%). Two children with persistent urachal cysts are still being followed (4 and 6 years after the diagnosis), although ultrasound monitoring reveals a gradual reduction in the size of the cysts. The median time between diagnosis and resolution was 16.5 months.

Conclusion

With the exception of cases in which there is a clear indication for surgery (i.e. reinfection), a conservative approach based on regular monitoring may be useful.

### Preoperative imaging contributes to pathologically complete resection of the urachal remnant by determining an appropriate surgical approach without unnecessary and excessive surgical invasion: a retrospective study [^111EnRwk]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathological findings indicated that the urachus tissue at the bladder site was present when preoperative imaging showed that the UR continued toward the bladder apex. When preoperative imaging showed that the UR did not continue to the bladder apex, urachus tissue was present near the umbilicus but ended at the fibromuscular cord-like structure and did not exist at the resected margin. A pathological examination of the resected sites (i.e. fibromuscular cord-like structure) revealed no urachus tissue; however, urachus tissue was pathologically observed near the umbilicus. All cases of UR that did not continue to the bladder apex were appropriately resected with negative pathological margins (Table 3).

Some imaging results and pathological findings are shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4. Figure 2 shows a 6-year-old boy whose preoperative US evaluation indicated that the UR continued toward the bladder apex. The TU approach was initially performed; however, the LATU approach was required to excise the UR and bladder apex in the end. Pathological findings revealed the existence of urachus tissue at the bladder apex. Figure 3 shows an 11-year-old girl whose preoperative CT evaluation indicated that UR existed at the bladder apex. The same operative process was performed. Pathological findings revealed the existence of urachus tissue at the bladder apex. Figure 4 shows a 10-year-old boy whose preoperative MRI evaluation indicated that the UR did not continue toward the bladder apex. The TU approach was sufficient for the complete excision of the UR, and the UR was resected at the fibromuscular cord-like structure. Pathological findings revealed fibrous tissue but no urachus tissue at the resected margin.

### A rare case of urachal adenocarcinoma with bone marrow metastasis [^113aKopa]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

The urachus is a fibrous, tubular vestigial remnant derived from the involution of two contiguous embryonic structures, one of which is the allantois, a derivative of the yolk sac, and the other being the cloaca, a cephalic extension of the urogenital sinus which is a precursor to the fetal bladder. The urachus usually involutes after the third trimester and is obliterated by fibrous proliferation thus remaining as the medial umbilical ligament, connecting the apex of the bladder dome to the umbilicus in the midline, without any remaining physiological function.

Urachal cancer is a rare, aggressive and often clinically silent disease due to its extravesical and extraperitoneal location. It accounts for less than 0.5% of bladder cancers and only 0.01% of all adult malignancies. Urachal cancer typically involves the dome of the bladder and is most often histologically characterised as adenocarcinoma in 80%–90% of cases, although the normal urachus is primarily lined by transitional epithelium. One proposed theory is that this occurs due to columnar metaplasia of the urachal mucosa while a competing theory suggests that this is due to malignant transformation of enteric epithelial rests within the urachal remnant left behind from the cloaca during embryological development. Histological subtype of urachal cancer most often reveals mucinous type in 50%–75% of cases, although 15%–25% of cases are enteric type, resembling colorectal adenocarcinomas and 6%–7% are signet ring cell type. The median age at the time of diagnosis is between 50 and 58 years old based on previous studies, which is much younger than non-urachal adenocarcinomas whose median age is around 69 years old. Urachal cancer also displays male predilection, with males representing between 60% and 68% of all cases.

Patients with urachal cancer often present with locally advanced or metastatic disease, most commonly metastatic to the lungs, liver, peritoneum, lymph nodes, brain and/or bone. Given the aggressive nature of urachal cancer, early diagnosis is paramount as there is significant divergence in both treatment and prognosis depending on stage. A retrospective study performed by Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota evaluated 49 patients with urachal cancer from 1950 to 2003 and found the median overall survival for stage I/II urachal cancer to be 10.8 years vs 1.3 years for stage IV urachal cancer.

### Late abdominal pregnancy in a post-conflict context: case of a mistaken acute abdomen-a case report [^112eW7Z1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Examination of the vulva and vagina were normal. The cervix was long, posterior, and not excitable. The os was closed. No abnormal discharge was noted.

Diagnosis of an acute abdomen in the third trimester of pregnancy was made and acute peritonitis was suspected. Differential diagnosis included appendicular or other bowel perforation.

The patient was admitted to hospital. An emergency ultrasound showed a single viable pregnancy at 33-weeks gestation with a low-lying placenta and oligoamnios. Initial hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dl with a hematocrit of 22.6%.

After intravenous access was obtained, intravenous fluids and initial pain management were started. The patient was counselled and consented for an emergency laparotomy.

She was taken to operating theatre and was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Both an obstetrician and a general surgeon scrubbed for the case. A sub-umbilical incision was made and then extended above the umbilicus. On entering the abdominal cavity, a huge reddish mass was identified. Fetal parts were visible through the membranes delineating the mass. There was minimal meconium stained amniotic fluid around the baby. Upon digital opening of the mass, a live 2000 g female baby in longitudinal lie with the head in the maternal pelvis was delivered [Fig. 1]. APGAR scores were 8, 6, and 9 at 1, 5 and 10 min respectively. The baby was immediately taken to neonatology for thorough screening by the paediatrics team and was found to be healthy with no congenital abnormalities. Careful exploration of the abdomen revealed a placenta implanted on the greater omentum and on the small bowel mesentery [Fig. 2]. There was no plane of cleavage and any manoeuver to remove the placenta was susceptible to bleeding. It was decided to leave the placenta in place. Membranes were stripped and the umbilical cord was cut near its placental insertion. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the surgery and no complications were noted. However, she did receive one unit of whole blood transfusion.

### Urachal adenocarcinoma in an adolescent boy: a case report [^112TuR8X]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The urachus is a three-layered tubular structure as a remnant of an embryonic structure. Urachal remnants result from failure of allantois lumen obliteration, and may lead to urinary symptoms and the development of urachal carcinoma at an older age. This anomaly is relatively uncommon, with a prevalence of 1% in children. Urachal carcinoma is an extremely rare malignant tumor originating from the urachus, with an incidence of 0.3% among all bladder cancers. The majority of cases are diagnosed in individuals in their 50s and 60s, with a median age at diagnosis of 52 years, according to a study reviewing 1,010 cases. Urachal adenocarcinoma has never been reported in patients under 20 years of age. Here, we describe a case of 15-year-old with urachal adenocarcinoma.

A previously healthy 3-week-old boy presented with 5 hours of marked fussiness, abdominal distention, and poor feeding. He was afebrile and well perfused. His examination was remarkable for localized abdominal tenderness and distention. He was referred to the emergency department in which an abdominal radiograph revealed gaseous distention of the bowel with a paucity of gas in the pelvis. Complete blood cell count and urinalysis were unremarkable. His ongoing fussiness and abnormal physical examination prompted consultation with surgery and radiology.

We present ultrasonographic manifestations and computed tomographic findings of an umbilical cyst originating from an omphalomesenteric duct remnant in a 6-year-old girl. In cases of umbilical cyst, radiographic evaluation alone may not differentiate an omphalomesenteric duct remnant with heterotopic gastric mucosa from a urachal remnant, and surgical intervention is required.

### Omphalocele | Birth defects… [^1164H8SS]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What it is Omphalocele, also known as exomphalos, is a birth defect of the abdominal wall. The infant's intestines, liver, or other organs stick outside of the belly through the belly button. The organs are covered in a thin, nearly transparent sac that usually is intact at birth. As babies develop in early pregnancy, the intestines get longer and push out from the belly into the umbilical cord. By the eleventh week of pregnancy, the intestines normally go back into the belly. If this does not happen, an omphalocele occurs. The omphalocele can be small with only some of the intestines outside of the belly. Or, it can be large, with many organs outside of the belly. Babies born with an omphalocele may have additional complications. Their abdominal cavity, the space in the body that holds these organs, might not grow to its normal size. Also, infection is a concern, especially if the sac around the organs is broken.

Sometimes, an organ might become pinched or twisted, and loss of blood flow might damage the organ. Babies born with an omphalocele often have other birth defects, such as heart defects, neural tube defects, and chromosomal abnormalities. Risk factors The causes of omphalocele in most cases are unknown. The role that genetics and the environment play in causing omphalocele needs to be studied further. Some known factors that may increase the risk of having a baby with omphalocele include:

- Alcohol or heavy tobacco use before or during pregnancy
- Use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy
- Pre-pregnancy obesity CDC continues to study birth defects such as omphalocele and how to prevent them. Screening and diagnosis An omphalocele can be diagnosed during pregnancy or after the baby is born. During pregnancy An omphalocele might result in an abnormal result on a blood or serum screening test. It might also be seen during an ultrasound.

After a baby is born In some cases, an omphalocele might not be diagnosed until after a baby is born. An omphalocele is seen immediately at birth. Treatment Treatment for infants with an omphalocele depends on a number of factors, including:

- The size of the omphalocele
- The presence of other birth defects or chromosomal abnormalities
- The baby's gestational age.

### 4.10 abdominal wall defects | CDC… [^115tLGys]. archive.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

4. 10 Abdominal wall defects Omphalocele Omphalocele or exomphalos is a birth defect of the central portion of the anterior abdomen in which the herniated organs are covered by a thin membrane. At times, the membrane – which consists of the peritoneum and amnion – might be ruptured or matted. The key finding in omphalocele is that the herniation occurs centrally – the organs herniate through an enlarged umbilical ring, with the umbilical cord inserting in the distal part of the membrane covering the defect. Careful examination of the newborn can confirm the diagnosis of omphalocele and help distinguish omphalocele from gastroschisis as well as from several rarer similar phenotypes.

Typically the membrane covering an omphalocele is thin and translucent, but at times this membrane will rupture during or shortly after birth and the surface of the membrane might appear matted and covered by fibrous material as a result of prolonged exposure to amniotic fluid in utero. Postnatal. Diagnosis Prenatal. Gastroschisis might be diagnosed or strongly suspected prenatally; however, it can be missed. Moreover, the distinction from omphalocele prenatally is difficult and error-prone. Also, in early pregnancy there is a normal physiologic hernia that might be confused with gastroschisis. For this reason, a prenatal diagnosis should always be confirmed postnatally. When this is not possible, the programme should have criteria in place to determine whether to accept or not accept a case based solely on prenatal data. Postnatal.

Careful examination of the newborn can confirm the diagnosis of gastroschisis and distinguish it from omphalocele and some other rare anomalies that might involve the anterior abdominal wall. Note that sometimes the organs herniated in gastroschisis might be covered by fibrous material, which is thought to result from prolonged exposure to amniotic fluid in utero.

### Gastroschisis | Birth defects… [^1114Ba2w]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Gastroschisis is a condition where the intestines extend outside of the body through a hole beside the belly button.
- Surgery places the abdominal organs inside the baby's body and repair the hole.
- Researchers estimate 1 in every 2, 400 babies is born with gastroschisis in the US. What it is Gastroschisis is a birth defect where there is a hole in the abdominal wall beside the belly button. This results in the baby's intestines extending outside of the baby's body. Sometimes other organs, such as the stomach and liver, can be found outside of the baby's body. Gastroschisis occurs early during pregnancy and the hole is usually to the right side of the belly button. Because the intestines are not covered in a protective sac and are exposed to the amniotic fluid, they can become irritated. This can cause them to shorten, twist, or swell. Risk factors The causes of gastroschisis in most cases are unknown.

It is likely caused by a combination of genes and other factors. Research studies have found some factors that might increase the risk of having a baby with gastroschisis:

- Young maternal age
- Alcohol or tobacco use in early pregnancy
- A urinary tract or sexually transmitted infection in early pregnancy. Screening and diagnosis Gastroschisis can be diagnosed during pregnancy or immediately after the baby is born. Gastroschisis might causes an abnormal result on a blood or serum screening test. It might also be seen during an ultrasound. Treatment Soon after birth, surgery will be needed to place the abdominal organs inside the baby's body and repair the hole. Even after the repair, infants can have problems with eating, digestion of food, and absorption of nutrients. If only some of the intestine is outside of the belly, it is usually treated with surgery soon after birth. If many organs are outside of the belly, the repair might be done slowly, in stages.

The exposed organs might be covered with a special material and slowly moved back, and then the opening is closed. Babies with gastroschisis often need other treatments as well. These can include receiving nutrients through an IV, antibiotics to prevent infection, and careful attention to control their body temperature.
