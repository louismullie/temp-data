## Question

A city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the singing and chanting of songs from 1:00P. M. to 1:00A. M. by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises where the singing takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect, several college students were walking down the street on their way to a victory celebration following a big college football game. They began loudly chanting, "We're number 1… we're number 1. " One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance?

Answer Choices:
A. The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First andFourteenth Amendments.
B. The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.
C. The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.
D. The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which constitutional argument against a noise ordinance that exempts religious singing is the weakest. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ordinance's core features and the applicable constitutional doctrines. Then, I should evaluate each answer choice against those doctrines, paying close attention to standing, ripeness, and the strength of precedent. Finally, I will identify the weakest argument and explain why the others are comparatively stronger, making sure I don't overstate any claims without support.

> Let me first confirm the ordinance's key elements and the constitutional framework. The ordinance prohibits singing or chanting by two or more persons from 1:00 PM to 1:00 AM if audible off-premises, but it expressly exempts religious songs; the students were arrested for chanting "We're number 1" in public. The relevant constitutional claims are First Amendment free speech, First Amendment Establishment Clause/equal protection, Due Process, and vagueness/overbreadth doctrines, so I need to keep each of these in mind as I assess the options.

> Now, Option A claims a First Amendment free speech violation. Wait, let me verify the strength here. Content-based restrictions on speech are presumptively unconstitutional and subject to strict scrutiny, and a religious exemption makes this look content-based on its face. The city would need to show the restriction is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest, which is a high bar, so this is a strong argument, not a weak one, and I should not understate it.

> Option B argues substantive due process, asserting the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Noise control is a classic police-power objective, and courts generally defer to localities on legitimate public welfare goals like peace and quiet. While the students could argue the restriction is arbitrary or excessive, the baseline legitimacy of noise regulation makes this a tough sell, so this is likely the weakest argument among the choices, but I should double-check that I'm not overstating deference.

> Option C claims the ordinance is vague and overbroad. I need to check the vagueness point carefully. The ordinance specifies the conduct (singing/chanting by two or more, audible off-premises, during the prohibited hours) and includes a religious exemption, so it is not facially vague; overbreadth is trickier, but because the religious exemption renders the restriction content-based, a facial overbreadth challenge could still be viable, though the better route is likely the content-discrimination argument. Still, this is not the weakest claim here.

> Option D argues an equal protection violation by distinguishing religious from nonreligious singing. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might be the weakest because equal protection often uses rational basis, but hold on, I should verify the standard. When a law draws a distinction based on religious content, it implicates the Establishment Clause and may also trigger heightened scrutiny under equal protection principles, making this a strong constitutional argument rather than a weak one, so I should correct that initial instinct.

> Comparing the options, the due process claim in B is the weakest because noise control is a recognized legitimate government interest, and the students would struggle to show the ordinance lacks any rational basis. By contrast, the free speech and equal protection/Establishment Clause arguments are materially stronger given the content-based nature of the restriction and the religious exemption, while the vagueness/overbreadth claim is plausible but secondary to the content-discrimination problem.

> Final answer: B. The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest. This is the weakest argument because noise regulation is a legitimate police-power objective, whereas the First Amendment and equal protection challenges are substantially stronger in this factual context.

---

The weakest argument is **B. Due process** because noise control is a legitimate government interest, and the ordinance's time-place-manner restrictions are rationally related to that interest. By contrast, the **First Amendment** (A) and **equal protection** (D) arguments are strong given the content-based distinction favoring religious speech, and the **vagueness/overbreadth** claim (C) is plausible but less decisive than B.

---

## Analysis of each argument

### A. First Amendment violation (freedom of expression)

- **Strength**: Strong. The ordinance is content-based, exempting religious songs, which triggers strict scrutiny and is presumptively unconstitutional unless narrowly tailored to a compelling interest.
- **Weakness**: The city may argue it serves a compelling interest in noise control, but the religious exemption undermines narrow tailoring.
- **Conclusion**: This is a strong argument for the students.

---

### B. Due process violation (lack of legitimate community interest)

- **Strength**: Weak. Noise control is a legitimate police-power interest, and courts defer to local judgments on public welfare.
- **Weakness**: The students must show the ordinance bears no rational relation to noise control, which is hard given the time and volume restrictions.
- **Conclusion**: This is the weakest argument.

---

### C. Vagueness and overbreadth

- **Strength**: Moderate. "Singing" and "audible off premises" could be vague, and the religious exemption may make the ordinance overbroad by chilling nonreligious speech.
- **Weakness**: The ordinance specifies conduct, time, and location, which may suffice for clarity; overbreadth is harder to prove outside the religious-exemption context.
- **Conclusion**: Plausible, but less compelling than A or D.

---

### D. Equal protection violation (religious discrimination)

- **Strength**: Strong. The religious exemption creates a content-based preference likely violating the Establishment Clause and equal protection.
- **Weakness**: The city may claim the exemption is justified, but strict scrutiny will be hard to satisfy.
- **Conclusion**: This is a strong argument for the students.

---

## Comparative strength of arguments

| **Argument** | **Strength** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| A. First Amendment | Strong | Content-based restriction; strict scrutiny applies |
| B. Due process | Weak | Noise control is a legitimate interest; rational basis likely satisfied |
| C. Vagueness/overbreadth | Moderate | Plausible but less decisive than A or D |
| D. Equal protection | Strong | Religious preference violates Establishment Clause/equal protection |

---

## Conclusion

The weakest argument is **B. Due process** because noise control is a legitimate government interest and the ordinance's restrictions are rationally related to that interest. The strongest arguments are **First Amendment** (A) and **equal protection** (D), with **vagueness/overbreadth** (C) as a secondary claim.

### Are zero tolerance policies effective in the schools? an evidentiary review and recommendations [^111XkfDA]. The American Psychologist (2008). Low credibility.

Although there can be no dispute that schools must do all that can be done to ensure the safety of learning environments, controversy has arisen about the use of zero tolerance policies and procedures to achieve those aims. In response to that controversy, and to assess the extent to which current practice benefits students and schools, the American Psychological Association convened a task force to evaluate the evidence and to make appropriate recommendations regarding zero tolerance policies and practices. An extensive review of the literature found that, despite a 20-year history of implementation, there are surprisingly few data that could directly test the assumptions of a zero tolerance approach to school discipline, and the data that are available tend to contradict those assumptions. Moreover, zero tolerance policies may negatively affect the relationship of education with juvenile justice and appear to conflict to some degree with current best knowledge concerning adolescent development. To address the needs of schools for discipline that can maintain school safety while maximizing student opportunity to learn, the report offers recommendations for both reforming zero tolerance where its implementation is necessary and for alternative practice to replace zero tolerance where a more appropriate approach is indicated.

### Policy-driven tobacco control [^113N5nUT]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Local resolutions and ordinances

Local resolutions or ordinances may be established by any government or board authorised to set formal rules, such as a city, county, tribe, fair board, transit authority, or housing authority. A resolution reflects a formalised, written decision adopted by a governing body that encourages and promotes a particular action or a desired outcome. Like voluntary policies, resolutions are generally not enforceable and are limited in scope.

A local legislative ordinance is a law reflecting a mandate or directive that must be adhered to by those under the specific jurisdiction. Legislative policies are relatively easy to track and measure, and violations are typically subject to legal penalties such as fines, imprisonment, or court orders. Legislative policies are also subject to tobacco industry efforts to influence, weaken, or defeat policy adoption. Given the tobacco industry's lack of credibility within many communities, their local efforts have generally been indirect and have focused on advocating for individual rights, disputing 'junk' science and providing erroneous calculations of economic impacts on local businesses.

Policy strength and iteration

The strength of a policy is dependent on a number of factors, including: restrictions, penalties, enforcement, implementation, public support, compliance and its lack of exemptions. A strong policy will include all of these factors and provide guidance regarding who may enforce the law and in what capacity. Compliance with a specific policy will be dependent on knowledge, social acceptance and successful policy implementation.

Using Rogers' model, the innovation and diffusion of a specific policy across jurisdictions allows for refinement or modification of the policy. This becomes an iterative process that can help build social acceptance, identify policy gaps or loopholes and strengthen protections and enforceability. While few communities fall into the innovator or early adopter categories, the rate of diffusion (policy adoption) increases as jurisdictions become increasingly more confident to modify and adopt similar or stronger policies. Other factors influencing policy strength and innovation include community size and political environment, as well as social and geographical proximity to other communities with similar policies.

### Individual medical emergencies occurring at school [^116hU9Zy]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Student transport and consent policy — schools determine whether a school staff member accompanies the student to the hospital, and if accompaniment occurs the staff member's role is to support the child rather than serve as a source of consent to medical treatment; the school is advised to develop a policy because states permit emergency medical treatment in the absence of parental consent, and it is preferable that multiple backup numbers of emergency contacts are available for each student's family.

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^115DkoSu]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Suspension and expulsion during early childhood education — prevalence and harms — include that during the 2020 to 2021 school year, nearly 1000 preschool students received 1 or more suspensions, and 220 preschool students were expelled; exclusionary school discipline in this early education period imposes a harsh penalty for behaviors likely still developmentally appropriate; suspension and expulsion of preschools is largely ineffective in decreasing physically aggressive behavior; repeated preschool suspensions and expulsions can exacerbate poverty and food insecurity by requiring caregivers to find costly alternative care or take leave from work; and this discipline can uproot children routines and impose stigmatizing labels on young children.

### Is there no alternative? Conscientious objection by medical students [^115X7YPc]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

Recent survey data gathered from British medical students reveal widespread acceptance of conscientious objection in medicine, despite the existence of strict policies in the UK that discourage conscientious refusals by students to aspects of their medical training. This disconnect demonstrates a pressing need to thoughtfully examine policies that allow conscience objections by medical students; as it so happens, the USA is one country that has examples of such policies. After presenting some background on promulgated US conscience protections and reflecting on their significance for conscience objections by medical students, this paper observes that the dominant approach (following the American Medical Association's conscience clause) is to allow exempted students to instead be evaluated on the basis of alternative curricular activities to learn the associated underlying content. This paper then introduces and discusses an example in which male Muslim students who believe it is wrong to touch members of the opposite sex object to performing physical examinations on female subjects in their medical training. This sort of case, it is argued, causes difficulty for a conscience clause that resolves the dilemma by granting reasonable exemptions in the form of participation in alternative curricular activities: there are cases where one must perform the 'objectionable' activity itself in order to learn the necessary content and underlying principles.

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^112LYwPg]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Exclusionary school discipline and zero-tolerance policies — scope, trends, and effectiveness are described, noting that 1.4 million students in kindergarten through grade 12 were suspended at least once (55% in-school, 45% out-of-school), and more than 28 000 students were expelled; in data from the 2017 to 2018 school year, more than 2.5 million students were suspended and more than 100 000 expelled. From 1973 to 2006, the percentage disciplined with suspension or expulsion increased from 3.7% to 6.9% of total student enrollment. The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 required a minimum 1-year expulsion for any student who brought a firearm to school and mandated law enforcement be notified of the incident, and exclusionary discipline rates peaked at nearly 3.2 million students suspended at least once (6% of total national enrollment) during the 2011 to 2012 school year. There is little evidence that zero-tolerance school exclusion policies make schools safer, with approximately 12 times more school shootings with casualties during the 2021 to 2022 school year than in 2000 to 2001. Suspension and expulsion alone are often not effective in deterring future misbehavior, with 28% of suspended students during 2020 to 2021 suspended more than once in the same school year, and administrators and teachers may use subjectivity and personal judgment influenced by their biases when determining which behaviors warrant exclusion.

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^114ooSjC]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The education-health gradient and exclusionary school discipline are linked by evidence that exclusionary school discipline is associated with school failure, which can limit career opportunities and put students at risk for worse health outcomes; many suspended and expelled students experience decreased instructional time, disruption in student-teacher relationships, and lack of adult supervision while removed from the school environment; these factors can contribute to academic disengagement and low academic achievement; and suspended and expelled students are more likely to drop out of high school, which severely stunts their lifetime earning potential.

### Alcohol risk management in college settings: the safer California universities randomized trial [^113uTSbb]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Potentially effective environmental strategies have been recommended to reduce heavy alcohol use among college students. However, studies to date on environmental prevention strategies are few in number and have been limited by their nonexperimental designs, inadequate sample sizes, and lack of attention to settings where the majority of heavy drinking events occur.

Purpose

To determine whether environmental prevention strategies targeting off-campus settings would reduce the likelihood and incidence of student intoxication at those settings.

Design

The Safer California Universities study involved 14 large public universities, half of which were assigned randomly to the Safer intervention condition after baseline data collection in 2003. Environmental interventions took place in 2005 and 2006 after 1 year of planning with seven Safer intervention universities. Random cross-sectional samples of undergraduates completed online surveys in four consecutive fall semesters (2003–2006).

Setting/Participants

Campuses and communities surrounding eight campuses of the University of California and six in the California State University system were utilized. The study used random samples of undergraduates (∼500–1000 per campus per year) attending the 14 public California universities.

Intervention

Safer environmental interventions included nuisance party enforcement operations, minor decoy operations, driving-under-the-influence checkpoints, social host ordinances, and use of campus and local media to increase the visibility of environmental strategies.

Main Outcome Measures

Proportion of drinking occasions in which students drank to intoxication at six different settings during the fall semester (residence hall party, campus event, fraternity or sorority party, party at off-campus apartment or house, bar/restaurant, outdoor setting), any intoxication at each setting during the semester, and whether students drank to intoxication the last time they went to each setting.

Results

Significant reductions in the incidence and likelihood of intoxication at off-campus parties and bars/restaurants were observed for Safer intervention universities compared to controls. A lower likelihood of intoxication was observed also for Safer intervention universities the last time students drank at an off-campus party (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.68, 0.97); a bar or restaurant (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.62, 0.94); or any setting (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65, 0.97). No increase in intoxication (e.g., displacement) appeared in other settings. Further, stronger intervention effects were achieved at Safer universities with the highest level of implementation.

Conclusions

Environmental prevention strategies targeting settings where the majority of heavy drinking events occur appear to be effective in reducing the incidence and likelihood of intoxication among college students.

### Corporal punishment in schools [^112a4YWD]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of corporal punishment in schools is not an effective or ethical method for management of behavior concerns and causes harm to students. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that corporal punishment in all school settings be abolished in all states by law and replaced by alternative forms of student behavior management. Corporal punishment remains legal in many public and private schools in the United States and is disproportionately used among Black students and children with disabilities. The aims of this policy statement are to review the incidence of school-based corporal punishment; the negative physical, psychological, and developmental impact of corporal punishment on students; and the need for continued advocacy by pediatricians, educators, and parents to abolish corporal punishment in all schools.

### Child protective services involvement and exclusionary school discipline [^115mynEe]. Child Development (2023). Medium credibility.

Third, the nature of CPS contact matters. There is a clear conceptual difference in the experience of a CPS investigation, which may involve little more than a 15-minute conversation with a caseworker, and the experience of foster care, which can last months or (less often) years and entails a change in one's primary caregivers and physical environment. We found that recent foster care predicted lower odds of suspension in the full sample compared with both recent non-foster care CPS contact and any upcoming CPS contact and statistically equivalent odds compared with children with no recent or upcoming CPS contact. This pattern was broadly consistent across grade levels — though potentially less so for junior high students — and by sex. Weaker effects of foster care for older students is consistent with prior research demonstrating higher rates of mental and behavioral health problems, a lack of qualified foster homes, and increased rates of congregate care placement and placement moves. By race and ethnicity, we found that differences between foster care and the other CPS conditions were typically not statistically significant for Black and Hispanic children, reflecting both different point estimates and wider confidence intervals due to smaller sample size. However, in no subgroup model was recent or current foster care associated with higher odds of suspension than recent CPS without placement or future CPS.

The protective effect of foster care was highly concentrated among children in special education. It is possible that special education and foster care contact jointly bring oversight and accountability that discourages suspension. That is, federal disability laws are designed to protect students from being penalized for the symptoms of their disability, but in practice, protecting students with disabilities from suspension may require advocacy by parties with institutional power and knowledge. The involvement of foster care caseworkers, as well as Court-Appointed Special Advocates or other professionals, may increase compliance with existing disability laws. Alternatively, students with disabilities, due to their higher levels of need, may disproportionately benefit from the increased resources, supervision, and health care services that are provided in foster care. CPS-involved children have high rates of inadequately detected and untreated physical, developmental, and mental health problems, and — despite real concerns about the quality and consistency of therapeutic services — children in foster care are more likely than their in-home counterparts to receive assessment and treatment. This may also explain why, in our study, the benefits of foster care were concentrated among White children, as studies have consistently found that Black children receive fewer mental health services, even in foster care, irrespective of their need.

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^113QrZ33]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Exclusionary school discipline disparities across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender/sexual orientation, and disability are described as follows: Teachers in a controlled experiment were more likely to judge committing 2 minor infractions as problematic when done by Black children and were more likely to recommend harsher punishments for Black students than for white students; American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) students are also disproportionately impacted, with American Indian students in California, Montana, and Utah 2.4 to 4 times more likely to receive a suspension than white students; students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch are suspended at a higher rate than other students; boys are more likely to be suspended or expelled than girls, with boys receiving more than 70% of expulsions in the 2020 to 2021 school year; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) students are suspended and expelled at higher rates than peers; and students with disabilities served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or Section 504 are disproportionately affected, with students identified under the IDEA category of "emotional disturbance" (ED), "intellectual disability", and "other health impairment" — eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — at highest risk and with students with ED and ADHD more likely to be suspended or expelled repeatedly.

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^113BNJ1c]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

AAP policy — recommendations for local education agencies — The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that local education agencies do the following: Collect and analyze internal disaggregated data regarding exclusionary school discipline practices; offer universal antibias training for administrators, teachers, school resource officers, and other school staff to decrease bias related to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status of caregivers, and ability; determine areas for improvement in school personnel training and professional development, including conflict resolution, de-escalation approaches, and social-emotional training; promote positive school climates by partnering with families and utilizing interventions such as trauma-informed school frameworks, multitiered system of supports programs including positive behavior interventions and supports, and restorative practices; recognize the special protections for students served by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or Section 504 when they are suspended or expelled; and advocate for continued school district funding for programs that offer alternatives to exclusionary school discipline, particularly on the behalf of under-resourced schools.

### Air pollution as a catalyst for supporting tobacco control policies? Evidence from a nationwide study on Chinese medical students [^111Xvztb]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Few studies have discussed how the increasing ambient air pollution may affect policy-related attitudes. Medical professionals constitute an important interest group who analyse and solve public issues within a medicalised framework. The current study investigates whether ambient air pollution is associated with a greater likelihood of supporting tobacco control measures among medical students.

Methods

We conducted multistage sampling among the medical students from 42 cities in China. We employed propensity-score matching to eliminate the selection bias and used multilevel logistic regressions for the main analysis (n1 = 9458, n2 = 42).

Results

we found that city-level air particulate matter is consistently associated with the support for tobacco control among medical students, net of other individual-level and city-level covariates. For one standard increase in air particulate matter, people are 1.21 times more likely to fully support tobacco control measures (p < 0.05). This association is significantly stronger among medical students who are financially worse-off and are ethnic majority.

Conclusions

Environmental pollution has a significant correlation with people's attitudes towards health policies, even when such policies are not directly concerned with the natural environment. Policy makers may use this opportunity to implement tobacco control measures against the backdrop of China's pollution crisis.

### It's time to address sexual violence in academic global health [^115jesQc]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

What can academics and academic institutions Do?

Our actions must be informed by up-to-date prevention guidelines on sexual violence on college/university campuses. But these need to be adapted to address specific issues in academic global health, with programmes for all students and academics (male and female) to address both victimisation and perpetration, and for entire academic communities so that active bystanders can contribute to changing cultural norms and behaviours among peers. Such approaches should include: (1) raising awareness; (2) acknowledging barriers to change; and (3) increasing action through skills practice. But until such a prevention package is adapted and implemented, what can academics and academic institutions do? We propose the following:

Immediately sanction perpetrators according to policy guidelines. Although it is difficult for universities to sanction international research partners who are not under their jurisdiction, one sanction for violating the policy would be to cease collaboration.
Adopt a comprehensive sexual harassment and violence policy globally, spearheaded by schools of global (public) health in the Global North. Accreditations given by the Council on Education for Public Health in North America and the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region should add the presence of these policies as an evaluation criterion. These policies should be shared with universities and funding agencies, who are in a good position to raise researchers' awareness about sexual violence and require adherence to sexual violence prevention policies in funded research. They should clearly state what constitutes sexual violence, including harassment. They should also refer to a code of conduct between faculty/researchers/supervisors and students, guidelines for reporting and a clear set of sanctions for violating the policies. Global South partners should be made aware of the policies, agree to adhere to them for continued partnership and be held responsible for the conduct of their employees and collaborators. The policies must be systematically included in the guides to good practice for scientific partnerships in global health and be disseminated to all academics, for example, through a massive open online course.
Stop participating in the culture of sexual harassment. This means intervening with our harassing colleagues when we are made aware of such situations, rather than solely advising young women on how to 'manage' them (eg, 'wear a wedding ring', 'don't meet him alone', and so on). Upstream, academics should be more aware of the situation by serving as mentors and by systematically discussing the issue during classes and before students leave for the field. Academics referring students to their colleagues should have a responsibility to act when made aware of sexual violence on their part by following policy procedures and enforcing sanctions. Academics also must be trained in how to receive disclosures and to support students who have been harassed or assaulted. Such training should be survivor centric, increase policy and service awareness and reduce victim blaming. This, in turn, would increase confidence in institutional responses and encourage disclosures. Confident listening spaces should exist, both before and during fieldwork, to discuss and suggest possible solutions. The scientific literature on challenges facing young women doing research in a male-dominated field should be mobilised for training purposes. It is also important to make available in the field mentors trained in harassment management to support anyone (women and men) involved in these situations and help them find appropriate solutions, or at least talk about them.
Fund and implement sexual harassment and assault resistance training for students as part of an integrated sexual violence prevention strategy based on the best available evidence. Evidence-based programmes exist to help students become more active bystandersand better resist sexual violence, as well as programmes that show promise for reducing male students' perpetration of sexual violence. If ' the female researcher cannot prepare for all eventualities,… at least she can enter the setting with some idea of how she might respond to sexist remarks, sexist behavior, and sexual hustling. 'For example, the Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act programme has resulted in an annual victimisation reduction of up to 63% in five forms of sexual violence experienced by female students in Canada. A working group should be set up to determine whether this programme can be specifically adapted for global health research, tested and evaluated.

### Tobacco marketing in California and implications for the future [^112Tq4sP]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

A second CTCP campaign, initiated in 1997 was Project SMART (Sponsorship Mission: Avoid Reliance on Tobacco) Money. It focused on reducing tobacco industry event sponsorship and free tobacco product sampling through policy adoption and enforcement of existing sampling laws (TB Cruz, N Preacely, unpublished report, 2005). California policies to eliminate tobacco-related event sponsorship include 22 state, county and local fair board policies, seven rodeo-level policies and 20 university, college and community level policies prohibiting tobacco sponsorship or advertising.

California state law prohibits tobacco sampling in many locales, but permits it in adult-only facilities. As of 2009, there were 47 ordinances restricting the free distribution of tobacco products in California. One of the strongest of these is the city of Chico's 2007 ban on the non-sale distribution of smokeless tobacco and cigarettes, coupons and rebates in locations including bars, fraternities, sororities, convenience stores and gas stations. This college community has a population of 69 000 and a student population of 17 000 at California State University Chico. Before its ordinance, the US Smokeless Tobacco Company (USST) sponsored bar nights in the city, and parties at the university's fraternities and sororities. Students were often hired to give away free samples of tobacco products along with promotional items, including T-shirts, shot glasses and lighted necklaces in exchange for personal information.

The third statewide advocacy effort launched was the STORE (Strategic Tobacco Retail Effort) Campaign in 2002. It took a comprehensive approach to the retail environment in terms of tobacco marketing and sales. This campaign helped build momentum for local tobacco retail licensing and self-service display bans. From 1998 to September 2009, 102 tobacco retail licensing ordinances were enacted which cover about 57% of the state's population. The number of self-service tobacco sales bans enacted increased from 27 in 1994 to 157 in July 2009. The large number of local self-service display ordinances facilitated passage of a statewide self-service display ban on cigarettes in 2002, which was expanded to include other tobacco products in 2004.

### Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review [^116uKcSP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of COVID-19, national and subnational governments implemented a variety of measures in order to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid-April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world's student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework.

Objectives

To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, or developing COVID-19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed-methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission-related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health-related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE).

Main Results

We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Studies conducted in real-world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission-related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.

### When a student dies: organizing the school's response [^117Rqrr4]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Principals, teachers, and guidance counselors feel ill-prepared to address a student's death. Often the death is not anticipated, comes as a shock, and has many reverberations in the school itself and in the broader community. The principal and others in the school may be called upon to serve as leaders in this sudden crisis and have broad responsibilities to their school community that may seem overwhelming in the face of their own grief and reactions to the loss. These guidelines present a meaningful response to an event that can profoundly affect the school and community.

### Voluntary guidelines for managing food allergies in schools and early care and education programs [^1123dVkB]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Create and maintain a healthy and safe school environment — schools should "Promote a safe physical environment through the following actions:" including "Create classroom rules and practices for dealing with food allergies. Tell parents about these rules and practices at the beginning of the school year or when you find out that a student with a food allergy will be in your class", "Create ways for students with food allergies to participate in all class activities", "Avoid using known allergens in classroom activities, such as arts and crafts, counting, science projects, parties, holidays and celebrations, or cooking", "Enforce hand washing before and after eating, particularly for younger students", "Use nonfood items for rewards or incentives", and "Encourage the use of allergen-safe foods or nonfood items for birthday parties or other celebrations in the classroom. Support parents of students with food allergies who wish to send allergen-safe snacks for their children".

### Flavour chemicals in a sample of non-cigarette tobacco products without explicit flavour names sold in New York city in 2015 [^117FtRva]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

Banned in the ordinance

§17–715 Sale of flavored tobacco products prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale any flavored tobacco product except in a tobacco bar.

Enforcement of the NYC law began in November 2010, and citations for violations have been based on use of explicit flavour names and/or images on the packages. Some NYC retailers, however, are now selling colourfully packaged tobacco products that, although not carrying explicit flavour indicators, smell distinctly of flavour variations other than tobacco, menthol, mint or wintergreen. Although cigarillos labelled 'Blueberry' and 'Strawberry' have largely disappeared from store shelves, noticeably flavoured 'Blue' and 'Pink' cigarillos are increasingly common in NYC. Cigarillos under the brand name Show, labelled 'Ba Boom', are sold in green/black/orange packages. Bluntville branded 'Piff' cigarillos are sold in purple packages, 'blunt' and 'piff' having cannabis connotations. Although NYC rules pertaining to the flavour prohibition allow for sensory testing to identify flavoured products, this enforcement mechanism has not been used to date. Nationally, Viola et al note that ' the cigar industry may be pre-emptively steering away from overt flavour descriptors, instead relying on more generic names on their packaging in anticipation of a [federal] ban on flavoured cigars '. Manufacturers may also be anticipating a proliferation of local sales restrictions on flavoured products, taking advantage of the commercial convenience of selecting names that can be used in any jurisdiction. Also, it cannot be excluded that some manufacturers may simply believe that there is consumer demand for products with colourful or catchy names that do not explicitly reference flavours, though for cigarettes, Lempert and Glantzpresent arguments that tobacco companies do use colour on packaging and labelling as a replacement for now-prohibited descriptive words such as 'light' and 'mild'.

### Out-of-school suspension and expulsion. American Academy of Pediatrics committee on school health [^116P78MR]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Suspension and expulsion from school are used to punish students, alert parents, and protect other students and school staff. Unintended consequences of these practices require more attention from health care professionals. Suspension and expulsion may exacerbate academic deterioration, and when students are provided with no immediate educational alternative, student alienation, delinquency, crime, and substance abuse may ensue. Social, emotional, and mental health support for students at all times in all schools can decrease the need for expulsion and suspension and should be strongly advocated by the health care community. This policy statement, however, highlights aspects of expulsion and suspension that jeopardize children's health and safety. Recommendations are targeted at pediatricians, who can help schools address the root causes of behaviors that lead to suspension and expulsion and can advocate for alternative disciplinary policies. Pediatricians can also share responsibility with schools to provide students with health and social resources.

### Remove citizenship-based discrimination in global health institutions to truly achieve' health for all' [^116xWJ2d]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Taiwan has a geopolitical superpower as its counterpart, which has pressured multilateral organisations to enforce discriminatory employment and representation policies against Taiwan and its citizens. I was first rejected due to my citizenship 15 years ago, as I was told that I was ineligible for internships (even as a student at a non-Taiwanese university) and fellowships such as the World Bank's young professional programme. I am not allowed to apply for any UN consultancy roles, let alone full employment. My job applications were promptly rejected by human resource offices, citing my citizenship as the issue. Now, as an associate professor at a Danish university involved in academic research with these organisations, I have been advised to declare my citizenship upfront (like a conflict of interest), asked to use other citizenships (which I do not have), and disinvited from in-person workshops last minute despite my leadership roles and relevant expertise. Imagine a world in which Russia, after a victory where only a small part of Ukraine remains independent, dictates that Ukrainian citizens cannot seek jobs at the WHO? Or the Israeli government vetoing Palestinian youths from doing an internship at the World Bank? This is the status quo for Taiwanese citizens, and it has been for decades.

A colleague questioned whether this is a 'domestic issue' that the global institutions should not engage in. Taiwanese are not allowed to participate as Chinese citizens even if we requested it. Furthermore, if global institutions consider this a domestic affair, should they allow one country to actively block a subgroup of their citizens from participating in global activities as private citizens? If Russia blocks Ukrainian citizens after Russia occupies Ukrainian territory, would we also see this as a 'domestic issue' that global health institutions should not interfere in?

Throughout my personal rejections, my academic colleagues are mostly surprised and apologetic, while UN staff show no discomfort in processing these discriminatory decisions. This is likely because these are the rules that have been enforced top-down, and they are likely unaware that they are enforcing a discriminatory policy for a geopolitical superpower that they may personally disagree with in real life. Recalling Solomon Asch's observations of conformity pressures, "Such is the power of the pressure to conform: it can lead us to say what we know is untrue".

### Ensuring the right to rest: city ordinances and access to rest breaks for workers in the construction industry [^116rCphK]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of city Rest Break Ordinance (RBO) policies in expanding access to rest at work.

Methods

We use data from surveys of construction workers in Austin and Dallas, Texas, in 2009, 2012, and 2015 (n = 557) to calculate the odds of receiving a rest break in pre- versus post-RBO Austin and in post-RBO Austin versus pre-RBO Dallas, controlling for demographic and employment characteristics.

Results

Construction workers were 35% more likely to report receiving a rest break in Austin post-RBO and 16% less likely in Dallas without a RBO as compared to Austin with a RBO.

Conclusion

The increased likelihood of receiving rest breaks at work in a RBO city suggests that, in the absence of enforceable national standards, city-level RBOs can be an important first step to effective prevention of heat-related illnesses (HRIs) and heat-related fatalities at work.

### Voluntary guidelines for managing food allergies in schools and early care and education programs [^11552qJe]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Support professional development on food allergies for staff, educate students and family members about food allergies, and create and maintain a healthy and safe school environment — actions specified include to "Help educate district and school staff about food allergies so they are adequately trained, competent, and confident to perform assigned responsibilities to help students with food allergies and respond to an emergency", to "Help develop district training for all school staff to help them improve their FAMPPs", to "Know and educate others about federal and state laws, including regulations, and policies relevant to the obligations of schools to students with food allergies and make sure district and school policies and practices follow these laws and policies", and to "Help school building leaders plan and provide food allergy training for staff, parents, and students". They further include to "Help school administrators communicate the district's policies and practices for preventing food allergy reactions to parents through newsletters, announcements, and other methods", to "Work collaboratively with district staff to enforce policies that promote healthy physical environments", and to "Work collaboratively with district health services staff, school principals, school counselors, and others to help enforce policies that prohibit discrimination and bullying against all students, including those with food allergies".

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^1163UVya]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Disparities in exclusionary school discipline practices — intersectional risks and disproportionate impacts are outlined, emphasizing that an intersectional approach considers a student's race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status of caregivers, and ability, and that students with multiple marginalized identities are at particularly high risk for suspension and expulsion. Students disproportionately affected often belong to populations with a high prevalence of childhood trauma, and in the absence of protective relationships and supports, childhood trauma can manifest in the classroom as inattention, impulsivity, emotional lability, and impaired executive function. More than 20 years of multidisciplinary literature has shown that Black children and adolescents are among those most severely affected; despite representing only 17% of preschool enrollment from 2020 to 2021, Black toddlers received nearly one-third of all preschool suspensions and one-quarter of all preschool expulsions. By age 9, about 40% of Black boys and 15% of Black girls who live in urban areas have already been suspended or expelled at least once. Implicit bias and racial stereotypes may contribute to how Black students are disciplined in school. There is no evidence that Black students misbehave at higher rates than other students, and Black children do not commit more serious infractions than their peers and are more likely to be disciplined for subjective infractions.

### Effects of return-to-office, public schools reopening, and vaccination mandates on COVID-19 cases among municipal employee residents of New York city [^113MzpQu]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To encourage social distancing while ensuring continuity of operations during the COVID-19 outbreak, the New York City (NYC) Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) issued a temporary telework policy on March 13, 2020, for eligible municipal employees of the City of New York (hereafter referred to as City employees). After COVID-19 vaccination availability, the mayor directed all City employees to return to the office at least part-time by May 3, 2021and full-time by September 13, 2021, with protective measures in place including mandatory face coveringsand proof of full vaccination or weekly negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic tests. As justification for withdrawing the telework policy, a mayor's spokesperson stated, "We know how to make workplaces safe, and public servants can deliver more for New Yorkers when they're working together".

During the 2020–2021 academic year, a remote learning option was available to families with children in public schools. When the 2021–2022 academic year commenced on September 13, 2021, public schools returned to full-time, in-person instruction. Staff and students were required to wear face coverings while on school property. As with all City employees, unvaccinated teachers and staff were required to test weekly.

By order of the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, COVID-19 vaccination was required for Department of Education staff effective October 1, 2021, and more generally for all City employees effective October 29, 2021. This order cited a federal executive order stating, "It is essential that Federal employees take all available steps to protect themselves and avoid spreading COVID-19 to their co-workers and members of the public. The CDC has found that the best way to do so is to be vaccinated".

### Policies to restrict secondhand smoke exposure: American College of Preventive Medicine position statement [^114fYjMa]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Economic impact of smokefree policies — sales and tourism: The 2006 Surgeon General report indicates smokefree policies "do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry". Studies including "15 cities" concluded smokefree policies had "no impact on general revenues", with additional research confirming the "negligible effect" on restaurant sales; analyses of "more than 20 cities" concluded ordinances had "no impact on restaurant revenues". Large city studies showed "no decrease in sales or city revenues", statewide California analyses found tourism-related sectors were "all unaffected", and in California cities with "100% smokefree restaurant policies", "revenues and tourism rates actually increased after ordinance passage".

### School tobacco policies and adolescent smoking in six European cities in 2013 and 2016: a school-level longitudinal study [^112SzMzt]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment of the effectiveness of school tobacco policies (STPs) in reducing adolescent smoking remains inconclusive. Previous studies took insufficient account of different dimensions of STPs, the different views of students and staff, and policy changes over time. This study assessed how a multidimensional STP, as perceived by students and staff, was associated with adolescent smoking over time in six European cities. The SILNE and SILNE-R surveys were conducted among students (n = 18,502) and staff (n = 438) in 38 schools in 2013 and 2016. Three dimensions (comprehensiveness, enforcement, and communication) were assessed and we calculated total STP scores. Multilevel logistic regressions estimated associations of STPs with adolescent smoking on and just outside school premises and with weekly smoking. Further analyses estimated associations between 2013 and 2016 STP changes and smoking outcomes in 2016, controlling for STP and smoking prevalence in 2013. On average, there were few increases in STP scores over time. Greater STP enforcement, as perceived by students, was associated with lower odds of weekly smoking (OR:0.93, 95%CI:0.89–0.97) and of smoking on school premises (OR:0.80, 95%CI:0.72–0.90). Higher total STP scores were associated with lower odds of smoking on school premises (OR:0.76, 95%CI:0.67–0.86), but not of smoking just outside premises or smoking weekly. Greater increases in STP scores over time were associated with lower odds of smoking on school premises in 2016 (OR:0.65, 95%CI:0.47–0.89). Well-enforced STPs may help reduce adolescent smoking at school. Schools should be supported in adopting comprehensive policies that also extend to the surroundings of their premises.

### Alternating quarantine for sustainable epidemic mitigation [^113F5Z3M]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 7
Driving social conformity for alternating quarantine.

a We identify four needs that inhibit potential cooperation: child care arrangements, work, purchasing supplies or services, and outdoor activities. b Infection risk is highest under extensive and continuous interactions, such as in school or at work, and least significant during open-air activities, such as strolling or exercising. We, therefore, focus on moderators mainly for the first three inhibitors. c To enhance social compliance we seek moderators that encourage conformity in lieu of coercive enforcement: school and work — due to their liability, schools, and workplaces will be naturally prohibited for the quarantined cohort, as both will be required to abide by the AQ routine, and therefore will not admit workers or students of the inactive cohort. In addition, routine inspections for symptoms will expose potential defectors who wish to conceal their infection. Public centers — we consider three moderators to deter individuals from seeking services or supplies: (i) instruct the population to obtain sufficient supplies in advance for a single week; (ii) establish a support network in case of unexpected needs; (iii) create a mobile app confirming an individual's cohort (1 or 2), that must be displayed upon entry to public centers. The outdoor activity could be moderated by enforcement, however, since it poses little infection risk, we believe such activity should, in practice, be ignored. d The residual mortality Δ D vs. the fraction of defectors/essential workers f, as obtained for the intermediate scenario β = 0.20, α = 0.15. We find that AQ is robust under imperfect implementation, allowing to sustain a ~20% violation, either via formal exemption or by defection. e, f Similar results are obtained for H Peak and V Peak; the average estimated national hospitalization capacity is indicated by the gray dashed line. Results represent an average of over 20 stochastic realizations on a network comprising 4000 households (~10⁴ individuals).

### Unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review [^111KSy7u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, schools were a key setting for intervening with public health and social measures (PHSM) to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Consequently, there is a need to assess the varied unintended consequences associated with PHSM implemented in the school setting, for students, teachers, and school staff, as well as for families and the wider community. This is an update of a Cochrane scoping review first published in 2022.

Objectives

To comprehensively identify and summarise the published literature on the unintended consequences of public health and social measures implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This will serve to identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future primary research and systematic reviews. It may also serve as a resource for future pandemic management.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Web of Science on 5 and 6 January 2023. We also searched two COVID-19-specific databases (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease). Finally, we reviewed the included studies of all relevant systematic reviews and guidelines identified through the searches.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that empirically assessed the impact of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We imposed no restrictions with regard to the types of populations and specific interventions. Outcomes of interest were consequences that were measured or experienced, but not anticipated consequences. This review focused on real-world evidence: empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies were eligible for inclusion, but modelling studies were ineligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review was guided by a logic model. In line with the latest Cochrane effectiveness review of school measures to contain COVID-19 and a conceptual framework of PHSM, this logic model distinguishes between measures to make contacts safer (related to individual protection and the physical environment), measures to reduce contacts (related to social interactions, movement, and services) and surveillance and response measures. Unintended consequences comprise the following categories: health and well-being, health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, acceptability and adherence, equality and equity, social and institutional, economic and resource, and ecological. The review team screened all titles and abstracts, then potentially eligible full-text articles, in duplicate. Across the included studies, we summarised and presented types of measures, consequences, and study designs using the predefined categories of the logic model, while allowing for emerging categories.

Main Results

We included 60 studies (57 new to this update) from 25 countries. There were 31 quantitative studies, 17 qualitative studies, and 12 mixed-method studies. Most targeted either students (26 studies), teachers and school staff (11 studies), or students and school staff (12 studies). Others evaluated measures aimed at parents (2 studies), staff and parents (1 study), students and teachers (3 studies), or the whole school (5 studies). The measures were related to individual protection (26 studies), the physical environment (20 studies), social interactions (25 studies), services (1 study), movement (3 studies), surveillance (9 studies) and response (7 studies). Nine studies evaluated the combined effect of multiple measures. The main consequences assessed were from the categories health and well-being (29 studies), acceptability and adherence (31 studies), and social and institutional (23 studies). Fewer studies covered consequences from the categories equality and equity (2 studies), economic and resource (7 studies), and ecological (1 study). No studies examined consequences for the health system and social welfare services or for human and fundamental rights.

Authors' Conclusions

This scoping review provides an overview of the evidence on the unintended consequences of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The 60 included studies describe a broad body of evidence and cover a range of measures and unintended consequences, primarily consequences for health and well-being, acceptability and adherence, social and institutional aspects, and economic aspects. The main gaps identified relate to consequences of school measures for the health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, equality and equity, and the environment. Further research is needed to fill these gaps, making use of diverse methodological approaches. Future studies should explore unintended consequences - whether beneficial or harmful - in more depth and over longer time periods, in different population groups, and across different contexts. A more robust evidence base could inform and facilitate decisions about whether, how, and when to implement or terminate COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in school settings, and how to counter negative unintended consequences.

### Voluntary guidelines for managing food allergies in schools and early care and education programs [^115EfhA8]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

School food allergy management — education and school environment directives include "Help ensure that information about food allergies is included in the district's health education curriculum for students to raise awareness" and "Communicate with parents about the district's policies and practices to protect the health of students with food allergies". Environmental measures include "Increase awareness of food allergies throughout the school environment", "Collaborate with school board members, school administrators, and other school staff to create a safe environment for students with food allergies. Provide oversight of schools with children who have food allergies", "Make sure that food allergy policies and practices address competitive foods, such as those available in vending machines, in school stores, during class parties, at athletic events, and during after-school programs", and "Consistently enforce policies that prohibit discrimination and bullying against all students, including those with food allergies".

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^116Uzpzu]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Impact of exclusionary school discipline and school security measures on school climate — exclusionary discipline negatively affects school climate and correlates with lower academic achievement, and security practices disproportionately affect marginalized students. School climate refers to the quality and character of school life and the organizational culture that helps students feel safe and respected. Exclusionary school discipline has a negative effect on school climate, and high rates of suspension and expulsion are correlated with lower academic achievement schoolwide. School security measures may also negatively impact school climate, especially for students who identify as part of historically marginalized communities. Black students and students whose caregivers have low socioeconomic status are more likely to experience metal detectors, video surveillance, and random property searches at school and to interact with school resource officers (SROs), who are sworn law enforcement officers trained in adolescent behavior, crisis management, and trauma-informed de-escalation techniques. When in-school arrests occur by SROs, AI/AN students, Black students, boys, and students with disabilities have a higher risk of being arrested than other students.

### The mental impact of digital divide due to COVID-19 pandemic induced emergency online learning at undergraduate level: evidence from undergraduate students from dhaka city [^113XNEfu]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 outbreak has drawn out institutions to closure with several challenges for university students of undergraduate level in Dhaka city including an emergency shift from traditional learning to online learning, which associated digital divide, left several arguments in response to technological inefficiency, pedagogic inefficiency of teachers, inappropriate study environment and so on. Previous literature shows that the COVID-19 is imposing a threat to mental health all over the nation since its spread. This study intended to evaluate the emerging reasons for psychological distress among university students of undergraduate level in Dhaka, also assess the execution methods, barriers of online learning, and lastly, the attitudes of students regarding online learning throughout the pandemic.

Methods

A mixed methodology was used to conduct the research. Primary data has been collected using simple purposive sampling on 180 undergraduate students, 9 interviews were taken including 6 in-depth interviews of different university undergraduates from Dhaka city and also 3 (KIIs) from specialists of pedagogy and medical anthropology, and a high official from Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC).

Results

Based on the Kessler K-10 distress scale, the study found that the prevalence of no psychological distress (16.67%) followed by mild (40%), moderate (30.56%), and severe psychological distress (12.78%).

Conclusion

The results concluded considering several reasons for mild to severe psychological distress. The findings suggest some recommendations to accumulate the process of online learning effectively and also strategies to regulate the preferred mode of learning in future.

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^114mHNxC]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement — school suspension and expulsion outlines that exclusionary school discipline practices are severe consequences and provides background definitions. Exclusionary school discipline practices — ie, suspension and expulsion — represent some of the most severe consequences a school district can implement, and currently the most common indications are for behaviors that are neither violent nor criminal; there is little evidence that these practices make schools safer or deter future misbehavior. The policy notes disproportionate discipline of American Indian/Alaska Native students, Black students, students whose caregivers have low socioeconomic status, male students, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning students, and students with disabilities. In addition, it states that exclusionary school discipline in the preschool period can be harmful to early childhood development and that affected children and adolescents are at higher risk for dropping out of high school and involvement with the juvenile justice system, with both experiences associated with a worse profile of physical and mental health outcomes. The document describes a multidisciplinary and trauma-informed approach to reducing exclusionary school discipline and provides recommendations at both the practice level for pediatric health care providers and at the systems level for both pediatric health care providers and educators. Background definitions clarify that exclusionary school discipline removes a student from their usual educational setting, either temporarily (suspension) or permanently (expulsion), and that suspensions can be classified as in-school or out-of-school.

### Flavour chemicals in a sample of non-cigarette tobacco products without explicit flavour names sold in New York city in 2015 [^113vpDSj]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

What this paper adds

New York City (NYC) currently prohibits sales of tobacco products having 'characterising flavours' other than 'tobacco, menthol, mint or wintergreen', except as may occur in 'tobacco bars'. Enforcement action may take place when products are explicitly labelled with a recognisable flavour name (eg, cherry and vanilla) or flavour image (eg, fruit and candy). Chemical testing of products cannot be used as a basis for enforcement by a state or local jurisdiction because federal law pre-empts local regulations based on tobacco product standards (eg, a city or state likely cannot ban specific flavourings based on chemical analyses).
A convenience sample of 19 tobacco products were purchased in NYC in 2015. Sixteen tobacco products did not have explicit flavour names. All products were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Fourteen tobacco products were found to contain total determined flavour chemical levels higher than the lowest total level (0.313 mg/g) found in 18 tobacco products with flavour names previously analysed by our laboratory.
The results indicate that most (if not all) of the 14 have a 'characterising flavour', likely constituting a violation of the NYC ordinance: manufacturers may be responding to local adoption of laws restricting the sale of flavoured products by avoiding explicit flavour names.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced a plan to prohibit flavoured cigars. Such a step would advance local efforts to reduce availability of flavoured 'other tobacco products' (OTPs), although localities that restrict the sale of flavoured OTPs would still contend with enforcement challenges related to flavoured smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco and tobacco-containing shisha.
This work suggests that the FDA could consider using its unique power to regulate ingredients and flavourings to help local jurisdictions enforce their restrictions on the sale of flavoured tobacco products. For example, the FDA could decide to require all tobacco products with more than some particular total number of milligrams of total flavour chemicals per gram of product to bear a disclosure on their label stating 'This is a flavoured tobacco product'.

### Medical vs nonmedical immunization exemptions for child care and school attendance: policy statement [^114zb4Tq]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Nonmedical exemptions from immunization — state policies and counts — include that, as of this writing, 5 states (CA, CT, ME, NY, and WV) accept only medical exemptions; Mississippi had a similar law but in April 2023 was required by a federal court to include provisions for a religious exemption; forty-five states allow religious beliefs as a basis for an exemption and 15 states allow "personal beliefs", "philosophical", or "conscientious objection" exemptions; regulations vary across states, some explicitly exclude "philosophical" and "personal belief" exemptions, more than half can exclude unimmunized students during outbreaks, epidemics, or emergencies, more than one-quarter require an affidavit for a nonmedical exemption, and some require parent/guardian education, which has resulted in a decline in the total number of exemptions requested and approved.

### Institutionalising global health: a call for ethical reflection [^112yGraY]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

We believe that continued participation can be defended, but fostering a culture of internal critique must be invited and also genuinely embraced by the entire global health community, especially those who sit in positions of influence and power. Students express reasonable concern that criticising the global health project as they enter into it will be seen as a form of heresy. Emphasising the enterprise's deficiencies can pose a risk for those who need to maintain their credibility within the community. Look, for example, to the bedrock funding and promotion pathway for an academic pursuing global health; as it is in all other university-based disciplines, those who play by, rather than object to, prevailing institutional norms tend to be rewarded.

We remind our students of one Albert Hirschman's insights more than 50 years ago: when considered alongside the option to exit, using one's voice to criticise an institution can be a sign of loyalty rather than disloyalty to the project. Encouragingly, more academics are voicing critical concern about ethically dubious paradigms on which global health practice has been established. Nevertheless, our students' concerns highlight a substantial tension as they contemplate on-going or future work in this field. Agreeing to join or remain part of a flawed global health project typically requires one to work from the inside out, and risk being complicit in the kinds of ethical dilemmas most of us wish to avoid. How much complicity can each of us tolerate before we decide to become an actor working from the outside in? On the other hand, is working from the outside in even possible if one loses (what feels like) necessary institutional standing to "study, research, and practice"? Our students understandably feel trapped.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^111Tk3fA]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Research and training inclusivity — raising students' awareness of socioeconomic status (SES) concerns in research can be very valuable and might involve reading relevant literature or integrating such issues into research methods courses. Teaching students how to effectively measure SES can be quite useful, with Best Practices in Conceptualizing and Measuring Social Class in Psychological Research cited as an excellent starting point, and students are advised to choose measures informed by the type of social class information sought. Students might also strive to be aware of cultural sensitivity and the potential for exploitation when studying economically marginalized populations, noting that financial incentives and power differentials may be more likely to have an adverse impact on the economically marginalized.

### New York city's window guard policy: four decades of success [^117RWTTh]. Injury Prevention (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Preventing child falls from windows is easily accomplished by installing inexpensive window-limiting devices but window falls remain a common cause of child injuries. This article describes the history and evolution of the New York City (NYC) window guard rule, which requires building owners to install window guards in apartments housing children aged ≤ 10years. The NYC window guard rule was the first directive of its kind in the USA when it was adopted in 1976, and it has led to a dramatic and long-lasting reduction in child window fall-related injuries and deaths.

Methods

Data about the history of the window guard rule were obtained by reviewing programmatic records, correspondence, legal decisions and the published literature. In addition, key informant interviews were conducted with programme staff.

Results and Discussion

This article describes each stage of policy development, starting with epidemiological studies defining the scope of the problem in the 1960s and pilot-testing of the window guard intervention. We describe the adoption, implementation and enforcement of the rule. In addition, we show how the rule was modified over time and document the rule's impact on window fall incidence in NYC. We describe litigation that challenged the rule's constitutionality and discuss the legal arguments used by opponents of the rule. Finally, we discuss criminal and tort liability as drivers of compliance and summarise lessons learnt.

### Making cities mental health friendly for adolescents and young adults [^115wDKb3]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Our study also has several limitations. First, the participants recruited do not reflect the full social and economic diversity of urban populations whom city governments and decision-makers must serve. Our decision to use a web-based format following standard health research priority-setting methods required tradeoffs. We sought disciplinary, age and geographic diversity; however, our sample does not represent the most marginalized groups of adolescents or adults. Rather, the recruitment of academics, educators, leaders and well-networked young people through an online study probably minimizes the number of participants living in adversity. Although we also recruited young people who were not necessarily established experts, many were students or members of advocacy or international leadership networks and were not likely to exemplify the most disadvantaged groups. We risk masking the specific viewpoints or needs of marginalized and at-risk young people. However, we are reassured by the prominence of equity as a theme and the call to address social determinants of health. Second, it is possible that participants recruited through the authors' professional networks may be more likely to reflect the viewpoints of the advisory committee members who selected them, given collaborative or other professional relationships. This may have shaped the range of responses and their prioritization. Third, the aspirational calls for an end to discrimination and inequalities highlighted in our results require confronting long-standing structural inequities both within and between countries. Structural violence frequently maintains these power imbalances. Although we do not view their aspirational nature as a limitation, we note that our study data do not outline the complexity of responses required to address these determinants of mental health or to dismantle discriminatory structures. Fourth, our data present several aggregated characteristics that may require disaggregation as cities contextualize the findings for their settings. Fifth, our network recruitment strategy led to skewed recruitment from some geographic regions (for example, North America and Nepal), which may have biased responses (Extended Data Figs. 1–3). Extended Data Table 1 shows the similarities and differences in the rankings for Nepal, USA and the remaining countries in survey 3. Additionally, we recruited few 14–17-year-olds. We experienced attrition over the three rounds of surveying, ending with complete responses from 261 individuals from 48 countries, with the greatest loss in participants between surveys 1 and 2 (Table 1), among the 14–17-, 18–24- and 25–35-year-old age groups, and among participants from Nepal (Extended Data Fig. 2).

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^116nruuf]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Practice-level recommendations — The AAP recommends that pediatric health care providers do the following: Understand the current disparities in the use of suspension and expulsion, particularly for AI/AN students, Black students, students whose caregivers have low socioeconomic status, male students, LGBTQ+ students, and students with disabilities, and refer affected students to education advocacy services; Acknowledge that suspension and expulsion in the early education period is developmentally inappropriate and can create harm by interrupting child routines, imposing stigmatizing labels, and exacerbating caregiver stress because of employment and child care challenges; Identify the potential harms of school suspension and expulsion to the affected student, including missed instructional time, increased risk of school failure, and increased contact with the juvenile justice system; Understand how dropping out of high school and juvenile justice involvement are pertinent risk factors associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes in affected children and adolescents throughout their lifetime; Refer families to government and community resources, including trauma-informed care systems, that address the social determinants of health associated with school difficulty; Screen school-aged children for chronic absenteeism, ie, missing 15 or more school days a year, as chronic absenteeism is associated with school difficulty and school dropout; Screen all children and adolescents for developmental delays and disabilities that may lead to school difficulty, and refer to developmental-behavioral pediatricians, early intervention services, and/or special education services in a timely manner; Educate caregivers of students with disabilities on the processes to develop an IEP or a Section 504 plan with the student's school; Stay informed on AAP policy and practice guidelines for the screening and treatment of developmental and mental health problems, including substance use.

### Interventions to prevent misconduct and promote integrity in research and publication [^1132VjYU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Improper practices and unprofessional conduct in clinical research have been shown to waste a significant portion of healthcare funds and harm public health.

Objectives

Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of educational or policy interventions in research integrity or responsible conduct of research on the behaviour and attitudes of researchers in health and other research areas.

Search Methods

We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS and CINAHL health research bibliographical databases, as well as the Academic Search Complete, AGRICOLA, GeoRef, PsycINFO, ERIC, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. We performed the last search on 15 April 2015 and the search was limited to articles published between 1990 and 2014, inclusive. We also searched conference proceedings and abstracts from research integrity conferences and specialized websites. We handsearched 14 journals that regularly publish research integrity research.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that measured the effects of one or more interventions, i.e. any direct or indirect procedure that may have an impact on research integrity and responsible conduct of research in its broadest sense, where participants were any stakeholders in research and publication processes, from students to policy makers. We included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, such as controlled before-and-after studies, with comparisons of outcomes in the intervention versus non-intervention group or before versus after the intervention. Studies without a control group were not included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. To assess the risk of bias in non-randomized studies, we used a modified Cochrane tool, in which we used four out of six original domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, other sources of bias) and two additional domains (comparability of groups and confounding factors). We categorized our primary outcome into the following levels: 1) organizational change attributable to intervention, 2) behavioural change, 3) acquisition of knowledge/skills and 4) modification of attitudes/perceptions. The secondary outcome was participants' reaction to the intervention.

Main Results

Thirty-one studies involving 9571 participants, described in 33 articles, met the inclusion criteria. All were published in English. Fifteen studies were randomized controlled trials, nine were controlled before-and-after studies, four were non-equivalent controlled studies with a historical control, one was a non-equivalent controlled study with a post-test only and two were non-equivalent controlled studies with pre- and post-test findings for the intervention group and post-test for the control group. Twenty-one studies assessed the effects of interventions related to plagiarism and 10 studies assessed interventions in research integrity/ethics. Participants included undergraduates, postgraduates and academics from a range of research disciplines and countries, and the studies assessed different types of outcomes. We judged most of the included randomized controlled trials to have a high risk of bias in at least one of the assessed domains, and in the case of non-randomized trials there were no attempts to alleviate the potential biases inherent in the non-randomized designs. We identified a range of interventions aimed at reducing research misconduct. Most interventions involved some kind of training, but methods and content varied greatly and included face-to-face and online lectures, interactive online modules, discussion groups, homework and practical exercises. Most studies did not use standardized or validated outcome measures and it was impossible to synthesize findings from studies with such diverse interventions, outcomes and participants. Overall, there is very low quality evidence that various methods of training in research integrity had some effects on participants' attitudes to ethical issues but minimal (or short-lived) effects on their knowledge. Training about plagiarism and paraphrasing had varying effects on participants' attitudes towards plagiarism and their confidence in avoiding it, but training that included practical exercises appeared to be more effective. Training on plagiarism had inconsistent effects on participants' knowledge about and ability to recognize plagiarism. Active training, particularly if it involved practical exercises or use of text-matching software, generally decreased the occurrence of plagiarism although results were not consistent. The design of a journal's author contribution form affected the truthfulness of information supplied about individuals' contributions and the proportion of listed contributors who met authorship criteria. We identified no studies testing interventions for outcomes at the organizational level. The numbers of events and the magnitude of intervention effects were generally small, so the evidence is likely to be imprecise. No adverse effects were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence base relating to interventions to improve research integrity is incomplete and the studies that have been done are heterogeneous, inappropriate for meta-analyses and their applicability to other settings and population is uncertain. Many studies had a high risk of bias because of the choice of study design and interventions were often inadequately reported. Even when randomized designs were used, findings were difficult to generalize. Due to the very low quality of evidence, the effects of training in responsible conduct of research on reducing research misconduct are uncertain. Low quality evidence indicates that training about plagiarism, especially if it involves practical exercises and use of text-matching software, may reduce the occurrence of plagiarism.

### Flavour chemicals in a sample of non-cigarette tobacco products without explicit flavour names sold in New York city in 2015 [^113oAhfu]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

In October 2009, to extend the protection conferred by the FSPTCA, New York City (NYC) restricted retail sales of tobacco products other than cigarettes (ie, 'OTP') having 'characterising flavours' other than 'tobacco, menthol, mint or wintergreen' as summarised in Box 1. Electronic cigarette products are not addressed by this law. 'Tobacco bars', a narrow class of food service establishments that have been required to register annually with NYC since 2002 (and currently numbering eight), are not subject to the flavoured tobacco regulation. Consistent with the FSPTCA, the NYC ordinance defined 'flavored' as ' contains a constituent that imparts a characterizing flavor '. The ordinance further states that a 'public statement or claim made or disseminated by the manufacturer of a tobacco product… that such tobacco product has or produces a characterizing flavor shall constitute presumptive evidence that the tobacco product is a flavored tobacco product'. As a result of this provision, tobacco product packaging labelled with the name of a flavour, or a picture connoting that flavour — such as 'strawberry', or a picture of a strawberry, constitutes presumptive evidence that sale of the product is illegal in NYC. Several other local jurisdictions have enacted laws restricting the sale of flavoured OTP; these include Providence, Rhode Island; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts, and various smaller Massachusetts towns. Most of these localities, like NYC, rely on product names as the primary means of identifying flavoured products.

### Local smoke-free policy development in santa Fe, Argentina [^112S29Fh]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Strong governmental political will

After the Lower House passed the bill on 25 November 2004 it was sent to the Senate, where it was passed 7 months later, on 30 June 2005, as Law 12 432.

The law was supported by provincial Minister of Health and Governor, who on 10 November 2005, signed Decree 2759to regulate the law's implementation. The regulation, among other measures, included the mandatory placement of signs inside all public and private places indicating they were smoke free (figure 1). The regulation, however, did not establish specific sanctions for violators, simply referring to the Provincial Code of Misdemeanours, which made the law difficult to enforce.

Figure 1
No smoking sign.

No local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) mobilised to support the law before it passed.

Rosario takes the lead in the full implementation of the law

On 16 March 2006, the Rosario City Council passed Ordinance 7970 to adhere to provincial law 12 432 and revoke all previous ordinances that contradicted the provincial law. The ordinance established a toll-free telephone line for complaints, but health authorities failed to act against violators. Smoking legislation in Rosario moved one step forward in 13 July 2006, when the City Council approved Ordinance 8021, which the Mayor had introduced, to fully implement the provincial law by establishing sanctions for violators. Penalties included fines for smokers and owners or managers of the locations where violations took place, and the closure of facilities if there were repeated violators.

Santa Fe: establishing sanctions

On 24 August 2006, the Santa Fe Legislature passed Complementary Law 12 605 to establish specific sanctions for smokers and owners of the locations (eg, fines and closure of the establishment) and a mechanism for enforcing the law.

Pro-tobacco industry response

As in the US and elsewhere in the world, with encouragement from the tobacco industry, soon after the Legislature approved the law pro-tobacco forces began a campaign to challenge it (table 2 and figure 2).

### Legal and political obstacles to smoke-free regulation in Minnesota regions [^112ZKiTN]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

As communities move toward statewide smoke-free regulation, progress is often stymied by legal and political challenges that arise when multiple cities and counties share regulatory power within what is, for economic purposes, a single population center. Political challenges are exacerbated by legal inconsistencies and uncertainties, such as confusing and conflicting lawmaking power in boards of health, cities or counties, and diverse procedures and timelines for adopting and amending ordinances. Surprisingly little research is available about the legal and political obstacles communities face in regulating tobacco on a regional basis. Researchers used case study methodology to analyze legal and political challenges that seven multi-jurisdictional Minnesota regions faced in smoke-free ordinance campaigns between 2000 and 2006, to examine the approaches regulatory authorities took in each of these communities, and to identify strategies to help public health advocates, health organizations, policymakers, and legal professionals anticipate, avoid, and address these obstacles. Legal impediments included confusing rules for passing smoke-free laws via ballot measures (initiatives and referenda); distracting lawsuits; and conflicts over legal jurisdiction. Political challenges included the recurrent argument for regional consistency, protracted timelines, pending legislation and elections, and mayoral vetoes. Legal and political challenges similar to those in this study appear in smoke-free campaigns across the U.S. By recognizing the risks posed by these obstacles, advocates will be better prepared to advance smoke-free policies effectively.

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^113DMJf5]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Exclusionary school discipline practices-ie, suspension and expulsion-represent some of the most severe consequences a school district can implement for unacceptable student behavior. Suspension and expulsion were traditionally used for student behaviors that caused serious harm, such as bringing a weapon to school. Currently, the most common indications for exclusionary school discipline are for behaviors that are neither violent nor criminal. There is little evidence that exclusionary school discipline practices make schools safer or deter future misbehavior. American Indian/Alaska Native students, Black students, students whose caregivers have low socioeconomic status, male students, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning students, and students with disabilities are disproportionately disciplined with suspension and expulsion. In addition, exclusionary school discipline in the preschool period can be harmful to early childhood development. Children and adolescents affected by exclusionary school discipline are at higher risk for dropping out of high school and for involvement with the juvenile justice system. Both of those experiences are associated with a worse profile of physical and mental health outcomes. A multidisciplinary and trauma-informed approach to reducing exclusionary school discipline practices is described. Recommendations are provided at both the practice level for pediatric health care providers and at the systems level for both pediatric health care providers and educators.

### Economic impacts of the pueblo smoke-free air act [^111k3WWE]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

On July 1, 2003, the city of Pueblo CO enacted a smokefree ordinance (Pueblo Smoke-Free Air Act [PSFAA]) that prohibited smoking in public places and workplaces, including taverns and restaurants. Opponents to this ordinance argued that it would have a negative impact on tavern and restaurant sales.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the PSFAA had a negative economic impact on tavern and restaurant sales tax revenues.

Methods

With data gathered in 2007, this study implemented an interrupted time-series model in 2008, using 42 months of pre- and post-intervention sales tax revenue data for Pueblo to determine whether implementation of this ordinance had an effect on tavern and restaurant sales tax revenues. Ratios of tavern and restaurant openings to closings were also computed for the pre- and post-intervention periods.

Results

Pre-post sales tax revenue data showed slight losses in sales tax revenue for taverns, and gains for restaurants, which more than offset the tavern losses. After adjusting for the consumer price index, the city of Pueblo experienced a 20.3% gain in combined tavern and restaurant sales tax revenues from the pre-ordinance period to the post-ordinance period. The ratio of tavern openings to closings improved from 1:1 pre-period to 3.3:1 post-period and the restaurant ratio remained unchanged at approximately 1.78:1 from pre- to post-period.

Conclusions

There is no evidence that the PSFAA had a negative economic impact on consumer price index-adjusted tavern and restaurant sales tax revenues. From a fiscal policy perspective, this ordinance may have contributed to a net increase in sales tax revenues for the city of Pueblo. The business openings/closings data suggest that the confidence Pueblo's business sector had in the local hospitality industry was not negatively influenced by the PSFAA.

### The impact of marijuana policies on youth: clinical, research, and legal update [^111934iF]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Society and social justice — decriminalization and possession amounts — Before decriminalization, in Massachusetts 90% of arrests were for 1 ounce or less and in Connecticut 75% of arrests in those older than 18 years were for a half ounce or less. After decriminalization of marijuana possession with intent in Massachusetts in 2008, the number of minors arrested for marijuana possession dropped by 89%–90% — to 189 in 2009 and 170 in 2010. These reduced violations do not carry the requirement for short-term prison time or probation or the longer-term stigma of a felony drug conviction, which may result in the inability to obtain student loans or attend school, ineligibility for certain housing, and difficulties with future employment. For example, students applying to college may be denied federal financial aid because of a drug conviction, including marijuana possession (part of the Higher Education Act Aid Elimination Penalty passed by Congress in 1998).

### Linking global youth tobacco survey (GYTS) data to the WHO framework convention on tobacco control (FCTC): the case for Mexico [^111t7avE]. Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The adoption of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2004 marked a critical achievement in efforts to stem the tobacco epidemic in Mexico. The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) findings are useful for evaluating achievement of FCTC articles and designing tobacco control programs.

Objective

To use data from the GYTS conducted in 21 Mexican cities between 2000 and 2005 to monitor Articles in the WHO FCTC.

Methods

The GYTS uses a two-stage cluster sample survey design that produces representative samples of students aged 13–15 years enrolled in public, private and technical schools. The survey was undertaken at 542 schools in 21 cities. The GYTS surveyed 43,950 students during 2000–2005.

Results

The current smoking rate ranged from 10.7% to 29.4%. Among never smokers, susceptibility to initiate smoking ranged from 20.2% to 34.4%. Among current smokers, the percentage who bought their cigarettes in a store was above 40% in 6 cities, but significantly declined over five years in the only city with two assessments (Monterrey). Exposure to secondhand smoke in public places was greater than 50% in 15 of the 21 cities. Over 80% of students in all 21 cities reported that they saw of advertisements for cigarettes on billboards.

Conclusion

Using determinants measured by GYTS in Mexico, the government can monitor the impact of enforcing various provisions of the National Health Law and the progress made in achieving the goals of the WHO FCTC and the Regional strategy. When these goals are met, tobacco consumption and exposure in Mexico will have declined substantially.

### Policing is a threat to public health and human rights [^114QBkFC]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Problematising the institution of policing

The impact of policing on individual and collective well-being and human rights has gained renewed attention. In 2020, global protests against police violence, racism and white supremacy were met with further violence by state security actors. In Nigeria, at least 56 people were killed during protests in opposition to the Nigerian police force's 'Special Anti-Robbery Squad' in October 2020 alone.

Peripheral calls to defund and abolish the police have gained extraordinary mainstream support. Such a shift has coincided with public scrutiny of state responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, examination of public investment in health and social services, and calls to eliminate militarised and biosecuritised public health responses.

We must understand the extent to which policing has been framed as essential to the function of safe societies. Substantial sociological and philosophical inquiry has long recognised contemporary policing as a product of disciplinary and regulatory power, and as a tool to preserve 'inequality and maintaining the status quo' (p 15).

Adopting a term first coined by Ture and Hamilton, the UK government's inquiry into the handling of Stephen Lawrence's murder identified widespread 'institutional racism' in the UK police service. Despite its applicability to other contexts and institutions, identifying policing as racist differs from referring to other institutions as such: racism and discrimination are not byproducts of policing, but central to its function. Policing has not become racist or discriminatory, but has always existed as a tool to maintain racist and other power hierarchies. In the USA, modern policing evolved from decentralised, privately funded slave patrols. In Australia and Canada, policing remains a weapon of colonial and neocolonial control, evidenced by legislation mandating the forced removal of indigenous children from their families.

Aside from the institution, acts of policing are pervasive across other contexts. In healthcare, policing dominates the response to people experiencing mental health crises. Disruption in educational settings is dealt with punitively, with Black students more likely to be permanently excluded from school. Efforts have been taken to impose state censorship of critical race theory from public discourse. Not only is policing as an institution racist, but policing across a multitude of contexts upholds racism and other oppressive hierarchies.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^1151kr3E]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Body image, inclusivity, and anti-teasing environment — recommended school practices: Create a school environment that encourages a healthy body image, shape, and size among all students and staff members, is accepting of diverse abilities, and does not tolerate weight-based teasing. The psychological environment at a school should support all students in making healthy eating choices and being physically active, regardless of race/ethnicity, income, sex, and physical ability. Schools can adopt and enforce a universal bullying prevention program that addresses weight discrimination and teasing, ensure that students of all sizes are encouraged to participate in a wide variety of physical activities, display inclusive visuals, and avoid practices that single out students; schools should avoid elimination games such as dodge ball, bombardment, and elimination tag that limit opportunities for all students to be active.

### Impact of a crime prevention ordinance for small retail establishments [^112D7gYV]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ordinances requiring the implementation of robbery prevention measures have been enacted at the city level in many jurisdictions. We evaluated the impact of an ordinance requiring crime prevention measures on subsequent crime rates.

Methods

Crime reports for robbery and aggravated assault from January 2006 through December 2015 were linked to randomly-selected convenience stores and small retail grocers in Houston (n = 293). Store characteristics and compliance with a list of safety measures were collected by surveyors in 2011. Generalized linear mixed models were used to compare rates of crime before and after the implementation of the ordinance.

Results

Robberies decreased significantly after the ordinance went into effect (rate ratio = 0.38; 95% confidence interval 0.29–0.51). No individual safety measure was associated with decreased robbery rates. No similar decrease was observed for aggravated assault.

Conclusions

City ordinances mandating crime prevention measures can be effective. We could not parse out the effectiveness of individual elements, suggesting a comprehensive approach may be more effective.

### The APA guidelines for psychological practice with sexual minority persons: an executive summary of the 2021 revision [^116YRKmW]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Application — interventions for sexual minority students in schools emphasize that interventions aimed at targeting bullying are not effective without specific considerations for protecting sexual minority students from bullying and aggression in schools. Psychologists working in schools are encouraged to establish and deliver school-wide interventions to target homonegative bullying and victimization, and are encouraged to contribute to developing interventions that target students' aggressive behaviors toward sexual minority students, including peer-led programs. Psychologists also want to consider programs that train teachers and other school personnel on how to intervene when homonegative aggression is taking place, and parent-school collaborations. Psychologists acknowledge and strive to work toward making systemic impact by educating themselves, students, school personnel, parents, and other stakeholders about the negative consequences of laws prohibiting the discussion of sexual diversity among sexual minority youth, and psychologists strive to provide psychoeducation and other direct services (e.g., family therapy) in order to create a safe environment for sexual minority youth beyond the school setting. Psychologists recognize the importance of engaging in interdisciplinary work with other professionals to promote the well-being of sexual minority students at an individual, local, state-wide, and national level, and psychologists are advised to recognize that no two students are the same and actively acknowledge and consider the importance of intersectionality when creating and delivering interventions. It should be noted that most of the available research about the experiences of sexual minority students in educational settings focuses on K-12, with less attention geared toward sexual minority students in college/university settings, and schools also have the potential to serve as a protective factor, helping to buffer against bullying and the consequences of bullying toward sexual minority students.

### The role of schools in combating illicit substance abuse [^115S7JJY]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Disturbingly high levels of illicit drug use remain a problem among American teenagers. As the physical, social, and psychological "home away from home" for most youth, schools naturally assume a primary role in substance abuse education, prevention, and early identification. However, the use of random drug testing on students as a component of drug prevention programs requires additional, more rigorous scientific evaluation. Widespread implementation should await the result of ongoing studies to address the effectiveness of testing and evaluate possible inadvertent harm. If drug testing on students is conducted, it should never be implemented in isolation. A comprehensive assessment and therapeutic management program for the student who tests positive should be in place before any testing is performed. Schools have the opportunity to work with parents, health care professionals, and community officials to use programs with proven effectiveness, to identify students who show behavioral risks for drug-related problems, and to make referrals to a student's medical home. When use of an illicit substance is detected, schools can foster relationships with established health care experts to assist them. A student undergoing individualized intervention for using illicit substances merits privacy. This requires that awareness of the student's situation be limited to parents, the student's physician, and only those designated school health officials with a need to know. For the purposes of this statement, alcohol, tobacco, and inhalants are not addressed.

### The upstream-downstream tension in the global health classroom [^112b1wmQ]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Looking upstream in global health roles

While its mechanisms can be abstract or difficult to observe directly, upstream determination often takes institutional and operational forms. It may be embedded via organisational practices (eg, through active participation in governance, practice guidelines or leadership roles) or formalised through institutions (eg, laws, rights and policies). It can also be less formalised but harness equally powerful social dynamics, such as fostering social inclusion and harmony or challenging unjust social norms and discriminatory ideologies. The form that upstream determination takes depends on the positionality, resources and networks of the actors involved. Upstream determination can also involve designing the systems through which downstream interventions are implemented — ensuring that services and infrastructure are delivered equitably, sustainably and with accountability. For example, workplace safety laws require employers to provide protective equipment for workers, and universal healthcare coverage legislation creates the conditions for primary care, acute care and immunisation programmes to be delivered as public goods rather than discretionary services.

However, the global health job market is fundamentally constructed by the same structural forces that prioritise downstream over upstream solutions. A global health graduate, for example, is far more likely to find employment in organisations focused on service delivery or project-based implementation — roles that engage symptoms — rather than structural forces. While some positions incorporate elements of upstream focus, it is unlikely to make a collective meaningful dent in our progress towards health equity. We encourage students to recognise this asymmetry not as a reason to disengage but as a call to help create new platforms for upstream determination in whichever role they work in. This includes considering leading or being part of social movements, participating in cross-sector alliances and building relationships rooted in mutual respect and equity with communities and partner organisations. After all, addressing upstream determination requires time, sustained effort and collective organisation — conditions best met when graduates see themselves beyond future employees, but as part of broader movements of 'upstreamists' working towards systemic transformation.

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^113eTr1t]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Trauma-informed systems in schools — the National Child Traumatic Stress Network defines a trauma-informed system as an entity in which "all parties involved recognize and respond to the impact of traumatic stress on those who have contact with the system, including children, caregivers, and service providers". The National Child Traumatic Stress Network created a system framework for trauma-informed schools, consisting of 10 core principles to be used as both a preventive approach and as a tiered support system for students that are already affected by trauma. An example of trauma-informed school practices is the Kaiser Permanente Resilience in School Environments program, which successfully provided educators with practical tools to regulate stress, identify feelings, and reframe challenging interactions using a trauma-informed lens.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^114CqhtS]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines executive summary — U.S. psychologists' work with immigrant populations and global mental health needs are described, noting that "in 2012, two thirds of the students in New York City's public school system came from immigrant and underrepresented cultures" and that "psychologists in the average New York City public school are encouraged to be prepared to work with students whose parents have arrived in New York City from an estimated 40 nations across the globe". Citing Whiteford et al., the page states that "Overall, mental and substance use disorders were the fifth leading disorder category of global DALYs", and asserts that "Partnerships between primary healthcare systems of other nations and U.S. behavioral health practices are needed for integrated treatment and increased human resources". It further notes that "the demand for mental and behavioral health care in primary care medical facilities in different nations becomes critical" and that "The need to proactively address the care-need gap from a practical approach has been repeatedly identified by the World Health Organization", adding that U.S. psychologists in international primary care settings "can broadly address in a limited number of short sessions a wide array of problems".

### Retailer experiences with tobacco sales bans: lessons from two early adopter jurisdictions [^113wWwu7]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Beverly Hills and Manhattan Beach, California, are the first two US cities to prohibit the sale of tobacco products, passing ordinances that went into effect on 1 January 2021. We sought to learn about retailers' experiences with these laws 22 months after implementation.

Methods

Brief in-person interviews with owners or managers of businesses that formerly sold tobacco (n = 22).

Results

Participant experiences varied by type of retailer. Managers at large chain stores reported no problems adapting to the law and little effect on overall sales. Many were largely indifferent to the sales bans. By contrast, most managers or owners of small, independent retailers reported losses of both revenue and customers, and expressed dissatisfaction with the laws. Small retailers in Beverly Hills objected particularly to exemptions that city made allowing hotels and cigar lounges to continue their sales, which they saw as undermining the health rationale for the law. The small geographical area covered by the policies was also a source of frustration, and retailers reported that they had lost business to retailers in nearby cities. The most common advice small retailers had for other retailers was to organise to oppose any similar attempts in their cities. A few retailers were pleased with the law or its perceived effects, including a reduction in litter.

Conclusion

Planning for tobacco sales ban or retailer reduction policies should include considering impacts on small retailers. Adopting such policies in as wide a geographical area as possible, as well as allowing no exemptions, may help reduce opposition.

### Is parenting style a predictor of suicide attempts in a representative sample of adolescents? [^113etEvh]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Sample

A total of 3,052 classes (9 th grade) with 71,891 students were drawn. For 921 classes (21,181 students), the directors/main class teachers refused to participate. 2,131 classes participated with a total of 44,610 students. Actually, the 2,131 classes included 50,708 students, but 6,098 of them did not participate (example reasons: parents' refusal or absenteeism). Figure 1 comprises a detailed flow-chart of the evolution of the sample.

Figure 1
Sample constitution.

The return rates (students with director acceptance) differed between the school types and across the classification groups of region size. In spite of the varying return rates in the different classification groups of region size, the final sample represented the proportions of the population very well (e.g. students living in cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in Western Germany: 12.04% in the sample and 11.68% in the population). The proportion of students in the 9 th grade in every classification group of region size in Western and Eastern Germany was compared to their proportion in the sample. With those two percentages for each category, the reliability can be rated. The proportions never differed more than 0.36% between population and sample in the different classes of region size except for Berlin where the difference was 0.62%.

### Socio-economic equity in the impact of population-based interventions to reduce alcohol consumption [^115wfedP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

For pricing and taxation regulations, regulation of the physical availability, restrictions on marketing, and education and persuasion programmes, we will include interventions of any duration and frequency. For human‐delivered brief alcohol interventions, there will be no restrictions on the type of person delivering the intervention (e.g. nurses, physicians, research assistants). We will analyse the five intervention groups as separate syntheses. We will consider interventions that target multiple health risk factors at once if alcohol consumption is explicitly addressed, as well as interventions combined with another eligible or non‐eligible population‐based alcohol intervention (e.g. combined taxation and availability policy and mass media campaign accompanied by lowering the blood alcohol concentration limit for drivers). However, we will categorise interventions that include additional co‐interventions or components into distinct groups based on their specific combination of components and analyse them individually, in the case of sufficient data. We will exclude pharmacological interventions, as well as interventions targeted at specific subpopulations rather than the overall population (e.g. studies solely including pregnant women, people with chronic disease (including alcohol use disorder), university students, or children and adolescents). The latter also include policies for the protection of minors, such as minimum legal purchase age, licencing restrictions, and zero‐tolerance laws for young people, age restrictions on access to alcohol industry websites, and school‐based programmes. We will not include drink‐driving countermeasures (e.g. blood alcohol concentration limits for drivers, zero‐tolerance laws for novice drivers, sobriety checkpoints, or random breath testing), as their main focus is on the reduction of alcohol‐impaired driving among road users by deterrence and punishment rather than on a general reduction in alcohol consumption in the population as a whole. We will also exclude interventions that specifically target subpopulations with low SEP (i.e. low income, low education, or low skill occupations, or the unemployed).

We will consider suitable control groups to encompass no‐intervention control groups, wait‐list control groups, or active control groups (e.g. providing flyers with general health information).

### Policies to restrict secondhand smoke exposure: American College of Preventive Medicine position statement [^1117bcVY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Rationale for the statement — secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and health basis: Exposure to SHS in the U.S. population has decreased significantly "over the past 20 years", yet "at least 126 million nonsmokers in the U.S. are exposed to SHS at least once per week". Healthy People 2020 goals include increasing smokefree indoor air policies "that prohibit smoking in public workplaces, restaurants, and bars in all 50 states, territories, and the District of Columbia". The page states that indoor clean air policies decrease SHS harms and are linked with reductions in cardiovascular diseases, respiratory illnesses, and certain cancers, as well as increased smoking-cessation rates, and concludes, "There is no safe level of SHS exposure".

### Active commuting to school in New Zealand children (2004–2008): a quantitative analysis [^111mUe4d]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe trends in active commuting to school in children from Auckland region, New Zealand following implementation of the School Travel Plan (STP) program. The program included educational initiatives, enforcement activities and urban form changes around school environments.

Methods

Active commuting to school was estimated for 57,096 students, aged 5–10 years, from 56 elementary schools. Data were drawn from surveys conducted between 2004 and 2008.

Results

There was an overall increase in active commuting by the third year of STP implementation when compared to baseline levels (40.5% to 42.2%), [OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.75–4.02]. Students of high socio-economic background improved (38.9% to 39.1%) compared to those from mid [OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.82–1.01] and low [OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.32–0.68]. STP appealed to senior (43.6% to 44.3%), [OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.15–1.53] when compared to junior elementary students. The STP was equally effective in schools with small to medium student rolls compared to large schools (34.1% to 36.5%), [OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.09–1.63]. Schools in Auckland city (47.2% to 48.1%), [OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.20–1.70] showed significant improvements when compared to schools from North Shore City.

Conclusion

The STP was associated with increased active commuting in children after three years of implementation.

### Assessing tobacco retailer compliance with flavoured tobacco product sales restrictions: a cross-sectional study of four California cities [^115uCEiG]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Our retail audit of tobacco retailers in four cities with local ordinances restricting the sale of FTPs found variable rates of retailer non-compliance between cities, ranging from 49.3% of stores to no stores (0%), indicating total compliance. Variable rates of non-compliance were also observed by store type, with higher rates of non-compliance in vape or tobacco specialty stores and lowest in gas stations. In two cities where longitudinal data were collected, retailer non-compliance did not change appreciably over an approximately 6-month period.

The results of this study suggest that the existence of ordinances that restrict the sale of FTPs alone do not ensure compliance among retailers. In this study, there is no clear pattern in policy factors that affect retailer compliance including date of policy passage, length of time the ordinance has been in force, or exemptions. Thus, there may be unaccounted factors affecting retailer compliance such as retailer knowledge of local FTP sales ordinances, resistance to the policy by retailers, or lack of political will or governmental resources to enforce FTP sales restrictions. With the expansion of FTP sales restrictions across local and state governments and a potential federal ban of menthol cigarettes, enforcement actions will be central to ensuring retailers adhere to such policies to maximise their public health impact. This includes explicit statements regarding and commitment to enforcement which, as California's statewide policy shows, may not always be specified in the authorising policy.

This study has limitations. The cities in this study were selected using a convenience sample with a relatively small sample size, limiting generalisability to other cities or regions. The products requested for purchase did not include other FTPs such as cigars which may have affected study outcomes and should be included in future studies. Local enforcement efforts may be an important factor in eliciting retailer compliance, but information regarding such efforts was not collected in this study. Furthermore, research staff were designated to collect data from specified cities, confounding data collectors with cities.

In four Southern California cities, retailer compliance with local FTP sales restrictions was highly variable. Though policies restricting the sale of FTPs are spreading, retailer compliance will require concerted educational and enforcement efforts to realise such policies' intended public health benefit.

### Health system governance: a triangle of rules [^116fp3Tw]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

The rules-in-use (de facto rules) at the operational level may diverge significantly from rules-in-form (de jure rules) at the constitutional level. An important mediator of that gap is actors at the collective level. For example, consider the operational rule that determines the opening hours for outpatient services in a public sector health facility. Constitutional rule-making entities (say, policy-makers at the capital city) may decide that the operational rule should be 09:00 to 17:00. Or they may decide that such a rule should be made at the collective level, say by the council of chiefs (or by the governing board of each health facility or by the health committee in each community). And the council of chiefs may, in turn, decide that such a rule should instead be made by operational level actors; say the manager or health worker in charge of the facility.

In a scenario in which such a rule is only made, changed, monitored and enforced at the constitutional level, two problems may arise. First, constitutional actors are distant from this health facility and may not be able to monitor and enforce this 09:00 to 17:00 rule. Second, distant constitutional level actors may also be unable to use information and feedback from the community to make and change rules in a way that is responsive to the needs and preferences of people in the community. Women in the community may be dissatisfied with the 09:00 to 17:00 rule, perhaps because on market days, they are unable to take their children for immunisation during those hours. So, on those days, they want the health facility to open earlier, at say 07:00, so that they can visit the immunisation clinic before heading to the market.

### Implementing socially responsible licensing for global health: beyond neglected diseases [^111DCq8d]. Science Translational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Global health efforts require socially responsible licensing that permits wide-ranging access to inventions that address health challenges beyond the so-called neglected diseases. Our analysis suggests that universities that excel in global health innovation are less likely to have global-access licensing policies in place. This trend can slow access to new clinical products and diminish the ability of universities to address their public missions.

### Attitude change in youths after being exposed to different road safety interventions in two Mexican cities [^112yY8J9]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the reach of three different types of road safety interventions (social marketing, education and law enforcement) implemented as part of the Iniciativa Mexicana de Seguridad Vial y Prevención de Lesiones en el Tránsito (Mexican Initiative for Road Safety and the Prevention of Road Traffic Injuries) among youth in two Mexican cities (Guadalajara-Zapopan, Jalisco and León, Guanajuato), and to examine students' self-reported attitude change after being exposed to these interventions.

Methods

A cross-sectional design was utilized to evaluate the reach of the city-wide interventions among a random sample of public and private high school and college students from October to December 2011. A total of 5,114 students completed a self-administered questionnaire.

Results

In both cities, students reported a greater exposure to social marketing (73% in Guadalajara-Zapopan and 64% in León) as compared to educational interventions (29.3% in León and 21.6% in Guadalajara-Zapopan) and law enforcement activities (~12% in both). Among respondents, self-reported attitude change was higher after being exposed to educational interventions than law enforcement. Social marketing yielded the lowest prevalence of self-reported attitude change.

Discussion

Our results show a potential moderate impact, measured as self-reported attitude change, resulting from the three intervention approaches under study. Future studies should address the intensity of exposure as well as the translation of attitude change into safer behaviors. Information generated by this study could be useful for local authorities in the intervention areas to inform their activities.

### Local smoke-free policy development in santa Fe, Argentina [^113KJiq7]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Results

First attempts to restrict smoking in public places (1992–2003)

Efforts to pass smoke-free policies in public places began in 1992 in Santa Fe and Rosario while the tobacco industry was fighting a national tobacco control law. On 13 October 1992, a comprehensive national law that, among other measures, intended to end smoking in most public places, was vetoed by the then President of Argentina. The veto resulted from an aggressive lobbying campaign orchestrated by the subsidiaries of both of the transnational tobacco companies operating in Argentina, Massalin-Particulares (a Philip Morris International affiliate) and Nobleza-Piccardo (a British American Tobacco (BAT) affiliate).

Just 5 days before the veto, on 8 October 1992, the Santa Fe provincial legislature approved Law 10 855 to end smoking in all provincial public offices for all three government branches (executive, legislative and judicial). An educational campaign was to be conducted during the first year of implementation to promote the health risks of smoking and SHS. On 3 December 1993, the Santa Fe Governor enacted a decree to regulate the law, establishing minor sanctions for violators included under the Provincial Code of Misdemeanours. Although the law was approved without opposition, the educational campaign was not implemented and the law was never enforced.

Similar to the provincial legislature, since the early 1990s, local policymakers have introduced ordinances in the Rosario City Council to restrict smoking in public places (table 1). All were approved without strong opposition; however, they were never enforced.

Table 1
Ordinances on Smoke-free Policies, Rosario (1992–1998)

On 13 August 1998, the City Council passed Ordinance 6631 to restrict smoking in public places including discos, restaurants and bars. The original 1996 draft sought 100% smoke-free enclosed environments; the approved ordinance required at least 30% of restaurants and cafeterias be smoking areas. This ordinance resembled 'accommodation' laws that the tobacco industry first started pushing in the US to maintain the social acceptability of smoking by preventing passage of strong clean indoor air laws, which Philip Morris International expanded into Latin America in the 1990s as the 'Courtesy of Choice' programme.

### Reducing DUI among US college students: results of an environmental prevention trial [^11719dfp]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol is among the most common and serious alcohol-related problems experienced by US college students. Community-based prevention trials using environmental approaches to DUI prevention have been effective in reducing DUI. Such interventions remain untested in college settings. This study is the first to test the efficacy of an environmental prevention campaign to reduce DUI among college students.

Design

We used a quasi-experimental non-equivalent comparison group design to test the efficacy of the DUI prevention intervention. Students at the experimental university were exposed to a DUI prevention intervention that included a social marketing campaign, a media advocacy campaign and increased law enforcement (DUI checkpoints and roving DUI patrols).

Setting

Students from two large public universities located along the US/Mexico border participated in the seven-semester study.

Participants

In total, 4832 college students took part.

Measures

Using telephone interviews of randomly selected students, we took pre- and postintervention measures of self-reported DUI.

Findings

Self-reported DUI (past year) decreased significantly from pre-test to post-test (odds ratio = 0.55) at the intervention school, whereas rates at the comparison campus remained stable. The campus-intervention interaction was statistically significant (P < 0.05), suggesting that the campaign led to the observed change in DUI.

Conclusions

Environmental DUI campaigns similar to those validated in community prevention trials can be effective in college settings. Further research, however, is needed to determine the robustness of the changes associated with such campaigns.

### Evaluation of an integrated multisector campaign to increase child helmet use in Vietnam [^111b65d3]. Injury Prevention (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study presents child helmet use before, during and after implementing the Vietnamese National Child Helmet Action Plan (NCHAP) and evaluates its effect on child helmet use. The NCHAP, an integrated multisector campaign, incorporated a wide-scale public awareness campaign, school-based interventions, increased police patrolling and enforcement, and capacity building and support to relevant government departments in target provinces.

Methods

In Vietnam's three largest cities, 100 schools in 20 districts were selected to monitor motorcycle helmet use behaviour. The effectiveness of the NCHAP was measured by unannounced, filmed observations of student motorcycle passengers and their adult drivers as they arrived or left their schools at four points. Baseline observations at each school were conducted in March 2014, with subsequent observations in April 2015, December 2015 and May 2016.

Results

Across the 84218 observed students, student helmet prevalence increased from 36.1% in March 2014 to 69.3% immediately after the initiation in April 2015. Subsequent observations in December 2015 and May 2016 showed a reduction and stabilisation of helmet use, with 49.8% and 56.9% of students wearing helmets, respectively. Helmet use in students was higher when adult drivers were also wearing helmets.

Conclusions

Integrated multisectoral interventions between governments, civil society and the corporate sector that incorporate communications, school-based education, incentives for change and police enforcement have the potential to increase helmet use among children. Future integrated campaigns may be more effective with an increased focus on parents and other adult drivers given their potential influence on child helmet use.

### The APA guidelines for psychological practice with sexual minority persons: an executive summary of the 2021 revision [^1144Htzq]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Education and vocational issues — Psychologists strive to understand the educational and school system experiences that impact sexual minority students in K-12 and college/university settings. According to cited research, approximately 95% of sexual minority K-12 students reported hearing expressions such as "dyke" and "faggot"; further, over 40% reported considering suicide and approximately 30% reported attempting suicide in the last year. Schools that enact and enforce anti-harassment and anti-bullying policies protecting sexual minority youth are the schools where students report the lowest rates of bullying and victimization, and sexual minority youth report cyberbullying at higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts. Hostile school climates have a significant negative impact on sexual minority students' mental health and academic performance, and sexual minority students who are victimized in schools have poorer academic-related outcomes and poorer mental health outcomes. According to GLSEN's 2018 climate survey, Black/African American sexual minority students were more likely to experience out-of-school suspension or expulsion than White students and other sexual minority students of color.

### Municipal smoke-free laws and preterm birth [^117GhAQa]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Smoking during pregnancy and prenatal secondhand smoke exposure increase the risk of preterm birth. As Kentucky has the second highest rate of smoking in the United States and no statewide smoke-free law, an examination of the effect of municipal smoke-free legislation on preterm birth is warranted.

Objective

This study used state-level live birth data and county-level municipal smoke-free legislation status to assess the association between the presence and strength of smoke-free laws and the likelihood of preterm birth. Moreover, this study hypothesized that pregnant persons living in counties with comprehensive municipal smoke-free laws prohibiting smoking inside all workplaces and enclosed public places would exhibit a lower likelihood of preterm birth than those living in counties with weak or moderate laws (ie, smoke-free laws with exemptions that do not cover all workplaces and enclosed public places) or no smoke-free law.

Study Design

Using live birth data from the Kentucky Office of Vital Statistics with birth years ranging from 2004 to 2020, a total of 894,372 live births were recorded that indicated that a childbearing person was between the ages of 18 and 49 years and a resident of Kentucky; these live births formed the sample for the study. Municipal ordinances implemented during a given calendar year were coded in the model as present starting with the following calendar year, as the birth records were time deidentified except for the year of birth. This lagged law convention maximized the likelihood that pregnant persons included in the study were exposed to the smoke-free policy for at least a portion of their pregnancy. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the effect of smoke-free ordinances on the likelihood of preterm birth, with personal- and county-level variables included as potential covariates and pregnant persons nested within the county of residence. Data analysis was conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with an alpha level of .05.

Results

Nearly all personal-level variables were associated with preterm birth status. Personal factors associated with an increased likelihood of preterm birth included being older (relative to 18–24 years old; odds ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 1.02 [1.01–1.04] and 1.27 [1.24–1.31] for ages 25–34 and 35–49 years, respectively); having a history of preterm birth (odds ratio, 4.65; 95% confidence interval, 4.53–4.78); and smoking before pregnancy (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.12–1.16). Pregnant persons living in counties with comprehensive laws were 9% less likely to have a preterm birth than those living in counties without a smoke-free ordinance (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.94; P < .001). There was no difference in the likelihood of preterm birth between those living in counties with moderate or weak laws and those unprotected by any smoke-free ordinance in their county of residence.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that comprehensive municipal smoke-free laws are associated with reduced risk of preterm birth and that moderate or weak smoke-free laws are not. The findings have major implications for public health policy and underscore the potential influence of healthcare providers' advocacy for strong smoke-free policies, prohibiting smoking in all workplaces (including restaurants, bars, and casinos), to support healthy pregnancies.

### Food environment after implementation of a healthy checkout policy [^111ebz9M]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The high level of HCO compliance observed in Berkeley was attained after outreach to stores about the policy had been conducted but prior to enforcement, which is described in the ordinance as including inspections and citations, including fines (eg, paying for costs associated with investigating complaints). Initial outreach and technical assistance around the HCO was provided to stores between December 2020 and November 2021 by a youth-focused, community-based organization that received a grant from the city to work on implementation as a result of a community grantmaking process established by Berkeley's SSB excise tax ordinance. Healthy checkout ordinance compliance, and therefore the healthfulness of store checkout environments, may increase further (especially in independent grocery and chain drug stores) after city inspections are completed, which began in 2023.

Because this is the first evaluation of a healthy checkout policy, to our knowledge, there were no similar studies for comparison. However, the level of compliance observed herein exceeds that observed in other studies of mandatory healthy retail or restaurant policies. For example, an evaluation of the 2015 Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance, which required food stores to stock minimum quantities of healthy foods and beverages in specific categories, found that there was no difference in change between stores in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and comparison stores in St. Paul, Minnesota. Furthermore, by 2017, compliance among sampled stores was fairly low, with only 10% of stores being fully compliant and only 51% being mostly compliant. Likewise, evaluations of healthy beverage default laws regulating restaurant children's meals have found low postpolicy compliance (eg, 6%-41%) and/or no significant difference in prepolicy to postpolicy change between jurisdictions subject to the policy and comparison jurisdictions.

### Honoring do-not-attempt-resuscitation requests in schools [^116LbRV5]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Increasingly, children and adolescents with complex chronic conditions are living in the community. Federal legislation and regulations facilitate their participation in school. Some of these children and adolescents and their families may wish to forego life-sustaining medical treatment, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, because they would be ineffective or because the risks outweigh the benefits. Honoring these requests in the school environment is complex because of the limited availability of school nurses and the frequent lack of supporting state legislation and regulations. Understanding and collaboration on the part of all parties is essential. Pediatricians have an important role in helping school nurses incorporate a specific action plan into the student's individualized health care plan. The action plan should include both communication and comfort-care plans. Pediatricians who work directly with schools can also help implement policies, and professional organizations can advocate for regulations and legislation that enable students and their families to effectuate their preferences.

### Reduced hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction after implementation of a smoke-free ordinance – city of pueblo, Colorado, 2002–2006 [^1127QA5z]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) has immediate adverse cardiovascular effects, and prolonged exposure can cause coronary heart disease. Nine studies have reported that laws making indoor workplaces and public places smoke-free were associated with rapid, sizeable reductions in hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, most studies examined hospitalizations for 1 year or less after laws were implemented; thus, whether the observed effect was sustained over time was unknown. The Pueblo Heart Study examined the impact of a municipal smoke-free ordinance in the city of Pueblo, Colorado, that took effect on July 1, 2003. The rate of AMI hospitalizations for city residents decreased 27%, from 257 per 100,000 person-years during the 18 months before the ordinance's implementation to 187 during the 18 months after it (the Phase I post-implementation period). This report extends that analysis for an additional 18 months through June 30, 2006 (the Phase II post-implementation period). The rate of AMI hospitalizations among city residents continued to decrease to 152 per 100,000 person-years, a decline of 19% and 41% from the Phase I post-implementation and pre-implementation period, respectively. No significant changes were observed in two comparison areas. These findings suggest that smoke-free policies can result in reductions in AMI hospitalizations that are sustained over a 3-year period and that these policies are important in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease. This effect likely is mediated through reduced SHS exposure among nonsmokers and reduced smoking, with the former making the larger contribution.
