## Question

Contraindications for Ferruc gluconate in a patient with anemia who received 2 units of blood and dvt on warfarin inr 6,5

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sodium ferric gluconate (Ferrlecit) is contraindicated in a patient with anemia, recent transfusion, DVT, and supratherapeutic INR on warfarin, and what precautions or alternatives should be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal labeled contraindications for ferric gluconate. Then, I should verify whether recent transfusion, active DVT, or supratherapeutic INR changes the risk calculus. Next, I will review infection-related cautions and monitoring requirements. After that, I should consider drug–drug interactions with warfarin and any need to adjust anticoagulation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with dosing and monitoring guidance, including alternatives if needed.

> Let me first confirm the labeled contraindications. The FDA labeling for sodium ferric gluconate states the only absolute contraindication is known hypersensitivity to sodium ferric gluconate or any of its components, with reactions including anaphylaxis, so hypersensitivity is the key exclusion criterion [^111wbGph] [^117SXyBh].

> Wait, let me verify whether recent transfusion or active DVT alters this. I initially wondered if recent transfusion might be a contraindication, but I should double-check the label and guidelines; there is no mention of transfusion history as a contraindication, and no guideline lists recent transfusion as a reason to avoid IV iron, so that concern is unfounded here [^111wbGph] [^116DCPpr]. Likewise, active DVT itself is not a labeled contraindication to ferric gluconate, though I need to ensure we account for infection cautions and overall thrombotic risk in the decision-making process [^111wbGph] [^117SXyBh].

> I need to check infection-related cautions next. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while active systemic infection is a situation where many guidelines advise caution or avoidance of IV iron, this is not a formal labeled contraindication for ferric gluconate, and the strength of evidence varies; KDIGO suggests avoiding IV iron in active systemic infection, whereas the UK Kidney Association notes infection should not be regarded as an absolute contraindication if the risk–benefit favors treating anemia, especially if bacteremia is absent, so clinical judgment is essential here [^11245VhZ] [^115JfC31]. Given the scenario does not specify infection, I should proceed with standard precautions rather than a blanket deferral, but I will keep infection screening in mind if clinically suspected [^113qCqKs] [^115JfC31].

> Next, I should review warfarin and INR considerations. Let me think about this carefully: there is no direct pharmacokinetic interaction between ferric gluconate and warfarin, and supratherapeutic INR does not create a new contraindication to IV iron; however, the bleeding risk is driven by the INR elevation and the patient's clinical context, not by the iron product itself, so the priority is to manage the anticoagulation rather than avoid indicated iron therapy [^notfound] [^112yVtAk]. I should confirm that the INR of 6.5 warrants warfarin interruption and vitamin K as per guideline thresholds for nonmajor bleeding or high INR without bleeding, which it does, and then proceed with iron once the bleeding risk is mitigated and the patient is clinically stable [^notfound].

> I will now examine dosing and administration safety. Standard adult repletion with ferric gluconate is 125 mg elemental iron per dose, typically given as a 1-hour infusion in 100 mL normal saline, repeated to a cumulative 1,000 mg over about 8 sessions; doses above 125 mg are associated with more adverse effects, so I should not exceed 125 mg per infusion [^112h4CNq]. I should confirm first-dose monitoring: observe for 60 minutes after infusion with resuscitation capability available, given rare but serious hypersensitivity reactions, and document any prior parenteral iron reactions before treatment [^1115CJy8] [^113qCqKs].

> But wait, what if the anemia is multifactorial or the patient is unstable? I need to ensure we are treating true iron deficiency and that the patient is hemodynamically stable before giving IV iron; if iron deficiency is confirmed and oral iron is not suitable or has failed, IV iron is appropriate, and recent transfusion does not preclude it, though I should recheck ferritin and transferrin saturation to guide need and avoid iron overload [^116wp4dY] [^116DCPpr]. If there is concern for active infection or bacteremia, I should delay iron until infection is controlled, recognizing this is a precaution rather than a labeled contraindication [^112h4CNq] [^115JfC31].

> Let me consider alternatives if there are access or tolerability issues. Iron sucrose is a reasonable alternative with a different safety profile and typical dosing of 100–200 mg per session, though it requires multiple infusions; ferric carboxymaltose allows 1,000–1,500 mg in one or two infusions but carries a higher risk of hypophosphatemia, so I should choose based on urgency, comorbidities, and monitoring capacity [^116pZz8e] [^115JfC31]. If hypersensitivity to ferric gluconate is confirmed or strongly suspected, desensitization protocols exist, but that is not the scenario described here [^114RxMQB].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I should confirm there is no history of hypersensitivity to ferric gluconate or its components; if none, ferric gluconate is not contraindicated in this patient. The correct management sequence is to stabilize the anticoagulation by holding warfarin and giving vitamin K as indicated for INR 6.5, reassess bleeding risk, and then administer ferric gluconate 125 mg IV over 1 hour with 60-minute post-infusion observation and resuscitation resources available, repeating to a total of 1,000 mg as needed based on iron indices and response [^113F3oUj] [^112h4CNq] [^1115CJy8]. I should double-check for signs of infection before infusion and defer only if there is active systemic infection or bacteremia where the risk clearly outweighs benefit, documenting the rationale if I delay therapy [^116rxGHx] [^115JfC31].

Ferric gluconate is **not absolutely contraindicated** in a patient with anemia, recent transfusion, DVT, and INR 6.5 on warfarin. The main contraindication is **hypersensitivity to ferric gluconate** or its components [^111wbGph] [^117SXyBh]. However, the elevated INR and active DVT increase bleeding risk, so **IV iron should be delayed** until the INR is corrected and the DVT is stabilized. If iron is urgently needed, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring and consider oral iron if feasible. Avoid IV iron in active infection or iron overload [^116rxGHx] [^115JfC31].

---

## Absolute contraindications

The **only absolute contraindication** is known hypersensitivity to ferric gluconate or any of its components, including anaphylaxis [^111wbGph] [^117SXyBh].

---

## Relative contraindications and precautions

Several factors in this patient **warrant caution** but do not constitute absolute contraindications:

- **Elevated INR (6.5)**: Supratherapeutic INR significantly increases bleeding risk; IV iron can cause infusion reactions and rare hypersensitivity, which may complicate bleeding management [^1178gnny] [^112yVtAk].

- **Active DVT**: Active thrombosis increases bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulation; IV iron should be delayed until the DVT is stabilized and the INR is therapeutic [^notfound].

- **Recent transfusion**: Recent transfusion is not a contraindication, but iron status should be reassessed to avoid iron overload [^notfound].

- **Infection**: Active infection is a relative contraindication; IV iron can exacerbate infection risk and should be avoided in active systemic infection [^116rxGHx] [^115JfC31].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized risk–benefit assessment**:

- **INR management**: For INR > 5.0 without bleeding, withhold 1–2 warfarin doses and reduce the maintenance dose; consider vitamin K if rapid correction is needed [^113F3oUj].

- **IV iron administration**: If absolutely necessary, administer the lowest effective dose with close monitoring for hypersensitivity and bleeding [^111M3RrJ].

- **Alternative routes**: Consider oral iron if feasible, as it avoids infusion-related risks [^116wp4dY].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical factor** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Hypersensitivity to ferric gluconate | Absolute contraindication |
| INR 6.5 on warfarin | Delay IV iron until INR is therapeutic |
| Active DVT | Delay IV iron until stabilized |
| Recent transfusion | Reassess iron status; avoid iron overload |
| Active infection | Relative contraindication; avoid IV iron |

---

Ferric gluconate is **not absolutely contraindicated** in this patient, but the elevated INR and active DVT necessitate delaying IV iron until these are stabilized. If iron is urgently needed, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring and consider oral iron as an alternative.

### Safety in iron management [^111axQRu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) iron therapy has become an integral part of hemodialysis management during the past several decades, and the National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines recognize that most patients undergoing hemodialysis will require IV iron therapy on a regular basis to reach target hemoglobin (Hgb) levels. There now are three IV iron compounds available in the United States: iron dextran, sodium ferric gluconate, and iron sucrose. Although all have been proven effective for increasing Hgb/hematocrit levels, recent data show differences in their relative safety profiles. During the past two decades, more than 30 deaths have been attributed to the use of IV iron dextran. The two newer compounds available in the United States, sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose, have more favorable safety profiles, with the largest prospective safety comparison to date showing sodium ferric gluconate to be similar to placebo in the incidence of serious anaphylactoid-type reactions. This article reviews safety data surrounding the IV iron therapies.

### Drug insight: safety of intravenous iron supplementation with sodium ferric gluconate complex [^115atZ4P]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Intravenous iron is necessary for optimal management of anemia in patients receiving hemodialysis and is utilized in the majority of these patients in the US. The availability of nondextran formulations of intravenous iron has significantly improved the safety of its use. The nondextran iron formulation sodium ferric gluconate complex (SFGC) has been extensively studied in the hemodialysis population, with two large phase IV trials documenting its safety. SFGC is efficacious and, at recommended doses, is associated with a low incidence of adverse events. There have been few comparative studies of the nondextran intravenous iron preparations; however, they are known to have different pharmacokinetic characteristics. There is also evidence to indicate that these compounds differ in terms of their cytotoxic and proinflammatory properties, and their propensity to induce oxidative stress. This paper reviews the current literature on the safety of SFGC and examines the emerging safety issues surrounding the use of intravenous iron.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### Hypersensitivity from intravenous iron products [^111RnsJQ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

In the last several years, intravenous therapy with iron products has been more widely used. Although it has been a standard procedure in dialysis-associated anemia since the early 1990s, its use is expanding to a host of conditions associated with iron deficiency, especially young women with heavy uterine bleeding and pregnancy. Free iron is associated with unacceptable high toxicity inducing severe, hemodynamically significant symptoms. Subsequently, formulations that contain the iron as an iron carbohydrate nanoparticle have been designed. With newer formulations, including low-molecular-weight iron dextran, iron sucrose, ferric gluconate, ferumoxytol, iron isomaltoside, and ferric carboxymaltose, serious adverse events are rare.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112fptXx]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the true risks and contraindications of i.v. iron?

Many clinicians and health authorities still consider that i.v. iron is strongly associated with major side‐effects such as anaphylaxis, infection or oxidative stress. However, these side‐effects appear not to be significant with the newer i.v. iron preparations, such as ferric carboxymaltose, iron isomaltoside and low molecular weight iron dextran 64, 65, 66.

After an extensive review of the data, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that " all i.v. iron medicines have a small risk of causing allergic reactions which can be life‐threatening if not treated promptly " 67. However, the reported incidence of potentially life‐threatening hypersensitivity reactions (< 1:250,000 administrations) is vastly overestimated; the pathophysiological mechanism is poorly understood, although a substantial proportion is thought to be mediated by complement activation, resulting in complement activation‐related pseudo allergy (CARPA) 68, 69. Minor infusion reactions due to 'labile' iron may occur, but are usually self‐limiting without intervention and should not be misinterpreted as acute hypersensitivity events 65, 70.

The CHMP's review also concluded that " the benefits of these medicines are greater than their risks, provided that adequate measures are taken to minimise the risk of allergic reactions " 67. To this end, i.v. iron preparations should only be given in an environment where resuscitation facilities are available, so that patients who develop an allergic reaction can be treated immediately, and patients should be closely observed for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during and for at least 30 min following each injection of i.v. iron. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of these reactions have been recently published 71. In addition, the CHMP's report contraindicates the use of i.v. in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or excipients; with serious hypersensitivity to other parenteral iron products; or in the first trimester of pregnancy 67.

### The comparative safety of intravenous iron dextran, iron saccharate, and sodium ferric gluconate [^115csXgJ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2000). Low credibility.

Intravenous iron treatment is an important component of anemia therapy for patients on dialysis. Until recently iron dextran was the only parenteral form of iron available in the United States. This drug has been associated with occasional serious adverse reactions, including full-blown anaphylaxis. In 1999 the Food and Drug Administration approved a second form of iron for intravenous administration, sodium ferric gluconate in sucrose. It is expected that by the time of this publication, a third agent, iron saccharate will also be approved. In this review the comparative safety of these three agents is critically evaluated.

### Sodium ferric gluconate complex in the treatment of iron deficiency for patients on dialysis [^117N6Pmp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Intravenous iron has been found to be an important adjunctive therapy in the treatment of anemia for patients on dialysis. In the United States, iron dextran had been the only form available for parenteral use until 1999. This agent has been associated with a concerning number of severe adverse reactions, in some cases resulting in patients' deaths. Recently, a form of iron used for many years in Europe, sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose, was approved for intravenous use in the United STATES: Because this agent does not contain the immunogenic dextran component of iron dextran, it is expected that the safety profile of this drug should be superior to that of iron dextran. The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the relevant literature and to synthesize the information into a strategy for clinical use of this drug.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^111jxwye]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Parenteral iron hypersensitivity — diagnosis and testing: Evaluation of an iron reaction should document the specific product and dose, route, and rate of administration, and include a detailed description of the reaction, treatment, and response. Skin testing has limited value because most reactions are not IgE-mediated, but it may detect a subset of patients who are sensitized via typical allergic pathways. A protocol for ferric gluconate skin testing has been used: skin prick at 12.5 mg/mL, and IDT at 0.0125, 0.125, and 1.25 mg/mL at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. Skin testing to iron sucrose should not be performed, because a permanent tattoo can form from deposition of iron pigment.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^111HmFfp]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug-drug interactions involving Ferrlecit have not been studied. Ferrlecit may reduce the absorption of concomitantly administered oral iron preparations. Risk Summary Parenteral iron administration may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions, which may have serious consequences, such as fetal bradycardia. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Available data from postmarketing reports with Ferrlecit use in pregnancy are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Untreated iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as postpartum anemia. Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IDA include increased risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Severe adverse reactions including circulatory failure may occur in pregnant women with intravenous iron administration, which may have serious consequences on the fetus such as fetal bradycardia, especially during the second and third trimesters. The Ferrlecit iron complex is not dialyzable. No data is available regarding overdose of Ferrlecit in humans. Excessive dosages of Ferrlecit may lead to accumulation of iron in storage sites potentially leading to hemosiderosis. Do not administer Ferrlecit to patients with iron overload. Patients in the high-dose Ferrlecit group achieved significantly higher increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit than patients in the low-dose Ferrlecit group. See Table 1.

Study B was a single-center, non-randomized, open-label, historically controlled, study of the safety and efficacy of variable, cumulative doses of intravenous Ferrlecit in iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. Ferrlecit administration was identical to Study A. The primary efficacy variable was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to the last available observation through Day 50. Baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit values were similar between the treatment and control groups, and were
9. 1 g/dL and 27. 3%, respectively, for Ferrlecit-treated patients. Serum iron studies were also similar between treatment and control groups, with the exception of serum ferritin, which was 606 ng/mL for historical control patients, compared to 77 ng/mL for Ferrlecit-treated patients.

Despite the overwhelming preponderance of published evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron, reluctance to its use among practitioners prevails due to heightened concerns of danger fomented, at least in part, by misinformation and misinterpretation of the incidence and clinical nature of serious adverse events occurring in recipients of this treatment. The convincing evidence brought forth from these well-performed in vitro experiments and animal models provides information not only on a long-sought physiological mechanism for a commonly observed clinical event but more importantly on the need to heighten the awareness of a readily prescribed treatment modality which mitigates its occurrence.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116nQCco]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

A study of 2,534 haemodialysis (HD) patients receiving sodium ferric gluconate (SFGC) or placebo found low rates of anaphylaxis with non-dextran irons, with reactions generally manageable. A retrospective cohort study comparing five IV iron preparations reported the highest anaphylaxis rate with iron dextran (9.8 per 10,000 first doses), followed by ferumoxytol (4.0), ferric gluconate (1.5), iron sucrose (1.2), and ferric carboxymaltose (0.8).

The IRONMAN trial, involving 1,127 heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and iron deficiency, reported no significant differences in serious adverse events between the IV ferric derisomaltose and usual care groups. Only one participant experienced an infusion-related reaction, which resolved after observation.

The MHRA has issued updated guidance on IV iron use due to the potential for serious and rarely fatal hypersensitivity reactions, particularly in pregnant women. Such reactions can occur even with prior tolerance and are more common in individuals with allergies, immune or inflammatory conditions, or atopic history. Key recommendations include:

Strict adherence to product-specific administration guidelines.
Monitoring for hypersensitivity during and for at least 30 min post-administration.
Ensuring staff trained in anaphylaxis management and resuscitation facilities are available.
Caution in high-risk individuals, with IV iron only administered when benefits outweigh risks.

Rationale

Oral iron treatments for iron deficiency anaemia often cause gastrointestinal side effects, leading to poor adherence, while intravenous (IV) iron can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to high levels of non-bound iron. To address these issues, novel iron preparations have been developed to enhance tolerability and efficacy. These include nanosized compounds like ferric citrate, ferric maltol, and sucrosomial iron, which offer high bioavailability and reduced side effects, making them viable options for chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related anaemia.

### Iron therapy for the treatment of iron deficiency in chronic heart failure: intravenous or oral? [^115qW9Vi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

It is challenging to compare accurately the risk of hypersensitivity reactions between different i.v. iron preparations since events are very rare and reporting can be poor. I.v. iron complexes that contain dextran ligands can cause dextran-induced anaphylactic reactions. These are rare, particularly when using low molecular weight dextran preparations, but are serious events and have led to recommendations that i.v. iron dextran should be avoided. Sodium ferric gluconate, iron sucrose, and ferric carboxymaltose do not contain dextran ligands, although hypersensitivity reactions unrelated to dextran ligands are still possible.

Iron is essential for mounting an effective immune response, but it is also biologically plausible that excess iron can impair normal neutrophil and T-cell functioning, with an associated risk of increased microbial growth. The clinical evidence is largely based on observational studies on haemodialysis patients, which have yielded conflicting results, but taking a cautious approach the current Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease advises avoiding i.v. iron therapy in patients with active systemic infections. Conversely, withholding iron therapy with consequent iron deficiency may increase the risk of infections.

Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate all important safety endpoints, including infection. Ongoing monitoring of newer i.v. agents such as ferric carboxymaltose, ferumoxytol, and iron isomaltoside 1000 is essential to establish an extensive evidence base similar to that which already exists for earlier preparations such as iron sucrose. Additional clinical trials are being undertaken to help provide such data, in response to requests from regulatory authorities.

Which patients are suitable candidates for intravenous iron?

The FAIR‐HF, CONFIRM‐HF and EFFECT‐HF studies enrolled CHF patients with LVEF ≤ 45%, and demonstrated the efficacy of IV FCM with respect to improving functional capacity, HF symptoms and health‐related QoL, 22, 24, 34 while potentially reducing risk of HF‐related hospitalizations in this patient population. 24 These clinical trials were not designed for, or powered to, evaluate the effect of treatment on survival. Therefore, the potential efficacy of IV iron therapy in reducing mortality in CHF patients has not been demonstrated to date. The efficacy and safety of IV iron therapy has not yet been established in acute HF, or in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, defined as LVEF ≥ 50%). These gaps in knowledge are being addressed in ongoing clinical trials. 36, 37, 38

Contraindications for the use of FCM in patients with CHF and iron deficiency are few and include: hypersensitivity to the active substance, to FCM, or any of its excipients; known serious hypersensitivity to other parenteral iron products; the presence of anaemia not attributed to iron deficiency (e.g. other microcytic anaemia); evidence of iron overload; or disturbances in the utilization of iron 39 (Table 2).

Table 2
Practical guidance on the treatment of iron deficiency in patients with chronic heart failure

It is also important to note that the efficacy and safety of IV FCM have not been evaluated in patients with Hb levels > 15 g/dL, and therefore the drug should not be used in this patient population. Furthermore, IV iron should be used with caution in patients with acute or chronic infection according to the opinion of the treating physician, and treatment with IV FCM should be stopped in patients with ongoing bacteraemia. 39

Who can administer intravenous ferric carboxymaltose therapy?

A range of HCPs, including the general practitioner, nurse and hospital physician, can administer IV FCM therapy. In clinical practice, this varies between treatment centre and country based on local prescribing regulations or laws. FCM can be administered in any health care setting where staff are trained and equipment is available to evaluate and treat a potential hypersensitivity reaction. The risk of hypersensitivity reactions with IV FCM is low, with a frequency (events/patients treated) of ≥ 0.1% to < 1.0% observed during clinical trials and post‐marketing surveillance. 39 This is in contrast to the historical risk of older IV iron preparations (e.g. iron dextran), for which an increased risk of anaphylaxis has been observed. 40

### Comparative rates of adverse events with different formulations of intravenous iron [^1132rJSQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Oral iron replacement is the standard therapy in iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). However, 59% of patients have gastrointestinal toxicity. With impaired iron uptake from the gastrointestinal tract (in anemia of chronic disease (ACD) or after bariatric surgery), suboptimal responsiveness to exogenous erythropoietin (in chronic renal failure), in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy, or when oral iron is poorly tolerated, IV iron therapy is the preferred mode of repletion. Although effective in increasing hemoglobin, the relative safety of the available IV iron preparations is not well documented. We examined the comparative safety of IV iron formulations used at hospitals associated with our institution. Among 619 unique patients who received IV iron over a 2-year period, we found 32 adverse events (AEs), ranging from urticaria to chest pain. There were no serious AEs or anaphylactic-type reactions. In a multivariate model, there was no difference in AE rates between low-molecular-weight iron dextran (LMWD) and ferric gluconate; however, iron sucrose had significantly higher odds ratio of AEs (OR = 5.7; 95% CI = 1.6–21.3). Our data suggest that AE rates with IV iron are acceptable. More widespread use of LMWD, in particular, which can be given safely as a total dose infusion (TDI), should be considered.

### Comparative safety of intravenous ferumoxytol versus ferric carboxymaltose in iron deficiency anemia: a randomized trial [^111B95Sd]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

As noted, subsequent to the filing of the sNDA to obtain the broader indication for treatment of IDA due to any etiology, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter requesting additional information. This study was performed to support the sNDA for a broader indication of ferumoxytol and at the request of the FDA to perform a randomized controlled trial with ferumoxytol compared to another approved intravenous iron with the primary focus on rates of serious HSRs. The FIRM study was designed in concert with the FDA including a required HSR questionnaire following each administration's observation period and the primary and secondary safety end points. Notable was the fact that dosing would utilize the FDA‐approved regimens for each product. FCM was selected to facilitate a double‐blind study design comparing 2 intravenous irons delivered in 2 administrations.

Although it has been suggested based on possible pathobiologic mechanisms that the rapidity of administration may increase the occurrence of serious HSRs, 3 other than so‐called "minor infusion reactions" due to labile or free iron, chiefly noted with higher doses of ferric gluconate and iron sucrose, 16 there is no evidence that the total dose of intravenous iron impacts the rate of serious HSRs. The dosing of the 2 intravenous irons studied (1.02 g vs. 1.50 g) reflects the approved dosing regimen, and the difference in dose was not expected to affect the rate of acute HSRs following either of the 2 intravenous iron administrations.

While the primary focus and end points of the study were safety, hematopoietic responses were also assessed. In contrast to HSRs, it was recognized that administering ∼50% more iron could likely affect the secondary end points of efficacy. Therefore, it was prespecified that the change in hemoglobin from baseline would be analyzed as both mean change and mean change per gram of iron administered to assist practitioners in formulating treatment decisions for their patients.

### Anemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [^1152Ey6V]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

ANEMIA MANAGEMENT

The first step in the management of anemia is evaluating the underlying cause. (See above on diagnosis and evaluation.) If absolute iron deficiency is present, the patient should be put on oral or intravenous iron therapy. Several oral iron preparations are available for treatment including ferrous gluconate, fumarate, and sulfate. Doses of 300–325 mg of one of these agents three times daily can increase the Hb level significantly in such patients. Notably, significant gastrointestinal side effects may lead to poor adherence and compliance with oral iron. An alternative is to administer intravenous iron on a periodic basis. Several studies indicate that these preparations are effective and safe in predialysis populations. Dahdah et al. administered intravenous iron dextran to anemic, iron-deficient (serum ferritin < 100 ng/ml or transferrin saturation < 20%) patients with an estimated GFR < 50 ml/min and not on dialysis in doses of either 200 mg/week for 5 weeks or 500 mg/week for 2 weeks. Significant increases in Hb occurred within 2 weeks; all patients tolerated infusions without serious adverse reactions. Intravenous iron preparations including ferric sodium gluconate, iron sucrose, and iron dextran are available and can be administered safely. Among these agents, iron dextran has been associated with the highest incidence of adverse reactions, although the incidence of such reactions is low with all three preparations. Although some studies indicate that intravenous iron is in general more efficacious than oral iron for achieving increases in Hb in patients with CKD, oral iron is also effective. Moreover, no definite advantages have been shown with intravenous versus oral iron in patients with CKD not on dialysis.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Two clinical studies (Studies A and B) were conducted in adults and one clinical study was conducted in pediatric patients (Study C) to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection.

Study A

Study A was a three-center, randomized, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of two doses of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administered intravenously to iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. The study included both a dose-response concurrent control and an historical control. Enrolled patients received a test dose of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection (25 mg of elemental iron) and were then randomly assigned to receive sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection at cumulative doses of either 500 mg (low dose) or 1000 mg (high dose) of elemental iron. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was given to both dose groups in eight divided doses during sequential dialysis sessions (a period of 16 to 17 days). At each dialysis session, patients in the low-dose group received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection 62.5 mg of elemental iron over 30 minutes, and those in the high-dose group received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection 125 mg of elemental iron over 60 minutes. The primary endpoint was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to the last available observation through Day 40.

### Intravenous ferric derisomaltose for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia [^112G1pXw]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) iron is the therapy of choice when oral iron is ineffective or poorly tolerated, yet use has been limited by fears of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Newer formulations that bind iron more tightly and release it more slowly have made the risk of serious or severe HSRs very low. One such formulation, ferric derisomaltose, has been approved in the United States for delivery of 1000mg iron in a single IV infusion. Ferric derisomaltose rapidly repletes iron parameters with low rates of serious or severe HSRs. Single-infusion iron repletion offers convenience, eliminates adherence concerns, and reduces healthcare resource utilization.

### Ferric gluconate reduces epoetin requirements in hemodialysis patients with elevated ferritin [^1142HdmG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The Dialysis Patients Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) study demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous ferric gluconate to improve hemoglobin levels in anemic hemodialysis patients who were receiving adequate epoetin doses and who had ferritin levels between 500 and 1200 ng/ml and transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≤ 25%. The DRIVE-II study reported here was a 6-wk observational extension designed to investigate how ferric gluconate impacted epoetin dosage after DRIVE. During DRIVE-II, treating nephrologists and anemia managers adjusted doses of epoetin and intravenous iron as clinically indicated. By the end of observation, patients in the ferric gluconate group required significantly less epoetin than their DRIVE dose (mean change of -7527 ± 18,021 IU/wk, P = 0.003), whereas the epoetin dose essentially did not change for patients in the control group (mean change of 649 ± 19,987 IU/wk, P = 0.809). Mean hemoglobin, TSAT, and serum ferritin levels remained higher in the ferric gluconate group than in the control group (P = 0.062, P < 0.001, and P = 0.014, respectively). Over the entire 12-wk study period (DRIVE plus DRIVE-II), the control group experienced significantly more serious adverse events than the ferric gluconate group (incidence rate ratio = 1.73, P = 0.041). In conclusion, ferric gluconate maintains hemoglobin and allows lower epoetin doses in anemic hemodialysis patients with low TSAT and ferritin levels up to 1200 ng/ml.

Although second-generation parenteral iron products are much less likely to cause anaphylactic reactions, doses of iron sucrose > 300 mg per infusion or ferric gluconate > 250 mg are not recommended, as they have been associated with higher rates of adverse reactions such as hypotension. In a study of iron sucrose, adverse events occurred in 36% of subjects who received 500-mg doses. Another study reported that an infusion of 500 mg of iron sucrose over 3.5–4 h was associated with hypotension in 6.7% of subjects. Similarly, administration of 500 mg of sodium ferric gluconate over 5 h resulted in a 30% rate of adverse events including hypotension. Thus, safe administration of a typical 1000-mg course of IV iron sucrose or ferric gluconate will require either long infusion times or from five to eight clinic visits with repeated venipuncture. This is clearly inconvenient for outpatient administration and adds to the expense for both patients and healthcare providers. In contrast, 1000 mg of FCM can be administered in a single dose in only 15 min, which would require fewer clinic visits and venipunctures. Thus, FCM appears to be better suited for outpatient use in ND-CKD patients. Only one other IV iron preparation, ferumoxytol, which can be quickly administered in 500-mg doses, has been shown to be superior to oral iron, but it still requires two separate clinic visits for a 1000-mg course.

### On the relative safety of parenteral iron formulations [^111LZYd6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous iron is usually required to optimize the correction of anaemia in persons with advanced chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Randomized clinical trials may have insufficient power to detect differences in the safety profiles of specific formulations.

Methods

We obtained data from the US Food and Drug Administration on reported adverse drug events (ADEs) related to the provision of three formulations of intravenous iron during 1998–2000. We estimated the relative risks [odds ratios (OR)] of ADEs associated with the use of higher molecular weight iron dextran and sodium ferric gluconate complex compared with lower molecular weight iron dextran using 2 x 2 tables.

Results

The total number of reported parenteral iron-related ADEs was 1981 among approximately 21,060,000 doses administered, yielding a rate of 9.4 x 10(-5), or approximately 94 per million. Total major ADEs were significantly increased among recipients of higher molecular weight iron dextran (OR 5.5, 95% CI 4.9–6.0) and sodium ferric gluconate complex (OR 6.2, 95% CI 5.4–7.2) compared with recipients of lower molecular weight iron dextran. We observed significantly higher rates of life-threatening ADEs, including death, anaphylactoid reaction, cardiac arrest and respiratory depression among users of higher molecular weight compared with lower molecular weight iron dextran. There was insufficient power to detect differences in life-threatening ADEs when comparing lower molecular weight iron dextran with sodium ferric gluconate complex.

Conclusions

Parenteral iron-related ADEs are rare. Using observational data, overall and most specific ADE rates were significantly higher among recipients of higher molecular weight iron dextran and sodium ferric gluconate complex than among recipients of lower molecular weight iron dextran. These data may help to guide clinical practice, as head-to-head clinical trials comparing different formulations of intravenous iron have not been conducted.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116rxGHx]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

- All forms of IV iron may be associated with acute adverse events (AEs).

- Immune mechanisms (including IgE-mediated responses or complement activation-related pseudo-allergy) may have a role in some cases.

- Anaphylactoid reactions appear to occur more frequently with high molecular weight iron dextran.

- Labile or free iron reactions occur more frequently with non-dextran forms of iron.

- The rate of life-threatening reactions to iron dextran administration is 0.6% to 0.7%.

- In one study, a total of 2534 haemodialysis patients were directly observed after double-blind exposure to intravenous sodium ferric gluconate (SFGC) or placebo. One patient in each of the SFGC and placebo groups experienced anaphylactoid reactions. Additional cases with characteristics possibly consistent with anaphylaxis occurred in 0.4% of intravenous SFGC–treated patients and 0.1% of placebo-treated patients. The results suggest that there is a relatively low rate of anaphylaxis with non-dextran irons and that the reactions are generally easily managed.

- The MHRA has issued an updated guidance on the use of parenteral iron. This was in response to concerns raised as a result of serious and rarely fatal hypersensitivity reaction, particularly in pregnant women. These reactions can occur even when a previous administration has been tolerated (including a negative test dose). The risk of hypersensitivity is increased in patients with: known allergies (including drug allergies); immune or inflammatory conditions (e.g. systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis); or those with a history of severe asthma, eczema, or other atopic allergy. As a result the MHRA updated guidelines recommend that:

- IV iron should be administered in strict accordance with the posology and method of administration described in the product information for each individual product (note that advice varies between products).

- Caution is needed with every dose of intravenous iron that is given, even if previous administrations have been well tolerated.

- IV iron products should only be administered when staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions — as well as resuscitation facilities — are immediately available.

- Patients should be closely monitored for signs of hypersensitivity during and for at least 30 min after every administration of an IV iron product.

- In patients with increased risk of hypersensitivity, treatment with IV iron products should only be considered if the benefits are clearly judged to outweigh the potential risks.

### Efficacy and safety of ferric carboxymaltose infusion in reducing anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy for nonmyeloid malignancies: a randomized, placebo-controlled study (IRON-CLAD) [^114BDJmW]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ferric carboxymaltose raised no new safety signals and was well tolerated, with no notable difference between groups in the incidence of AEs other than hypophosphatemia, which occurred in 16% of FCM patients and 3% of placebo patients (treatment related in 8% vs. 2%) but was transient and asymptomatic. Short‐term iron‐induced hypophosphatemia has been reported previously. In a study of a single 1000 mg infusion of FCM in patients with NDD‐CKD, a significant reduction in serum phosphate was reported at week 3 and remained lower than baseline for up to 3 months after FCM infusion. Neutropenia was a TEAE in 17.4% of FCM patients and 11.9% of placebo patients, but is not a common AE in clinical trials (i.e. reported in > 1% of patients) or in post‐marketing experience, per the FCM product labeling. Key confounding factors that may decrease neutrophil count―chemotherapy (a key eligibility criterion), concomitant medications, history of neutropenia at baseline (10% of patients), other comorbidities, and underlying morbidities―were present in the study population and should be considered when ascribing causality of neutropenia. Although patients with cancer are at an increased risk of thrombosis, there were no reports of venous thromboembolism during the study. Growing evidence suggests that iron‐deficient erythropoiesis increases thrombotic tendency and that IV iron may reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.

Overall, 54.2% of patients in the placebo group experienced an increase from baseline in Hb of ≥ 1 g/dL during the study. A differing level of aggressiveness of myelosuppressive chemotherapies received or shorter duration of treatment compared to the FCM arm may have contributed to this result. Additional studies with more stringent enrollment criteria using iron parameters may help understand this response.

Evidence suggests that low serum hepcidin levels may aid in identifying iron‐deficient patients who are more likely to benefit from IV iron. This relationship was suggested by an analysis of data from patients receiving ESA for CIA, in which improved Hb in response to IV iron supplementation was observed only in the subgroup of patients whose hepcidin levels were ≤ 64.3 ng/mL. However, in the present study, no clear correlation was found between baseline hepcidin level and change in Hb in the FCM group, although post hoc analysis revealed that a significantly lower percentage of patients in hepcidin tertile 2 receiving FCM had a decrease in Hb ≥ 0.5 g/dL.

### Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose [^112h4CNq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

The dosage of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection is expressed in terms of mg of elemental iron. Each 5 mL sterile, single dose vial contains 62.5 mg of elemental iron (12.5 mg/mL).

Do not mix sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection with other medications or add to parenteral nutrition solutions for intravenous infusion. The compatibility of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection with intravenous infusion vehicles other than 0.9% sodium chloride has not been evaluated. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration, whenever the solution and container permit. If diluted, use immediately.

Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection treatment may be repeated if iron deficiency reoccurs.

2.2 Adult Dosage and Administration

The recommended dosage of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection for the repletion treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients is 10 mL of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection (125 mg of elemental iron). Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection may be diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour per dialysis session. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection may also be administered undiluted as a slow intravenous injection (at a rate of up to 12.5 mg/min) per dialysis session. For repletion treatment most patients may require a cumulative dose of 1000 mg of elemental iron administered over 8 dialysis sessions. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection has been administered at sequential dialysis sessions by infusion or by slow intravenous injection during the dialysis session itself.

Data from sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection postmarketing spontaneous reports indicate that individual doses exceeding 125 mg may be associated with a higher incidence and/or severity of adverse events [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

2.3 Pediatric Dosage and Administration

The recommended pediatric dosage of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection for the repletion treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients is 0.12 mL/kg sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection (1.5 mg/kg of elemental iron) diluted in 25 mL 0.9% sodium chloride and administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour per dialysis session. The maximum dosage should not exceed 125 mg per dose.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^112jXvqd]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Opinions of the Panel: Treatment of Preoperative Anemia

The treatment target in patients with preoperative anemia is usually to restore the Hb level to the normal range. The exact target Hb level may be affected by the clinical setting (eg, lower in patients with renal disease) or by demographic characteristics. Additional data are needed to assess the impact of anemia treatment on clinical outcomes. The optimal time frame to begin treating preoperative anemia before surgery is as soon as possible after surgery is scheduled, ideally at least 3 to 4 weeks in advance. However, a short time frame before surgery should not preclude treatment.

Consensus Statements: Preoperative Iron Therapy

Iron therapy should be administered as treatment for preoperative IDA, except when it is contraindicated.
IV iron is preferable to oral iron in preoperative IDA.
Preoperative oral iron therapy should be started as early as possible.
Preoperative IV iron therapy should be started as early as possible.
Administration of IV iron is generally well tolerated and does not increase the patient's risk of infection.

Supporting Evidence: Preoperative Iron Therapy

A systematic review and meta-analysis of preoperative IV iron in patients undergoing major surgery concluded that this intervention significantly decreases the blood transfusion rate and provides a significant but modest increase in Hb concentration preoperatively and > 4 weeks postoperatively when compared with placebo or oral iron (Fig. 2). Positive results were also reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis of perioperative iron therapy in acute major noncardiac surgery. Patients receiving IV iron had lower 30-day mortality, reduced ABT and a lower risk of postoperative infection. However, most of the evidence was from small observational studies, meaning that the analysis was not sufficiently powered to formally recommend iron therapy. According to the authors of a comprehensive, narrative review, meta-analyses have demonstrated that preoperative treatment with IV iron increases Hb levels, reduces transfusion of RBCs, and improves patient outcomes.

Treatment of IDA

17. We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

18. We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

19. Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

20. We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

21. We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see text), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

22. There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications (see text), but periodic blood count monitoring is suggested (evidence quality-low, consensus-92%, statement strength-weak).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

The treatment of iron deficiency aims to (i) restore normal circulating Hb levels, (ii) replenish body iron stores, (iii) improve quality of life and (iv) improve physiological function. Successful IRT should achieve all of these outcomes. An algorithm providing an overview of the treatment of IDA is shown in figure 3, and the elements of this are discussed in more detail below.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^114NDee1]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Use of iron therapy in patients undergoing specific types of surgery has been investigated in numerous clinical studies and reviews. The placebo-controlled PREVENTT trial (whose design has been called into question) reported that preoperative IV iron before major abdominal surgery was not superior to placebo in reducing perioperative RBC transfusions or mortality, but Hb levels 8 weeks and 6 months after surgery were increased (in line with meta-analyses) and the hospital readmission rate was lower. Details of the publications can be found in the Supplemental Digital Content (Parts 1, Supplemental Digital Content 3, and 4, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

Opinions of the Panel: Preoperative Iron Therapy

The available data suggest that iron therapy as a treatment for preoperative anemia should be limited to patients with IDA. Iron therapy is contraindicated only in patients with an allergy to iron, and septic patients should have their infection controlled before iron therapy is commenced. Both oral and IV iron have been used to treat preoperative anemia. However, in general, IV iron may be preferable to oral iron due to high frequency of adverse effects, noncompliance, poor intestinal absorption in patients with inflammation, and the need for prolonged treatment (to ensure sufficient iron stores) associated with oral therapy. Recent data suggest that IV iron therapy is typically well tolerated and effective. Treatment with IV iron (or oral iron) would ideally be started at least 3 weeks in advance of surgery to allow sufficient time for restoration of iron stores and for other treatment(s) in case of inadequate response.

The panel members perceived the risk of oxidative stress observations with IV iron to be low and of minimal clinical relevance. The potential for IV iron to increase the risk of infection appears to be relatively modest, and the available data may be confounded by factors such as variability in transfusion practices. Panel members believed that the possibility of hypophosphatemia in patients receiving IV iron is a question requiring more study.

Consensus Statements: Preoperative Treatment With ESAs

ESAs have a role in the preoperative treatment of anemia in surgery.
If ESAs are used, supplemental iron should also be given.
If ESAs are used, postoperative prophylactic treatment for thromboembolism should be considered.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115JfC31]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Infusion-related reactions are uncommon with modern intravenous iron preparations, but hypersensitivity-type and infusion reactions (approximate incidence — 0.5%) are commoner than with oral iron or placebo. Serious adverse reaction rates are low, however, and similar for oral and parenteral iron preparations.

Caution is advised regarding the use of parenteral iron in the context of acute and chronic infection, although studies have consistently shown no significant increase in clinically important infective episodes associated with the use of parenteral IRT. Infection should not be regarded as a contraindication to parenteral IRT if the risk/benefit assessment favours treatment of the anaemia, though it should be withheld in those with ongoing bacteraemia.

Hypophosphataemia has been reported with all parenteral iron preparations. This seems to relate to the molecules complexed to the iron, rather than the iron itself. Rates of hypophosphataemia are higher with ferric carboxymaltose (58%) than with iron derisomaltose (4%) or iron sucrose (1%), but the clinical importance of this has not been established. Most of the episodes are biochemically moderate (serum phosphate in the range 0.32–0.64 mmol/L) and asymptomatic, and resolve without the need for intervention. However, because of the rare association with hypophosphataemic osteomalacia, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued a recommendation in 2020 advising that serum phosphate levels should be monitored in those with risk factors for hypophosphataemia, and in those receiving long-term or multiple high-dose infusions of ferric carboxymaltose.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114U9GKz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Iron sucrose ('Venofer', Vifor (International) Inc. Switzerland) is the formulation most extensively studied in patients with IBD. – It has been shown to be safe and well tolerated even in patients previously intolerant to other intravenous iron products. It is a semi-stabile iron preparation with a half-life of 5–6 h so that iron is released relatively quickly. Iron sucrose is typically given as a slow injection of 100–200 mg iron two to three times a week or as a slow infusion of a maximum of 500 mg of iron once a week. This can be disadvantageous in severe anemia because multiple sessions are necessary to supplement the estimated iron deficit.

Ferric gluconate ('Ferrlecit', Sanofi, Paris, France) is a liable iron formulation meaning that iron is also released relatively quickly. Most of the studies on ferric gluconate have been performed in patients with chronic kidney failure and it was shown to be safe and effective in patients with anemia receiving hemodialysis. A typical dosage would be eight infusions of 125 mg during eight consecutive sessions of dialysis.

Ferric carboxymaltose ('Ferinject', Vifor (International) Inc. Switzerland, 'Injectafer', Vifor (International) Inc. Switzerland) is another iron formulation that was approved by the FDA in 2013. Up to 1000 mg of iron can be safely administered within 15 min. Safety and efficiency have been demonstrated in over 3500 patients with IDA and chronic kidney disease, pregnancy/postpartum or congestive heart failure. In patients with IBD, a large randomized controlled trial showed noninferiority in Hb increase compared with oral ferrous sulfate with a faster Hb increase. Another large randomized controlled trial compared ferric carboxymaltose following a new simplified fixed dose regimen with traditional treatment using up to 11 injections of iron sucrose following the Ganzoni calculation. By week 12, a larger proportion of the patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group had a Hb response.

The following additional events were reported in two or more patients: hypertonia, nervousness, dry mouth, and hemorrhage. Drug-drug interactions involving Ferrlecit have not been studied. Ferrlecit may reduce the absorption of concomitantly administered oral iron preparations. Risk Summary Parenteral iron administration may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions, which may have serious consequences, such as fetal bradycardia. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Available data from postmarketing reports with Ferrlecit use in pregnancy are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Untreated iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as postpartum anemia.

Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IDA include increased risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Severe adverse reactions including circulatory failure may occur in pregnant women with intravenous iron administration, which may have serious consequences on the fetus such as fetal bradycardia, especially during the second and third trimesters. Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Benzyl alcohol contained in Ferrlecit may cause serious and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old.

Study A was a three-center, randomized, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of two doses of Ferrlecit administered intravenously to iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. The study included both a dose-response concurrent control and an historical control. Enrolled patients received a test dose of Ferrlecit and were then randomly assigned to receive Ferrlecit at cumulative doses of either 500 mg or 1000 mg of elemental iron. Study B was a single-center, non-randomized, open-label, historically controlled, study of the safety and efficacy of variable, cumulative doses of intravenous Ferrlecit in iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. Ferrlecit administration was identical to Study A. The primary efficacy variable was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to the last available observation through Day 50.

Proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) health-outcome descriptors — upper leg severe, moderate, and mild presentations are defined across symptoms, time horizon, testing and treatment, and consequences. Severe DVT notes symptoms in the entire leg, a time horizon that will persist for months and will slowly improve, and consequences that often include long‑lasting pain and swelling, and sometimes a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death; treatment may be administered in the hospital or at home and typically includes administration of blood thinners using a small tube inserted in your vein, injections or pills, with long‑lasting treatment often required. Moderate DVT will persist for months but improve over that time, and consequences may include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death. Mild DVT will persist for weeks but improve over that time, and consequences rarely include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and very rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death.
