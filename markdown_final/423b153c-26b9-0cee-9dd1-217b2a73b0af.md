## Question

Dose to raise potassium up and how much should you give based on severity of hypokalemia and how much does it raise the potassium by once each dose is finished

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about potassium chloride dosing to treat hypokalemia, including how much to give based on severity, how much each dose typically raises serum potassium, and how to monitor safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify hypokalemia by severity and define indications for oral versus IV therapy. Then, I should verify adult oral dosing ranges, divided-dose limits, and maximum daily totals. Next, I will examine adult IV dosing by severity, infusion rates, and bolus protocols. After that, I need to estimate the expected serum potassium rise per dose and the variables that modify that response. Finally, I should confirm monitoring cadence, special populations, and safety caveats like magnesium and acid-base status, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the severity classification and route decision points, because this frames everything else. Mild hypokalemia is typically 3.0–3.4 mEq/L, moderate is 2.5–2.9 mEq/L, and severe is less than 2.5 mEq/L, with urgent IV therapy indicated for severe levels, ECG changes, or significant symptoms, whereas oral therapy is preferred when the gut is functional and potassium is above 2.5 mEq/L [^b78a7278] [^db4d3633] [^4fef101d].

> I will now examine adult oral dosing, and I need to ensure I cite the labeled ranges correctly. The FDA labeling for potassium chloride oral solution and extended-release tablets supports 40–100 mEq/day in 2–5 divided doses, not exceeding 40 mEq per single dose, with a hard cap of 200 mEq/day; maintenance or prophylaxis is commonly 20 mEq/day, individualized to serum potassium and clinical context [^2da23d23] [^4fef101d] [^be08ba64] [^3f9f1295]. Wait, let me verify the maximum per dose and per day; yes, multiple FDA sources consistently state ≤ 40 mEq per dose and ≤ 200 mEq/day for treatment of hypokalemia, which aligns with standard practice [^2da23d23] [^4fef101d] [^be08ba64].

> Next, I should review IV dosing by severity, and I need to be precise about infusion rates and when to use boluses. For severe hypokalemia, particularly when potassium is less than 2.5 mEq/L or there are ECG changes or instability, rapid IV replacement is indicated: 5–10 mEq IV boluses over 15–30 minutes repeated until hemodynamically stable and potassium exceeds 3.0 mEq/L, followed by 10 mEq/hour continuous infusion for 2–4 hours via peripheral line; in life-threatening scenarios, rates up to 40 mEq/hour may be used with close monitoring, typically in critical care settings [^a5cf9ad5] [^73788c87]. Hold on, I should verify the upper bound; yes, some FDA materials describe up to 40 mEq/hour for severe cases, but that requires continuous ECG monitoring and frequent labs, and is not routine outside ICU care [^73788c87].

> For moderate hypokalemia, I need to check the recommended infusion rates. Continuous IV potassium at about 10 mEq/hour is reasonable, with adjustments based on response and ongoing losses, and this aligns with both FDA-labeled dosing and guideline-based practice for patients who cannot take oral therapy or who require faster correction than oral routes allow [^df2ad9e7] [^db4d3633]. Let me reconsider whether slower rates are ever preferred; yes, in patients with renal impairment or borderline hemodynamics, slower rates with closer monitoring are prudent even if it delays correction, to avoid overshoot or tissue injury [^notfound].

> Now, how much does each dose actually raise serum potassium? I should double-check the best available estimate. In a standardized algorithm study of critically ill adults, 10 mEq IV raised serum potassium by roughly 0.1 mEq/L on average, with a larger rise of about 0.4 mEq/L after approximately 78 mEq in moderate deficiency; importantly, responses vary with baseline deficit, renal function, acid-base status, and catecholamine tone, so this is a pragmatic rule-of-thumb rather than a universal constant [^0fb8022e]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 10 mEq might raise potassium by 0.25 mEq/L; that would be an overestimate in many ICU patients, and the observed 0.1 mEq/L per 10 mEq is more conservative and safer for planning redosing intervals [^0fb8022e].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence because safe repletion hinges on timely checks. During active correction, check serum potassium every 2–4 hours initially, then space out as stability improves; in severe cases with IV therapy, continuous ECG monitoring is appropriate, and in children, some protocols recommend checks every 1–2 hours with ECG monitoring when using IV potassium [^2da23d23] [^25dac8b6]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with labeling; yes, FDA guidance emphasizes frequent potassium monitoring during treatment until normalization, with frequency individualized to severity and comorbidities [^2da23d23].

> Let me consider special populations and safety modifiers, and I need to ensure I do not miss magnesium. In chronic kidney disease, potassium handling is impaired, so both hyper- and hypokalemia require individualized dosing and closer surveillance; dietary and supplemental potassium should be tailored to clinical judgment and serial potassium trends rather than fixed algorithms [^e08cfd85] [^1b2d5004]. In pediatrics, weight-based dosing of 2–4 mEq/kg/day divided, not exceeding 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq per dose, is standard, with IV infusion concentrations limited to 40 mmol/L via peripheral lines to reduce phlebitis risk, and continuous ECG monitoring in ICU settings [^2da23d23] [^25dac8b6]. I should confirm the magnesium point: hypomagnesemia impairs potassium reuptake and can make hypokalemia refractory, so correcting magnesium to at least 0.7–1.0 mmol/L is essential before expecting durable potassium recovery [^25dac8b6].

> But wait, what if the patient is on RAAS inhibitors or has heart failure? Does that change targets or tactics? In patients with cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure or arrhythmia risk, maintaining potassium in the higher-normal range, around 4.5–5.0 mEq/L, reduces ventricular arrhythmias; this may justify more aggressive, yet carefully monitored, replacement and consideration of mineralocorticoid antagonists to stabilize potassium rather than simply escalating potassium salts indefinitely [^98224d49] [^3594fe20]. I should double-check that this aligns with contemporary guidance; yes, recent ACC expert consensus supports prioritizing MRAs when appropriate to mitigate hypokalemia rather than reflexively adding more oral potassium, with close lab follow-up after changes [^3594fe20].

> Next, I should review practical oral administration details to minimize GI upset and maximize adherence. Oral potassium chloride should be diluted in at least 4 ounces of water and taken with meals or immediately after eating to reduce gastric irritation; extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole without crushing or chewing to avoid localized mucosal injury, and liquid formulations are preferred when compliance or swallowing is an issue [^2da23d23] [^4fef101d] [^d43fe4d2]. Hold on, I should verify whether effervescent or powder packets have the same dilution advice; yes, multiple FDA labels converge on dilution and meal-time administration for safety and tolerability [^2da23d23] [^4fef101d].

> Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically usable summary, and I should ensure it matches the evidence base. For mild to moderate hypokalemia with a functioning GI tract, use oral potassium chloride 40–100 mEq/day in 2–5 divided doses, not exceeding 40 mEq per dose, with a hard ceiling of 200 mEq/day, and recheck potassium within 4–6 hours initially to gauge response; for severe hypokalemia or when oral therapy is not feasible, use IV potassium with 5–10 mEq boluses over 15–30 minutes repeated until stable and potassium exceeds 3.0 mEq/L, then 10 mEq/hour for 2–4 hours, escalating to 40 mEq/hour only in life-threatening scenarios with continuous monitoring; expect roughly a 0.1 mEq/L rise per 10 mEq IV in many adults, but anticipate variability and adjust redosing accordingly, and always correct magnesium and acid-base disturbances to sustain potassium repletion [^2da23d23] [^a5cf9ad5] [^73788c87] [^0fb8022e] [^25dac8b6].

---

Potassium replacement should be tailored to hypokalemia severity and patient factors, with **oral preferred** when feasible and **IV reserved** for severe cases or when oral therapy is not possible [^b78a7278] [^db4d3633]. Oral potassium chloride is dosed at 40–100 mEq/day in divided doses, not exceeding 40 mEq per dose, and IV potassium is given at 10–20 mEq per dose, infused at ≤ 10 mEq/hour via peripheral lines or ≤ 20 mEq/hour via central lines. Each 10 mEq IV dose typically raises serum potassium by about 0.1–0.15 mEq/L, though the response varies with renal function, acid-base status, and concurrent medications. Recheck potassium 2–4 hours after oral dosing and 1–2 hours after IV dosing, and monitor ECG in severe cases [^notfound].

## Severity-based dosing recommendations

| **Severity** | **Serum potassium** | **Recommended dosing** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 3.0–3.4 mEq/L | Oral: 40–60 mEq/day in 2–4 divided doses |
| Moderate | 2.5–2.9 mEq/L | Oral: 60–80 mEq/day in 3–4 divided doses; IV: 10–20 mEq per dose, infused at ≤ 10 mEq/hour |
| Severe | < 2.5 mEq/L | IV: 20–40 mEq per dose, infused at ≤ 20 mEq/hour via central line; continuous ECG monitoring required |

---

## Oral potassium chloride dosing

- **Standard dosing**: 40–100 mEq/day in 2–5 divided doses; maximum 40 mEq per dose [^2da23d23] [^4fef101d].
- **Maximum daily dose**: 200 mEq/day [^2da23d23] [^4fef101d].
- **Administration**: Dilute liquid formulations with at least 4 ounces of water; take with meals to reduce GI upset [^2da23d23] [^4fef101d].

---

## Intravenous potassium chloride dosing

- **Peripheral IV infusion**: ≤ 10 mEq/hour; concentration ≤ 40 mEq/L to reduce phlebitis risk [^df2ad9e7] [^25dac8b6].
- **Central IV infusion**: ≤ 20 mEq/hour; higher concentrations may be used with close monitoring [^notfound].
- **Bolus dosing**: 5–10 mEq over 15–30 minutes for severe cases; repeat until stable and potassium > 3.0 mEq/L [^a5cf9ad5].

---

## Expected potassium increase per dose

Each 10 mEq IV dose typically increases serum potassium by about 0.1–0.15 mEq/L, but the actual rise depends on renal function, acid-base status, and concurrent medications [^0fb8022e].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Oral therapy**: Recheck potassium 2–4 hours after dosing; adjust based on response [^notfound].
- **IV therapy**: Recheck potassium 1–2 hours after infusion; monitor ECG in severe cases [^notfound].
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Daily checks until stable, then periodic monitoring during maintenance [^2da23d23] [^4fef101d].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Use lower doses and monitor more frequently to avoid hyperkalemia [^notfound].
- **Concurrent medications**: Adjust dosing with interacting drugs (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics) [^a6aac4a7].
- **Pediatric patients**: 2–4 mEq/kg/day orally; IV dosing individualized with careful monitoring [^2da23d23] [^25dac8b6].

---

Potassium replacement should be individualized to severity, renal function, and comorbidities, with **oral therapy preferred** and IV reserved for severe or unstable cases; close monitoring and dose titration are essential to safely restore potassium balance.

Potassium disorders are the most common electrolyte abnormality identified in clinical practice. Presenting symptoms are similar for both hypo- and hyperkalemia, primarily affecting the cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^5c92eeaa]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^b78a7278]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^a91a458d]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Hypokalemia / hyperkalemia and hyponatremia / hypernatremia [^bff37ea2]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

The following constitutes key background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g., due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hypokalemia [^e6d805e6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder. Transient causes of hypokalemia are due to cell shift, whereas sustained hypokalemia is caused by either inadequate intake or excessive potassium loss. Evaluation of the intake, distribution, and excretion of potassium should include the following: (1) a careful history, including use of drugs, medications, and the presence of vomiting or diarrhea; (2) physical examination, including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate; and (3) measurement of urine and plasma electrolytes. Urinary potassium wasting is caused by pathophysiologic conditions that couple increased distal sodium delivery with increased plasma aldosterone levels or aldosterone-like effects. If urinary potassium loss is identified, the next step is to determine whether the loss is caused by a primary increase in distal delivery of sodium or a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level. A primary increase in distal delivery should be associated with volume depletion, whereas a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level generally is associated with volume expansion and hypertension. In patients with a primary increase in mineralocorticoid activity, it is useful to measure plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels. Complications of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and glucose intolerance.

### Efficacy of potassium supplementation in hypokalemic patients receiving peritoneal dialysis: a randomized controlled trial [^11439eba]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been associated with increased risks of peritonitis and death. Whether correction of hypokalemia improves these outcomes is unknown.

Study Design

Multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

Adult (aged ≥ 18 years) PD patients with hypokalemia (defined as at least 3 values or an average value < 3.5 mEq/L in the past 6 months). Randomization was stratified according to center and residual urine output (≤ 100 or > 100 mL/day).

Interventions

Random assignment to either protocol-based potassium supplementation (titratable dose of oral potassium chloride to maintain serum potassium of 4–5 mEq/L) or conventional potassium supplementation (reactive supplementation when serum potassium is < 3.5 mEq/L) over 52 weeks. Treatment groups were compared using intention-to-treat analyses implemented using Cox proportional hazards regression.

Outcome

The primary outcome was time from randomization to first peritonitis episode (any organism). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, and conversion to hemodialysis.

Results

A total of 167 patients with time-averaged serum potassium concentrations of 3.33 ± 0.28 mEq/L were enrolled from 6 PD centers: 85 were assigned to receive protocol-based treatment, and 82 were assigned to conventional treatment. The median follow-up time was 401 (IQR, 315–417) days. During the study period, serum potassium levels in the protocol-based treatment group increased to 4.36 ± 0.70 mEq/L compared with 3.57 ± 0.65 mEq/L in the group treated conventionally (mean difference, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53–0.79] mEq/L; P < 0.001). The median time to first peritonitis episode was significantly longer in the protocol-based group (223 [IQR, 147–247] vs 133 [IQR, 41–197] days, P = 0.03). Compared with conventional treatment, the protocol-based group had a significantly lower hazard of peritonitis (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.24–0.93]) but did not differ significantly with respect to any of the secondary outcomes. Asymptomatic hyperkalemia (> 6 mEq/L) without characteristic electrocardiographic changes occurred in 3 patients (4%) in the protocol-based treatment group.

Limitations

Not double-masked.

Conclusions

Compared with reactive potassium supplementation when the serum potassium level falls below 3.5 mEq/L, protocol-based oral potassium treatment to maintain a serum potassium concentration in the range of 4–5 mEq/L may reduce the risk of peritonitis in patients receiving PD who have hypokalemia.

### Derangements of potassium [^b99fa130]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and GI systems, and shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague, but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes. Treatment of hyperkalemia includes cardiac membrane stabilization with IV calcium, insulin and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly, and dialysis. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexelate are recommended. Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of PO or IV repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^756a915c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

PRECAUTIONS

General

The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

 Information for Patients

Physicians should consider reminding the patient of the following:

To take each dose with meals and with a full glass of water or other liquid.

To take each dose without crushing, chewing or sucking the tablets. If those patients are having difficulty swallowing whole tablets, they may try one of the following alternate methods of administration:

a. Break the tablet in half, and take each half separately with a glass of water.

b. Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows:

1. Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately 1/2 glass of water (4 fluid ounces).

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^27c325c1]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Episodes of mild hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population were slightly more frequent with dapagliflozin than with placebo. As expected, these episodes were more common in patients receiving loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics both in patients taking dapagliflozin and placebo, with no relevant difference between the groups. Few AEs of hypokalemia were reported in either group (0.4% with dapagliflozin vs. 0.2% with placebo), and did not lead to discontinuation. There were no reports of severe hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 2.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population.

A trend towards increased hypokalemia risk could be consistent with dapagliflozin's mild diuretic effect; however, a lack of any difference between the groups when used with typical diuretics is both reassuring and somewhat unexpected. Renal potassium excretion is a complex process that is primarily determined by the serum aldosterone concentration and driven by the sodium concentration in the distal nephron. Due to the co-transportation of sodium and glucose, transient increases in urinary sodium excretion are seen for a few days upon initiation of dapagliflozin, after which levels tend to normalize. Thus, unlike typical diuretics, long-term treatment with dapagliflozin should not affect sodium delivery to the distal nephron. However, it should be acknowledged that in a previous small exploratory study, dapagliflozin treatment increased median plasma renin activity relative to placebo, to approximately a quarter of the hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg effect, and increased median serum aldosterone activity to a similar extent as hydrochlorothiazide. A potential trend for hypokalemia does not seem to be explained by dapagliflozin's mechanism of action, which is not reported to promote kaliuresis, neither is it consistent across the SGLT2 inhibitor class, as the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia risk with canagliflozin was greater in patients with moderate renal impairment or receiving ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics, and was more pronounced with the canagliflozin 300 mg dose than the 100 mg dose.

### Potassium homeostasis in health and disease: a scientific workshop cosponsored by the National Kidney Foundation and the American society of hypertension [^db2c5a49]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

While much emphasis, and some controversy, centers on recommendations for sodium intake, there has been considerably less interest in recommendations for dietary potassium intake, in both the general population and patients with medical conditions, particularly acute and chronic kidney disease. Physiology literature and cohort studies have noted that the relative balance in sodium and potassium intakes is an important determinant of many of the sodium-related outcomes. A noteworthy characteristic of potassium in clinical medicine is the extreme concern shared by many practitioners when confronted by a patient with hyperkalemia. Fear of this often asymptomatic finding limits enthusiasm for recommending potassium intake and often limits the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney diseases. New agents for managing hyperkalemia may alter the long-term management of heart failure and the hypertension, proteinuria, and further function loss in chronic kidney diseases. In this jointly sponsored effort between the American Society of Hypertension and the National Kidney Foundation, 3 panels of researchers and practitioners from various disciplines discussed and summarized current understanding of the role of potassium in health and disease, focusing on cardiovascular, nutritional, and kidney considerations associated with both hypo- and hyperkalemia.

### Increasing the potassium level in patients at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias [^9cbe1a29]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hypokalemia and even low-normal plasma potassium levels increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias among patients with cardiovascular disease. An assessment of a strategy of actively increasing plasma potassium levels to the high-normal range is needed.

Methods

In this multicenter, open-label, event-driven, randomized superiority trial conducted in Denmark, we enrolled participants at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias (defined as those with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD]) and with a baseline plasma potassium level of 4.3 mmol per liter or lower. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to a treatment regimen aimed at increasing the plasma potassium level to a high-normal level (4.5 to 5.0 mmol per liter) by means of potassium supplementation, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or both plus dietary guidance and standard care (high-normal potassium group) or to standard care only (standard-care group). The primary end point was a composite of documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or appropriate ICD therapy, unplanned hospitalization (> 24 hours) for arrhythmia or heart failure, or death from any cause, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis.

Results

Among the 1200 participants who underwent randomization (600 assigned to each group), the median duration of follow-up was 39.6 months (interquartile range, 26.4 to 49.3). A primary end-point event occurred in 136 participants (22.7%; 7.3 events per 100 person-years) in the high-normal potassium group, as compared with 175 participants (29.2%; 9.6 events per 100 person-years) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.95; P = 0.01). The incidence of hospitalization for hyperkalemia or hypokalemia was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among participants with any cardiovascular disease who had an ICD and were at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias, a treatment-induced increase in plasma potassium levels led to a significantly lower risk of appropriate ICD therapy, unplanned hospitalization for arrhythmia or heart failure, or death from any cause than standard care.

### Potassium homeostasis and management of dyskalemia in kidney diseases: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^44a4003d]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Potassium disorders are common in patients with kidney disease, particularly in patients with tubular disorders and low glomerular filtration rate. A multidisciplinary group of researchers and clinicians met in October 2018 to identify evidence and address controversies in potassium management. The issues discussed encompassed our latest understanding of the regulation of tubular potassium excretion in health and disease; the relationship of potassium intake to cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, with increasing evidence showing beneficial associations with plant-based diet and data to suggest a paradigm shift from the idea of dietary restriction toward fostering patterns of eating that are associated with better outcomes; the paucity of data on the effect of dietary modification in restoring abnormal serum potassium to the normal range; a novel diagnostic algorithm for hypokalemia that takes into account the ascendency of the clinical context in determining cause, aligning the educational strategy with a practical approach to diagnosis; and therapeutic approaches in managing hyperkalemia when chronic and in the emergency or hospital ward. In sum, we provide here our conference deliberations on potassium homeostasis in health and disease, guidance for evaluation and management of dyskalemias in the context of kidney diseases, and research priorities in each of the above areas.

### Potassium homeostasis [^3d9f68ae]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Potassium homeostasis is essential for maintaining the normal resting membrane potential of excitable cells. Yet daily dietary potassium typically far exceeds total extracellular potassium, thus the body has elegant strategies to shift potassium into cells promptly after a meal and then the kidneys efficiently excrete potassium. Potassium excretion depends on adequate kidney perfusion and filtration, sodium delivery to the distal nephron and aldosterone action on the distal nephron. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia have been associated with an increase in mortality. In this piece, we share 5 challenging cases to explore normal potassium homeostasis and disorders that can lead to derangements in potassium balance or excretion.

### Re-visiting pH-adjusted potassium to avoid hypokalemic crisis during management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a conceptual framework [^e3016871]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment guidelines recommend to initiate potassium-replacement when serum potassium (S K) drops within normal range, and to withhold insulin if S K is below normal. Despite strict recommendations, hypokalemia is frequently observed in DKA.

Methods

Scientific literature was thoroughly searched to find 1) DKA treatment guidelines, 2) studies reporting hypokalemia in DKA, 3) and literature elaborating mechanisms involved in hypokalemia.

Results

Acidosis affects S K and its regulators including insulin, catecholamines and aldosterone. Current conceptual framework is an argument to gauge the degree of hypokalemia before it strikes DKA patients utilizing S K level after adjusting it with pH. Suggested approach will reduce hypokalemia risk and its associated complications. The nomogram calculates pH-adjusted potassium and expected potassium loss. It also ranks hypokalemia associated risk, and proposes the potassium-replacement rate over given time period. The differences between current DKA treatment guidelines and proposed strategy are also discussed. Moreover, reasons and risk of hyperkalemia due to early initiation of potassium replacement and remedial actions are debated.

Conclusion

In light of proposed strategy, utilizing the nomogram ensures reduced incidence of hypokalemia in DKA resulting in improved clinical and patient outcomes. Pharmacoeconomic benefits can also be expected when avoiding hypokalemia ensures early discharge.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^9bb0abf4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^3888412a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

### Evaluation of an intravenous potassium dosing algorithm for hypokalemic critically ill patients [^0fb8022e]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The intent of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intravenous (IV) potassium (K) dosing algorithm for hypokalemic critically ill trauma patients.

Methods

Adult patients, admitted to the trauma intensive care unit from June 2010 to October 2012 and who received IV K therapy according to a standardized dosing algorithm, were retrospectively evaluated. Patients who received IV K during resuscitation or following initiation of nutrition therapy, IV fluids containing > 20 mEq/L of potassium, or medications known to alter K homeostasis or those with an arterial pH change > 0.1, diarrhea, hypomagnesemia, renal impairment, or morbid obesity were excluded.

Results

In total, 715 patients were reviewed to obtain 100 evaluable patients. Serum K for patients with mild depletion (serum K, 3.5–3.9 mEq/L, n = 74) remained unchanged at 0.0 ± 0.3 mEq/L (P = ns) following 46 ± 8 mEq. Serum K increased by 0.4 ± 0.3 mEq/L (P = 0.001) following 78 ± 18 mEq during moderate depletion (serum K, 3–3.4 mEq/L). None of the patients experienced hyperkalemia (serum K, > 5.2 mEq/L) postinfusion. The presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) blunted the response to IV K for mild K depletion as only 26% had an increase in serum K compared with 55% of patients without TBI (P = 0.025).

Conclusions

The Nutrition Support Service-guided IV K dosing algorithm was safe for patients with mild and moderate hypokalemia and efficacious for those with moderate hypokalemia. Further study in patients with severe hypokalemia (serum K, < 3 mEq/L) is warranted.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^a6c138e4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. These time intervals were prespecified to facilitate analysis in the absence of a standardized, institutional hyperkalemia protocol. Reduction of serum potassium levels was also assessed using relative (percentage) reduction owing to the hypothesized mechanism of more prominent lowering with higher baseline elevation. Outcomes were compared across prespecified subgroups based on care setting, patiromer dose, and baseline hyperkalemia severity stratified as mild (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L), moderate (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L), or severe (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). Subsequent use of any potassium binder was captured as well as standard-of-care hyperkalemia control measures (eg, calcium, albuterol, regular insulin coadministered with dextrose, and dialysis). Time to a second potassium binder dose and time to insulin dose were assessed. Incidence of hypokalemia, defined as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L, and incidence of hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.4114), at 24 hours were recorded. Potassium laboratory test orders and their performance times after the initial patiromer administration were evaluated at intervals of 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. The time to the earliest recheck and the presence of repeated laboratory tests in each time interval were evaluated to provide insight on potassium monitoring patterns in real-world clinical practice without a treatment protocol.

6 HYPERKALEMIA IN LARGE CLINICAL TRIALS

The cornerstone of HF treatment is RAASi and MRAs and current HF guidelines 5 recommend them for patients who have HFrEF unless they are contraindicated or not tolerated. There is evidence to show that these drugs can increase potassium levels from < 2% to 5%‐10%, depending on the baseline characteristics. 3, 30, 44 The smallest increase is observed among hypertensive patients without any risk factors, while the greatest is among patients with HF and CKD. Thus, HF treatment management always takes this kind of interaction into account and often limits the prescription of RAASi and its target dose titration. Apparently, most of them involved MRAs, whether spironolactone or eplerenone. Thus, RALES, EPHESUS, and EMPHASIS‐HF are three large randomized studies of MRAs in patients with HFrEF. 30, 31, 32, 45 The ATHENA‐HF trial was also conducted to assess MRAs among patients with acute HF, regardless of ejection fraction. 46 Another study in patients with HFrEF and NYHA II‐IV, PARADIGM‐HF, compared sacubitril/valsartan with enalapril. 15 TOPCAT was the only study where HFpEF was a main inclusion criterion. 47 A safety analysis of the abovementioned studies is presented in Table 1. In the RALES, EPHESUS, and TOPCAT studies hyperkalemia was identified when potassium level was > 5.0 mmol/L and only the EMPHASIS‐HF trial identified hyperkalemia as a potassium level > 4.5 mmol/L. Furthermore, the following stages of hyperkalemia were defined in this trial: mild (4.5 mmol/L), moderate (5.0 mmol/L), and severe (≥ 5.50 mmol/L). 30, 31, 41, 46 Mineralocorticoids contribute to potassium loss and sodium absorption, while their antagonists have the reverse action and cause potassium absorption. Thus, the serum potassium level was higher among patients in the treatment group of MRA trials in comparison with placebo controls. However, MRAs improve prognosis despite leading to increased rates of hyperkalemia or hypokalemia. 30 Apart from primary cardiovascular prevention of MRAs an additional advantage is the maintenance of potassium levels within normal range and the protection from hypokalemia.

KDIGO 2021 chronic kidney disease blood pressure management — monitoring after starting or increasing RASi: Changes in blood pressure, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. In patients at risk for hyperkalemia, measuring serum potassium before and at 1–2 weeks after initiation of RASi is recommended, based on expert opinion, and an increase in serum creatinine level, if it occurs, will typically happen during the first 2 weeks of treatment initiation and should stabilize within 2–4 weeks in the setting of normal sodium and fluid intake.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^25dac8b6]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

A recent study indicates that infusing 1 mmol/kg of potassium chloride over 1–2 h is likely safe for young children in intensive care units with mild to moderate hypokalemia, however, those with severe hypokalemia may require additional supplementation. When administering potassium via peripheral veins, the concentration should not exceed 40 mmol/L to prevent phlebitis and pain. For higher concentrations, central venous lines are recommended, however, this does not apply to life-threatening conditions. Importantly, potassium dextrose-containing solutions must be avoided, as dextrose stimulates insulin secretion and can potentially worsen hypokalemia. Additionally, it is important when removing dextrose from intravenous fluids in ill children not eating as this can also increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to manage potential hypoglycemia in these patients. Potassium replacement should be scaled back when the serum potassium concentration exceeds 3.5 mmol/L. During this replacement approach, serum potassium checks are recommended every 1–2 h. Continuous ECG monitoring is essential, along with regular monitoring of blood gases and potassium levels. Additionally, concurrent hypomagnesemia in children with hypokalemia requires attention as it contributes to potassium wasting and lowers tubular potassium reabsorption. Management should focus on correcting low magnesium levels since hypokalemia is refractory until magnesium levels are within the range of 0.7–1 mmol/L. In specific conditions such as correcting electrolyte imbalances or acid–base disorders, alternative forms of potassium supplementation may be considered. These scenarios include potassium phosphate in diabetic ketoacidosis or potassium citrate in renal tubular acidosis.

Prevention of hypokalemia: Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. (2.2)

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

If serum potassium concentration is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. Monitor serum potassium periodically during maintenance therapy to ensure potassium remains in desired range.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms, and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Take potassium chloride extended-release tablets with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. Do not take potassium chloride extended-release tablets on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation [see Warnings and Precautions(5.1)].

Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing or sucking.

2.2 Dosing

Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. Dosages greater than 40 mEq per day should be divided such that no more than 40 mEq is given in a single dose.

Treatment of Hypokalemia: Typical dose range is 40–100 mEq per day.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis: Typical dose range is 20 mEq per day.

### New guidelines for potassium replacement in clinical practice… [^98224d49]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Overt hypokalemia may be diagnosed when the serum potassium level is less than 3. 6 mmol/L. Potential causes include diuretic therapy, inadequate dietary potassium intake, high dietary sodium intake, and hypomagnesemia. The arrhythmogenic potential of digoxin is enhanced by hypokalemia in patients with heart failure. When using digoxin in combination with a loop diuretic and an ACE inhibitor, the decision of whether to administer potassium supplements can be complex. Leier et al26 recommend maintaining serum potassium levels in the range between 4. 5 and
5. 0 mmol/L. They suggest that "effective potassium management with properly targeted serum potassium concentrations. probably represents the most effective and safe antiarrhythmic intervention" in heart failure. Magnesium may also be administered to facilitate the reversal of refractory hypokalemia.

The authors recommended using thiazide diuretics at a low dose only, and adding a potassium-sparing diuretic drug when higher diuretic doses are needed. 28 They estimated that the protective effect of antihypertensive treatment on mortality might be halved by the induction of sudden death following potassium loss. Leier et al26 suggested that virtually all patients with CHF should receive potassium supplementation, a potassium-sparing diuretic, or an ACE inhibitor. This is a prudent management strategy in light of the potentially dire consequences of hypokalemia in these patients. Patients with these characteristics had increased frequency and complexity of ventricular ectopic activity during diuretic therapy. In these patients, normalization of serum potassium levels with oral potassium supplements or potassium-sparing agents reduced the complexity and frequency of arrhythmias by 85%, even after discontinuation of diuretic therapy.

Therefore, the authors recommended that clinical and laboratory observation should be used to identify those patients susceptible to diuretic-induced ventricular ectopic activity and that steps should be taken to normalize serum potassium levels. In patients with a history of serious arrhythmias receiving antiarrhythmic drugs, hypokalemia may reverse the beneficial effects of these agents and render the patient vulnerable to a recurrence of arrhythmia. 34, 35 It is probably important, therefore, to impose a stricter standard for treatment especially in patients with heart disease who are at risk for serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^e618a29f]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 — Administration and monitoring of RASi in CKD — It may be reasonable to treat people with high BP, CKD, and no albuminuria, with or without diabetes, with RASi (ACEi or ARB). RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated, and changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose increase. Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB for symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are effective for management of refractory hypertension but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in kidney function, particularly among patients with low eGFR.

Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently the largest health crisis facing most countries. Several factors have been linked with a poor prognosis for this disease, including demographic factors, pre-existing comorbidities and laboratory parameters such as white blood cell count, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine and electrolytes. Electrolyte abnormalities particularly potassium disorders are common among Covid-19 patients. Based on our pooled analysis, hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur in 24.3% and 4.15% of Covid-19 patients, respectively. Potassium level deviation from the normal range may increase the chances of unfavorable outcomes and even death. Therefore, this article reviewed the epidemiology of potassium disorders and explained how hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are capable of deteriorating cardiac outcomes and the prognosis of Covid-19 for infected patients. The article finishes by highlighting some important considerations in the management of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia in these patients.

### Hyperkalemia [^d18f1a96]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

Background

The normal range of plasma potassium is 3.5 −5.0 mmol/l. Hypokalaemia is defined as a serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/l. Severe hypokalaemia is defined as a K+ < 2.5 mmol/l.

Hypokalaemia is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities and has an incidence of 17–20% in hospitalised patients. Hypokalaemia is most frequently asymptomatic and identified on routine screening. Mild to moderate hypokalaemia if ignored may progress to life threatening severe hypokalaemia. Literature shows severe hypokalaemia is associated with potential life threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, diaphragmatic weakness resulting in cardiac or respiratory arrests.

Causes of hypokalaemia include drugs such as diuretics, laxatives or steroids, gastrointestinal loss such as diarrhoea, renal loss such as renal tubular disorders or diabetes insipidus, endocrine disorders such as Cushing's syndrome, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia, poor dietary intake and treatment strategies used for hyperkalaemia.

### Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality among unselected cardiac intensive care unit patients [^079d42fd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated a U‐shaped relationship between admission serum potassium levels and unadjusted mortality in unselected CICU patients, including relevant subgroups with ACS, HF, AKI, and CKD. After adjustment for illness severity and comorbidities (including renal function), hyperkalemia was associated with higher in‐hospital and postdischarge mortality, whereas hypokalemia was not. Elevated admission potassium levels only slightly above the upper limit of normal were associated with higher short‐ and long‐term mortality, emphasizing the importance of mild hyperkalemia as a predictor of adverse outcomes. This demonstrates that admission potassium levels may be a marker for illness severity that can help clinicians in prognostication and risk assessment in the CICU. The inconsistencies within the current literature regarding optimal potassium levels in acutely ill cardiac patients emphasize the need for future prospective studies examining electrolyte repletion protocol goals and optimal treatment of hyperkalemia in this population. Further study is needed to determine how abnormal potassium levels influence patient care and clinical outcomes in CICU patients, and how current risk indicators among general intensive care unit patients may or may not apply to the evolving CICU population.

If these measures fail, the algorithm advises "Reduce dose or stop ACEi or ARB if mitigation strategies ineffective".

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^9766d976]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Hyperkalemia in CKD — practice points emphasize awareness of variability in potassium measurement and local formulary constraints, note no recommendations for timing to recheck potassium or for managing hyperkalemia, and provide dietary guidance. In CKD G3–G5 with emergent hyperkalemia, implement an individualized approach including dietary and pharmacologic interventions with assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accredited nutrition provider. Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3–G5 who experience hyperkalemia or when it is an emerging issue and for individuals with kidney failure receiving dialysis when intakes of potassium are variable, and consider dietary and pharmacologic strategies during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

### Potassium and its discontents: new insight, new treatments [^3bc0867e]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is common in patients with impaired kidney function or who take drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. During the past decade, substantial advances in understanding how the body controls potassium excretion have been made, which may lead to improved standard of care for these patients. Renal potassium disposition is primarily handled by a short segment of the nephron, comprising part of the distal convoluted tubule and the connecting tubule, and regulation results from the interplay between aldosterone and plasma potassium. When dietary potassium intake and plasma potassium are low, the electroneutral sodium chloride cotransporter is activated, leading to salt retention. This effect limits sodium delivery to potassium secretory segments, limiting potassium losses. In contrast, when dietary potassium intake is high, aldosterone is stimulated. Simultaneously, potassium inhibits the sodium chloride cotransporter. Because more sodium is then delivered to potassium secretory segments, primed by aldosterone, kaliuresis results. When these processes are disrupted, hyperkalemia results. Recently, new agents capable of removing potassium from the body and treating hyperkalemia have been tested in clinical trials. This development suggests that more effective and safer approaches to the prevention and treatment of hyperkalemia may be on the horizon.

### Elevated potassium levels in patients with congestive heart failure: occurrence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes: a Danish population-based cohort study [^64b449d8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Although most current guidelines for HF recommend clinicians to consider stopping or reducing dose of ACEi/ARB or potassium‐sparing diuretics if potassium increases > 5.5 mmol/L, 15 the proportion of users and the dosing of these drugs remained broadly unchanged after the initial hyperkalemia event. Potential explanations may include that some patients had potassium levels < 5.5 mmol/L or that some patients had transient elevated potassium levels not requiring cessation of treatment.

Any conclusions on causal mechanisms in our study should be made with caution. Hyperkalemia measured in association with acute‐care hospitalization may be a consequence of the condition leading to hospital contact (eg, infection, dehydration, or deteriorating kidney function), rather than causing the hospitalization. The exact order of events in the pathophysiological pathway leading to a acute‐care hospitalization is difficult to disentangle. It is impossible to determine in our registry‐based study, in which patients with hyperkalemia did not have any bearing on the acute‐care hospitalization and its course. However, the findings that outcome RRs were higher for more severe versus mild hyperkalemia events and that specific diagnoses, such as cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest, were associated with high levels of potassium argue for a causal association.

Interestingly, the results of our analysis were consistent in a subset of patients with chronic HF receiving ACEi/ARB blockade and β blockers in whom ≈40% had chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2). This indicates that careful surveillance of potassium levels is important in patients with chronic HF, and future studies should address the role for novel prevention and treatment strategies.

Our real‐world observational study of the burden of hyperkalemia in patients with HF has both strengths and weaknesses. The Danish public healthcare system permitted a population‐based design with inclusion of all patients with incident HF and subsequent incident hyperkalemia in a well‐defined geographical region. This largely eliminated some of the selection problems encountered in clinic‐based or health insurance–based observational studies.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. (2.1)
If serum potassium is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation. (2.1)
Take with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing or sucking. (2.1)
Treatment of hypokalemia: Doses range from 40 to 100 mEq/day in divided doses. Limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. (2.2)
Prevention of hypokalemia: Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. (2.2)

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

If serum potassium concentration is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. Monitor serum potassium periodically during maintenance therapy to ensure potassium remains in desired range.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms, and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Take Klor-Con with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. Do not take Klor-Con on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing or sucking.

2.2 Dosing

Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. Dosages greater than 40 mEq per day should be divided such that no more than 40 mEq is given in a single dose.

Treatment of Hypokalemia: Typical dose range is 40 to 100 mEq per day.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis: Typical dose range is 20 mEq per day.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^a9e105f3]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients; however, the clinical usefulness of administering patiromer for reduction of serum potassium levels in this setting is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the outcomes associated with patiromer as monotherapy in patients with acute hyperkalemia in an acute care setting.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used electronic health record data from adult patients treated with patiromer for acute hyperkalemia in emergency departments, inpatient units, and intensive care units at an urban, academic medical center in the Bronx, New York, between January 30, 2018, and December 30, 2019. Data analysis was conducted between June 2020 and February 2021.

Exposures

A single dose of oral patiromer (8.4 g, 16.8 g, or 25.2 g).

Main Outcomes and Measure

The primary outcome was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. Key secondary outcomes were the incidence of hypokalemia and potassium reduction stratified by baseline potassium level and care setting.

Results

Among 881 encounters of patiromer treatment, the mean (SD) age of patients was 67.4 (14.4) years; 463 encounters (52.6%) were for male patients, and most (338 [38.4%]) were for patients who identified as non-Hispanic Black. The mean (SD) baseline serum potassium level was 5.60 (0.35) mEq/L (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0), and within the first 6 hours after patiromer administration, the mean (SD) potassium reduction was 0.50 (0.56) mEq/L (P < .001). Both absolute and relative potassium reduction from baseline varied across baseline hyperkalemia severity but not by care setting. The lowest dose of patiromer (8.4 g) was used in 721 encounters (81.8%), and in 725 encounters (82.3%), no further doses of a potassium binder were required. Hypokalemia was noted in 2 encounters (0.2%) at 24 hours after patiromer administration.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients with acute, non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, a single dose of patiromer was associated with a significant decrease in serum potassium levels and a low incidence of hypokalemia. These findings suggest that patiromer monotherapy may be useful in an institutional setting for managing elevated potassium levels and minimizing the risk of hypokalemia associated with other potassium control measures.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment; a basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension and 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of diuretics, ACEi, ARB, and MRA. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, and hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics, especially when used in combination or in chronic kidney disease; ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Mitigation strategies include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combining medications with complementary electrolyte effects (for example, ACEi plus a thiazide-type or loop diuretic); treatment of hyperkalemia can include initiation of potassium-lowering drugs including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, with emphasis on taking them mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^e94c49f6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.
