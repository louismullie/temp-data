## Question

low iron, low iron sat, high TIBC

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, and high TIBC, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each of these labs actually measures and how they relate to iron physiology. Then, I should verify the classic pattern they create and what diagnoses it supports. Next, I will consider confounders that can mimic or blunt this pattern, especially inflammation and chronic disease. After that, I should review how ferritin fits into the diagnostic reasoning and what thresholds to apply in different contexts. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise workup and management plan, including when to use oral versus intravenous iron and when to pursue source identification for blood loss.

> Let me first confirm the basics: serum iron reflects circulating iron bound to transferrin, transferrin saturation (TSAT) is the percentage of transferrin occupied by iron (serum iron divided by TIBC times 100), and TIBC is a surrogate for transferrin concentration, which rises when the liver increases transferrin synthesis in iron deficiency. So, low serum iron with low TSAT and high TIBC is the canonical pattern of absolute iron deficiency, indicating depleted stores and reduced circulating iron availability for erythropoiesis [^2455baf2] [^d0f33d72].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic implications of this pattern before jumping ahead: this triad strongly supports absolute iron deficiency, either with or without anemia, and is the opposite of anemia of chronic disease, where serum iron and TSAT are low but TIBC is low or normal due to inflammation suppressing transferrin synthesis. Thus, high TIBC in this context argues against pure anemia of chronic disease and favors absolute iron deficiency, though mixed states can occur in inflammatory conditions [^2455baf2] [^d0f33d72].

> Hold on, I should verify ferritin's role because it is the key storage marker and is highly specific when low. In the absence of inflammation, ferritin less than about 30 ng/mL is highly specific for depleted stores, whereas in inflammatory states ferritin can be misleadingly normal or elevated, so I need to check CRP and interpret ferritin in that context. In older adults or those with chronic disease, ferritin up to 100 ng/mL may still be consistent with iron deficiency if TSAT is low, and in heart failure or CKD, ferritin less than 100 ng/mL with TSAT less than 20% supports iron deficiency even without anemia [^2455baf2] [^d0f33d72] [^3ecf634f] [^823ad5f3].

> I need to ensure I am not missing functional iron deficiency, which is common in CKD, heart failure, and inflammatory states. Functional iron deficiency presents with low TSAT and low serum iron but ferritin that is normal or high because iron is trapped in stores; in these settings, TSAT less than 20% is the most reliable marker of insufficient iron for erythropoiesis, and guidelines recommend integrating ferritin with TSAT rather than relying on ferritin alone to decide on iron therapy [^2455baf2] [^cef7e553] [^823ad5f3].

> Next, I should review the differential so I do not anchor prematurely. Thalassemia trait and other microcytoses can confound MCV-based reasoning, but they do not produce low TSAT and high TIBC, so the iron studies help distinguish them. Lead poisoning and sideroblastic anemia can also cause microcytosis, but again, the iron pattern here points to iron deficiency rather than those entities, which I should confirm with clinical context and, if needed, hemoglobin electrophoresis or smear review [^24d2dc9e] [^d0f33d72].

> Let me think about source identification because absolute iron deficiency in adults is most often due to blood loss. In men and postmenopausal women, gastrointestinal malignancy must be excluded, so bidirectional endoscopy is indicated when no other cause is obvious. In younger women, heavy menstrual bleeding is common, but I should still screen for GI sources if symptoms, age, or risk factors warrant it, and I should also consider H. pylori and celiac disease as reversible contributors to iron loss or malabsorption [^2455baf2] [^d926af9f] [^44a745d9].

> I should double-check the management approach: oral iron is first-line for most patients, with ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day to improve absorption and tolerability. I will recheck hemoglobin in 2 to 4 weeks and expect a rise of about 1 g/dL if responding, while continuing therapy for roughly 3 months after normalization to replete stores. If there is intolerance, malabsorption, ongoing blood loss, or failure to respond, intravenous iron is appropriate and safe with modern formulations, and is particularly favored in CKD, heart failure, IBD, cancer, and in the second or third trimester of pregnancy when oral iron is inadequate or not tolerated [^2455baf2] [^d926af9f] [^a04bc3d2].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD or is on ESA therapy? I need to check red cell indices like reticulocyte hemoglobin content or percent hypochromic red cells if available, because they predict response to IV iron better than ferritin alone. In dialysis and many non-dialysis CKD patients, IV iron is often preferred when iron deficiency is documented or when ESA hyporesponsiveness suggests iron-restricted erythropoiesis, with ferritin less than 100 ng/mL and TSAT less than 20% commonly used as treatment thresholds in this context [^cef7e553] [^9de70b19].

> Let me reconsider pediatric and special populations briefly. In children, ferritin is less reliable in the setting of inflammation, so combining ferritin with CRP or using iron and TIBC can improve detection of iron deficiency. In Down syndrome, annual screening with CBC plus ferritin with CRP or serum iron with TIBC is recommended, and ferritin less than 50 ng/mL in the context of sleep problems may prompt iron therapy even without anemia, which I should keep in mind when interpreting borderline values [^49ff96e4] [^0340cd45] [^7a2bd36f].

> In summary, I should confirm that low serum iron, low TSAT, and high TIBC together indicate absolute iron deficiency and proceed with source identification for blood loss, starting with age- and sex-appropriate evaluation. Ferritin helps confirm depleted stores when low, but in inflammatory states I must integrate ferritin with TSAT and CRP to avoid false reassurance, and I should tailor iron repletion to severity, tolerance, and comorbidity, escalating to IV iron when indicated and ensuring treatment of the underlying cause to prevent recurrence [^2455baf2] [^d0f33d72] [^d926af9f].

The combination of **low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, and high TIBC** is diagnostic of **absolute iron deficiency** [^2455baf2], most often due to chronic blood loss or inadequate intake/absorption [^a97d6fd3]. This pattern reflects depleted iron stores with increased transferrin production to maximize iron transport [^d0f33d72]. Confirm with **ferritin** (expect < 30 ng/mL in the absence of inflammation) [^d0f33d72] and evaluate for **bleeding sources** (GI, menstrual) [^2455baf2] and malabsorption (celiac, bariatric surgery) [^d926af9f]. Treat with **oral iron** first-line [^2455baf2]; use IV iron if oral therapy fails or is not tolerated [^a04bc3d2].

---

## Physiological basis of the findings

- **Low serum iron**: Indicates reduced circulating iron available for erythropoiesis, reflecting depleted iron stores [^2455baf2].
- **Low transferrin saturation (TSAT)**: Calculated as serum iron divided by TIBC, TSAT < 20% indicates insufficient iron supply to tissues [^2455baf2].
- **High total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)**: Reflects increased transferrin production by the liver in response to iron deficiency, attempting to maximize iron transport [^d0f33d72].

---

## Clinical significance and diagnostic implications

This pattern is **highly specific for absolute iron deficiency** [^notfound], distinguishing it from functional iron deficiency (normal or low TIBC) and anemia of chronic disease (normal or low TIBC) [^24d2dc9e]. It is the classic laboratory signature of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [^notfound].

---

## Common causes of absolute iron deficiency

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Chronic blood loss | - Gastrointestinal bleeding (peptic ulcer, malignancy, diverticulosis) [^2455baf2] <br/> - Menstrual blood loss (menorrhagia) [^2455baf2] <br/> - Hookworm infestation [^notfound] |
| Inadequate dietary intake | - Strict vegetarian diets <br/> - Poor nutrition [^2455baf2] |
| Impaired absorption | - Celiac disease [^d926af9f] <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease [^2455baf2] <br/> - Bariatric surgery [^2455baf2] <br/> - Helicobacter pylori infection [^d926af9f] |
| Increased demand | - Pregnancy [^2455baf2] <br/> - Rapid growth (adolescence, infancy) [^notfound] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm iron deficiency**: Measure serum ferritin [^d0f33d72]; in the absence of inflammation, ferritin < 30 ng/mL confirms absolute iron deficiency [^d0f33d72].
- **Identify the cause**: Evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding (stool occult blood, endoscopy/colonoscopy) [^2455baf2], menstrual blood loss, and malabsorption (celiac serology, H. pylori testing) [^d926af9f].
- **Additional tests**: CBC (microcytic, hypochromic anemia), reticulocyte count, and inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) to distinguish from anemia of chronic disease [^d0f33d72].

---

## Clinical consequences of untreated iron deficiency

If untreated, iron deficiency can cause **anemia** with fatigue, pallor, dyspnea, and impaired cognitive function [^2455baf2]. It also worsens chronic diseases such as heart failure and CKD [^notfound], and in children can impair growth and neurodevelopment [^a04bc3d2].

---

## Management strategies

- **Oral iron therapy**: First-line treatment; ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day improves absorption and tolerability [^2455baf2] [^d926af9f].
- **Intravenous iron**: Indicated for intolerance to oral iron, malabsorption, ongoing blood loss, or chronic inflammatory conditions (CKD, HF, IBD, cancer) [^2455baf2] [^a04bc3d2].
- **Address underlying cause**: Treat bleeding sources, malabsorption, or dietary insufficiencies to prevent recurrence [^2455baf2].

---

## Special considerations

In **chronic inflammatory conditions**, ferritin may be elevated despite iron deficiency; interpret iron studies with inflammatory markers and consider functional iron deficiency [^3a9c6eef] [^04d21bef]. In **pregnancy**, iron requirements increase significantly; monitor closely and consider IV iron if oral therapy is inadequate [^2455baf2] [^dc39f1e3].

---

Low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, and high TIBC constitute a **classic pattern of absolute iron deficiency** [^2455baf2]. Confirm with ferritin, identify the cause, and treat with iron replacement while addressing the underlying source to restore iron stores and prevent recurrence [^d926af9f].

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^810f3cfc]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Circulating iron bound to transferrin (TIBC, total iron binding capacity — by transferrin) reflects the amount of iron available for metabolizing target cells. Importantly, neither serum iron nor serum transferrin alone should be used as biomarkers of iron status. Instead, transferrin saturation (Tsat), the per cent of transferrin that has iron bound to it (ratio of serum iron and TIBC × 100), is recommended. Reduced Tsat (< 20%) is considered a surrogate of insufficient iron available for metabolizing cells. With malnutrition accompanying chronic diseases, liver synthesis and blood transferrin levels may be low, which can artificially increase Tsat disproportionate to the iron content.

When serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg/L (which is frequent in patients with chronic diseases with pro-inflammatory activation), the diagnosis of ID is more complex. Such values are usually associated with normal/slightly increased intracellular iron stores and the diagnosis of absolute ID cannot be made. If there is restricted iron delivery to target cells (reduced Tsat < 20%), functional ID can be diagnosed.

Practical recommendations on the screening and diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure

The current 2016 ESC HF guidelines 1 recommend that evaluation of iron status should be considered in the diagnostic work‐up of all newly diagnosed HF patients (class of recommendation I, level of evidence C). A practical recommendation of the working group is that iron status should also be evaluated in patients with existing CHF, particularly if they are symptomatic despite receiving optimal background HF medications. In addition, as part of routine follow‐up, consideration should be given to the re‐evaluation of iron status 1–2 times per year, as well as after hospitalization for HF.

Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are widely available blood markers for evaluating iron status. Their use for the diagnosis of iron deficiency is recommended by the 2016 ESC HF guidelines. 1 Ferritin is an intracellular iron‐storage protein secreted by iron‐storing tissues (e.g. liver and reticuloendothelial system). Serum ferritin concentrations are a surrogate marker of stored iron quantity. 9 TSAT (defined as % of transferrin that has iron bound to it) is used as a marker of the availability of circulating iron to supply metabolizing cells. 9 TSAT value is calculated by dividing the serum iron concentration by the total iron‐binding capacity (TIBC):

The 2016 ESC HF guidelines recommend treating iron deficiency based on a serum ferritin level < 100 µg/L, or 100–299 µg/L when TSAT < 20%. Two different cut‐offs are used because ferritin levels may become elevated in the presence of inflammation and may, therefore, appear to be within the normal range (100–300 µg/L). As ferritin, an acute‐phase protein, is elevated as a result of inflammation, TSAT levels < 20% indicate that insufficient circulating iron is available to supply metabolizing cells (functional iron deficiency). 9 Therefore, in accordance with the 2016 ESC HF guidelines, it is important to ensure that both ferritin and TSAT testing is performed simultaneously and evaluated together when assessing iron status (Figure 1). Lower ferritin cut‐offs (e.g. < 30 µg/L) may be used to confirm the presence of iron deficiency in other disease settings and are often displayed on laboratory test results as the lower limit of normal. However, the thresholds defined above are recommended to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with CHF.

Methods

Patients

This was a prospective observational study using the Canadian National MDS registry, which captures detailed disease and patient-related characteristics of MDS patients from 15 Canadian centers. Registry details have been described previously. Briefly, the registry enrolled patients with MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and low blast count AML with MDS-related changes, within 1 year of diagnosis. Patients were evaluated every 3–6 months until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. We conducted this study with over 11.5 years of prospectively-collected patient data. All patients provided consent to participate, and the registry was approved by the research ethics boards of participating institutions.

Temporal trends in iron parameters

Trends in iron parameters were evaluated among time-varying transfusion dependent (TD) and transfusion-independent (TI) patients, where transfusion-dependence was determined at 6-month intervals. TSAT was calculated as serum iron/total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Mean values of ferritin and TSAT were calculated every 6 months, including values from 3 months prior to and following that visit. If a patient had multiple measurements during each time window, the average was calculated. Natural logarithm transformation was applied for normalizing the distribution of ferritin data by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Linear regression was used to evaluate a correlation between ferritin and TSAT. Linear mixed model analysis with repeated measures per subject was used to evaluate changes in ferritin and TSAT over time from enrollment up to 42 months.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

- iron

- TIBC

- transferrin saturation

### How we diagnose and treat iron deficiency anemia [^a04bc3d2]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is anemic, the majority being due to iron deficiency (ID). In adults, ID is associated with fatigue in the absence of anemia, restless legs syndrome, pica and, in neonates, delayed growth and development. In adolescents, ID is associated with decrements in learning and behavioral abnormalities. In the absence of a clear cause, search for a source of bleeding is indicated. No single test is diagnostic of ID unless the serum ferritin is low or the percent transferrin saturation is low with an elevated total iron binding capacity. Oral iron is considered front line therapy except for conditions such as gastric bypass, heavy uterine bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Oral iron has many unpleasant side effects, resulting in low patient adherence. For patients intolerant of, or unresponsive to, oral iron, intravenous (IV) administration is the preferred route. While early formulations were associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), newer formulations are much safer with SAEs occurring very infrequently. Full replacement doses can be administered in a matter of minutes to a few hours. Nevertheless, there remains a reluctance to use IV iron due to a misunderstanding of the safety of the available formulations. IV iron is safe and effective in all clinical circumstances including pregnancy. The preponderance of published evidence suggests IV iron therapy is underutilized and we believe that IV iron should be moved forward in the treatment of ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA).

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^9ef1bfec]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Transferrin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) — key diagnostic parameters: transferrin normal values can vary between 200 and 400 mg/dL, and TSAT reflects iron availability with normal transferrin saturation ranging from 16% to 45%; a saturation below 16% indicates suboptimal iron for erythropoiesis and levels above 50% suggest iron overload. TSAT performance for iron deficiency shows sensitivity of 50% to 88% and specificity of 63% to 78%. TIBC is the amount of iron needed to saturate plasma transferrin and, while high in functional or true iron deficiency, has reported diagnostic sensitivity of 34% and specificity of 97%.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^3a9c6eef]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### High serum transferrin receptor level in anemia of chronic disorders indicates coexistent iron deficiency [^a972767e]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Blood transferrin receptor (TR) level is largely determined by the quantum of erythropoiesis and by intracellular iron content of the cells of the erythroid lineage. Hence, a high serum TR level has been found to be useful in distinguishing iron deficiency anemia (IDA) from anemia of chronic disorders (ACD). In order to examine its potential role in the diagnosis of concomitant iron deficiency in ACD, we determined serum TR levels in 130 cases of ACD, in 25 cases of IDA, and in 40 normal adults. As expected, all patients of IDA had significantly higher serum TR levels compared to the normal subjects (4.2–19.2 microg/dL vs. 1.3–3.0 microg/dL) (P < 0.002). In 11/25 cases of IDA, the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was in the normal range although bone marrow iron store was absent and serum TR levels were high, thereby highlighting the superiority of TR level in the diagnosis of iron deficiency compared to TIBC. Although 54% (70/130) patients of ACD had normal or low serum TR levels (0.9–3.0 microg/dL) as expected, in 46% (60/130) of ACD patients, serum TR levels were high (3.2–11.0 microg/dL). Mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, and transferrin saturation were significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the latter group of patients compared to the former, and these parameters resembled those in IDA patients. Also, serum iron was lower and TIBC was higher in this group of ACD patients compared to those with normal or low serum TR. All these features point to an "IDA-like" profile of ACD patients with high TR and support the possibility of co-existent iron deficiency in this subgroup of ACD patients. In light of these observations it would be prudent to treat ACD patients with high serum TR levels with iron replacement therapy.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^a97d6fd3]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^caa14b92]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON society [^3391ebae]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The current clinical scenario

Unlike in the past, fully expressed and potentially lethal HC (with liver cirrhosis, diabetes, endocrine dysfunction, and heart failure) is seen rarely in current clinical practice. This can be ascribed to increased awareness of the disease and, mostly, to the routine assessment of iron biomarkers, particularly serum ferritin. Unfortunately, this is counterbalanced by an increased diagnostic challenge for nonexperts in the iron field, primarily due to the lack of specificity of ferritin.

Ferritin is an essentially intracellular protein that serves to store iron safely. It is also present at very low concentrations (micrograms per liter) in serum, likely through secretion by macrophages. Normal values usually range from 30 to 200 µg/L or 300 µg/L in females and males, respectively. The function of secreted extracellular ferritin remains largely unknown. Several common conditions lead to increased serum ferritin levels, including virtually all inflammatory disorders, hepatic cytolysis (eg, during acute or chronic liver disease), or metabolic syndrome. This translates into a huge number of consultations, overuse of the "first-level" genetic test looking for the presence of the common variants in the HFE gene, and even misdiagnosis due to incorrect interpretation of the results.

The glycoprotein transferrin is the extracellular carrier of iron that is detectable at high concentrations in blood (grams per liter; the third most abundant protein after albumin). Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is calculated as the ratio between serum iron and transferrin (multiplied by the correction factor 1.42) or, less reliably, between serum iron and total iron-binding capacity and expressed as a percentage. TSAT is much less requested in clinical practice but is much more informative about a possible diagnosis of HC. Normal TSAT varies between 20% and 45%. It has been estimated that hyperferritinemia with normal TSAT is associated with increased iron stores in less than 10% of cases. Importantly, TSAT elevation is the hallmark of HC. In HC patients, high TSAT reflects the increased pool of circulating iron due to insufficient hepcidin production and typically precedes the rise of serum ferritin by several years.TSAT tends to remain elevated even in subjects effectively iron-depleted by phlebotomies. Occasional reports of normal TSAT in p. Cys282Tyr homozygotes with hyperferritinemia should always prompt the search for additional cofactors that raise ferritin, such as metabolic syndrome or alcohol intake.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with down syndrome [^49ff96e4]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Down syndrome — anemia and iron deficiency screening recommends to obtain a complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential plus either ferritin with C-reactive protein (CRP) or serum iron with total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), beginning at 1 year of age and annually thereafter; screening by hemoglobin alone misses iron deficiency/iron insufficiency, and using an elevated red cell distribution width with ferritin or transferrin saturation or serum iron divided by TIBC leads to 100% sensitivity for identifying iron insufficiency, iron deficiency, or anemia.

### High transferrin saturation predicts inferior clinical outcomes in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes [^d45b0cfd]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 5.
The effect of iron chelation therapy (ever vs. never). Iron chelating therapy has an attenuating effect on the adverse prognostic impact of a higher transferrin saturation (TSAT) in both intermediate (TSAT 50–80%) and high (TSAT > 80%) groups, although sample sizes were limited in the tails of the Kaplan Meier survival curves.

Figure 6.
Cardiac death-free survival. Among patients who were transfusion-dependent at enrollment, higher mean transferrin saturation (TSAT) was associated with inferior cardiac death-free survival (A), but higher mean ferritin was not (B). Total numbers of patients at time zero in the black, red and blue groups were 75, 107 and 36 for the analysis by TSAT, and 48, 31 and 139 for the ferritin analysis, respectively.

While a minority of patients in our cohort received ICT, TSAT should be interpreted with caution in chelated patients. The presence of free chelate in plasma may artificially increase the measured total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and thus reduce the calculated TSAT. Conversely, chelate-iron complexes may be measured as serum iron, thereby increasing the TSAT. True measurement of TSAT during ICT requires alternative laboratory techniques (i.e. urea gel method) or a chelator washout. Furthermore, in a large prospective study of transfusion-dependent anemias, TSAT was not significantly reduced after one year of deferasirox. Survival analyses demonstrating an attenuating effect of ICT on the impact of TSAT are limited by sample sizes.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: what do we need to know? [^0781b7b4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous. There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards (such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF) among noninflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff of < 15 μg/L is a specific but not sensitive cutoff, although evidence is limited. Data from women during pregnancy or from young children are especially uncommon. Most data are from studies conducted > 30 y ago, do not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity, and were performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes relevant to iron adequacy.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^04d21bef]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

### Iron deficiency in adults: a review [^2455baf2]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Observations

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency. The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%), HF (37%-61%), and cancer (18%-82%). Testing for iron deficiency is indicated for patients with anemia and/or symptoms of iron deficiency (fatigue, pica, or restless legs syndrome) and should be considered for those with risk factors such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, or IBD. Iron deficiency is diagnosed by low serum ferritin (typically < 30 ng/mL) in individuals without inflammatory conditions or by transferrin saturation (iron/total iron binding capacity×100) less than 20%. Causes of iron deficiency should be identified and treated. Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg/d or on alternate days) is typically first-line therapy. Intravenous iron is indicated for patients with oral iron intolerance, poor absorption (celiac disease, post-bariatric surgical procedure), chronic inflammatory conditions (CKD, HF, IBD, cancer), ongoing blood loss, and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are common conditions that may cause symptoms such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Ferritin and/or transferrin saturation are required for diagnosis and screening. Oral iron is first-line therapy for most patients. Intravenous iron is used for individuals who do not tolerate or have impaired absorption of oral iron, those with ongoing blood loss, certain chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, CKD, HF, cancer), and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^a06e018d]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### New cut-off values for ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor for the assessment of iron deficiency in children in a high infection pressure area [^e4040618]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The examination of stained aspirates of bone marrow for haemosiderin has been considered the "gold standard" as a method for evaluation of iron status. This technique is invasive and therefore not suitable for screening. There are currently several laboratory assays available for assessing the iron status in children. These are widely used in clinics and include ferritin, serum iron, serum transferrin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and mean cell volume (MCV). However, these iron markers are considerably altered by inflammation, which limits their applicability, especially in areas with a high infection pressure. Surprisingly, it is still unclear to what extent adjustment of the recommended cut-off values for these iron markers is required in order to improve their diagnostic efficiency. To date there are no studies which have validated these iron markers against the "gold standard" (bone marrow iron content) in children living in areas endemic for malaria and other common infective conditions. In areas with a limited infection pressure, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) has been shown to be a promising new tool for the diagnosis of deficiency of iron stores.

Due to a recent finding in Tanzania of an increased mortality in iron replete children receiving iron supplementation, there is an urgent need to be able to target iron therapy and prophylaxis programmes on the children with proven iron deficiency. To be able to do this there is a need for non-invasive and sensitive tests that distinguish iron stores deficiency from functional iron deficiency which is associated with anaemia of inflammation. We have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of various iron markers against bone marrow iron assessment in children residing in an area of high infection pressure.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^3ecf634f]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

To evaluate gastrointestinal bleeding, we usually refer for colonoscopy and/or EGD. We frequently recommend FOBT, recognizing that FOBT alone is insufficient for excluding gastrointestinal bleeding, with a sensitivity of 58% at detecting the source of IDA.FOBT is more appropriate for colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic people without anemia. We refer for endoscopic evaluation irrespective of FOBT when IDA is suspected unless another etiology for IDA is established. In frail older adults, the decision to perform an endoscopy is often case-by-case with consideration for the person's life expectancy. It should be a shared decision with the patient and caregiver; a positive FOBT suggests a higher yield from endoscopy.

Patients with IDA may present with microcytic or normocytic hypochromic RBCs. Nearly 70% of older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) with IDA present with normal MCV. Laboratory evaluation includes obtaining a CBC, reticulocyte count, serum iron level, TIBC (represents the ability to bind iron to transferrin), TSAT (ratio of serum iron to TIBC), and ferritin (reflects iron stores). Individuals with iron deficiency typically have low serum iron, low TSAT, low ferritin, and high TIBC. Timing and fasted state should be considered when iron studies are collected. A TSAT of < 20% suggests that the iron supply is not adequate for RBC production and a very low TSAT of < 15% is consistent with iron deficiency. Compared with lower ferritin cutoffs, a ferritin level of < 50 ng/mL is suspicious for iron deficiency in older adults because this is a more reliable predicter of iron deficiency in older populations. Intermediate ferritin levels (the range from 30 to 100 ng/mL) pose difficulties, particularly in older adults with chronic diseases. Ferritin levels increase with age and patients with conditions such as chronic heart failure or inflammatory disorders may experience absolute iron deficiency even at ferritin levels of up to 100 μg/L and as high as 300 μg/L if the TSAT is < 20%.

### Optimizing diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in women and girls of reproductive age: clinical opinion [^dc39f1e3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common disorder and one of the top five causes of years lived with disability. Whereas low serum ferritin is diagnostic of ID, ferritin-an acute phase reactant-may be elevated in inflammatory states and the first trimester of pregnancy even if ID exists. Consequently, in early pregnancy or chronic inflammation, percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) measurement is the best indicator of iron status. Unfortunately, current guidelines do not recommend routine screening for ID in either pregnant or nonpregnant women in the absence of anemia. This circumstance should be urgently reviewed based on available data. While oral formulations have long been the standard for iron replacement therapy and are widely available and inexpensive, oral iron is frequently associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects for the majority-a major reason for poor adherence, inadequate repletion, and persisting ID symptoms and sequellae. Although safe intravenous iron administration was introduced in the mid-1950s, formulations with cores binding the elemental iron more tightly became available in the 2000s, allowing complete and safe replacement, even in a single setting. Prospectively acquired neonatology evidence reports oral iron's failure to reach the developing fetus when the mother is iron deficient. Consequently, while oral iron remains frontline in the first trimester because of insufficient safety data for intravenous iron, the author recommends that the intravenous route should be the gold standard for second-trimester ID when hemoglobin concentrations are less than 10.5g/dL and for all iron-deficient women in their third trimester.

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^cc54970b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### Is intervertebral disc degeneration associated with reduction in serum ferritin? [^83ab7453]. European Spine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ferritin autophagy is characterized by intracellular ferroptosis and selective ferritin degradation. However, the role of ferritin in the development of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) has not been elucidated. The study aimed to investigate the role of serum iron metabolism markers, especially serum ferritin (SF), in IDD.

Methods

217 patients who came to the spine surgery department of our hospital for low back pain were recruited, and blood samples were collected for routine examination after admission. The cumulative grade was also calculated by summing up the Pfirrmann grade of all lumbar discs.

Results

Correlation analysis showed that cumulative grade was correlated with SF (r = - 0.185, p = 0.006), not with serum iron (SI), transferrin saturation (TS), unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) (all p > 0.05). In addition, SF levels in the low severity IDD were significantly higher than high severity IDD in cumulative grade (p = 0.003) and single disc grade. No statistically significant difference was found in the other four indicators. A statistically significant difference was observed between the high (cumulative grade > 17) and low score (cumulative grade ≤ 17) groups in terms of age. According to the ROC curve, the cut-off value of SF levels was 170.5. Patients with SF < 170.5 ng/mL had severe disc degeneration. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.635 and 0.602, respectively.

Conclusion

This study preliminarily showed that SF was negatively correlated with the degree of IDD and can be used to predict IDD severity.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^0947c5bf]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic implications

Notwithstanding spectacular advances in our understanding of iron metabolism and homeostasis our diagnostic approach to iron disorders still relies mainly on three historical tests: serum iron, transferrin (or total iron binding capacity) and ferritin. Transferrin saturation (Tsat), i.e. the ratio of serum iron/total iron binding capacity and serum ferritin coupled with genetic testing and non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging measurements of liver iron content, define the nature and severity of iron loading in both hemochromatosisand thalassemia. Other useful markers are the level of serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTFRC), related to the expansion of erythropoiesis or iron deficiency, the sTFRC/log ferritin ratio for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in inflammationand the Tsat/log hepcidin ratio to suspect IRIDA.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits can measure serum hepcidin levels. However, this does not provide any information additional to serum ferritin, since the two variables are tightly related. Some researchers propose determining hepcidin levels in order to choose the better therapeutic route of administration of iron supplementation (oral vs. intravenous), as well as its correct timingand schedule. However, besides being subject to circadian oscillations, hepcidin levels change rapidly in response to activating and inhibitory signals, making their measurement useful in only a limited number of conditions. A kit to measure human serum ERFE concentration is available for research purposes. Whether the elongated ERFE identified in individuals with SF3B1 mutations will become a biomarker of ringed sideroblast myelodysplastic syndromeremains to be tested.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

Key Points

Question

How is the choice of guideline-recommended cutoffs for ferritin associated with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in primary care?

Findings

In this cohort study of 255 351 adult primary care patients, ferritin cutoffs of 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL were associated with incidences of iron deficiency diagnoses of 10.9, 29.9, and 48.3 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively.

### New cut-off values for ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor for the assessment of iron deficiency in children in a high infection pressure area [^67a7fb4a]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, the diagnostic efficiency of sTfR and a variety of more conventional laboratory tests for the identification of deficiency of iron stores or functional deficiency was evaluated. The results suggested that serum transferrin, TIBC and transferrin saturation were of limited value in diagnosis of deficiency of iron stores as their corresponding AUC ROC values did not provide acceptable sensitivity and specificity estimates. Most likely, this relates to the interference of inflammatory cytokines produced as part of the acute phase response during an infection.

The bone marrow iron smear was used as the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of deficiency of iron stores. It has generally been considered the most reliable diagnostic test, but has the limitations of being more invasive than peripheral blood iron markers. Furthermore, incorrect assessment of iron stores in bone marrow aspirates has been described.

Ferritin has been widely used as an iron marker in individuals without inflammatory conditions. Conversely, sTfR is considered to reflect the degree of tissue iron need, and there is evidence that it is a good indicator of iron status when the iron stores are depleted. The reciprocal relationship between sTfR and ferritin describes a perfect log-linear relationship over a wide range of normal and depleted iron stores states. Punnonen et al evaluated various possibilities of combinations of sTfR and ferritin parameters, and concluded that use of the sTfR/log ferritin ratio (TfR-F index) considerably improved diagnostic efficiency, even in settings with a high infection pressure.

In the present study, serum ferritin had a high specificity and sTfR a high sensitivity, which is consistent with previous studies. Changing the current conventional cut-off of TfR-F index (5.6) to its optimal cut-off (according to the ROC analysis) of 5.3 has little effect on its diagnostic efficiency. This is in contrast with ferritin and sTfR which required a change of 810% and 80%, respectively, to achieve maximal sensitivity and specificity.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1bf98cb7]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — initial diagnostic markers and transferrin saturation (TS) thresholds are outlined: the initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin, and a recent study using fasting samples showed no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes; accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values, and using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, requiring further evaluation.

### Discriminating between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease using traditional indices of iron status vs transferrin receptor concentration [^9fa99dfc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We compared the ability of soluble serum transferrin receptor (TfR) concentration, quantified using the R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) enzyme-linked immunosorbent TfR assay, with other, more traditional indicators of iron status (total iron binding capacity [TIBC], mean corpuscular volume [MCV], percent transferrin saturation [%TS], RBC distribution width [RDW], and serum iron concentration [SIC]) for discriminating between patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) or anemia of chronic disease (ACD). The TfR concentration was determined in 72 serum samples selected from men and nonpregnant women classified biochemically on the basis of ferritin concentration as having IDA (n = 41) or ACD (n = 31). By using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of the various indicators of iron status that we evaluated for discriminating between IDA and ACD decreased in the following order: TIBC > TfR > MCV > (%TS = RDW) > SIC. There was no significant difference between the diagnostic accuracy of TIBC and TfR. Thus, the routine measurement of TfR offers no advantage over TIBC for discriminating between people with biochemically defined IDA or ACD.

### Reflective testing: how useful is the practice of adding on tests by laboratory clinicians? [^ee6c725c]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the clinical value and practice of reflective testing, a new term to describe the practice of adding on tests when reporting or clinically authorising results.

Methods

A consultant medical biochemist collected over a calendar year (2001) copies of clinical biochemistry reports on samples to which he had added on either iron studies (iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and percentage saturation), or vitamin D. Iron studies and vitamin D were added on when biochemical results, available clinical information, demographic data, and clinical experience-or combinations thereof-suggested the possibility of haemochromatosis or vitamin D deficiency, respectively. The number of reports that the consultant authorised was estimated for the same calendar year. The number and percentage of raised TIBC percentage saturation and low vitamin D results from the tests that were added on were collated.

Results

Raised TIBC saturation values were found in 28 patients (18.7% of the iron studies added on), of whom 16 were subsequently genotyped, eight having a genotype consistent with haemochromatosis. Thirty one patients with vitamin D deficiency (23.1% of the vitamin D tests added on) were identified.

Conclusions

The addition of iron studies and vitamin D tests by a laboratory clinician, when reporting, resulted in the identification of patients with haemochromatosis and vitamin D deficiency. The practice of adding on tests should be called reflective testing, because it is discretionary and is based on the clinical judgement of a laboratory clinician in the interpretation of results.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^b39cea74]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

INTRODUCTION

In biological systems, iron exerts essential functions and can potentially result in cell toxicity, particularly in the context of increased intracellular iron content resulting in oxidative injury, which explains the complex regulation of iron metabolism in human physiology. On the other hand, a decrease in iron availability in the body results not only in iron deficiency (ID) anemia, but also in a disarrangement of the energy metabolism, particularly in muscle cells, given that iron is essential for the synthesis of major proteins in a wide range of intracellular pathways.

A precise diagnosis of ID can be achieved by the confirmation of reduced iron content in the bone marrow, although the clinical use of this evaluation is not practical. Although far from ideal, the most commonly used parameters to assess iron status in clinical practice are transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin. Based on these biochemical parameters, there are two main ID subtypes: absolute ID, loosely defined as low TSAT and low ferritin levels, and functional ID, defined as high ferritin combined with low TSAT. While the former represents the most common subtype in the general population, the latter is commonly found in chronic inflammatory states, such as heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In fact, functional ID results in part from increased hepcidin levels, which reduce iron release from the reticuloendothelial system, thereby restricting iron availability for metabolic functions.

ID is a common finding in nondialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD), occurring in up to 50% of patients with anemia. Current CKD guidelines recommend that screening for ID should be done mainly in the context of anemia. Previous studies have shown that even in this restricted strategy of testing for iron parameters, patients are often left underevaluated and undertreated for ID.

The clinical effects of ID on muscle metabolism and function are well described in chronic conditions having a similar pathophysiological basis for ID, such as HF. In HF patients, ID, independent from anemia, has been associated with worse functional and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in observational studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have confirmed the benefits of ID treatment in HF, regardless of anemia status, with improvements ranging from patient-reported to clinical outcomes. In NDD-CKD patients, ID, both functional and absolute, has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in observational studies; RCTs, however, have primarily focused on the erythropoietic effects of iron replacement therapy.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^d293ab36]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Injury-associated anemia and iron homeostasis after orthopaedic trauma: a prospective observational study of 844 patients [^5adf0042]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the incidence of injury-associated anemia and functional iron deficiency following operative fracture care.

Methods

Design: Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Level 1, academic trauma center.

Patient Selection Criteria

All operative fracture patients who presented between April 2022 and August 2023 were screened.

Outcome Measure and Comparisons

Laboratory tests for anemia were performed on post-operative day one including complete blood count, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), transferrin, and ferritin levels. Values were enumerated to capture the previously unknown incidence of injury-associated anemia.

Results

844 patients were screened following operative fracture management (mean: 52 years (SD 22), 58% male). Injury-associated anemia was present in 94.7% (median hemoglobin: 10.0 [IQR: 8.5–11.1]) of the 844 eligible patients; 72.5% of patients with anemia did not reach transfusion requirements (hgb < 7.0). Only 33% (270/800) received an ICD-10 diagnosis code for anemia during the hospital admission. Functional iron deficiency was present in 80.9% of eligible patients, while 94.5% demonstrated derangements in body iron stores. Ferritin levels were > 50 ng/mL in 89.8% of patients overall and 96.9% in patients with all other iron studies low. Patients with fractures in multiple extremities demonstrated 52% higher odds of elevated ferritin levels than patients with isolated fractures after controlling for transfusions and sex (adjusted OR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.06–2.17, p = 0.02).

Conclusion

The incidence of injury-associated anemia and functional iron deficiency was exceedingly common following operative orthopaedic trauma. Ferritin was more likely to be normal or high even when all other iron values were low, indicating that iron may become sequestered and unavailable for replenishing blood cell volume. Improving documentation of perioperative anemia after trauma and directing future research to counteract both anemia and functional iron deficiency may benefit most orthopaedic trauma patients.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^6c6cdd15]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Iron metabolism and its regulation

Since most of the body iron is destined for hemoglobin synthesis, erythropoiesis and iron metabolism are inextricably linked. Iron must be tightly regulated to avoid shortfalls or excesses, which typically result in anemia or iron overload, respectively. The stable concentration of circulating iron, which enables erythropoiesis and other iron-requiring physiological processes, is maintained by baseline dietary absorption, storage, and recycling of iron. Recycled iron within bone marrow, spleen, and liver macrophages is either stored in cytosolic ferritin or exported to carrier proteins. Transferrin is the main iron carrier in circulation, and transferrin saturation of iron-binding sites, calculated as a ratio of serum iron to total transferrin iron-binding capacity, is approximately 20–45% under normal conditions. Iron deficiency is typically diagnosed on the basis of decreased transferrin saturation (i.e. < 15%) and serum ferritin (< 22 ng/mL), tests that effectively supplanted the historical gold standard for diagnosis, the absence of iron stores in bone marrow aspirate samples. Despite their ease of use, there are limitations to the sensitivity and specificity of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin in the diagnosis of iron deficiency. First, there is a lack of established cutoffs to confidently distinguish "iron depletion" from "absolute iron deficiency". Second, additional markers, such as serum soluble TfR1 (sTfR1) or zinc protoporphyrin IX, are in use to identify "iron restricted erythropoiesis". When sTfR1 is combined with serum ferritin (i.e. log(sTfR1/ferritin)) using internal cutoffs, corresponding with 95th or 97.5th percentile distribution within a study population, it is highly sensitive in identifying clinically relevant iron restricted erythropoiesis, but because sTfR1 and log(sTfR1/ferritin) are not standardized, its clinical utility is limited.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^55e331cf]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy — diagnosis and initial management begin with serological testing, where serum transferrin saturation (serum iron/total iron binding capacity of > 45%) and elevated serum ferritin > 200 µg/L in men or > 150 µg/L in women supports the diagnosis; if HH is suspected, especially with a known family history, testing for the HH genotype should be performed. Diagnosis of cardiac iron overload is possible with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in which a decreased T2 signal correlates with myocardial iron infiltration and depressed left ventricular function. The established treatment for HH is phlebotomy, and in secondary iron overload, there is a role for chelation therapy.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^3bbbdb51]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

We also assessed requests for additional iron studies accompanying ferritin testing (within ± 1 week), considering iron studies often mentioned in international and local clinical guidelines for iron deficiency,: serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor. To further examine concomitant testing, we considered all patients of the study cohort who received ferritin testing during the study period and considered the presence of hemoglobin and CRP accompanying the first ferritin test recorded during the study period as 2 distinct binary outcomes. We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models using the R package lme4to assess the associations of each outcome with the same determinants and random effects as for ferritin. Associations are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with corresponding 95% CIs.

### Iron dextran [^5bc98c29]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Oral iron should be discontinued prior to administration of INFeD.

Dosage:

I. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Periodic hematologic determination (hemoglobin and hematocrit) is a simple and accurate technique for monitoring hematological response, and should be used as a guide in therapy. It should be recognized that iron storage may lag behind the appearance of normal blood morphology. Serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and percent saturation of transferrin are other important tests for detecting and monitoring the iron deficient state.

After administration of iron dextran complex, evidence of a therapeutic response can be seen in a few days as an increase in the reticulocyte count.

Although serum ferritin is usually a good guide to body iron stores, the correlation of body iron stores and serum ferritin may not be valid in patients on chronic renal dialysis who are also receiving iron dextran complex.

Although there are significant variations in body build and weight distribution among males and females, the accompanying table and formula represent a convenient means for estimating the total iron required. This total iron requirement reflects the amount of iron needed to restore hemoglobin concentration to normal or near normal levels plus an additional allowance to provide adequate replenishment of iron stores in most individuals with moderately or severely reduced levels of hemoglobin. It should be remembered that iron deficiency anemia will not appear until essentially all iron stores have been depleted. Therapy, thus, should aim at not only replenishment of hemoglobin iron but iron stores as well.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in CKD: a summary of the NICE guideline recommendations and their rationale [^9de70b19]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The UK-based National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has updated its guidance on iron deficiency and anemia management in chronic kidney disease. This report outlines the recommendations regarding iron deficiency and their rationale. Serum ferritin alone or transferrin saturation alone are no longer recommended as diagnostic tests to assess iron deficiency. Red blood cell markers (percentage hypochromic red blood cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, or reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent) are better than ferritin level alone at predicting responsiveness to intravenous iron. When red blood cell markers are not available, a combination of transferrin saturation < 20% and ferritin level < 100ng/mL is an alternative. In comparisons of the cost-effectiveness of different iron status testing and treatment strategies, using percentage hypochromic red blood cells > 6% was the most cost-effective strategy for both hemodialysis and nonhemodialysis patients. A trial of oral iron replacement is recommended in people not receiving an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and not on hemodialysis therapy. For children receiving ESAs, but not treated by hemodialysis, oral iron should be considered. In adults and children receiving ESAs and/or on hemodialysis therapy, intravenous iron should be offered. When giving intravenous iron, high-dose low-frequency administration is recommended. For all children and for adults receiving in-center hemodialysis, low-dose high-frequency administration may be more appropriate.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^eb5d51fe]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^24d2dc9e]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

Results

The study cohort consisted of 255 351 patients (median [IQR] age, 52 [36–66] years; 52.1% female and 47.9% male). Figure 1 summarizes the cohort selection process, and Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics. The cohort patients were seen by 262 general practitioners with a median (IQR) age of 48 (40–57) years and a median (IQR) workload of 139 (86–230) consultations per working week in 80 practices. During the study period, 72 817 patients (28.5%) received ferritin testing. Of the first ferritin tests during the study period, 7036 (9.7%) were accompanied by iron studies, most commonly serum iron in 6095 (8.4%), transferrin in 5820 (8.0%), and transferrin saturation in 3856 (5.3%). Accompanying hemoglobin and CRP tests were present in 52 499 (72.1%) and 36 136 (49.6%) cases, respectively.

### Association between iron profile status and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^18060b3c]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Individuals' burden of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, is increasing. This indicates to intrigue into various facets of prevention, early screening, prognostication and feasible treatment alternatives in this arena.

Aim

This study targets to evaluate iron profile status among people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normoglycemic in order to deduce association between iron parameters and insulin resistance, if any exist.

Methodology

A case-control study of total 123 subjects, comprising males and females in the age group of 30–70 years were recruited for the study. Case group constituted 81 participants who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and control group constituted 42 healthy individuals who attended routine health check-ups in the hospital. Iron profile parameters including Serum Iron, Serum Ferritin, Total Iron binding Capacity and Glycemic profile parameter like fasting blood glucose, serum insulin were estimated. Transferrin saturation and HOMA-IR were calculated.

Result

Ferritin and Transferrin saturation was found to be higher in cases than in controls with significance of p = 0.003 and p = 0.021 respectively and TIBC (total iron-binding capacity) was lesser in cases with p = 0.031. Comparison of Serum Iron values did not yield a significant result. Correlation study between ferritin and insulin resistance parameters yielded a satisfactory result in the cases (p < 0.05) and controls (p < 0.01) separately.

Conclusion

This study implies that there is a clear link between iron profile status, notably ferritin, and the emergence of insulin resistance, and hence insulin production. This study supports the function of the micronutrient iron in the etiology of type 2 diabetes and its consequences.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^336dab3a]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to do not measure the percentage saturation of transferrin in isolation to predict responsiveness to IV iron therapy in patients with CKD. Consider assessing the percentage saturation of transferrin to monitor response to ESAs and/or iron therapy in patients with CKD. Consider measuring the percentage saturation of transferrin in combination with either the serum ferritin concentration or measurements such as the percentage of hypochromic red cells and reticulocyte hemoglobin content for the diagnosis of functional iron deficiency.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^048df49a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency is a common condition and a leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, mainly due to subsequent anemia. A depletion of iron stores that does not yet result in anemia, simply referred to as nonanemic iron deficiency, has recently gained attention as a distinct clinical entity. Associated with various symptoms, including fatigue, restless legs syndrome, and hair loss, nonanemic iron deficiency has been estimated to be more common than anemic iron deficiency.

Measurement of (serum) ferritin is considered the mainstay of iron deficiency diagnosis, and ferritin is a commonly requested laboratory test in various high-resource primary care settings. In particular, a Swiss study revealed that 27% of the population received serum ferritin testing in 2018, and ferritin ranked among the most frequently ordered laboratory tests in Swiss primary care between 2009 and 2018. At the same time, iron deficiency guidelines are conflicting as to which populations benefit most from ferritin testing. For example, the US Preventive Services Task Force specifically mentions children and pregnant womenbut makes no recommendation for the general population. A prominent Swiss primary care guideline discourages iron deficiency screening in the general population, with exceptions for conditions that require special consideration due to increased risk, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or when evidence suggests a benefit from replete iron stores, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^b03826dc]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation. Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status. This study also underscores the limitations of ferritin, particularly its low sensitivity. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L, the specificity rates were impressively high at 97% for females and 99% for males, but the sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. This indicates that while a ferritin of 30 μg/L or lower is highly specific for low or absent bone marrow iron, it is not sensitive enough to detect all cases of low iron stores, especially in patients with comorbid conditions that can increase ferritin levels. It is important to recognize that in this study, there were females with serum ferritin > 1750 μg/L and males with serum ferritin > 4967 μg/L who had low or absent bone marrow iron stores.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD, evaluation, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^d926af9f]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 45 ng/mL or ferritin level of 46 to 99 ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than 20% is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than 5 years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for 94% of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately 50% of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects. Patients taking oral iron therapy should be evaluated for response in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or do not have adequate response should receive intravenous iron. Hypersensitivity to newer formulations of intravenous iron is rare (less than 1%).

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^cef7e553]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — iron status assessment emphasizes ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) for storage and availability of iron. Serum ferritin values ≤ 30 ng/ml (≤ 30 μg/l) indicate severe iron deficiency, whereas values > 30 ng/ml (> 30 μg/l) do not necessarily indicate adequate stores. Most CKD patients, including those on hemodialysis, will have normal marrow iron stores when ferritin is ≥ 300 ng/ml (≥ 300 μg/l), and even at 100 ng/ml (100 μg/l) most have stainable stores. TSAT (serum iron x 100 divided by total iron binding capacity) is the most commonly used measure of iron availability, while ferritin is an acute phase reactant requiring caution in interpretation, especially in dialysis. Other tests such as percentage of hypochromic red blood cells and reticulocyte hemoglobin content may be used instead of, or in addition to, TSAT and ferritin if available, and hepcidin measurement has not been shown to be clinically useful or superior to standard iron status tests in CKD.

### Could the erythrocyte indices or serum ferritin predict the therapeutic response to a trial with oral iron during pregnancy? Results from the accuracy study for maternal anaemia diagnosis (AMA) [^99543111]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Previous studies, which validated the erythrocyte indices against SF at 2 nd and 3 rd gestational trimesters, report similar low diagnostic performance with very low Se. Accordingly, in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of United States (NHANES) 1999–2006, the Hb detected only 16% (Se) of the pregnant women classified as iron-deficient by the 'total body iron model': {– [log 10 (sTfR × 1000 ÷ ferritin) – 2.8229] ÷ 0.1207} < 0 mg/Kg. ROC curves in a moderately (0.7 < AUC ≤ 0.9) or less accurate ranges for both indices of erythrocyte mass and morphology were observed by Tam et al (versus SF < 20 ng/mL), Casanova et al (versus SF < 10 ng/mL) and Jaime-Pérez et al (versus SF < 12 ng/mL). On the other hand, Tiwari et al found a highly accurate (0.9 < AUC < 1.0) curve for Hb, with Se of 91% and Sp of 79% for a cutoff of 9.7 g/dL (versus SF < 12 ng/mL), differing from ours and other authors results.

The low diagnostic performance of SF in our study disagrees with studies comparing SF levels with the iron contents in the pregnant women's bone marrow, which observed a positive correlation. Puolakka et al found a Se of 72% for SF < 35 ng/mL and Van den Broek et al found a Se of 90%, Sp of 85% and LR+ of 6.0 for SF < 30 ng/mL, which was more accurate than serum iron, zinc protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation, transferrin iron-binding capacity and transferrin receptor. However, these small studies are not enough to validate the SF as a gold-standard for maternal iron-deficiency. The first one of these two studies occurred before international standardization of human ferritin for immune assays, and the other one included many women with HIV and Thalassemia.

### National health and nutrition examination survey… [^d77ef9d0]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2002). Low credibility.

The specific objective of this component is to determine the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia using iron and TIBC in conjunction with ferritin and erythrocyte protoporphyrin. The general objectives of the nutritional biochemistry components are: These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and health promotion. Serum iron and TIBC tests were measured by a modification of the automated AAII-25 colorimetric method, which was based on the procedures of Giovaniello et al. and Ramsey. The method was modified to be performed on an Alpkem Flow Solutions 3000 system.

Iron was quantitated by measuring the intensity of the violet complex formed in the reaction between ferrozine and Fe++ in acetate buffer and measured at 562 nm. Thiourea was added to complex Cu++, which can also bind with ferrozine and yield falsely elevated iron values. For the TIBC test, serum was mixed with 400 g/dL iron solution to saturate the iron-binding sites of the serum transferrin molecules. Magnesium carbonate was used to remove excess iron. Centrifugation was used to precipitate the magnesium carbonate, and the supernatant was measured for iron content. Collaborative Laboratory Services A known ferrous iron standard of 105 μmol/L was incubated with serum at a pH of 7. 9, which saturates the available binding sites on serum transferrin. The unbound excess iron was then complexed with ferene to form ferrous ferene, a blue complex, which was measured by the Beckman/Coulter LX 20 analyzer. The UIBC was equal to the total iron added minus the excess iron.

The TIBC is the sum of iron and UIBC. The transferrin saturation value was calculated as × 100%. The iron variable name is LBXIRN, the TIBC variable name is LBXTIB, and the transferrin saturation is LBDPCT.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^99564ccb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^059d1a54]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — definitions for key terms: Hepcidin is defined as a hormone synthesized and secreted by the liver in response to circulating iron levels, which inhibits iron absorption from the intestinal mucosal cells by degradation of ferroportin-1. Ferroportin-1 is a transmembrane protein found predominantly in the intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and macrophages, which facilitates iron export from the cells. Transferrin is a glycoprotein synthesized by the liver which exists in 3 forms (apo, monomeric, and dimeric); it carries iron in the circulation. Unsaturated iron-binding capacity is the portion of iron-binding sites on transferrin that are not occupied by iron, and a low unsaturated iron-binding capacity raises the suspicion for hemochromatosis. Total iron-binding capacity is the sum of the serum iron and unsaturated iron-binding capacity. Transferrin saturation is the percentage of iron bound to transferrin and is calculated by dividing serum iron by total iron-binding capacity. Ferritin is an intracellular protein that stores and releases intracellular iron.

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process. An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice. An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

### Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin are main predictors of liver iron content in subjects with hyperferritinemia [^8b6384fb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Hyperferritinemia is widespread and is caused by or associated with a variety of diseases requiring complex diagnostic workup. Magnetic resonance imaging-based liver iron quantification (LIC MRI) can differentiate subjects with iron overload requiring treatment but is still limited to specialized centers and costly. We aimed to determine whether parameters belonging to the diagnostic setting of hyperferritinemia could lead to a more selective use of LIC MRI.

Methods

We enrolled a cohort of 570 subjects with hyperferritinemia from a tertiary hospital center. They underwent full clinical and laboratory evaluation, and LIC MRI. We applied a partitioning tree to explore which features were relevant in classifying LIC MRI, severity from grade 1 to 3.

Results

A total of 66.1% had LIC MRI ≤ 3 mg/g (grade 1), while 11.2% had LIC MRI above 7 mg/g (grade 3). The partitioning tree model showed a global accuracy of 78% (95% confidence interval, 74%-81%) in predicting the severity of LIC MRI in the entire series. Sensitivity and specificity were high to distinguish patients with grade 1 from those with grade 3 but not from patients with grade 2. Focusing on the LIC MRI threshold of 7 mg/g, we found that transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥ 60% and TSAT < 60% with serum ferritin ≥ 963 μg/L correctly classified 61 (95.3%) subjects with grade 3 LIC MRI to class 3. Based on these cutoffs, 193 subjects with LIC MRI grade 1 and 2 were also selected for LIC MRI assessment, while 316 patients (55.4%) would be addressed to follow-up.

Conclusions

TSAT and serum ferritin allow us to identify more than 95% of patients with a LIC MRI grade 3 and reduce MRI requirements by more than 50%.

### Diagnostic value of iron indices in hemodialysis patients receiving epoetin [^579df042]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency remains a common cause of hyporesponsiveness to epoetin in hemodialysis patients. However, considerable controversy exists regarding the best strategies for diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

As part of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of intravenous versus subcutaneous administration of epoetin, we made monthly determinations of serum iron, total iron binding capacity, percentage transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin. If a patient had serum ferritin < 100 ng/mL or the combination of serum ferritin < 400 ng/mL and a transferrin saturation < 20%, he/she received parenteral iron, given as iron dextran 100 mg at ten consecutive dialysis sessions. We analyzed parenteral iron use during the trial, the effect of its administration on iron indices and epoetin dose, and the ability of the iron indices to predict a reduction in epoetin dose in response to parenteral iron administration.

Results

Eighty-seven percent of the 208 patients required parenteral iron to maintain adequate iron stores at an average dose of 1516 mg over 41.7 weeks, or 36 mg/week. Only two of 180 patients experienced serious reactions to intravenous iron administration. Two thirds of the patients receiving parenteral iron had a decrease in their epoetin requirement of at least 30 U/kg/week compared with 29% of patients who did not receive iron (P = 0.004). The average dose decrease 12 weeks after initiating iron therapy was 1763 U/week. A serum ferritin < 200 ng/mL had the best positive predictive value (76%) for predicting a response to parenteral iron administration, but it still had limited clinical utility.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency commonly develops during epoetin therapy, and parenteral iron administration may result in a clinically significant reduction in epoetin dose. The use of transferrin saturation or serum ferritin as an indicator for parenteral iron administration has limited utility.

### Genome-wide admixture and association study of serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation and total iron binding capacity in African Americans [^8171ad3f]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Iron is an essential component of many important proteins and enzymes, including hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen to the cells. African Americans (AAs) have a greater prevalence of iron deficiency compared with European Americans. We conducted genome-wide admixture-mapping and association studies for serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation (SAT) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) in 2347 AAs participating in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Follow-up replication analyses for JHS iron-trait associated SNPs were conducted in 329 AA participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (HANDLS). Higher estimated proportions of global African ancestry were significantly associated with lower levels of iron (P = 2.4 × 10(-5)), SAT (P = 0.0019) and TIBC (P = 0.042). We observed significant associations (P < 5 × 10(-8)) between serum TIBC levels and two independent SNPs around TF on chromosome 3, the first report of a genome-wide significant second independent signal in this region, and SNPs near two novel genes: HDGFL1 on chromosome 6 and MAF on chromosome 16. We also observed significant associations between ferritin levels and SNPs near GAB3 on chromosome X. We replicated our two independent associations at TF and our association at GAB3 in HANDLS. Our study provides evidence for both shared and unique genetic risk factors that are associated with iron-related measures in AAs. The top two variants in TF explain 11.2% of the total variation in TIBC levels in AAs after accounting for age, gender, body mass index and background ancestry.

### New cut-off values for ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor for the assessment of iron deficiency in children in a high infection pressure area [^1e39f565]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Definitions and cut-off values

Malaria was defined as presence of Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites in blood. HIV testing was done using two rapid tests according to WHO guidelines and discordant results were resolved by PCR.

Internationally accepted cut-off values for biochemical iron markers used in this analysis were as follows: ferritin < 30 μg/l; serum iron < 3.6 μmol/l; serum transferrin > 3.6 g/l; TIBC > 72 μmol/l (laboratory reference values); transferrin saturation < 16%; sTfR > 8.3 mg/l (test kit reference value); MCV < 67 fl (< 2 years old) and < 73 fl (2–5 years old); MCHC < 32 g/l. Transferrin-ferritin (TfR-F) index was defined as [sTfR ÷ log ferritin]. A TfR-F index value of > 5.6 (using sTfR of > 8.3 mg/l and ferritin of < 30 μg/l) was used to define deficiency of iron stores.C-reactive protein (CRP) of > 10 mg/ml was defined as increased.

Bone marrow aspirates were prepared and stained using a commercial kit and according to manufacturer guidelines (HematoGnost Fe, Darmstadt, Germany). Smears were graded for iron and defined as positive when the fragment iron was < 2. Bone marrow iron assessment was used as the gold standard for diagnosis of iron stores deficiency.

Statistical analysis for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy for individual iron markers was calculated using SPSS V.11.0. Iron markers having either a sensitivity or specificity < 20% were classified as poor predictors of iron stores deficiency and were dropped from further analysis. For the remaining iron markers, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for identifying the optimal cut-offs for best identifying iron stores deficiency were constructed, and the corresponding areas under the curve (AUC ROC) for all the markers were compared. A new cut-off for each iron marker which provided maximal sensitivity and specificity was determined from ROC curves.KSP analysed the data but all others had access to the primary dataset.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^06ecb830]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

### Maternal prenatal, with or without postpartum, vitamin D3 supplementation does not improve maternal iron status at delivery or infant iron status at 6 months of age: secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial [^72e76a84]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2023). High credibility.

Serum (extracellular) ferritin reflects intracellular iron storage such that a low ferritin concentration represents only the first stage of ID and does not reflect iron demand or functional iron capacity. We therefore explored a range of biomarkers to examine potential pathways that may explain the metabolic interplay of vitamin D and iron. In contrast to the negative effect of vitamin D on maternal ferritin, we did not observe meaningful differences in markers of iron transport (transferrin saturation), regulation (hepcidin) or ID erythropoiesis (sTfR). The greater TIBC among women receiving low-dose vitamin D supplementation in our primary analytical approach corroborates the trend for a reduction in ferritin, yet this difference is interpreted cautiously given that it was no longer present in analyses restricted to women with vitamin D deficiency at enrolment, and given the multiple testing in this study. We did not expect low dietary iron to be a limiting factor in our analyses as all women were provided with standard iron-folic acid supplementation throughout the study period. However, given the high prevalence of ID in the placebo group at delivery, it is possible that overall iron uptake (ie, absorbed iron) was insufficient to meet iron demands. The lack of a decrease in sTfR does not support the hypothesis that the reduction in serum ferritin reflects diversion of stored iron to the bone marrow for erythropoiesis, despite possible effects of vitamin D on the expression of the erythropoietin receptor.

A limitation of this study is that it was a secondary analysis of a randomised trial which was not designed in tandem with the original trial and there was a reduction in sample size in the present analysis. However, given the similarity of participant characteristics across intervention arms and relative consistency in the number of participants per arm who contributed biomarker data, we do not believe selection bias to have influenced our results. Due to the eligibility criteria of the MDIG trial, findings may not be generalisable to pregnant women presenting with severe anaemia (Hb < 70 g/L). The panel of iron-related biomarkers facilitated examination of the relationship between vitamin D and several aspects of iron homeostasis in pregnant women, but data were comparatively limited for infants (only ferritin and Hb). Measurements of erythropoietin and Hb at delivery may have enabled further clarification of the relationship between vitamin D and anaemia. Lastly, while point-of-care testing of capillary Hb can bias estimates relative to venous blood and laboratory methods, we expected such bias to be similar across trial arms.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^bf660d0c]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) good practice statement — iron testing and management: In all patients with clinically significant RLS, clinicians should regularly test serum iron studies including ferritin and transferrin saturation (calculated from iron and total iron binding capacity), with testing ideally administered in the morning avoiding all iron-containing supplementation and foods at least 24 hours prior to blood draw. Consensus guidelines suggest that supplementation of iron in adults with RLS should be instituted with oral or intravenous (IV) iron if serum ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%, and only with IV iron if serum ferritin is between 75 and 100 ng/mL; in children, supplementation of iron should be instituted for serum ferritin < 50 ng/mL with oral or IV formulations. The first step in the management of RLS should be addressing exacerbating factors, and RLS is common in pregnancy; prescribers should consider the pregnancy-specific safety profile of each treatment being considered.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — iron studies for diagnostic evaluation: Transferrin saturation (TS) is the preferred initial screening test, and fasting is not required to accurately determine TS. A TS of greater than 45% identifies 97.9%–100% of C282Y homozygotes, although a small proportion of patients with HH such as young individuals at an earlier stage may have TS of < 45%. Serum ferritin (SF) is an excellent predictor of advanced fibrosis; in C282Y homozygotes, a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL, in combination with elevated aminotransferase levels and/or low platelet count, predicts cirrhosis in more than 80% of patients. A normal SF, defined as less than 200 ng/mL in premenopausal women or 300 ng/mL in men and postmenopausal women, in combination with a TS of < 45%, has a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. A unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) below 26 μmol/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 50% for detecting C282Y homozygosity.

### Anemia and poor iron indices are associated with susceptibility to febrile seizures in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6ba1311b]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure in children under the age of 5, and a number of risk factors for this condition have been identified. Several studies have examined the connection between iron deficiency anemia and febrile seizures in children, with inconsistent results. As a result, the authors sought to determine the precise link between iron deficiency anemia and its indices (mean corpuscular volume, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin) in conjunction to febrile seizures. Methods: A systematic literature search from several databases (PubMed, Europe PMC, ScienceDirect) was conducted from database inception until November 30, 2022. Studies were eligible if they investigated the relationship of the iron deficiency anemia and the aforementioned indices with the likelihood of febrile seizures. Results: This meta-analysis comprised 20 case-control studies with a total of 3856 participants. Our study revealed that iron deficiency anemia, low mean corpuscular volume, low serum iron, high total iron-binding capacity, and low ferritin were associated with the incremental risk of developing febrile seizures, with the odds ratios ranging from 1.24 to 1.59. Moreover, diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis indicated that low serum ferritin level had the highest overall area under the curve value amid other iron deficiency anemia indices regarding our outcomes of interest. Conclusion: This study suggest that iron deficiency anemia and poor iron indices are associated with increased risk of febrile seizures in children.
