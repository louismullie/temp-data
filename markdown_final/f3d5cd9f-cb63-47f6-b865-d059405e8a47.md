## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating COVID-19 cough. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the cough phenotype by timing and severity. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about symptom-directed therapy versus disease-modifying treatments. Next, I will examine evidence for specific symptomatic options, including inhaled corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and neuromodulators. After that, I need to check disease-modifying therapies that might indirectly improve cough. Then, I will consider special populations and red flags. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, making sure I continuously cross-check claims against IDSA, WHO, and related sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: COVID-19 cough spans acute infection-phase cough, subacute cough persisting beyond 3 weeks, and chronic cough beyond 8 weeks, and its management must be anchored to disease severity and risk of progression, not just the cough itself, so I need to ensure I stratify by severity and timing before recommending anything specific [^112zQ87B] [^1158xo2S].

> I need to check the overarching principle from guidelines: for mild-to-moderate COVID-19, management is supportive and symptom-directed, whereas severe or critical disease requires oxygen, systemic corticosteroids, and sometimes anticoagulation and additional immunomodulators; importantly, there is no guideline-endorsed "cough-specific" pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 cough per se, so expectations should be set accordingly [^1149pHED] [^111jxtab] [^113vVjzw] [^111m9dL5].

> Wait, let me verify the role of inhaled corticosteroids in ambulatory COVID-19; I initially thought they might help cough because of their airway anti-inflammatory effects, but the IDSA panel makes a conditional recommendation against initiating ICS solely for COVID-19 in ambulatory patients, citing uncertainty and potential harms, so I should not recommend starting ICS for COVID-19 cough outside trials; patients already on ICS for asthma/COPD should continue their maintenance therapy, and any off-label use should be individualized and cautious [^1134mQhk] [^114GovGV] [^112zRJGk] [^115PFVAP].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any trials directly tested ICS for post-COVID cough; observational cohorts during Omicron suggest ICS did not significantly improve cough scores versus non-ICS care, though some lung function parameters improved, so symptom benefit remains unproven and confounded by the self-limited nature of post-infectious cough; mechanistically, a cough hypersensitivity state has been proposed, but that still doesn't validate ICS for cough control in this setting [^115Krfi6] [^114aHtMs] [^114QiqFY].

> Next, I should review NSAIDs; a randomized trial of naproxen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients suggested improved cough and dyspnea versus placebo, but the study was small, hospitalized, and not designed for post-COVID cough, so I should be cautious about extrapolation; if a patient with acute COVID-19 cough is already using an NSAID for analgesia/antipyresis, it may help symptoms, but routine initiation solely for cough is not guideline-backed [^1124EdLP].

> Let me consider neuromodulators; the Lancet hypothesis paper discusses gabapentin or low-dose opioids for a presumed neurogenic cough hypersensitivity, but there are no COVID-19-specific RCTs, so this remains speculative; in refractory chronic cough after excluding other causes, a cautious, off-label trial of gabapentin may be reasonable, but I should confirm there is no alternative diagnosis and counsel on limited evidence [^114QiqFY].

> I should double-check disease-modifying therapies that reduce progression risk and might indirectly lessen cough burden by shortening illness; for high-risk outpatients within 5–7 days of symptom onset, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or a 3-day remdesivir course are recommended to reduce hospitalization and death, and while they are not antitussives, earlier clinical improvement may reduce cough duration; molnupiravir is a conditional alternative when preferred agents are unavailable or contraindicated, with explicit counseling on uncertain benefits and potential harms [^116NffSN] [^116i9ys2] [^111m9dL5].

> For hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19, I need to ensure standard-of-care is followed: supplemental oxygen as needed, dexamethasone for those requiring oxygen, and add tocilizumab or sarilumab in selected rapidly progressing cases with elevated inflammatory markers; these interventions target the underlying disease, not cough per se, but controlling the disease process should mitigate cough as oxygenation and inflammation improve [^1149pHED] [^111jxtab].

> But wait, what about convalescent plasma; I should confirm its role in ambulatory patients with no other options and early disease, where IDSA allows consideration of FDA-qualified high-titer plasma within about 8 days of onset, yet randomized data do not show faster symptom resolution, so it should not be expected to hasten cough improvement specifically; use remains narrow and conditional in high-risk, early-phase outpatients without access to antivirals [^116RYWmB] [^116avern] [^111N9rUg].

> I will now examine special populations; in pediatrics, cough is common, most cases are mild, and management is supportive; evidence for pediatric cough medicines is limited, with expert consensus favoring honey for acute cough and avoidance of systemic steroids for isolated cough; in patients with COPD, I should maintain bronchodilators and ICS if already prescribed and differentiate COVID-19 symptoms from baseline disease; in pregnancy, standard supportive care applies, and antivirals should be individualized based on risk-benefit and gestational timing [^113Qy8CA] [^116nECM8] [^115gT5ZB].

> Next, I should review red flags and differential diagnosis; persistent or worsening cough beyond 3–4 weeks warrants reassessment for secondary bacterial infection, asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, GERD, or other causes; in patients with cancer or on immunotherapy, I must distinguish COVID-19 from immune-related pneumonitis; and in those with high-risk exposures or epidemiology, I should consider TB coinfection, which can present with prolonged cough and requires targeted testing and therapy [^115VAWFk] [^113136tC] [^114toRyQ].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without overstepping the evidence: for acute COVID-19 with mild cough, use supportive care, hydration, throat lozenges, and acetaminophen or NSAID if already indicated; for high-risk outpatients, offer nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir early; for subacute or chronic cough, prioritize evaluation for alternative causes, consider pulmonary rehabilitation and speech therapy, and reserve off-label neuromodulators for refractory cases after shared decision-making; throughout, avoid starting ICS solely for COVID-19 cough and avoid therapies with negative recommendations such as ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, or lopinavir/ritonavir [^111m9dL5] [^115PFVAP] [^111qfeAE] [^112iPQzz] [^112EzLDp].

> Hold on, I should verify the key uncertainties and communicate them clearly: there are no FDA-approved antitussives for COVID-19 cough, guideline certainty for most symptomatic interventions is low to moderate, and persistent cough likely reflects neuroimmune mechanisms that are not yet targeted by proven therapies; patients should be counseled that many post-COVID coughs improve over weeks to months, and that ongoing research may clarify which subgroups, if any, benefit from ICS or neuromodulators [^113FjQVZ] [^114QiqFY] [^115VAWFk].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up emphasize education on red flags, return precautions, and realistic timelines for symptom resolution; I should confirm that patients understand when to seek re-evaluation for hemoptysis, systemic worsening, or persistent cough beyond 8 weeks, and I should align treatment choices with patient values and local access to antivirals and supportive resources, consistent with living guideline principles [^116RaWQZ] [^113ASgCV].

COVID-19 cough is managed with **supportive care first** [^111m9dL5] (hydration, humidified air, honey, throat lozenges, and head-of-bed elevation). Use **dextromethorphan or guaifenesin** for symptom relief; avoid codeine unless prescribed. Inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended for routine use in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [^1134mQhk] [^116sXmFV] but may be considered for persistent cough with airway hyperresponsiveness. For severe or critical illness, use dexamethasone [^1149pHED] and consider antivirals (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir [^116NffSN], remdesivir [^111m9dL5]) if indicated. Persistent cough (> 8 weeks) warrants evaluation for alternative causes and may benefit from speech therapy or pulmonary rehabilitation [^114tNeiy] [^115VAWFk]. Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial infection is confirmed, and monitor for worsening symptoms or respiratory distress [^111m9dL5].

---

## Supportive care measures

Supportive care remains the cornerstone of managing COVID-19 cough, particularly in mild-to-moderate cases [^111m9dL5]:

- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake helps maintain mucosal hydration and reduces cough reflex sensitivity.

- **Humidified air**: Using humidifiers or steam inhalation can alleviate dryness and irritation of the respiratory tract.

- **Honey**: Particularly effective in children older than one year, honey has been shown to reduce cough frequency and severity [^notfound].

- **Throat lozenges**: Menthol or eucalyptus-containing lozenges can provide temporary relief by numbing the throat and reducing cough reflex sensitivity.

- **Head-of-bed elevation**: Elevating the head of the bed by 15–20 degrees can reduce nocturnal cough and improve sleep quality.

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatments should be tailored to cough severity, patient risk factors, and clinical presentation:

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Dextromethorphan | Suppresses cough reflex | Recommended for mild-to-moderate cough |
| Guaifenesin | Expectorant | Recommended for productive cough |
| Codeine | Cough suppressant | Use cautiously; avoid in children and elderly |
| Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) | Persistent cough with airway hyperresponsiveness | Conditional use; not routine [^114GovGV] [^113vVjzw] |
| Systemic corticosteroids (dexamethasone) | Severe or critical COVID-19 | Recommended [^1149pHED] |
| Antivirals (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir) | High-risk patients within 5–7 days of symptom onset | Recommended [^111m9dL5] |

---

## Management of persistent or chronic cough

Persistent cough beyond eight weeks following acute COVID-19 infection requires further evaluation and management:

- **Evaluation**: Rule out alternative causes such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or upper airway cough syndrome [^114tNeiy].

- **Speech therapy**: Consider speech and language therapy techniques, including cough suppression strategies and breathing exercises [^notfound].

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Structured rehabilitation programs may improve lung function and reduce cough severity [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Supportive care, honey (for children older than one year), and cautious use of pharmacological agents are recommended. Avoid codeine-containing medications [^notfound].

- **Pregnant patients**: Supportive care remains the primary approach. Avoid medications with potential teratogenic effects unless benefits outweigh risks.

- **Elderly patients**: Use caution with sedating medications due to increased risk of falls and respiratory depression.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor symptom progression, assess treatment efficacy, and identify complications. Patients should be educated to recognize warning signs of deterioration, such as increased dyspnea, chest pain, or hemoptysis, and seek immediate medical attention if these occur [^111m9dL5].

---

## Conclusion

Effective management of **COVID-19 cough** involves a combination of supportive care, **pharmacological interventions**, and careful monitoring. Supportive measures such as hydration, humidified air, and honey are foundational, while pharmacological treatments should be individualized based on severity and patient characteristics. Persistent cough requires further evaluation and may benefit from **speech therapy or pulmonary rehabilitation**. Regular follow-up and patient education are critical to ensure optimal outcomes.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

Abstract.

Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its clinical manifestations, and treatment options continues to evolve at an unparalleled pace. This review sought to summarize the key literature regarding transmission, case definitions, clinical management, and the burden of COVID-19. Our review of the literature showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing the virus and had a mean incubation period of 4–6 days. The commonly reported symptoms were fever (75.3% ± 18.7%) and cough (62.6% ± 17.7%) across the spectrum of clinical disease — mild, moderate, severe, and critical, but with the disease phenotype varying with severity. Categorization of these cases for home care or hospital management needs to be defined, with risk stratification accounting for the age of the patient and the presence of underlying comorbidities. The case definitions varied among countries, which could have contributed to the differences in the case fatality rates among affected countries. The severity and risk of death due to COVID-19 was associated with age and underlying comorbidities. Asymptomatic cases, which constitute 40–80% of COVID-19 cases are a considerable threat to control efforts. The presence of fever and cough may be sufficient to warrant COVID-19 testing, but using these symptoms in isolation will miss a proportion of cases. A clear definition of a COVID-19 case is essential for the management, treatment, and tracking of clinical illness, and to inform the quarantine measures and social distancing that can help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children: evolving epidemiology, immunology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, post-COVID-19 conditions, prevention strategies, and future directions [^113Qy8CA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

The epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children has evolved throughout the pandemic, with initially low infection rates rising significantly as a result of the emergence of the more transmissible Omicron variant. Adolescents, children from ethnic minorities and lower-income households, and those with obesity are at increased risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The immune response in children leads to milder symptoms compared to adults, with fever and cough being most frequent; tough symptoms vary by SARS-CoV-2 variant and age. Diagnostic methods to confirm current or past infection include reverse transcription PCR, rapid antigen tests, and serology. Treatment is mainly supportive, with antivirals and glucocorticoids reserved for severe cases. While serious conditions like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and other post-COVID-19 conditions are rare, they require careful management. Vaccination has proven effective in reducing severe disease and protecting against post-COVID-19 conditions. Continued surveillance, including wastewater monitoring and universal or pooled testing, remains crucial for controlling community spread. Key questions remain regarding the duration and quality of immunity after reinfection or vaccination, the impact of coinfections, and optimal treatment protocols for different pediatric populations.

### National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment guidelines panel: perspectives and lessons learned [^112YJtzt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

In March 2020, the White House Coronavirus Task Force determined that clinicians in the United States needed expert treatment guidelines to optimally manage patients with COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a new pathogen for which no specific treatments were known to be effective.

Methods

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requested that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) take the lead in expeditiously convening a panel of experts to create "living" guidelines that would be widely accessible and capable of frequent updating as important new information became available.

Recommendations

The purpose of this article is to expand on the experiences of the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) over the past 4 years, summarize the Panel's final recommendations for COVID-19, highlight some challenges and unanswered questions about COVID-19 management, and inform future responses to public health emergencies. The Panel was formed in March 2020, and the first iteration of the guidelines was released in April 2020. Now that the public health emergency has ended, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines have sunsetted. This role will now fall to professional societies and organizations, such as the American College of Physicians, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the World Health Organization, all of which have been active in this area.

### A clinical review of long-COVID with a focus on the respiratory system [^115VAWFk]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Persistence of symptoms after acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), often described as long- COVID, is common and debilitating. In this article, we review the epidemiology, clinical features, and research priorities for long-COVID focusing on the respiratory system.

Recent Findings

Breathlessness, cough and chest pain were the most commonly reported respiratory symptoms associated with long-COVID. In hospitalised patients, abnormalities on lung function testing or chest imaging were observed less commonly at 12months compared to six months since discharge. Clinical assessment of patients with persisting symptoms after acute COVID-19 requires a comprehensive evaluation to exclude other possible causes for symptoms. With no robust current evidence for interventions to treat long-COVID respiratory symptoms, symptomatic treatment, supported self-management and pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered to help individuals with respiratory symptoms associated with long-COVID.

Summary

Long-COVID is a debilitating syndrome that often includes persisting respiratory symptoms and to a lesser degree, abnormalities in lung physiology or imaging. Respiratory features of long-COVID may reduce over time, yet resolution is not seen in all cases. Future research is needed to understand the natural history of long-COVID, identify factors associated with spontaneous improvement/persistence, investigate mechanisms for persisting symptoms, and test interventions to prevent and treat long-COVID.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^116dn4mC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 infection prevention guidelines — abstract overview describes risk context, scope, methods, and outputs. Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a risk to healthcare personnel (HCP) and patients, with actions like coughing and aerosol-generating procedures likely having a higher risk of transmission. The objective is to develop evidence-based rapid guidelines to support HCP in decisions about infection prevention when caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19. Methods included forming a multidisciplinary panel, following a rapid recommendation checklist, conducting a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature, and using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty of evidence and make recommendations. The guideline panel agreed on eight recommendations, including two updated recommendations and one new recommendation added since the first version, and narrative summaries of other interventions undergoing evaluations are included.

### COVID-19 diagnosis and management: a comprehensive review [^115TGeLu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel coronavirus from the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has spread worldwide leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals. Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19. We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy. In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.

### Clinical characteristics and effects of inhaled corticosteroid in patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the omicron variant outbreak [^114GovGV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was a public health event with global effects. As of October 25, 2023, the World Health Organization has reported over 770 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in nearly seven million deaths. The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in November 2021 and quickly swept around the world. By the end of 2022, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 had caused a new round of large-scale epidemics in China. Owing to the ongoing mutation of the virus, numerous people were infected during this wave of the pandemic.

Most patients recover completely after an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, a certain percentage of patients experience persistent residual symptoms. Cough is one of the main symptoms in the acute phase of COVID-19, especially when the infection is caused by the Omicron variant. The cough may persist for weeks or months after COVID-19 infection. It has been reported that 20–30% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a chronic cough, and 2.5% of patients still suffer from coughing 1 year after initial infection. A multicenter observational study of post-discharge conditions in patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 reported that 15.4% of patients developed new or worsening cough within 2 months after discharge. Prolonged coughing not only causes distress to patients' health but also leads to increased stigma and social impact.

The mechanism underlying persistent cough after SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Recently, Chinese experts summarized a consensus on cough after coronavirus infection that proposed symptomatic treatment, with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) being recommended for patients with airway hyperresponsiveness. However, no study has evaluated the effect of ICS on patients with persistent cough after COVID-19, and there is currently a lack of evidence-based therapeutic regimens for post-COVID-19 chronic cough.

Herein, the study aimed to outline the clinical characteristics and explore the efficacy of ICS of patients with chronic cough after COVID-19 recovery during the Omicron wave.

Conclusion

In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatment regimes have been explored in the treatment of COVID-19. Some of these treatments may have been tried out of desperation, and among these, some show initial promise. However, it is too early to see any published results of rigorous clinical trials.

Using the serum of recovered patients is a tried and tested approach, and trials are underway to study its effectiveness. This treatment appears to be helpful in the short term until definitive and effective treatments are found.

### Cough and sputum in long COVID are associated with severe acute COVID-19: a Japanese cohort study [^1158xo2S]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread worldwide since its outbreak in China in December 2019. A large number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 have been reported, and the pandemic is ongoing, although vaccines are widely available. Most patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 experience long-term effects on multiple organs and systems. In most cases, persistent symptoms resolve over several months. However, some patients experience systemic symptoms that persist for more than 3–24 months. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a consensus definition of the post-COVID-19 condition in 2021. To date, these sequelae have been called post-acute COVID-19, long-haul COVID, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or post-acute syndrome of COVID-19. These systemic symptoms, including coughing and sputum, deteriorate the quality of life of patients and cause health and social burdens.

Cough is a protective response against the elimination of inhaled foreign substances and airway secretions. Patients with acute or chronic respiratory diseases often present with cough. Persistent cough for > 8 weeks is defined as chronic cough accompanied by chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and otorhinolaryngological disorders with posterior nasal leakage. Cough is classified as dry or productive, based on the presence or absence of sputum. Productive cough is primarily associated with pneumonia and/or bronchitis caused by infectious diseases. Sputum is occasionally the main symptom without cough, especially in chronic respiratory diseases such as bronchiectasis. Therapeutic strategies for cough and sputum are planned to treat underlying diseases using antitussive agents and expectorants. Cough during acute COVID-19 infection (acute COVID-19-associated cough) occurs in 40.5–72.5% of the patients. This symptom generally improves, and its incidence rate decreases to 18% at the 3-month follow-up. Conversely, 10% of post-infected patients still have a prolonged cough 2 years after acute infection (post COVID-19 cough), while only 4% of COVID-19 uninfected patients exhibit cough.

### Thoughts on COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases [^113wTj2A]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Per the CDC, treatment options for COVID-19 are currently infection control measures and supportive management of complications. The CDC recommends generally avoiding corticosteroids due to its possible prolonging of viral replication. Remdesivir (an investigational antiviral drug) and chloroquine (an antimalarial drug frequently used in the treatment of SLE), demonstrated in vitro activity against COVID-19. A clinical trial is underway in China for the use of remdesivir in COVID-19. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration approved a National Institutes of Health adaptive randomised controlled clinical trial of investigational therapeutics (the first investigational drug being remdesivir) for patients hospitalised with COVID-19.

Recently, the American College of Rheumatology suggested that patients should 'talk to their rheumatologist or rheumatology professional prior to discontinuing any medications… providers should follow their current practice for interrupting therapy during episodes of infection'. However, there are currently no official guidelines on holding immunosuppression in patients with autoimmune diseases at risk for contracting COVID-19. For outpatients with known contact, who are under quarantine and for certain patients who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and are under investigation for the disease, it may be prudent to hold maintenance immunosuppression for 2 weeks following contact or travel. Patients with autoimmune diseases without clear evidence of exposure should continue their treatments. As always, this should be based on a conversation (including a basic evaluation of COVID-19 risk factors and a risk/benefit analysis) between the patient and the rheumatologist and should be a joint decision. Basic measures to minimise exposure should be reviewed with our patients and include cancelling non-essential travel, avoiding gatherings, reducing contact with others, skipping hugs and handshakes and frequent hand hygiene. Patients complaining of fever and cough should be advised not to come for their appointments and might have to be turned away since they risk infecting others. However, patients with fever, cough and shortness of breath should be directed to the emergency room, where they can be tested, evaluated and treated. Many hospitals are encouraging or mandating telemedicine visits; this may soon extend to everyone.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^114akMNt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — ambulatory persons: The panel states the overall certainty is low and notes uncertainty about early use, and the guideline panel suggests use only in a narrow outpatient population. Specifically, the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence is low due to concerns with imprecision and recognized the inability to exclude a meaningful beneficial or detrimental effect when convalescent plasma is given early in the course of COVID-19 disease. For outpatients, the guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the ambulatory setting for persons with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease, who have no other treatment options.

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

What is GOHIBIC?

GOHIBIC is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). GOHIBIC is investigational because it is still being studied. GOHIBIC is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Application of an evidence-based, out-patient treatment strategy for COVID-19: multidisciplinary medical practice principles to prevent severe disease [^111T4nhN]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated individuals, families, and institutions throughout the world. Despite the breakneck speed of vaccine development, the human population remains at risk of further devastation. The decision to not become vaccinated, the protracted rollout of available vaccine, vaccine failure, mutational forms of the SARS virus, which may exhibit mounting resistance to our molecular strike at only one form of the viral family, and the rapid ability of the virus(es) to hitch a ride on our global transportation systems, means that we are will likely continue to confront an invisible, yet devastating foe. The enemy targets one of our human physiology's most important and vulnerable life-preserving body tissues, our broncho-alveolar gas exchange apparatus. Notwithstanding the fear and the fury of this microbe's potential to raise existential questions across the entire spectrum of human endeavor, the application of an early treatment intervention initiative may represent a crucial tool in our defensive strategy. This strategy is driven by evidence-based medical practice principles, those not likely to become antiquated, given the molecular diversity and mutational evolution of this very clever "world traveler".

### Diagnosing respiratory long COVID: a practical approach [^111QBRTP]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID or post-COVID Condition, defined as the persistence of symptoms at least three months post-acute COVID-19 infection, is a novel condition where a definitive diagnostic marker and treatment has yet to be found. This condition, which has been estimated to impact more than 65 million individuals worldwide, manifests with multisystem involvement, most commonly presenting with fatigue, brain fog, dyspnea and/or cough. The burden of these symptoms can range from mild to severe with many patients reporting an inability to return to usual activities. Here, we present several hypothetical but clinically representative cases to allow discussion around how we approach the diagnosis of respiratory symptoms of Long COVID in those with and without chronic lung disease.

### Pemivibart (Pemgarda) [^114XJajy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Risk for COVID-19 Due to SARS-CoV-2 Viral Variants with Substantially Reduced Susceptibility to PEMGARDA

Certain SARS-CoV-2 viral variants may emerge that have substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA. PEMGARDA may not be effective at preventing COVID-19 caused by these SARS‑CoV-2 viral variants. The cell culture neutralization activity of PEMGARDA against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants is described in Microbiology (12.4).

Inform individuals of the increased risk, compared to other variants, for COVID-19 due to emergent SARS-CoV-2 viral variants that exhibit substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA. If signs or symptoms of COVID-19 occur, advise individuals to test for COVID-19 and seek medical attention, including starting treatment for COVID-19 as appropriate. Symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea.

### Work disability prevention and management [^116kRLAP]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19–related disability and rehabilitation — COVID-19 may cause numerous significant adverse effects and, among those treated as outpatients, persistent symptoms lasting more than 6 months including fatigue, dyspnea, joint pain, chest pain, cough, anosmia, and cognitive and executive function impairments. Drawing on similar conditions, there is significant risk of delayed return to work and long-term disability, as approximately 50% of individuals surviving ARDS have not returned to work after 1 year. Evaluation often requires cardiac, respiratory, and neurological impairment measures; rehabilitative strategies targeting impairments are indicated and are typically multimodal. Some preliminary randomized clinical trials suggest CBT is indicated for ongoing post COVID-19 symptoms, particularly with anxiety, depression, insomnia, and PTSD, and employer support for recovery is believed to be critical by analogy with other conditions.

### Confronting COVID-19-associated cough and the post-COVID syndrome: role of viral neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmune responses [^114QiqFY]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms of COVID-19, along with fever and loss of taste and smell. Cough can persist for weeks or months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, often accompanied by chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, dyspnoea, or pain-a collection of long-term effects referred to as the post-COVID syndrome or long COVID. We hypothesise that the pathways of neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmunomodulation through the vagal sensory nerves, which are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, lead to a cough hypersensitivity state. The post-COVID syndrome might also result from neuroinflammatory events in the brain. We highlight gaps in understanding of the mechanisms of acute and chronic COVID-19-associated cough and post-COVID syndrome, consider potential ways to reduce the effect of COVID-19 by controlling cough, and suggest future directions for research and clinical practice. Although neuromodulators such as gabapentin or opioids might be considered for acute and chronic COVID-19 cough, we discuss the possible mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cough and the promise of new anti-inflammatories or neuromodulators that might successfully target both the cough of COVID-19 and the post-COVID syndrome.

### Immune-related (IR)-pneumonitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: multidisciplinary recommendations for diagnosis and management [^113136tC]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune-related (IR)-pneumonitis is an uncommon but potentially fatal toxicity that occurs in 5%–10% of patients treated with anti-PD(L)1 immunotherapy, and is defined as a focal or diffuse inflammation of the lung parenchyma. Patients with IR-pneumonitis most commonly present clinically with non-productive cough and shortness of breath, and less commonly with fever and chest pain. The diagnosis of IR-pneumonitis is one of exclusion, and involves completion of a standard institutional evaluation to rule out respiratory infection inclusive of laboratory testing, chest CT imaging, and in selected symptomatic cases, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), with the goal of ruling out alternative diagnoses such as infection and malignant lung infiltration.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly recognized respiratory virus responsible for the COVID-19 global pandemic. Since its declaration as a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020, over five million cases of documented COVID-19 have been diagnosed worldwide, resulting in over 330,000 deaths. Importantly, patients with comorbidities such as cancer appear to have higher case-fatality rates from COVID-19. Retrospective studies suggest patients with hematologic malignancies, lung cancer, and metastatic cancer are at particularly high risk of severe disease. Interestingly, receipt of programmed-death 1 (PD-1) pathway blockade does not appear to impact the severity of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. That said, the diagnosis and management of toxicities related to immune checkpoint blockade in the era of COVID-19 poses several challenges. Similar to patients who develop IR-pneumonitis, those with COVID-19 infection tend to present clinically with fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Unlike IR-pneumonitis, however, COVID-19 is a viral illness transmissible via droplet, human contact, and possibly airborne transmission, and thus requires infection prevention measures to limit transmission. Across the world, testing and triage algorithms have been developed in order to identify patients most suitable for COVID-19 testing via viral PCR assay of nasopharyngeal samples. In general, patients who develop fever, respiratory changes, or other symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are considered for testing. Although widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals is not currently recommended, institutions may opt to test select asymptomatic populations such as residents of long-term care facilities or patients undergoing operative interventions. For symptomatic patients, diagnostic evaluation with chest imaging (chest X-ray, CT) and other laboratory tests (ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, interleukin (IL)-6) are completed according to institutional algorithms to assist in identifying cases that may clinically worsen, but have yet to be validated for their associations with clinical outcome.

### Symptom management in people dying with COVID-19: multinational observational study [^116jaXdz]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Specialist palliative care services have been critical in managing people dying with COVID-19 and ensuring symptom control towards the end of life. Frequent symptoms in severe COVID-19 include breathlessness and agitation. Cough, fever, fatigue, pain and respiratory secretions are also common.

A recent rapid review on the pharmacological strategies used for symptom management in patients dying of COVID-19 found seven studies (n = 493 patients), and concluded that modest doses of morphine and midazolam are required for symptom control. There is very limited evidence on international practice and service-level perspectives regarding pharmacological management of symptoms and the perceived effectiveness of medicines in patients dying with COVID-19.

Opioids and benzodiazepines are recommended in guidelines for breathlessness in severe COVID-19. Opioids are generally used in palliative care and are the first line treatment for refractory breathlessness. Benzodiazepines have been recommended in patients dying from severe COVID-19, but there is mixed evidence in other advanced illnesses on benefits and harms, and no evidence in COVID-19.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, benzodiazepine prescribing had been reported to differ between the UK and European countries. Huerta et al reported higher benzodiazepine prescribing in UK and Spanish electronic healthcare databases, but lower prescribing in Dutch, German and Danish databases. Possible reasons for differences included variation in help-seeking habits of patients and the diseases for which benzodiazepines are indicated by country as well as prescribing habits. Despite the adverse effects associated with benzodiazepines, the majority of hospice clinicians view them as beneficial treatments for breathlessness and agitation.

While pain, agitation, fever and cough are severe symptoms in COVID-19, there have been limited information about their clinical management. Given the lack of clarity on benzodiazepine benefit for breathlessness, concerns around safety and variation in its prescribing by country, and the dearth of information around prescribing for pain, agitation, fever and cough in COVID-19, it is important to understand what is being prescribed for symptom control in patients dying with COVID-19 and whether prescribed medicines are considered to be effective by specialist palliative care services. We therefore aimed to describe multinational prescribing practices of specialist palliative care services for symptom management in patients dying with COVID-19 and the perceived effectiveness of medicines.

### COVID-19 and respiratory system disorders: current knowledge, future clinical and translational research questions [^116DhB63]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, causing a pandemic.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 appears to cause predominantly respiratory disease in the form of viral pneumonia.
Severe cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection can lead to hypoxemic respiratory failure with features of the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection also may increase the risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism, by mechanisms that are not fully understood.

Coronaviruses are important human pathogens, and research into their behavior is nearly a century old. In late 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, and then spread worldwide. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as the name of the human disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was previously known as 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus). Viral pneumonia is the most frequent serious clinical manifestation of COVID-19, prominently featuring fever, cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography. – Dry cough is more common than a productive cough. Dyspnea appears after a median time of 5 to 8 days. Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure consistent with the Berlin definition of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients who require mechanical ventilation have a high risk of death.

A detailed understanding of the respiratory pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains elusive, however, because comprehensive data from clinical and research tools such as pulmonary artery catheterization or transpulmonary thermodilution, respiratory mechanics, mixed inert gas elimination technique, or electrical impedance tomography remain lacking or under development. – The clinical observations, radiology, and pathology offer clues about the respiratory pathogenesis of COVID-19 and raise interesting research questions. This review will highlight the current knowledge on COVID-19 pathophysiology, with a focus on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on airway and alveolar epithelium, vascular endothelium, and the control of breathing. We present questions that arise from these observations and indicate possible future research directions that will enhance our understanding of COVID-19 clinical pathophysiology and guide the development of future treatments.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^116nECM8]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnosis, guidelines agreed that acute pediatric cough (which is most commonly URTI-based) can usually be diagnosed by patient history and examination, whereas chronic pediatric cough requires systematic evaluation to identify the underlying disease. Most experts agreed that chronic pediatric cough requires further diagnostic investigations, and each expert listed a variety of investigations they had used in the past 6 months (most commonly spirometry, chest X-ray, and allergy testing), presumably representative of the patients that had presented at their respective clinics, and the testing that was possible during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Considering the treatment of acute cough symptoms, guidelines highlighted the lack of evidence for OTC and prescription cough medicines. This was mirrored in the expert survey, where participants had differing opinions on which medicines were most suitable for different symptoms. Experts considered honey to be one of the most effective and well tolerated acute cough treatments, with some support from clinical studies. Most experts had recommended phytomedicines for the treatment of acute pediatric cough. Cough-related pain and sleep disruption were highlighted as symptoms for which current therapies are lacking. The majority of children with cough (and their parents) suffer from disturbed sleep, and there is a need for additional treatment options in this area. Experts judged that systemic steroids and immunostimulants are generally not efficacious, and are among the least well tolerated options in children, indicating a need for alternative rapid-acting treatment options. Considering chronic cough, there is greater consensus on its treatment, which involves addressing the underlying cough-causing disease.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^1145Jsss]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January 2020. Soon afterwards (on March 11, 2020), the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a pandemic. It has been estimated that around 35% of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, clinical manifestations include fever, cough, body aches and pains, headache, sore throat, gastrointestinal symptoms, acute respiratory disease, pneumonia, and loss of smell or taste –. Symptoms range in severity from mild to extremely severe, and patients with severe symptoms may require hospitalization and ventilation. In July 2021, the total number of global deaths related to COVID-19 had almost reached 4 million. Global data on hospitalization rates are lacking but, in the United States between February 2020 and March 2021, there were an estimated 97.1 million symptomatic illnesses and 5.6 million hospitalizations related to COVID-19. In the early stages of the pandemic, best practice for managing hospitalized patients was undefined. Since then, treatment guidelines have been developed that include recommendations on the use of medications known to be beneficial –.

### Efficacy of naproxen in the management of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial [^1124EdLP]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The current study was done to examine the efficacy of naproxen in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was done on hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either naproxen (two capsules per day each containing 500 mg naproxen sodium) or placebo (containing starch) for five days along with the routine treatment that was nationally recommended for COVID-19 infection. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection, the time to clinical improvement, blood pressure, laboratory parameters, and death due to COVID-19 infection were considered as the outcome variables in the present study.

Results

Treatment with naproxen improved cough and shortness of breath in COVID-19 patients; such that, compared with placebo, naproxen intake was associated with 2.90 (95% CI: 1.10–7.66) and 2.82 (95% CI: 1.05–7.55) times more improvement in cough and shortness of breath, respectively. In addition, naproxen administration resulted in a significant increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and had a preventive effect on the reduction of systolic blood pressure in COVID-19 patients.

Conclusion

Treatment with naproxen can improve cough and shortness of breath in COVID-19-infected patients. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.

### Symptom duration and resolution with early outpatient treatment of convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019: a randomized trial [^116avern]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) reduces hospitalizations among outpatients treated early after symptom onset. It is unknown whether CCP reduces time to symptom resolution among outpatients.

Methods

We evaluated symptom resolution at day 14 by trial arm using an adjusted subdistribution hazard model, with hospitalization as a competing risk. We also assessed the prevalence of symptom clusters at day 14 between treatments. Clusters were defined based on biologic clustering, impact on ability to work, and an algorithm.

Results

Among 1070 outpatients followed up after transfusion, 381 of 538 (70.8%) receiving CCP and 381 of 532 (71.6%) receiving control plasma were still symptomatic (P = 0.78) at day 14. Associations between CCP and symptom resolution by day 14 did not differ significantly from those in controls after adjustment for baseline characteristics (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.99; p = 0.62). The most common cluster consisted of cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and headache and was found in 308 (57.2%) and 325 (61.1%) of CCP and control plasma recipients, respectively (P = 0.16).

Conclusions

In this trial of outpatients with early COVID-19, CCP was not associated with faster resolution of symptoms compared with control. Overall, there were no differences by treatment in the prevalence of each symptom or symptom clusters at day 14.

### COVID-19 with different severities: a multicenter study of clinical features [^114mBjgu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

Patients were recruited for this multicenter retrospective study from three hospitals designated for the treatment of COVID-19, namely, Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in Shanghai, and Tongling People's Hospital in Anhui Province, China. The recruitment period was from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020. All patients enrolled in this study had received a diagnosis of COVID-19 according to the diagnostic criteria from the fifth edition of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of China. The study was approved by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center Ethics Committee, the Jinyintan Hospital Ethics Committee, and the Tongling People's Hospital Ethics Committee.

COVID-19 Clinical Classification

According to the fifth edition of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of China, COVID-19 severity is classified as follows:
1 Mild type: The clinical symptoms are mild, with no abnormal radiological findings.
2 Moderate type: Fever, cough, and other symptoms are present with pneumonia on chest CT.
3 Severe type: The disease is classified as severe if one of the following conditions is met:

- Respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30/min.
- Oxygen saturation on room air at rest ≤ 93%.
- Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/F O 2 ≤ 300 mm Hg.
4 Critical type: One of the following conditions has to be met:

- Respiratory failure occurs and mechanical ventilation is required.
- Shock occurs.
- Other organ dysfunction is present, requiring ICU monitoring and treatment.

Based on the clinical information collected until February 15, 2020, the final date of enrollment, we classified our patients with COVID-19 into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical) in this study.

### Clinical characteristics and effects of inhaled corticosteroid in patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the omicron variant outbreak [^114aHtMs]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

ICS is the strongest local airway anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to control asthma symptoms and improve lung function. Inhaled budesonide can regulate inflammation by reducing epithelial damage and improving the T cell response, and that early use of ICS therapy can improve the inflammatory manifestations of patients with COVID-19 in the acute phase, producing clinical benefits. Airway inflammation is a central mechanism in post-infectious cough; therefore, ICS may be an effective option for patients who develop a persistent cough after COVID-19 infection. The results of our study showed that most patients exhibited a substantial return to their pre-COVID-19 status at the 2-month follow-up, with significant reductions in CET and dyspnea scores. Nevertheless, consistent with other studies, a minority of patients showed no improvement after treatment. Moreover, the level of symptomatic relief was comparable in patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough, regardless of whether corticosteroids were added to the treatment schedule. While greater changes in CET scores were found in patients treated with ICS, the differences were not statistically significant. In terms of improvement in lung function, in the analyses of the pulmonary function tests at the two visits, the patients treated with ICS showed a more significant improvement in lung function compared to those treated with conventional therapy; however, a very small number of patients showed no improvement or even deterioration of lung function. In a 2-year follow-up study, the lung function parameters of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 of different severities showed no improvement after discharge. This discrepancy with our results may be because all of our participants were outpatients with mild lung function impairment. Therefore, our study shows that the effect of ICS on patients with chronic cough after COVID-19 may be greater than that observed with non-inhalation therapy.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^112rpAiH]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study was limited by the small sample size of the survey, which is, in part, due to the strict entry criteria, designed to identify top experts in the field of pediatric cough. The survey coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have reduced the availability of respiratory disease experts. Although five continents were represented, there was a bias towards European doctors, and not all regions were represented (e.g. Africa). The survey had a relatively low response rate (9.9%), and was conducted over two time periods. While expert opinion is valuable, it may not be representative of day-to-day clinical practice, and is not a substitute for clinical evidence. The survey was designed prior to, but conducted during, the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have influenced participant answers to questions, particularly those intended to obtain information on their recent approach to diagnosis and management. Finally, the literature database search was limited to the previous 10 years in order to increase the efficiency of the search and to obtain the most recent updates to guidelines; it is possible that guidelines > 10 years old were missed, despite being current.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — outcomes and adverse event definitions prioritize patient-important outcomes including mortality, hospitalization, development of severe disease (e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), clinical improvement (disease-oriented outcomes inferred by radiological findings or virologic cure), and severe adverse events leading to discontinuation; serious adverse events are death, life threatening reactions, those that require hospitalization, result in disability or permanent damage or require an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. Critical outcomes varied by population: among hospitalized patients (at any disease severity), critical outcomes included mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, failure of clinical improvement, adverse events, and serious adverse events; among ambulatory populations with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization replaced duration of hospitalization; among persons receiving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, outcomes included measures of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — NAAT in asymptomatic exposed individuals: For individuals who have clinical or epidemiologic reasons that might make testing desirable, the IDSA panel suggests SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in asymptomatic individuals who are either known or suspected to have been exposed to COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting therapy for asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatment approved through EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, and notes that high-risk individuals (e.g., those who have pulmonary conditions or are immunocompromised or those in close contact with immunocompromised individuals) may be considered for testing. Testing should be done at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days, the exposed individual should get tested immediately.

### ESCMID rapid guidelines for assessment and management of long COVID [^114tNeiy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope

The aim of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of individuals with persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 infection and to provide a definition for this entity, termed 'long COVID'.

Methods

We performed a search of the literature on studies addressing epidemiology, symptoms, assessment, and treatment of long COVID. The recommendations were grouped by these headings and by organ systems for assessment and treatment. An expert opinion definition of long COVID is provided. Symptoms were reviewed by a search of the available literature. For assessment recommendations, we aimed to perform a diagnostic meta-analysis, but no studies provided relevant results. For treatment recommendations we performed a systematic review of the literature in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We aimed to evaluate patient-related outcomes, including quality of life, return to baseline physical activity, and return to work. Quality assessment of studies included in the systematic review is provided according to study design.

Recommendations

Evidence was insufficient to provide any recommendation other than conditional guidance. The panel recommends considering routine blood tests, chest imaging, and pulmonary functions tests for patients with persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 months. Other tests should be performed mainly to exclude other conditions according to symptoms. For management, no evidence-based recommendations could be provided. Physical and respiratory rehabilitation should be considered. On the basis of limited evidence, the panel suggests designing high-quality prospective clinical studies/trials, including a control group, to further evaluate the assessment and management of individuals with persistent symptoms of COVID-19.

### The efficacy and safety of inhaled peptide YKYY017 for COVID-19 patients with mild illness: a phase 2 randomized controlled trial [^116bN1N1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Trial design

This trial was a phase 2 randomized double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of YKYY017 aerosol inhalation in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (Trial registration: ChiCTR2300075467). We enrolled patients aged 18 to 75 years with mild to moderate COVID-19. We conducted the trial in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. This trial was approved by the ethics committee in China-Japan Friendship Hospital (approval number: YM2023–043–02) and the ethics committee at each participating center. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal representatives.

Population

Eligible patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or rapid antigen test during participant screening; had mild-to-moderate disease; were aged 18 to 75 years; had at least one of the designated COVID-19 related symptoms/signs (fever, cough, stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills or shivering), and the total symptom score is at least 2 points (COVID-19 related symptom score scale); and had the time of symptom onset (the time when the first symptom of 14 COVID-19 related symptoms appeared) within 72 hours of the first administration of the investigational drug. The key exclusion criteria were anticipated disease progression into severe or critical COVID-19 before randomization; the pulse blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) in the ambient air is less than or equal to 93%, or the arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO₂)/oxygen uptake concentration (FiO₂) is less than or equal to 300, or the respiratory rate is more than or equal to 30 per minute; urgently need or anticipated need of nasal high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. The evaluation of COVID-19 disease severity was based on the NIH COVID-19 treatment guideline (Supplementary Table 4). The COVID-19 related symptom score scale was based on guidance issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Supplementary Table 5). Full eligibility criteria were provided in the protocol.

### Accelerating clinical evaluation of repurposed combination therapies for COVID-19 [^111yw2JL]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

As the global COVID-19 pandemic continues, unabated and clinical trials demonstrate limited effective pharmaceutical interventions, there is a pressing need to accelerate treatment evaluations. Among options for accelerated development is the evaluation of drug combinations in the absence of prior monotherapy data. This approach is appealing for a number of reasons. First, combining two or more drugs with related or complementary therapeutic effects permits a multipronged approach addressing the variable pathways of the disease. Second, if an individual component of a combination offers a therapeutic effect, then in the absence of antagonism, a trial of combination therapy should still detect individual efficacy. Third, this strategy is time saving. Rather than taking a stepwise approach to evaluating monotherapies, this strategy begins with testing all relevant therapeutic options. Finally, given the severity of the current pandemic and the absence of treatment options, the likelihood of detecting a treatment effect with combination therapy maintains scientific enthusiasm for evaluating repurposed treatments. Antiviral combination selection can be facilitated by insights regarding SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and cell cycle dynamics, supported by infectious disease and clinical pharmacology expert advice. We describe a clinical evaluation strategy using adaptive combination platform trials to rapidly test combination therapies to treat COVID-19.

### Symptom duration and resolution with early outpatient treatment of convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019: a randomized trial [^111N9rUg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) reduces hospitalizations among outpatients treated early after symptom onset. It is unknown whether CCP reduces time to symptom resolution among outpatients.

Methods

We evaluated symptom resolution at day 14 by trial arm using an adjusted subdistribution hazard model, with hospitalization as a competing risk. We also assessed the prevalence of symptom clusters at day 14 between treatments. Clusters were defined based on biologic clustering, impact on ability to work, and an algorithm.

Results

Among 1070 outpatients followed up after transfusion, 381 of 538 (70.8%) receiving CCP and 381 of 532 (71.6%) receiving control plasma were still symptomatic (P = 0.78) at day 14. Associations between CCP and symptom resolution by day 14 did not differ significantly from those in controls after adjustment for baseline characteristics (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.99; p = 0.62). The most common cluster consisted of cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and headache and was found in 308 (57.2%) and 325 (61.1%) of CCP and control plasma recipients, respectively (P = 0.16).

Conclusions

In this trial of outpatients with early COVID-19, CCP was not associated with faster resolution of symptoms compared with control. Overall, there were no differences by treatment in the prevalence of each symptom or symptom clusters at day 14.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — glucocorticoids: The guideline panel recommends dexamethasone for patients with critical COVID-19 and suggests dexamethasone for patients with severe COVID-19; if dexamethasone is not available, then alternative glucocorticoids may be used, and the guideline panel suggests against glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen. The panel agreed the overall certainty of evidence for treatment with glucocorticoids for patients with severe COVID-19 as moderate due to concerns with indirectness since the evidence was from dexamethasone, and the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence for patients without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen as low due to concerns with risk of bias (post hoc analysis) and imprecision. Additional research is needed to inform the generalizability of treatment with different glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19.

### Clinical characteristics and effects of inhaled corticosteroid in patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the omicron variant outbreak [^116a6bGU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. First, this was a single-center study with a small sample size; therefore, the reproducibility and external validity of the results may be limited. In addition, the subjects were recruited from respiratory clinics; therefore, it may not be possible to generalize the results to hospitalized or severely ill patients. Second, without a non-COVID-19 chronic cough group as a control, it is difficult to determine whether the observed features are distinct for patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough. Third, the response rate of patients could cause selection bias. However, the baseline characteristics of patients in the ICS and the NICS group were balanced. Patients who did not participate may have milder symptoms than those who did, potentially leading to an overestimation of the rate of asthma diagnosis. Forth, the use of ICS is affected by the choice of patients. It is possible that some patients who respond to ICS treatment did not use ICS, which might result in an underestimation of the effectiveness of ICS. Fifth, several parameters were not collected in the follow-up, including the specific time taken for symptoms to improve and further details of medication adherence and combination medication. However, our study may reflect a real-world experience. Finally, given the self-limited nature of post-infectious cough, the symptom improvements in our cohort may be partly attributed to spontaneous remission. Thus, a longer follow-up period is necessary to verify our results over time.

Despite the limitations, we focused on treatment options for patients with persistent cough following COVID-19 infection during the Omicron wave, which has not been previously reported.

### Pulmonary procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic: a work group report of the AAAAI asthma diagnosis and treatment (ADT) interest section [^112uPcBk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary procedures — overview of factors affecting all procedures states that risk assessment is a complex multifactorial process and that the risk of COVID-19 transmission should be viewed from the perspective of the community, the individual patient, and the specific pulmonary procedure, with the composite summary risk of the elements currently not fully defined. Community considerations note that risk assessment should begin with understanding the transmission risk in the local population and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) divides the risk of transmission into 4 categories: high, substantial, moderate, and low, with categories based on a 1-week running composite of new cases per 100,000 and percentage of positive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), and that the CDC provides updated community transmission levels by county. Transmission risks should be used as a part of a composite with other considerations to assist in selecting appropriate levels of risk reduction strategies; when there is substantial or high risk of transmission in the community, the risk of asymptomatic spread is also elevated and it would be less effective to rely on symptom-based and exposure screening, even in vaccinated patients, whereas if the community transmission levels are low, symptom-based and exposure screening in vaccinated patients might be acceptable for selected encounters; higher community transmission rates suggest emphasis on postponement of procedures and/or stricter risk reduction strategies. Patient considerations indicate that the risk of transmission for individual patients should be assessed before and at every visit; vaccinated patients are at significantly lower risk for transmission, whereas unvaccinated patients are at higher risk; patients with symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection and/or known exposures to COVID-19 in the prior 2 weeks are at higher risk and should have their office visit postponed and recommended to quarantine; the CDC list of COVID-19–associated symptoms includes fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congested or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; and in select circumstances, if the patient were afebrile, had a negative COVID-19 NAAT, had only chronic respiratory symptoms, and otherwise fit the criteria to leave quarantine (onset of symptoms > 10 days prior, afebrile for > 24 hours, and symptoms improving), then pursuing an office visit and possible pulmonary testing would likely be lower risk.

### COVID-19 treatments: then and now [^115DhzUS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evolved over the past 3+ years, and strategies to prevent illness and treat infection have changed over time. As COVID-19 transitions from a pandemic to an endemic infection, widespread nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask mandates and governmental policies requiring social distancing have given way to more selective strategies for risk mitigation. Monoclonal antibody therapies used for disease prevention and treatment lost utility owing to the emergence of resistant viral variants. Oral antiviral medications have become the mainstay of treatment in nonhospitalized individuals, whereas systemic corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy in those requiring supplemental oxygen. Emerging literature also supports the use of additional immune-modulating therapies in select admitted patients. Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted both unprecedented research and development of medical interventions while also drawing attention to significant pitfalls in the global response. This review provides a comprehensive update in prevention and management of COVID-19.

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and its clinical manifestation as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an unparalleled worldwide public health problem. As reported on July 14, 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 has already infected 12,964,809 patients and provoked 570,288 deaths (mortality of 4.39%). The disease introduces a unique pathophysiology and clinical course that puzzles the efficacy of the currently existing therapeutic approaches. This editorial presents an overview of the clinical experience gathered thus far from different centers around the world, and is not meant to constitute a guideline nor a standard of care for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, given that the level of evidence behind the clinical approach to these patients is rapidly evolving.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become an important public health issue in the world. More than 118 000 cases were confirmed around the world. The main clinical manifestations were respiratory symptoms and occasional gastrointestinal symptoms. However, there is no unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. In the retrospective analysis, we report nine cases of COVID-19, describe the history of contact, clinical manifestations, the course of diagnosis and clinical treatment before, during and after treatment.

### Clinical characteristics and effects of inhaled corticosteroid in patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the omicron variant outbreak [^115Krfi6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic cough is a common symptom in patients post the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and the clinical characteristics of patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the Omicron era.

Methods

An ambispective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted that included patients with post-COVID-19 who attended the respiratory clinic at our hospital between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023 with a complaint of persistent cough lasting more than 8 weeks. At 30 and 60 days after the first clinic visit for post-COVID-19 chronic cough, enrolled patients were prospectively followed up. We compared the changes in symptoms and pulmonary function between patients receiving ICS treatment (ICS group) and those not receiving ICS treatment (NICS group) at the two visits.

Results

A total of 104 patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough were enrolled in this study (ICS group, n = 51; NICS group, n = 53). The most common symptoms accompanying post-COVID-19 chronic cough were sputum (58.7%, 61/104) and dyspnea (48.1%, 50/104). Seventy-one (82.6%, 71/86) patients had airway hyperresponsiveness, and 49 patients (47.1%, 49/104) were newly diagnosed with asthma. Most patients (95.2%, 99/104) exhibited improvement at 60 days after the first visit. The pulmonary function parameters of the patients in the ICS group were significantly improved compared to the baseline values (P < 0.05), and the improvement in the FEV₁/FVC was significantly greater than that in the NICS group (P = 0.003) after 60 days.

Conclusions

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma, which could be the underlying cause of persistent cough post-COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the Omicron era was often accompanied by sputum, dyspnea, and airway hyperresponsiveness. ICS treatment did not have a significant impact on symptom management of post-COVID-19 chronic cough; however, it can improve impaired lung function in in these individuals.

### Coinfection of COVID-19 and tuberculosis in Uganda [^114toRyQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

The clinical features and outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 coinfection are not well established. This short report describes 11 people with TB/COVID-19 coinfection in Uganda. The mean age was 46.9 ± 14.5 years; eight (72.7%) were male and two (18.2%) were coinfected with HIV. All patients presented with cough whose median duration was 71.1 (interquartile range, 33.1, 109) days. Eight (72.7%) had mild COVID-19 whereas two (18.2%) died, including one with advanced HIV disease. All patients were treated with first-line anti-TB drugs and adjunct therapy for COVID-19 using national treatment guidelines. This report presents the possibility of the coexistence of the two diseases and calls for more vigilance, screening, and collective prevention measures for both COVID-19 and TB.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — molnupiravir (Recommendation 28) states that in ambulatory adults (≥ 18 years) with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease who have no other treatment options, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests molnupiravir initiated within five days of symptom onset rather than no molnupiravir (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty of evidence). Other options for ambulatory treatment include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and three-day treatment with remdesivir, and patient-specific factors and product availability should drive decision-making; data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting. Patients who will most likely benefit from antivirals are those with risk factors for progression to severe disease, whereas those without risk factors are less likely to benefit. Patients who put a higher value on the putative mutagenesis, adverse events, or reproductive concerns and a lower value on the uncertain benefits would reasonably decline molnupiravir. Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression admitted to the hospital for reasons other than COVID-19 may also receive molnupiravir.

COVID-19 and COPD — People with COPD presenting with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or any other symptoms that could be COVID-19 related, even if these are mild, should be tested for possible infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients should keep taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as directed, and physical distancing and shielding, or sheltering-in-place, should not lead to social isolation and inactivity; patients should stay in contact with their friends and families by telecommunication and continue to keep active, and they should also ensure they have enough medication. Patients should be encouraged to use reputable resources for medical information regarding COVID-19 and its management, and guidance for remote (phone/virtual/online) COPD patient follow-up and a printable checklist are provided. Differentiating the symptoms of COVID-19 infection from the usual symptoms of COPD can be challenging; cough and breathlessness are found in over 60% of patients with COVID-19 and are usually also accompanied by fever (> 60% of patients). In COVID-19 symptoms may be mild at first, but rapid deterioration in lung function may occur, and a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 needs to be maintained in people with COPD who present with symptoms of an exacerbation, especially if accompanied by fever, impaired taste or smell or GI complaints. Persistent symptoms in people with COPD may cause diagnostic difficulty: approximately 10–20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop persistent symptoms with 25–45% experiencing dyspnea at 6–9 months after the acute infection and approximately 20% at 9–12 months.

CONCLUSION

As the world desperately searches for new treatments to reduce rates of severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, the promotion of new drug discovery building on extracts from traditional medicinal plants should be encouraged. The anecdotal and unproven use of A. Annua for COVID-19 following claims from politicians and others in low-income countries highlights the need for hard data to establish the active ingredients; develop formulations and dosing; define the pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and safety; and evaluate efficacy through controlled trials.

### Comparison of WHO versus national COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines across the world: not exactly a perfect match [^113wdcYJ]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic affected all WHO member states. We compared and contrasted the COVID-19 treatment guidelines of each member state with the WHO COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines.

Methods

Ministries of Health or accessed National Infectious Disease websites and other relevant bodies and experts were contacted to obtain national guidelines (NGs) for COVID-19 treatment. NGs were included only if they delineated specific pharmacological treatments for COVID-19, which were stratified by disease severity. We conducted a retrospective review using the adapted Reporting Checklist for Public Versions of Guidelines (RIGHT-PVG) survey checklist and a derived comparative metric based on the WHO guidelines was performed.

Results

COVID-19 therapeutics NGs could be obtained from 109 of the 194 WHO member states. There was considerable variation in guidelines and in disease severity stratifications. Therapeutic recommendations in many NGs differed substantially from the WHO guidelines. Overall in late 2022, 93% of NGs were recommending at least one treatment which had proved to be ineffective in large randomised trials, and was not recommended by WHO. Corticosteroids were not recommended in severe disease in nearly 10% of NGs despite overwhelming evidence of their benefit. NGs from countries with low-resource settings showed the greatest divergence when stratified by gross domestic product per year, Human Development Index and the Global Health Security Index.

Discussion

Our study is limited to NGs that were readily accessible, and it does not reflect the availability of recommended medicines in the field. Three years after the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, available COVID-19 NGs vary substantially in their therapeutic recommendations, often differ from the WHO guidelines, and commonly recommend ineffective, unaffordable or unavailable medicines.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade and pediatric evidence: Tocilizumab or sarilumab is suggested for use in treatment of COVID-19 in certain situations (recommendations 11–12). Of the studies informing the tocilizumab recommendations, only two did not specifically exclude children under 18 years from enrolling; the RECOVERY trial included children, but results from those in the tocilizumab arm have not yet been reported, and Hermine et al. did not specifically exclude children but did not separately report results in children. For sarilumab, three of the four studies used to inform recommendations excluded children from participation. The pre-print network meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IL-6 inhibitors included some studies that enrolled children, but results in children were not separately reported. There are several publications reporting on cohorts of children with COVID-19 who received treatment with tocilizumab, and although there have been no clear contraindications to using IL-6 inhibitors in children based on these reports more studies in children are needed to determine whether the criteria for their pediatric use would be similar to those in adults.

### Pediatric COVID-19: systematic review of the literature [^1121BgaB]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There is limited data regarding the demographics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. This information is especially important as pneumonia is the single leading cause of death in children worldwide. This Systematic Review aims to elucidate a better understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 on the pediatric population.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to gain insight into pediatric COVID-19 epidemiology. Specifically, Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify any relevant article with a focus on Pediatric Covid 19, Pediatric Covid-19, Pediatric SARS-COV-2, and Pediatric Coronavirus 19. References within the included articles were reviewed. All articles that met criteria where analyzed for demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, treatment and outcomes data.

Results

Ten studies including two case series and 8 retrospective chart reviews, altogether describing a total of 2914 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this systematic review. Of the patients whose data was available, 56% were male, the age range was 1 day to 17 years, 79% were reported to have no comorbidities, and of the 21% with comorbidities, the most common were asthma, immunosupression, and cardiovascular disease. Of pediatric patients that were tested and positive for an infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients were asymptomatic, 14.9% of the time. Patients presented with cough (48%), fever (47%) and sore throat/pharyngitis (28.6%), more commonly than with upper respiratory symptoms/rhinorrhea/sneezing/nasal congestion (13.7%), vomiting/nausea (7.8%) and diarrhea (10.1%). Median lab values including those for WBC, lymphocyte count and CRP, were within the reference ranges with the exception of procalcitonin levels, which were slightly elevated in children with COVID-19 (median procalcitonin levels ranged from 0.07 to 0.5 ng/mL. Computed tomography (CT) results suggest that unilateral CT imaging findings are present 36% of cases while 64% of pediatric patients with COVID-19 had bilateral findings. Of the studies with age specific hospitalization data available, 27.0% of patients hospitalized were infants under 1 year of age. Various treatment regimens including interferon, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine therapies have been trialed on the pediatric population but there are currently no studies showing efficacy of one regimen over the other. The mortality rate of children that were hospitalized with COVID-19 was 0.18%.

Conclusion

In contrast to adults, most infected children appear to have a milder course and have better outcomes overall. Additional care may be needed for children with comorbidities and younger children. This review also suggests that unilateral CT chest imaging findings were seen in 36.4% pediatric COVID-19 patients. This is particularly concerning as the work-up of pediatric patients with cough may warrant a bronchoscopy to evaluate for airway foreign bodies. Extra precautions need to be taken with personal protective equipment for these cases, as aerosolizing procedures may be a method of viral transmission.

Colchicine — hospitalized COVID-19 patients: The guideline panel made a strong recommendation against treatment of COVID-19 with colchicine for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the guideline panel recommends against colchicine for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We were unable to exclude the potential for adverse events in hospitalized patients receiving treatment with colchicine rather than no colchicine for COVID-19 (RR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.91). The panel determined the certainty of the evidence of treatment of colchicine for hospitalized patients to be moderate due to imprecision.

Management Patients with no risk factors for severe COVID-19 may benefit from supportive care and symptomatic treatment including antipyretics, analgesics, and antitussives. Clinicians can also instruct patients on preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 symptoms that indicate additional medical attention. For patients at increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19, clinicians should offer antivirals to significantly decrease the risk of hospitalization and death. Antivirals should be started within the first 5–7 days of symptom onset. If declined, patients should be closely monitored. Treatment The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir and Remdesivir for treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in people at risk for severe illness.
- Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir – This oral antiviral has been approved by FDA for the treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at risk for progression to severe illness. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is available under the emergency use authorization for eligible children ages 12–17 years who are not covered by the approval.

Management Clinical treatment recommendations for people with severe to critical COVID-19 are based on the severity of illness. Management often includes care of complications, including:

- Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS
- Sepsis and septic shock
- Elevation in inflammatory cytokines
- **Complications from prolonged hospitalization, including**:

- Thromboembolism
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia
- Hospital-acquired bacterial and fungal infections
- Thromboembolism.
