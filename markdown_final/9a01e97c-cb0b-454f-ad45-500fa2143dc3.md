## Question

Mood relation to estrogen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how estrogen relates to mood across the female lifespan, including mechanisms, windows of vulnerability, treatment implications, and individual variability. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiologic signal of sex differences and reproductive-linked mood vulnerability. Then, I should verify mechanistic pathways by which estradiol modulates mood circuits. Next, I will examine the critical window hypothesis and the evidence base for perimenopausal depression. After that, I need to review treatment data for estrogen therapy, including timing, formulations, and progestogen effects. I will then consider individual variability and biomarkers. Finally, I should integrate practical clinical recommendations and acknowledge controversies and gaps before concluding with a balanced synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic signal. Women have roughly twice the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder compared with men, and risk rises at puberty and again during reproductive transitions, supporting a hormone–mood link rather than a purely psychosocial explanation [^111Pnjg3]. Hold on, I should verify the specific perimenopausal risk: multiple cohorts and reviews describe a two- to fourfold increase in depressive symptoms or disorder during the menopausal transition, with risk peaking in late perimenopause and early postmenopause, and then declining thereafter, which aligns with the timing of estradiol instability and decline [^113TuuY5] [^112e3DX8] [^113LrPMQ].

> Next, I should review mechanisms. Estrogen, particularly estradiol, modulates monoaminergic systems: it increases serotonin synthesis via tryptophan hydroxylase, decreases monoamine oxidase activity, and shifts receptor sensitivity, collectively enhancing serotonergic tone. It also increases norepinephrine synthesis and availability, and interacts with dopaminergic and GABAergic pathways, including progesterone's allopregnanolone metabolite, which potentiates GABAergic inhibition [^113hFHqZ] [^113jVmjL] [^116LVqo6]. Wait, let me verify neuroplasticity links: estradiol upregulates BDNF and promotes dendritic spine formation in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, regions central to mood regulation, and it exerts both genomic and rapid non-genomic effects via ERα and ERβ, with regional specificity that may explain differential effects across circuits [^112zWRTV] [^113ScwAR].

> I will now examine the critical window hypothesis. The weight of evidence indicates that estrogen's antidepressant effects are most robust when initiated in perimenopause or early postmenopause, whereas benefits wane with advancing age or long-standing hypoestrogenism. This timing effect is consistent with neurobiologic plausibility and clinical trials showing antidepressant efficacy of transdermal estradiol in perimenopausal depression but not in older postmenopausal cohorts [^11366hkL] [^114ceTJr] [^113ZnyM9]. Hold on, I should double-check the withdrawal paradigm: in women with prior perimenopausal depression responsive to estrogen, blinded estradiol withdrawal reliably precipitates depressive symptoms, supporting a causal role for estradiol dynamics in susceptible individuals [^116YpdCH] [^111VtcFr].

> Let me consider the perimenopausal depression evidence base. Randomized trials demonstrate that transdermal estradiol produces clinically meaningful antidepressant effects in perimenopausal women with major or minor depression, with remission rates around two-thirds in some studies, and benefits appear independent of vasomotor symptom improvement, suggesting direct mood effects [^113ZnyM9]. I should confirm consistency: a 2023 meta-analysis of 14 RCTs concluded exogenous estrogen is superior to control for depressive mood, with greater sensitivity in perimenopause and an association with age rather than dose, reinforcing the timing hypothesis [^1144bZ8s]. But wait, what if progestogens blunt benefits? Narrative reviews and guidelines caution that certain progestogens may counteract estrogen's mood effects, so regimen selection matters in combined therapy [^116UaJn6].

> Next, I should review treatment implications and formulations. For depressed perimenopausal women, transdermal estradiol is a reasonable option, particularly when vasomotor symptoms coexist, and may be used alone or adjunctively with antidepressants. Transdermal routes avoid first-pass hepatic effects and allow physiologic delivery, and contemporary guidelines endorse estrogen therapy as having antidepressant effects of similar magnitude to antidepressants in this window, while emphasizing that estrogen is not FDA-approved for mood disorders and risks must be individualized [^11366hkL] [^113TuuY5]. Hold on, I should verify prophylaxis: one RCT suggests transdermal estradiol with intermittent micronized progesterone may prevent depressive symptom onset in euthymic perimenopausal women, but evidence is insufficient for routine prevention recommendations, so shared decision-making is key [^11366hkL] [^116UaJn6].

> I need to ensure I address postmenopause. The balance of evidence indicates estrogen is not an effective antidepressant in women well past the menopausal transition, consistent with receptor downregulation, altered neural circuitry, and lack of benefit in older cohorts. Thus, standard antidepressants and psychotherapy remain first-line for postmenopausal depression, with estrogen reserved for other indications such as vasomotor symptoms when appropriate [^11366hkL] [^114ceTJr] [^113TuuY5]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied estrogen has no role postmenopause; I should clarify that while mood benefits are limited, symptom-targeted hormone therapy may still be indicated for vasomotor and genitourinary complaints, which can secondarily improve sleep and quality of life, indirectly benefiting mood [^11366hkL].

> Let me consider individual variability and biomarkers. Susceptibility to estradiol withdrawal is not uniform. Mood sensitivity to weekly estradiol metabolite fluctuations predicts later depressive symptoms in perimenopausal women, and genetic variation in estrogen receptors, such as ESR1 polymorphisms, has been linked to mood and cognitive outcomes, though findings are heterogeneous and require replication [^114Fvnsz] [^114tJzAT]. I should confirm neurobiologic correlates: neuroimaging work suggests brain estrogen receptor density and network connectivity shift during the menopausal transition, potentially altering responsiveness to estradiol, and emerging data propose blood-based markers related to membrane progesterone receptor expression that track with depressive symptoms across reproductive phases, though these remain investigational [^1179TVay] [^113v9Acr].

> Next, I should review clinical assessment and integration. Guidelines advise obtaining a detailed reproductive mood history across the lifespan, screening for perimenopausal depression, and differentiating overlapping somatic symptoms. Treatment should be individualized, combining antidepressants and psychotherapy as first-line for moderate to severe depression, with consideration of transdermal estradiol in appropriately selected perimenopausal patients and careful attention to contraindications and risk–benefit profiles [^1165Ktwm] [^11366hkL] [^113g9hXF]. Hold on, I should verify that combined strategies are reasonable: observational and randomized data suggest additive benefits when estrogen is combined with antidepressants in midlife women, though more contemporary trials are needed [^116UaJn6] [^11366hkL].

> I should acknowledge controversies and limitations. The literature is heterogeneous in populations, formulations, and timing, and healthy-user bias complicates observational findings; WHIMS raised concerns about cognitive risks with late initiation of certain hormone therapies, whereas KEEPS, designed for early postmenopausal initiation, did not show cognitive harm and suggested mood benefits with oral CEE, highlighting the importance of timing and regimen selection [^114d8phC] [^114MxqQj]. But wait, what if dose–response is non-linear? Experimental work in young women shows inverted U-shaped effects of estradiol on hippocampal activity at supraphysiologic levels, reminding me that more is not always better and that physiologic replacement is the prudent clinical stance [^117SJUV9] [^111Wx7qp].

> Let me synthesize. Estrogen–mood relationships are best understood as dynamic, context-dependent, and time-sensitive: rapid estradiol fluctuations and decline during the menopausal transition destabilize mood circuits in susceptible women, whereas timely, physiologic transdermal estradiol can restore stability and exert antidepressant effects comparable to standard agents in perimenopause. Beyond the early postmenopausal window, these effects attenuate, necessitating reliance on conventional psychiatric treatments and careful risk–benefit appraisal of hormone therapy for other indications [^11366hkL] [^1144bZ8s] [^113ZnyM9]. I should double-check that this aligns with the totality of evidence: yes, converging epidemiology, mechanistic neuroscience, and randomized trials support a critical window model with individual susceptibility, guiding clinicians to screen proactively, personalize therapy, and integrate hormonal and psychiatric treatments when appropriate [^116VH8oN] [^113TuuY5].

Estrogen has a **modulatory effect on mood** through its influence on serotonin, dopamine, and GABA systems, with **fluctuations rather than absolute levels** driving mood symptoms in many women [^116LVqo6] [^1144bZ8s]. Perimenopause is a **critical window** of vulnerability, where rapid estradiol changes increase depression risk; transdermal estradiol can improve mood in perimenopausal women, but is not effective for depression in postmenopause [^11366hkL] [^113TuuY5]. Individual sensitivity to estrogen varies, and genetic factors (e.g. ESR1 variants) may explain why some women are more affected [^114Fvnsz] [^114tJzAT]. Clinically, **estrogen therapy is not first-line** for depression; antidepressants and psychotherapy remain standard, with estrogen considered for perimenopausal women with contraindications or as adjuncts [^11366hkL] [^113g9hXF].

## Biological mechanisms linking estrogen and mood

Estrogen **modulates mood** through multiple neurobiological pathways:

- **Serotonin regulation**: Estrogen increases serotonin synthesis, receptor density, and serotonin availability, thereby enhancing mood stability [^113hFHqZ] [^113jVmjL].

- **Dopamine and GABA modulation**: Estrogen influences dopamine and GABAergic systems, affecting reward processing and anxiety regulation [^116LVqo6].

- **Neuroplasticity**: Estrogen promotes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, supporting neural plasticity and resilience to stress [^112zWRTV].

---

## Estrogen fluctuations and mood disorders

Mood disturbances are strongly associated with **estrogen fluctuations** across reproductive stages:

| **Reproductive stage** | **Hormonal changes** | **Mood-related findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Puberty | Rapid estrogen rise | Increased depression risk, especially in females [^112KpJQr] |
| Premenstrual phase | Cyclic estrogen fluctuations | Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) [^113LXuv3] |
| Postpartum | Rapid estrogen decline | Postpartum depression [^113v9Acr] |
| Perimenopause | Erratic estrogen fluctuations | Heightened depression risk [^1168bHgv] |
| Postmenopause | Persistent estrogen deficiency | Mixed findings on mood [^116QUNfo] |

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Clinical trials and observational studies provide **mixed but informative evidence**:

- **Perimenopausal depression**: Transdermal estradiol significantly improves depressive symptoms in perimenopausal women, including those without vasomotor symptoms [^111LT9Ne] [^114ceTJr].

- **Postmenopausal depression**: Estrogen therapy is generally ineffective for treating depression in postmenopausal women, suggesting a limited therapeutic window [^11366hkL] [^114ceTJr].

- **Oral contraceptives**: Most women experience neutral or positive mood effects, but a subset reports negative mood changes, particularly with triphasic formulations [^1124A7XP] [^115zhf5z].

---

## Individual variability in estrogen sensitivity

Not all women respond similarly to estrogen fluctuations; **individual variability** reflects differences in estrogen metabolism, receptor sensitivity, and genetic predisposition. Genetic factors, such as **ESR1 polymorphisms**, influence estrogen receptor function and may modulate mood sensitivity to hormonal changes [^114tJzAT]. Variability in estrogen-metabolizing enzymes and receptor sensitivity contributes to **differential mood responses** [^112eUcUE].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment strategies

Understanding the estrogen–mood relationship informs **clinical practice**:

- **Perimenopausal depression**: Estrogen therapy, particularly transdermal estradiol, may be considered for women experiencing depression during the menopausal transition [^11366hkL] [^111LT9Ne].

- **Postmenopausal depression**: Estrogen therapy is not recommended as a primary treatment for depression in postmenopausal women; antidepressants and psychotherapy remain first-line treatments [^11366hkL] [^113g9hXF].

- **Combination therapy**: Estrogen therapy may augment antidepressant efficacy in some women, particularly during the perimenopausal period [^11366hkL] [^113TMzfF].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Several limitations and controversies persist:

- **Conflicting evidence**: Studies report inconsistent findings regarding estrogen's mood effects, partly due to heterogeneity in study populations, hormone formulations, and timing of therapy initiation [^111qhreH] [^112aSkKR].

- **Safety concerns**: Long-term estrogen therapy carries potential risks, including cardiovascular and breast cancer risks, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring [^notfound].

- **Need for further research**: More large-scale, longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the role of estrogen in mood regulation and identify predictors of response [^notfound].

---

Estrogen significantly influences mood through its modulation of neurotransmitter systems and neuroplasticity. Fluctuations in estrogen levels, particularly during the **perimenopausal transition**, are associated with **increased risk of mood disturbances**. Individual variability in estrogen sensitivity and genetic factors further modulate these effects. Clinically, **estrogen therapy** may benefit perimenopausal women experiencing mood symptoms, but it is not a universal solution and should be carefully individualized.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^114ceTJr]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Estrogen-based therapies have shown superior antidepressant effects compared to placebo when administered to perimenopausal women. The antidepressant effects of estrogen were observed even in the absence of concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Older, postmenopausal women, however, showed little or no response to estrogen therapy for the alleviation of depressive symptoms. Taken together, these observations suggest that estrogen's antidepressant effect may have a 'critical window' or optimal timing, possibly during the MT and early postmenopausal years; moreover, the potential benefits of E2 therapy for the improvement of mood symptoms may occur independent from changes/improvement of vasomotor symptoms.

As symptomatic midlife women may endorse a wide variety of physical and emotional complaints, physicians and other health professionals have the challenging task to disentangle the biological and psychosocial aspects that could be primarily attributed to (a) the aging process per se; (b) the menopausal transition; (c) the emergence of new onset/recurrent depression.

### Testosterone imbalance may link depression and increased body weight in premenopausal women [^112jbe3H]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Given the observed sex differences in both adipose fat accumulation and depression prevalence, it is likely that sex hormones substantially influence the interplay between obesity and depression. Sex hormones interact with main neurotransmitter systems implicated in the regulation of cognition and affect, including acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Both androgens and oestrogens play a role in emotional processing, memory, and perception, as well as the interpretation of sensory information in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, supporting a significant role in the etiopathogenesis of major depressive disorder. Evidence from several lines of research link hormone fluctuations to increased risk of developing a major depressive episode. Firstly, vulnerability for depression in women significantly increases in puberty and declines after menopause. Secondly, postpartum and perimenopause phases and the immediate period after a surgically induced menopause (all of which are characterised by substantial changes in sex hormone levels — particularly oestradiol) are associated with a significant increase in the risk of depression in women with or without a previous history of depressive symptoms. Finally, studies in clinical populations found associations between sex hormones, such as oestradiol and testosterone, and depression. Sustained low oestradiol levels have been observed in women with major depressive disorder, as well as clinical recovery from depression during the postpartum period, perimenopause, and postmenopause following restoration of stable oestradiol levels. Antidepressant effects of oestrogen were observed in several animal studies, and have been shown to be dose and receptor-dependent. While alterations in testosterone levels are largely accepted to influence the pathogenesis of depression in men –, recent findings suggest that testosterone may play a critical role in depression susceptibility in women as well, although the findings are mixed –. While the concentration of testosterone in women is ten times lower than in men, it has been shown that women are more sensitive to it. In a study of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, a state of hyperandrogenism, a four-fold risk increase for depression independent of body mass index (BMI) was found. Several animal studies have also indicated an anti-depressant effect of testosterone, and this effect appears to be dose dependent

### Practical strategies for diagnosing and treating depression in women: menopausal transition [^113g8Mzm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating condition that affects twice as many women as men. Accumulated evidence suggests that hormone fluctuations may play an important role in such increased risk for depression among females. For example, women during the menopausal transition appear to have a heightened risk for developing MDD compared with premenopausal or postmenopausal women. Overlapping depressive and menopause-related symptoms (e.g., vasomotor complaints, sleep disturbances) can complicate diagnosis and treatment, but it is vital that clinicians work to adequately tailor their treatment strategies to manage both the mood and somatic symptoms. Possible treatment options to be considered include the adequate use of hormone replacement therapy, antidepressants, psychotherapy, and other psychotropic agents.

### Linear and inverted U-shaped dose-response functions describe estrogen effects on hippocampal activity in young women [^112V8XFy]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Many animal studies have observed that E2 affects not only for cellular measures of hippocampal neuronal plasticity but also hippocampus-dependent memory performance –. Given that we used a paradigm which we know elicits menstrual-cycle-dependent variations in hippocampus-dependent memory, at least for negative stimuli, the null effect of E2 on memory performance in the current study seems to be particularly surprising. However, despite the many studies providing evidence for a positive relationship between hippocampus-dependent memory and E2 levels during learning within a physiological range in female animals, even these effects appear to depend highly on dose, treatment duration and, in particular, the specific task used –. We also observed highly task-specific behavioral effects of E2 in two of our previous studies in women, where hormonal effects were restricted to hippocampus-dependent memory for negatively valenced stimuli or a specific form of hippocampus-dependent associative verbal memory. Similarly, although only studied in young men, a genetic polymorphism related to higher E2 levels was associated with larger posterior hippocampi but not with better hippocampus-dependent memory performance in three different tasks. One might speculate that subtle differences in the neural circuits involved in specific hippocampus-dependent tasks, in combination with the influence of a (sub)region's specific ERα/ERβ distribution might lead to a complex interaction between task performance and dose. It therefore seems plausible that a different, more sensitive task with the current E2 regimen could elicit observable behavioral changes.

### The kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS): what have we learned? [^114d8phC]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Associations for specific cardiovascular risk factors that might affect cognitive performance were investigated in 571 women for whom a complete data set and APOE ε4 genotypes were available. After controlling for age, education and APOE ε4 status, systolic blood pressure showed an inverse association with performance on auditory attention and working memory, a relationship that was not related to endogenous hormone levels at baseline. These results are consistent with the growing body of evidence for a relationship between increased systolic blood pressure and with both adverse structural changes in the brain and decreased cognition.

A total of 662 women provided sufficient neuropsychological test data to be included in the longitudinal analytic sample. Effects of HT on changes in cognition and mood were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Longitudinal outcome measures included the following: Modified Mini-Mental State examination; four cognitive latent factors (verbal learning/memory, auditory attention/working memory, visual attention/executive function, and speeded language/mental flexibility); and mood measured by the Profiles of Mood States (POMS). There were no treatment-related effects found for any of the cognitive outcomes. Regarding mood, however, women treated with o-CEE but not t-E 2 reported less depression and anxiety symptoms compared with placebo. It should be emphasized that these results are limited to the 4 years of HT in women with low baseline cardiovascular risk. Long-term follow-up of women enrolled in KEEPS is currently underway to evaluate these effects in women after cessation of HT. Follow-up of younger WHI participants (aged 50–55 y at HT onset) was conducted in the E-only WHI trial. Using methods similar to the WHIMS substudy, no sustained benefit or risk was found on cognitive function, although these women were examined 7 years after cessation of HT, and no information was obtained regarding continuation or early discontinuation of treatment.

### Memory complaints and memory performance in the menopausal transition [^1164Mvzi]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perimenopausal memory complaints and performance on objective neuropsychological tests. A secondary aim was to determine if putative deficits are related to other relevant factors, such as hormone levels, mood state, or sleep quality.

Methods

Twenty-four perimenopausal women were enrolled. Participants completed questionnaires assessing mood, anxiety, menopausal symptoms, health, and subjective memory function. They also underwent comprehensive cognitive testing, which included measures of attention, working memory, verbal memory, verbal fluency, visuospatial skill, and fine motor dexterity. We obtained serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels on the day of testing.

Results

We found no association between memory complaints and performance on tests of retentive memory. However, memory complaints were associated with poorer memory encoding and increased depressive symptoms. Regression analyses revealed that memory complaints were best predicted by depressive symptoms, whereas encoding performance was predicted by depressive symptoms and estrogen level. Women with significant memory complaints performed worse on tests of encoding, after controlling for depression and sleep disturbance.

Conclusions

These results suggest a complex relationship between mood, memory, and hormones that may underlie perimenopausal memory complaints. Furthermore, they suggest that some women may be particularly vulnerable to the subjective experience of memory problems and relative decreases in attentionally mediated cognitive function.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and menopausal symptoms [^11112nGf]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

A majority of women will experience bothersome symptoms related to declining and/or fluctuating levels of estrogen during their menopausal transition. Vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, poor sleep, and depressed mood have all been found to worsen during the menopausal transition. While vasomotor symptoms gradually improve after menopause, the time course can be many years. Vaginal dryness does not improve without treatment, while the long-term course of sleep and mood deterioration is not clearly defined at this time. A small minority of women have vasomotor symptoms that persist throughout the remainder of their lives. These common menopausal symptoms all improve with estrogen treatment. Over the last 10 years, we have witnessed a dramatic reduction in enthusiasm for menopausal hormone therapy, despite its high efficacy relative to other treatments. We have also seen the emergence of sound, evidence-based clinical trials of non-hormonal alternatives that can control the common menopausal symptoms. Understanding the natural history of menopausal symptoms, and the risks and benefits of both hormonal and non-hormonal alternatives, helps the clinician individualize management plans to improve quality of life.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^11366hkL]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Depressive disorders and menopausal hormone therapy — Key points indicate that there is some evidence that estrogen therapy (ET) has antidepressant effects of similar magnitude to that observed with antidepressant agents when administered to depressed perimenopausal women with or without concomitant vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (Level II), and that estrogen therapy is ineffective as a treatment for depressive disorders in postmenopausal women, with such evidence suggesting a possible window of opportunity for the effective use of ET for the management of depressive disorders during the perimenopause (Level II). There is some evidence that ET enhances mood and improves well-being in nondepressed perimenopausal women (Level I). Transdermal estradiol with intermittent MP may prevent the onset of depressive symptoms in euthymic perimenopausal women, but the evidence is not sufficient to recommend estrogen-based therapies for preventing depression in asymptomatic perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, and the risks and benefits must be weighed (Level II). Estrogen-based therapies may augment clinical response to antidepressants in midlife and older women, preferably when also indicated for other menopause symptoms such as VMS (Level III). Most studies on hormone therapy for the treatment of depression examined the effects of unopposed estrogen, and data on estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) or different progestogens are sparse and inconclusive (Level II). Estrogen is not government approved to treat mood disturbance (Level I).

### Are the risk factors for developing type 1 and type 2 cesarean scar pregnancy different? [^117Ezbb4]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hysteroscopic surgery could "damage" the surface of the endometrium, resulting in extensive scar tissue. Our current study also found the association of hysteroscopic surgery with the developing type 1 CSP. However, due to the small sample size in CSP women with 3 times prior cesarean sections or CSP women with a history of hysteroscopic surgery, this association should be further investigated.

There is a lack of evidence in the current literature regarding whether hormonal levels could influence the type of CSP that develops. However, hormonal imbalances might affect how the fertilized egg implants in the uterine tissue. CSP is associated with low or absent β‐hCG levels, and lower estrogen levels are associated with an increased risk of vaginal bleeding. Our current study does not have data on sex hormone levels, such as estrogen and progesterone, in women with CSP, as these tests are not routinely performed. Nonetheless, hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly in its early stages, are known to influence mood swings. Estrogen, for instance, is active in regions of the brain that regulates mood. To explore this indirectly, we compared pregnancy‐related mood swings between type 1 and type 2 CSP, using these observations as a proxy for sex hormone levels. Our data showed no statistical significance in early pregnancy mood reactions between women with type 1 and type 2 CSP. In contrast, a significantly higher number of women with type 2 CSP experienced vaginal bleeding compared to those with type 1 CSP. This finding suggests that vaginal bleeding may be associated with type 2 CSP and indirectly indicates a potential link between lower estrogen levels and the development of this subtype. However, this association should be interpreted as part of a broader pattern of clinical differences between the subtypes, rather than as a definitive predictive factor. Reliable CSP classification will likely require a combination of clinical, imaging, and potentially molecular markers. Further studies with larger sample sizes and prospective designs are needed to validate this finding and determine its role in clinical decision‐making.

### Quality of life and menopause: the role of estrogen [^113RVYfn]. Journal of Women's Health (2002). Low credibility.

The use of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy (ERT/HRT) in preventing disease in menopausal women has been well documented. Less attention has been paid to the menopausal symptoms that can impair the quality of life of menopausal women, such as hot flushes, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, and alterations in mood. Researchers have used a variety of methods to investigate these concerns. Decreases in ovarian hormones that occur with menopause have been implicated in these symptoms. Ovarian hormones affect the central nervous system and urogenital tissues directly via receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and androgens. Changes in the symptoms of menopause consequential to estrogen therapy reflect the effect of this therapy on these tissues. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of ERT/HRT in the treatment of symptoms affecting quality of life is growing and supports the use of ERT/HRT during menopause. Because the most dramatic hormonal changes associated with menopause are related to estrogen and because estrogen is usually coadministered with a progestogen in patients with an intact uterus, this review is focused primarily on ERT/HRT. Because androgen therapy may also improve quality of life by enhancing perimenopausal and postmenopausal sexual desire, function, and general well-being, a brief discussion of androgen supplementation of ERT/HRT is also included. The ideal doses and combinations of hormones must be determined on an individual basis, taking into consideration benefits, risks, and interactions of the different hormone therapies.

### Special issues related to the treatment of depression in women [^114eUSXg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Depressive disorders in women are commonly associated with reproductive events. This association may be due in part to the changing balance between estrogen, progesterone, and other hormones that affect neurotransmitter function throughout a woman's lifecycle. Alternatively, they may be related to psychosocial events surrounding these pivotal times or to both sets of conditions. Some data suggest that depression in women tends to respond differently to antidepressant treatment than depression in men, underscoring the need to examine the risk and treatment of depressive disorders in males and females separately. Women have benefited considerably from serotonin reuptake inhibitor anti-depressants that are currently available. These agents appear to be more effective than the older tricyclic antidepressants in treating various depressive disorders that occur commonly or exclusively in women. Additionally, serotonin reuptake inhibitors have increased tolerability in women, who generally experience more adverse effects from tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors than do men. Estrogen appears to enhance antidepressant response in postmenopausal women receiving estrogen replacement therapy. More research is needed, however, that examines how the balance between estrogen, progesterone, and other hormones affects neurotransmitter function.

### Estrogenic regulation of hippocampal inhibitory system across lifespan [^112Jxrny]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Estrogens produced in peripheral tissues and locally in the brain are potent neuromodulators. The function of the hippocampus, a brain region essential for episodic memory and spatial navigation, relies on the activity of ensembles of excitatory neurons whose activity is temporally and spatially coordinated by a wide diversity of inhibitory neurons (INs) types. Over the last years, we have accumulated evidence that indicates that estrogens regulate the function of hippocampal INs through different mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation and rapid nongenomic signaling. Here, we argue that the well-documented influence of estrogens on episodic memory may be related to the actions of local and peripheral estrogens on the heterogenous populations of hippocampal INs. We discuss how physiological changes in peripheral sex hormone levels throughout lifespan may interact with local brain sources to regulate IN function at different stages of life, from early hippocampal development to the aging brain. We conclude that considering INs as mediators of sex hormone actions in the hippocampus across the healthy life span will benefit our understanding of sex-biased neurodevelopmental disorders and physiological aging.

### Associations between reproductive health factors and sociodemographic characteristics and the severity of moderate to severe postmenopausal depression: a secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial data [^116JM7j1]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Depression is a heterogeneous condition with significant gender differences, where women are at a greater risk of depression, the prevalence rates for women and men are 2:1, respectively. It appears that depression in women may also increase due to reproductive events, such as postpartum depression following childbirth, a premenstrual dysphoric disorder related to the menstrual cycle, and menopausal depression, possibly associated with factors such as sensitivity to changes in reproductive hormones.

Menopause, marked by 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea, results in significant clinical consequences due to the significant loss of estrogen and progesterone caused by the cessation of ovarian function. Premature menopause, defined as cessation of menses before 45 or as premature ovarian failure before 40, reduces fertility and leads to metabolic, cardiovascular, osteoarticular, genitourinary, sexual, and mood disturbances. Late-onset menopause, defined as occurring at age 55 or older, results in prolonged estrogen exposure and an increased risk of hormone-dependent cancers. Menopause represents a critical window for the onset of depression, during which depressive symptoms often co-occur with various menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor disturbances, sleep disruption, fatigue, and urinary incontinence. These overlapping symptoms suggest a strong link between the hormonal changes of menopause and the exacerbation of depressive episodes. Postmenopausal women experience changes in estradiol levels, which may increase their sensitivity to psychosocial stress, making them more susceptible to developing depressive symptoms. The steady and ongoing reduction in hormone production and function, associated with aging, negatively affects human health by elevating the risk of chronic illnesses and shortening life expectancy.

### Mechanisms of estradiol in fear circuitry: implications for sex differences in psychopathology [^111tor4E]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Future directions

The reviewed data indicate that low E2 levels in females may be associated with deficits in fear extinction recall and may potentially be related to vulnerability to anxiety, fear and mood disorders. In males, low levels of estradiol do not appear to impair extinction recall. This may be due to the effects of testosterone, which has been reported to have anxiolytic properties. It is also probable that estradiol engages male and female brains differently. As such, we cannot preclude the possible roles that other hormones, or their interactions with E2, may have in this phenomenon. It is also important to note that while low levels of estradiol are disadvantageous to extinction memory consolidation, it is likely that fluctuations rather than absolute levels of estradiol may be the critical factor for elevated risk of anxiety.

We have reviewed evidence that estradiol may influence the molecular and cellular machinery involved in fear extinction, a behavioral process that models the psychopathology of PTSD and anxiety disorders. Together, these data highlight the association between the dynamic estrogen states that occur across the female lifespan and increased vulnerability to anxiety-related disorders. It is imperative that future studies investigate fluctuations in levels of E2 to determine their possible associations with, and contributions to, vulnerability to mood and anxiety disorders in women. There are many questions that remain to be answered in this field that are related to where, how and when E2 modifies neural function to elicit its effects on extinction memory recall (Figure 6). Future research aimed at localizing and identifying cellular and molecular mechanisms by which estrogen modulates fear extinction and anxiety can better inform us of treatment targets and improve the efficacy of clinical applications.

### The other side of estrogen replacement therapy: outcome study results of mood improvement in estrogen users and nonusers [^116QUNfo]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

The effect of estrogen on the brain and body of women is a controversial topic that has received a tremendous amount of attention in the past few years. Recent reviews have focused on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), medical risks, and effects on brain metabolism, cognition, risk of Alzheimer's disease, and mood. This article summarizes HRT and mood improvement in postmenopausal women. For nondepressed women, experimental designs provide no clear evidence for mood improvement associated with HRT, whereas observational studies are more likely to report mood improvement. There appears to be moderate evidence that HRT facilitates the improvement of clinical depression and the efficacy of antidepressants. Heterogeneity among studies makes it difficult to generalize and recommend HRT for mood improvement in postmenopausal women, but there is a clear need to examine the necessary duration of HRT for neuroprotection to decrease a woman's risk for depression, cognitive dysfunction, and development of Alzheimer's disease.

### Estrogenic regulation of hippocampal inhibitory system across lifespan [^1113eMsz]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Estrogens produced in peripheral tissues and locally in the brain are potent neuromodulators. The function of the hippocampus, a brain region essential for episodic memory and spatial navigation, relies on the activity of ensembles of excitatory neurons whose activity is temporally and spatially coordinated by a wide diversity of inhibitory neurons (INs) types. Over the last years, we have accumulated evidence that indicates that estrogens regulate the function of hippocampal INs through different mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation and rapid nongenomic signaling. Here, we argue that the well‐documented influence of estrogens on episodic memory may be related to the actions of local and peripheral estrogens on the heterogenous populations of hippocampal INs. We discuss how physiological changes in peripheral sex hormone levels throughout lifespan may interact with local brain sources to regulate IN function at different stages of life, from early hippocampal development to the aging brain. We conclude that considering INs as mediators of sex hormone actions in the hippocampus across the healthy life span will benefit our understanding of sex‐biased neurodevelopmental disorders and physiological aging.

### Association between body mass index and comorbid anxiety in first-episode and drug Naïve patients with major depressive disorder [^117Ehv4N]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analysis revealed that the impact of BMI on anxiety symptoms was more pronounced in females and individuals with lower education levels, indicating that gender differences and education levels may influence the BMI-anxiety relationship. Clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated gender differences in MDD, with women exhibiting a higher prevalence than men. Women with MDD are also more likely to experience elevated anxiety levels and have a higher incidence of comorbid anxiety disorders. In a cross-sectional study, approximately 70% of patients with depressive and anxiety disorders were females who exhibited increased psychological stress associated with obesity and heightened body dissatisfaction. Moreover, estrogen modulates mood by influencing multiple neurotransmitter systems, including the noradrenergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic pathways. The regulatory effects of this hormone on neurotransmitters suggest a complex role in mood regulation. Conversely, vulnerability to "fat stigma" in everyday relationships among females exacerbates anxiety levels. Several studies have demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between educational level and depression prevalence. Individuals with lower educational attainment are more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Individuals with higher educational levels typically have better job prospects, which can provide a sense of purpose and reduce stress, thereby lowering the risk of depression and anxiety. Education often correlates with socioeconomic status, and lower educational levels can lead to reduced income and limited access to resources, contributing to mental health challenges. Moreover, higher levels of education are linked to improved health literacy, empowering individuals to make informed health decisions, and access appropriate mental health services when needed.

### Hormones and menopausal status as predictors of depression in womenin transition to menopause… [^1168bHgv]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

corroborating evidence that the changing hormonal milieu contributes to dysphoric mood during transition to menopause. The low estrogen levels of postmenopausalwomen were long believed to be associated with involutional melancholia, andthe low estrogen theory was supported by the results of estrogen administration, which reduced depressive symptoms in some studies, 1–3 althoughothers found no greater effect than with placebo use. 4 Arecent study5 indicated that estrogen deficiencymay play a role in depression in premenopausal women, although other researchers6 suggested that the destabilizing effect of repeatedfluctuations during menstrual cycles rather than low levels of estrogen maybe the important factor in dysphoric mood in cycling women.

Suppression of these hormonal fluctuations in premenopausalwomen eliminated menstrually related dysphoric symptoms; after pharmacologicsuppression of ovarian function, the administration of physiologic doses ofestrogen induced dysphoric symptoms in women with premenstrual syndrome but not in controls. 11 However, in perimenopausalwomen with major depression, estrogen treatment effectively reduced the depression. 12–14 These diverse studiesnot only indicate that the association between estrogen and depression iscomplex and varies with context15 but alsosuggest that estrogen has a role in depressive symptoms in the menopausaltransition. Women who experienced increased estradiol levels during the study weremore likely to report high CES-D scores, although the overall association of estradiol did not reachstatistical significance.

This pattern of higher estradiol levels observed in early transition to menopause34 is believed to result from an increased ovarian follicularresponse to increased FSH levels. 35 An associationbetween decreasing estradiol levels and CES-D scores was also observed, but it was limited by the smallnumber of participants who reached menopause during the study. The hypothesis that fluctuations in estradiol levels were associatedwith depressive symptoms was supported by the evidence that women with increasingestradiol profiles, which occur with ovarian aging in early transition tomenopause, 34 reported more depressive symptoms. Decreasing estradiol levels, which occur closer to menopause, were marginallyassociated with more depressive symptoms, although less than 5% of the cohortreached menopause during the study, providing little power for this analysis.

It will be important to further investigate the associations between fluctuationsin estradiol levels and depressive symptoms as larger numbers of women inthis cohort reach menopause.

### Prevalence of symptoms in relation to androgen concentrations in women using estrogen plus progestogen and women using estrogen alone [^112NmqG2]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Women using estrogen plus progestogen therapy sometimes report difficult to describe symptoms, eg, changes in libido, mood, and memory, that may be related to decreased androgens. To evaluate the prevalence of such symptoms and relate these symptoms to androgen levels in women using estrogen plus progestogen therapy, data from the Women's Health in the Lund Area Study were analyzed.

Design

A total of 2,816 women using estrogen plus progestogen therapy were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of questions concerning sexual well-being and different aspects of quality of life. Serum concentrations of testosterone, androstendione, sex hormone-binding globulin, and estradiol were measured.

Results

A total of 2,048 questionnaires were eligible for evaluation. Almost 40% of the women reported decreased libido. Approximately 70% were satisfied with their current sex life. Eight percent reported that intercourse was unpleasant because of vaginal dryness. No evident associations were found between libido and serum hormone concentrations. The most positive effects of estrogen plus progestogen therapy concerning memory and urinary tract and vaginal complaints were found in women with the highest and/or moderate testosterone levels (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

We found no strong association between symptoms related to sexual well-being or quality of life and androgen concentrations in this study. Estrogen plus progestogen therapy did not seem to affect symptoms that might be related to low levels of androgens in the group of climacteric women whom we studied.

### Mood disorders in midlife women: understanding the critical window and its clinical implications [^111LT9Ne]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years have been described as a "window of vulnerability" for the development of depressive symptoms or depression (new or recurrent) in some women. This article aims to review contributing factors to the emergence of menopause-related depression, some of the key challenges to its proper identification and management, and evidence on effective treatment strategies.

Methods

A body of evidence (animal data, epidemiologic studies, and clinical studies) was reviewed to disentangle some of the complex interactions between changes in sex hormones and reproductive function, physical health, and mood in midlife women. Special focus was given to the window of vulnerability framework.

Results

Despite evidence of a critical window for new onset of depression, a prior depressive episode (particularly if related to reproductive events) remains the strongest predictor of mood symptoms or depression during midlife years. Vasomotor symptoms, anxiety, and other health-related issues also modulate the risk for depression. Mechanistically, estrogen plays an important role in mood and cognitive regulation. Transdermal estradiol, as well as serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants, have shown efficacy in the management of depression in this population. Other evidence-based treatment options (hormonal, pharmacologic, and behavioral) are available to clinicians and health professionals.

Conclusions

A more comprehensive diagnostic approach should be used in symptomatic midlife women. Ultimately, researchers hope to develop preventive strategies and treatments that could be tailored to multiple symptom domains and improve overall functioning.

### Is there a neuroendocrinological rationale for testosterone as a therapeutic option in depression? [^111oyenA]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Depression is a disease of growing incidence and economic burden worldwide. In view of increasing treatment resistance, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. In addition to its gonadal functions, testosterone has many effects on the central nervous system. An association between testosterone levels and depressive symptoms has been proposed. Many hormones and neurotransmitters are involved in the aetiology and the course of depression including serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, vasopressin and cortisol. Testosterone is known to interact with them. Preclinical data suggest that testosterone has antidepressant potential. However, the data from clinical studies have been inconsistent. This review provides a critical overview on the currently available preclinical and clinical literature and concludes with clinical recommendations.

### Mood, depression, and reproductive hormones in the menopausal transition [^115uhwXZ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

This article focuses on a review of evidence related to the following 3 questions: (1) Does depression appear during the menopausal transition? (2) What factors influence the risk for depression during the menopausal transition? (3) Do age-related alterations in ovarian hormone secretion contribute to the development of depression in some middle-aged women? A brief background is provided on the importance of depressive disorders. Methodologic issues that have compromised previous studies investigating the possible relation between the menopausal transition and depression are discussed. Evidence is presented that suggests a relation between the perimenopause (the interval between the early menopausal transition and 1 year after the last menses), but not the postmenopause, and the onset of depressive illness. Finally, studies are reviewed that suggest an association between alterations in ovarian function and depression, including several randomized placebo-controlled trials examining the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in depressed perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

### Depression during and after the perimenopause: impact of hormones, genetics, and environmental determinants of disease [^115tAd7N]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Vulnerability to depression is increased across the menopause transition and in the early years after the final menstrual period. Clinicians should systematically screen women in this age group; if depressive symptoms or disorder are present, treatment of depression should be initiated. Potential treatments include antidepressants for moderate to severe symptoms, psychotherapy to target psychological and interpersonal factors, and hormone therapy for women with first-onset major depressive disorder or elevated depressive symptoms and at low risk for adverse effects. Behavioral interventions can improve physical activity and sleep patterns.

### Mechanisms of estradiol in fear circuitry: implications for sex differences in psychopathology [^112QGLpa]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Potential contribution of estradiol to vulnerability for mood and anxiety disorders

The experimental evidence reviewed thus far clearly indicates that endogenous fluctuations as well as exogenous manipulations of E2 influence emotional memory consolidation. Specifically, low levels of E2 appear to be associated with reduced memory consolidation whereas elevated E2 is associated with enhanced memory consolidation. Drastic hormonal fluctuations occur throughout the woman's lifespan and appear to coincide with vulnerability for mood disturbances. Risk for depression and anxiety increases at the onset of puberty, and mood disturbances such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder are associated with hormonal changes during menstruation. The sharp drop in estradiol production at menopause coincides with cognitive deficitsand increased risk for depression. During pregnancy, a period of extremely high hormone levels, women exhibit a blunted stress responseand have a lower risk for mood disorders than nonpregnant women. However, the dramatic decrease in hormone levels following pregnancy accompanies a significant risk for postpartum depression. These data suggest that fluctuations of E2 and other sex hormones may potentially place women at risk for developing mood and anxiety disorders. In support of this possibility, there are several studies indicating that estradiol therapy improves anxiety and depressive symptoms in postnatal depression, recurrent postpartum affective disorder, and menopause.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113ZhwT3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Androgens and mood in women are characterized by limited targeted studies, with few studies addressing how T affects mood in women in which mood is the primary endpoint and/or the population studied is depressed or rigorously assessed for depression, while several randomized, placebo-controlled studies in which women were not screened for depression before enrollment showed improvements in mood as a secondary endpoint in women with bilateral oophorectomy, sexual dysfunction, hypopituitarism, or anorexia nervosa. Psychological well-being improved with transdermal T in two RCTs in which women with depression were excluded, and DHEA monotherapy improved mood in small, randomized, placebo-controlled studies in women with HIV/AIDS and adrenal insufficiency; DHEAS levels were inversely associated with depressed mood in older women. There are few studies investigating the effects of androgens or preandrogens in women diagnosed with major depression, two small pilot studies reported positive results, and there have been no large, placebo-controlled studies that address whether T therapy is efficacious, either as monotherapy or augmentation therapy, for treatment of mood in women with major depressive disorders.

### Estrogen-mediated effects on depression and memory formation in females [^1119YuL8]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Women are twice as likely to suffer from depression as men. It has been proposed that the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone contribute to the higher incidence of this potentially debilitating disorder. Depression can also be accompanied by a loss of cognitive performance. Here we review estrogen-mediated effects on depression and memory formation in females. We propose that changes in levels of estrogen are associated with sex differences in learning as well as changes in affect prior to menses, immediately after pregnancy and during perimenopause and the menopausal transition. Finally, we discuss the animal model of depression known as 'learned helplessness' and describe research from our laboratory demonstrating that exposure to an acute stressful experience compromises a female's later ability to acquire certain types of new memories. This response to stressful experience is opposite to that observed in males and is dependent on the presence of estrogen, and more specifically-changing levels of estrogen. This observation indicates that females and males can use different hormonal and neural mechanisms to respond to the same emotional event and underscore the importance of studying the unique and changing biology of females, especially when considering treatment strategies for depression and stress-related illness.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (third edition) [^1165Ktwm]. APA (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, APA 2010 guidelines recommend to obtain a detailed assessment of mood changes across the reproductive life history (menstruation, pregnancy, birth control including oral contraception use, abortions, menopause) in the evaluation of female patients, because the symptoms of some female patients may fluctuate with gonadal hormone levels.

### Menopausal transition, mood, and cognition: an integrated view to close the gaps [^114WzH2L]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and clinic data support the notion that some women may be at higher risk for developing mood and anxiety symptoms and cognitive complaints during certain periods in life that are marked by intense hormone variations and psychosocial stressors. The complexity of the so-called windows of vulnerability poses a particular challenge to professionals involved in the care of female patients. Menopausal transition is perhaps a paramount example; the process itself is marked by progressive, dynamic changes in hormone levels and reproductive function that interact with the aging process, changes in metabolism, sexuality, lifestyle behaviors, and overall health. The putative compounded burden of health challenges associated with this transition has become a main focus of attention of physicians and researchers who aim to identify preventive and/or early intervention strategies to promote healthy aging in midlife women. Recent studies have provided further evidence that the menopausal transition may be not only a window of vulnerability for depression and cognitive impairment but also a critical "window of opportunity" for the success of hormone-based treatments. The need for further investigation and better understanding of common underlying mechanisms seems intuitive. An ultimate goal could include preventive strategies for women presenting with various risk factors for cardiovascular, cognitive, and mood disorders as well as treatments that could be tailored to multiple symptom domains during the menopausal transition.

### Sex is a defining feature of neuroimaging phenotypes in major brain disorders [^115Jnzuh]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Progesterone is a derivative of the hormone, pregnenolone, in both males and females. Although it is most commonly known for its role in female physiology, progesterone also facilitates sperm capacitation, fertilization and immunosuppression in both sexes (Maybin & Critchley; Oettel & Mukhopadhyay). In the brain, progesterone helps to maintain the structural integrity of myelin and regulates synaptogenesis, neuron survival and dendritic growth (Schumacher et al.). Neural functions of progesterone occur primarily through membrane‐associated progesterone receptors in various brain regions including the hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulb, cortex, cerebellum, locus coeruleus, hypothalamus, thalamus, basal ganglia, and brainstem (Schumacher et al.).

Estrogen and progesterone levels fluctuate throughout the female menstrual cycle, and these fluctuations have been associated with changes in mood, concentration, somatic sensations, and brain structure (Catenaccio, Mu, & Lipton). The follicular phase and luteal phase are the two primary phases of the menstrual cycle. Menstruation generally occurs between days 1 and 8 of the follicular phase, during which estrogen rises until reaching peak levels at the start of the peri‐ovulatory period of the follicular phase (~days 11–12). Ovulation, which typically occurs around Day 14 of the menstrual cycle, marks the transition from the follicular phase to the luteal phase, and a significant drop in estrogen levels. Simultaneously, progesterone levels begin to rise during the luteal phase (progesterone levels are low during follicular phase), peaking at the start of the pre‐menstrual period (~days 21–22) and declining rapidly thereafter (Catenaccio et al; Maybin & Critchley). A recent review of 25 neuroimaging studies (N = 1,321) (Catenaccio et al.) described the brain signatures that corresponded to these phases. Four studies reported larger volumes during the follicular phase than the luteal phase, with the most consistent effects in the hippocampus, parahippocampal and middle frontal gyri. Five studies reported larger volumes during the luteal phase than the follicular phase using a mix of voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) and region of interest (ROI) methods, but none reported effects in consistent regions. Three studies reported no volume differences between follicular and luteal phases. A few studies compared neuroimaging metrics (VBM, volumetry, ROI‐based) between the menstrual and peri‐ovulatory periods, but none reported consistent effects in any regions (Catenaccio et al.). It is worth noting, however, that the sample sizes of each of the 25 reviewed studies was small (largest N = 128, mean N ~ 32) and effect sizes were not reported in any systematic way.

### Depression in women: windows of vulnerability and new insights into the link between estrogen and serotonin [^113hFHqZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this commentary is to provide an update on the research in both preclinical and clinical models regarding the cross-talk between estrogen and various serotonin molecular markers and the possible implications this may have on female-related mood disorders.

Conclusions

Animal and human studies provide strong and consistent evidence suggesting that estrogen is able to regulate the serotonin pathway at various levels. The general trend that emerges is that estrogen administration increases serotonin availability by altering mRNA and protein levels of various serotonin markers and by decreasing serotonin breakdown. These effects may have direct implications on female mood disorders such as premenstrual disorders and depression during pregnancy, postpartum, and during the menopausal transition.

### Hormonal factors in female sexual dysfunction [^112vfmWX]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Female sexual dysfunction is a common, multifactorial medical condition, which can have a major impact on self-esteem, quality of life, mood and relationships. Hormonal imbalances may contribute to sexual dysfunction, in particular sexual arousal disorder. Androgens for the treatment of decreased libido, especially in postmenopausal women, have gained increased popularity despite preliminary and controversial results. The absence of precise definitions of androgen deficiency, unknown 'normal' ranges for androgens, and nuances in the sensitivity of the various assays have made research on androgens and libido in women difficult to interpret. This review presents the role of estrogen and androgens in sexual function and their potential roles as therapeutic agents for female sexual dysfunction.

### The kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS): what have we learned? [^114MxqQj]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

The unexpected early termination of the estrogen plus progestin (E+P) portion of the Women's Health Initiative's (WHI) trial in 2002 for net harm, and of the WHI estrogen-only (ET) trial in 2004 for futility left scientists, physicians, and their patients with many concerns about the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone treatments (HT). Despite the large scale and high cost of the WHI, many questions remained unanswered and some new questions arose, the most critical being whether the WHI findings were affected by the fact that most women in the hormone trials were 5 or more years beyond their menopause on entry into the study and many had existing cardiovascular disease. As it seemed unlikely that the National Institutes of Health would fund another study to address these questions, the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a privately funded non-profit institution located in Phoenix, AZ, brought together basic and clinical scientists, some of whom had been investigators in the WHI, from nine academic centers and one collaborating site across the country to design a new study named the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS). The primary goal of the KEEPS was to determine if, in women without preexisting cardiovascular disease, HT begun within 3 years of a woman's last menstrual period (2 y after the World Health Organization definition of menopause) would slow the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis as indicated by changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT). Secondary goals included evaluation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and measurement of coronary artery calcium (CAC). Other goals included aspects of postmenopausal health, risks, and evidence for adverse side effects. This review summarizes what has been learned from the KEEPS during the past decade, including multiple ancillary studies that have provided new insights into cognitive function, mood/affective outcomes, brain structure, menopausal symptoms including sleep quality and sexual function, bone health, metabolism, biomarkers for disease processes, breast pain, and pharmacogenomics of HT. The strengths and shortcomings of these data will be discussed as they may inform current use of HT and guide future research in this field.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^113g5aFo]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over the past few decades, growing epidemiological and clinical data support the notion that some, but not all, women may be at a heightened risk for psychiatric morbidity (for example, mood and anxiety symptoms, cognitive complaints) during periods in life that are associated with reproductive cycle events such as the postpartum period and the menopausal transition. These periods are not only marked by extreme hormone variations but may also be accompanied by the occurrence of significant life stressors and changes in personal, family, and professional responsibilities. The complexity of the so-called female-specific 'windows of vulnerability' certainly poses a particular challenge to physicians and other professionals dedicated to women's health issues across the life span.

Among these female-specific 'windows of vulnerability', the menopausal transition constitutes a complex example: this transition is marked by progressive, dynamic changes in sex hormones and reproductive function. At the same time, these changes overlap with the aging process per se, and with modifications in metabolism, sexuality, lifestyle behaviors and overall health. During this period in life, some individuals may seek medical treatment for a constellation of symptoms including vasomotor complaints (VMS; that is, hot flashes, night sweats), aches and stiff joints, trouble sleeping, and lack of energy. Others, on a more preventative approach, will inquire about different strategies (for example, hormonal, non-hormonal, 'natural' remedies) to promote a 'healthier' transition into postmenopausal years. Overall, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to symptomatic women during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal years are, or should be, multifaceted and multidisciplinary in nature (Figure 1).

### The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in mood disorders [^112NZAzZ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This article has demonstrated that stress and HPA axis activation affect the reproductive axis. Despite similarities in the HPA axis picture between women with major depression and those with hypothalamic amenorrhea and exercise or nutritional amenorrhea, no abnormalities in LH secretion have been documented in major depression. Lower estradiol in the follicular phase in depressed women and lower testosterone in depressed men however, have been observed [81, 92]. Although PMS would appear to be the best candidate for a mood disorder associated with abnormalities in reproductive hormones, no abnormalities in LH, estradiol or progesterone have been documented in PMS either [62]. Similarly, blockade of progesterone appears to be ineffective as a treatment for PMS [79]. Complete elimination of monthly cycling with leuprolide improves mood, however. No published studies have examined women with major depression to determine whether leuprolide will exacerbate or improve depressive symptoms. Some studies suggest beneficial effects of estrogen on mood in postmenopausal women, but no placebo controlled studies have explored estrogen augmentation in the treatment of major depression in either post- or premenopausal women, although estrogen is beneficial in women with perimenopause-related mood disorders [78].

### The kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS): what have we learned? [^115umxn8]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Sexual function

Estrogen deficiency impacts both physical and psychological domains that are critical to sexual experience. Estrogen insufficiency is associated with anatomical changes that contribute to sexual dysfunction, including thinning of the skin of external genitalia, loss of subcutaneous fat, parallel involution of the corpora cavernosa, as well as thinning of the epithelium lining the vagina. - Together these changes can lead to reduced lubrication and pain or discomfort during intercourse. As estrogen is a modulator of serotonergic function, it affects regions of the brain known to regulate mood and desire, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and the hypothalamus. Estrogen loss is associated with alterations in mood, sleep, and cognitive function, all directly or indirectly influencing sexual function.

Effects of o-CEE versus t-E 2: Improvements in domains of sexual function have been previously noted with the use of HT; however, the effects of o-CEE versus t-E 2 have not previously been directly compared. Five hundred and seventy-five of the 727 KEEPS enrollees agreed to participate in the ancillary study of sexual function. Participants completed the Female Sexual Function Inventory (FSFI), a well-validated 19-item questionnaire for assessing the key dimensions of sexual function along six domains of sexual function, including desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Treatment with t-E 2, but not o-CEE, was associated with a significant improvement in the FSFI overall score across all time points compared with placebo. In the individual domains of sexual function, t-E 2 and o-CEE both differed from placebo. Symptoms related directly to tissue effects of estrogens on the reproductive track, such as lubrication and pain on penetration, demonstrated a progressive exacerbation with time, yet were reduced with the use of either t-E 2 or o-CEE. In contrast, the more subjective domains of desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction demonstrated a relatively steady state over time, yet the superiority of t-E 2 over o-CEE was apparent in the greater efficacy of t-E 2 in improving these nonphysical sexual function aspects.

### The effect of hormone replacement therapy on cognition and mood [^113Qp3bj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To summarise the available data regarding the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on cognition and mood in women.

Background

Complaints of impaired cognition and mood are common in the peri‐menopausal and menopausal period. There is debate as to whether HRT can ameliorate this phenomenon.

Design

A literature search of studies using electronic databases was conducted. Both randomised control trials and observational studies were included.

Patients

Perimenopausal and menopausal women.

Results

Due to the heterogenicity of results it is challenging to draw firm conclusions. The preparations used in many of the studies are older regimes no longer routinely used clinically. The notion of a 'critical window' for HRT is compelling, suggesting HRT has a positive impact on cognition when administered in the peri‐menopausal or early postmenopausal period but may have negative effects on cognition in the older, postmenopausal woman. The evidence would seem to suggest importance of hormonal replacement in woman undergoing a surgical menopause, especially when young. It remains unclear for how long they ought to continue HRT though until at least the natural age of the menopause seems reasonable. Evidence for a positive effect of HRT on mood is more convincing, though possibly more efficacious in the younger age group. The effect of HRT on anxiety is less clear.

Conclusions

Further study, particularly focusing on the more contemporaneous HRT preparations, is warranted before evidence‐based conclusions can be drawn.

### Diagnosis and management of mood disorders during the menopausal transition [^1156iTu4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Recent census data indicate that, in the United States, an increasing number of women — almost 1.5 million each year — are reaching menopause. The menopausal transition is marked by intense hormonal fluctuations, and may be accompanied by vasomotor complaints, sleep disturbances, changes in sexual function, and increased risk for osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. In addition, there is evidence of increased risk for developing depression, even among women who never experienced depressive symptoms before. Thus depression during the perimenopause may have a substantial impact on personal, family, and professional spheres of life. A challenge to clinicians and health professionals lies in the identification of the most tolerable treatments to manage depression and improve quality of life in an aging population. Any treatment strategy should take into account not only the spectrum of side effects that may complicate treatment but also other menopause-related factors (e.g., vasomotor symptoms, psychosocial stressors) that may modulate risk for the development of mood disturbance. This article reviews the current literature on the prevalence and risk factors associated with depression during the menopausal transition. The benefits and risks of using hormonal and nonhormonal strategies for the management of depression and other menopause-related somatic symptoms are critically reviewed.

### Premenstrual exacerbations of mood disorders: findings and knowledge gaps [^113LXuv3]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Biological Mechanisms Underlying Premenstrual Exacerbations of Mood Disorders

The similar cyclical time pattern of PMDD and PME symptomatology in mood disorders appears to reflect a shared pathophysiology. However, this view has been increasingly questioned, and the overlap of underlying biological mechanisms in PMDD and PME remains unclear.

Nevertheless, there is broad consensus that both PMDD and PME of mood disorders do not arise from abnormal hormone levels, but that symptoms are triggered by abnormal sensitivity to normal fluctuations of sex hormones and their metabolites across the menstrual cycle. Cycle-related fluctuations of sex hormones also moderate stress sensitivity, which in turn influences emotion regulation.

Individual women's vulnerabilities towards the effects of these fluctuations on the brain are located on a continuum. This requires further risk factors to culminate in a PMD, and probably more specific risk factors for differentiating PMDD, PME of depression, and PME of BD.

Modulation of Neurotransmitter Systems by Estradiol and Progesterone

Sex hormones E2 and P4, and further neurosteroids such as the progesterone derivative allopregnanolone (ALLO) modulate mood-related brain systems including neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism, receptor synthesis, and synaptic plasticity. Their cyclic fluctuations result in changes in the activation of limbic and prefrontal brain regions, which are critical to emotion regulation, and can finally induce cyclical changes in mood and behavior. This hormonal priming may have several possible underlying mechanisms on different levels, which have not been fully uncovered, but might explain the inconsistencies and individual differences in the menstrual cycle effects on mood symptoms. Possible mechanisms through which sex hormones and their metabolites can regulate brain systems include acute activational effects, programming effects, neural excitability, regulation of neural cell functions and transmission, and circuit regulation.

### Dietary creatine intake and depression risk among U.S. adults [^112KpJQr]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

In contrast, it is possible that the interactive effects of estrogen and creatine on depression vary across a woman's lifespan based on reproductive stage and hormone cycle phase. In addition to their effects on areas of the brain related to reproduction, ovarian steroids have widespread neurological impacts including on serotonin pathways, catecholamine neurons, the basal forebrain cholinergic system, and the hippocampal formation. The onset of puberty marks a dramatic increase in the prevalence of depression in females compared to males, from approximately equalto twice that of males (prevalence ratio = 1.3–3.1; lifetime gender ratio = 2.1). In midlife, evidence has emerged that points to a temporal link between depression onset and the menopause transition in a subset of women, and the efficacy of exogenous estrogen administration during peri-menopause. However, at present the existence of menopause-associated depression remains controversial, due to inconsistency in the methods used to characterize reproductive staging and evaluate psychiatric conditions in studies of midlife women with depression. Importantly, estrogenand creatineboth possess the ability to target mitochondrial function in the brain, raising the possibility they may interact to potentiate one another's effects in treating or preventing depression. This relationship, however, is complicated by neuroimaging evidence demonstrating that a woman's brain creatine concentration is a 'state' marker, which varies with systemic estrogen levels in the menstrual, follicular, and luteal phases. Thus to elucidate the relationship between, and the respective contributions of estrogen and creatine to depression would require a measure of systemic estrogen and magnetic resonance spectroscopy brain scanning to quantitate in vivo brain creatine, with both performed on the day depression status is assessed. Future studies will be needed to explore how dietary creatine is related to mood symptoms across both the menstrual cycle and the lifespan, including pre-pubertal girls, adolescent females, women of childbearing age, as well as peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women.

### The effect of hormone replacement therapy on cognition and mood [^112aSkKR]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSION

Impaired cognition and mood disturbance is a common complaint amongst perimenopausal and menopausal women. There are both psycho‐social and biological explanations for this phenomenon. Analysis of the evidence regarding the impact of HRT on cognition and mood is challenging due to the heterogenicity of studies, the use of near historical HRT regimes in study protocols, and the age range and variety of comorbidities of women enroled in the trials. Current data is insufficient to draw conclusions of impact between the types of HRT for example, the older conjugated equine oestrogens and oestradiol. Some studies find improvements in cognition with HRT whilst other studies find no effect or even deleterious effects. A notion of a 'critical window' of HRT has arisen whereby HRT may improve cognition in the younger age group but be deleterious in older, postmenopausal women. Women who have undergone a surgical menopause are more likely to benefit cognitively from HRT. It remains unclear for how long they ought to continue HRT though until at least the natural age of the menopause seems reasonable. Evidence for a positive effect of HRT on mood is also conflicting but more convincing. It is likely more efficacious in the younger age group. Furthermore, HRT and antidepressants seem to have a positive cumulative effect in clinical depression. The data regarding the effect of HRT on anxiety states is lacking. In summary further study is warranted before evidence‐based conclusions can be drawn.

### Efficacy of estradiol for the treatment of depressive disorders in perimenopausal women… [^113ZnyM9]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

The use of estrogen replacement for the treatment of menopausal symptoms has been shown to enhance "psychological well-being. "%11 However, clinical studies using diverse forms of estrogen replacement for the treatment of depression produced mixed results. Three estrogen treatment studies in perimenopausal and newly postmenopausal women failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo for the treatment of mood symptoms. More recently, Schmidt and colleagues%18 described that perimenopausal women with major or minor depression with or without hot flushes experience greater relief of depressive symptoms with estrogen than with placebo. However, data confirming these preliminary findings are lacking, particularly in a larger group of perimenopausal women with major depression. Our results support these findings, as estradiol improved mood in subjects with depressive disorders.

Estradiol therapy was efficacious in treating depressive symptoms in a larger sample of women who met criteria for MDD — 67% of those receiving estradiol had full remission of depression. In addition, we were able to demonstrate the occurrence of continued mood improvement throughout the 12-week treatment phase. %1, 13 However, Schmidt and colleagues%18 demonstrated that estradiol reduces symptoms of depression in perimenopausal women who do not have hot flushes. This reinforces the concept that the effects of estrogen on mood and vasomotor symptoms may be independent. Recently, Bloch and colleagues%34 examined the effects of gonadal steroids in 16 euthymic women aged 22 to 45 years by simulating hormonal conditions related to pregnancy and parturition.

Women with a history of postpartum depression showed increased mood symptoms during the hypogonadal phase, produced by the administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. More important, the emergence of mood symptoms during the hormone withdrawal phase preceded the occurrence of hot flushes. Our findings also suggest independent effects of estrogen on mood and vasomotor symptoms. Specifically, we observed a sustained antidepressant benefit after discontinuation of estradiol treatment despite recrudescence of somatic symptoms. Seven of 10 patients who remained well after estradiol discontinuation reported reemergence of moderate-to-severe hot flushes.

### Effects of estradiol withdrawal on mood in women with past perimenopausal depression: a randomized clinical trial [^116YpdCH]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Perimenopause is accompanied by an increased risk of new and recurrent depression. The coincidence of declining ovarian function with the onset of depression led to the inference that "withdrawal" from physiologic estradiol levels underpinned depression in perimenopause. To our knowledge, this is the first controlled systematic study to directly test the estrogen withdrawal theory of perimenopausal depression (PMD).

Objective

To examine the role of estradiol withdrawal in PMD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Initial open-label treatment with estradiol followed by randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design evaluation of continued estradiol treatment was evaluated at an outpatient research facility at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. An intent-to-treat analysis was performed between October 2003 and July 2012. Participants included asymptomatic postmenopausal women with past PMD responsive to hormone therapy (n = 26) and asymptomatic postmenopausal women with no history of depression (n = 30) matched for age, body mass index, and reproductive status who served as controls. Data were analyzed between November 2012 and October 2013 by repeated-measures analysis of variance.

Interventions

After 3 weeks of open-label administration of transdermal estradiol (100 µg/d), participants were randomized to a parallel design to receive either estradiol (100 µg/d; 27 participants) or matched placebo skin patches (29 participants) for 3 additional weeks under double-blind conditions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (completed by raters blind to diagnosis and randomization status), self-administered visual analog symptom ratings, and blood hormone levels obtained at weekly clinic visits.

Results

None of the women reported depressive symptoms during open-label use of estradiol. Women with past PMD who were crossed over from estradiol to placebo experienced a significant increase in depression symptom severity demonstrated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, with mean (SD) scores increasing from estradiol (ie, 2.4 [2.0] and 3.0 [2.5]) to placebo (8.8 [4.9] and 6.6 [4.5], respectively [P = .0004 for both]). Women with past PMD who continued estradiol therapy and all women in the control group remained asymptomatic. Women in both groups had similar hot-flush severity and plasma estradiol levels during use of placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

In women with past PMD that was previously responsive to hormone therapy, the recurrence of depressive symptoms during blinded hormone withdrawal suggests that normal changes in ovarian estradiol secretion can trigger an abnormal behavioral state in these susceptible women. Women with a history of PMD should be alert to the risk of recurrent depression when discontinuing hormone therapy.

### Psychobiological factors of resilience and depression in late life [^115aULqW]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to altering cortisol secretion, sustained activation of the HPA axis results in deficient monoamine transmission, disruption of neurotrophic processes (e.g. the neuroprotective brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)), oxidative stress, widespread inflammatory processes, and neurodegeneration. Dysfunction in serotonergic and dopaminergic transmission contribute to the common mood and cognitive symptoms observed in depression. Once in motion, this stress-related biological cascade can be exacerbated by environmental factors (e.g. social isolation) or maladaptive coping behaviors (sedentary lifestyle, substance abuse).

Neuropeptides

Multiple neuropeptides are known to modulate emotional processing. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been proposed as an endogenous mediator of resilience to stress-related psychiatric illness, including depression. NPY plays a key role in the maintenance of homeostasis and has been implicated in diverse motivational, perceptual, and affective processes including circadian rhythm, anxiety, appetite, alcohol consumption, and pain perception. NPY receptors are densely expressed in brain regions relevant to mood disorders including the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Low NPY levels have been reported in MDD compared to healthy controls, and genetic variation associated with low NPY expression increases risk for MDD. Results of one study suggest that this effect may be mediated by increased neuronal response to affective stimuli in the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices among individuals with low-expression NPY genotypes.

Endocrine changes in aging and depression

One potential vulnerability for depression specific to older adults is age-associated decline in reproductive hormones. Perimenopause increases risk for both recurrent and new-onset depression. Loss of normal estradiol (the primary circulating estrogen) cycling is proposed to account for this increased vulnerability via effects on neurotransmitter and mood regulatory systems. Estrogen receptor polymorphisms have been associated with heightened depression risk in older women, and maintenance of normal estrogen levels is important for several brain regions vulnerable to age-related changes(e.g. the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus). Similarly, age-related reduction in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been linked to depression, cognitive decline, reduced immune function, and decreased physical health. Individuals with LLD demonstrate lower DHEA levels compared to non-depressed older adults, and DHEA levels increase with remission.

### Linear and inverted U-shaped dose-response functions describe estrogen effects on hippocampal activity in young women [^117SJUV9]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We identified different patterns in which hippocampal activity responded to E2 dose: we found an inverted U-shape in the medial posterior hippocampus but a monotonically increasing dose-response function across the full range of E2 levels in the lateral posterior hippocampus. While E2 did not modulate amygdala activity even at high levels, we observed an unpredicted monotonically decreasing relationship for activity associated with affective processing in the precuneus and for the functional coupling between precuneus and brainstem. Finally, activity in the insula exhibited an inverted U-shaped relationship with E2. Critically, the strictly data-driven analyses showed that the inflection point of the quadratic function in both the hippocampus and the insula were clearly above the physiological levels of E2 reached during the menstrual cycle. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that the effect of E2 on hippocampal neural activity follows an inverted U-shaped dose response curve only at supraphysiological levels but increases in E2 are beneficial within the levels experienced regularly during the menstrual cycle.

### Natural estrogen as an antidepressant for women [^1133dJgh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Recent well-controlled studies suggest that estrogen has antidepressant actions in perimenopausal women. Estrogen may also have antidepressant actions in postpartum women and across the life cycle for women who are resistant to treatment with various antidepressants. The question, however, of which depressed women to treat with antidepressants, which with estrogen, and which with both remains unanswered.

### To what extent do oral contraceptives influence mood and affect? [^1124A7XP]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Studies examining the effects of oral contraceptives (OCs) on mood, affect, and affect variability are reviewed.

Methods

MEDLINE and PsycLIT data bases were examined to identify studies that compared OC users with nonusers using daily ratings of mood, affect, or affect variability.

Results

Compared to non-users, OC users experience less variability in affect across the entire menstrual cycle, and less negative affect during menstruation (i.e. withdrawal bleeding). In women with OC-related negative mood and affect change, potential mediators of the relation between OCs and mood or affect were identified: a history of depression, psychiatric symptoms, dysmenorrhea, and premenstrual mood symptoms prior to OC use; a history of pregnancy-related mood symptoms; a family history of OC-related mood complaints; being in the postpartum period; and age. Furthermore, a lower ratio of progesterone to estrogen is associated with more negative mood change in women with a history of premenstrual emotional symptoms, higher progesterone to estrogen ratios are associated with increased negative mood effects in women without such a history, and monophasic OCs have a greater stabilizing effect on mood than triphasic OCs.

Limitations

The 'survivor effect', psychological factors, and indirect pharmacological effects (e.g. weight gain) have not yet been systematically investigated. Furthermore, most studies have examined only negative mood or affect, as opposed to both positive and negative affect and affect variability; and few affect studies have assessed potential mediators of OC-related affect change.

Conclusions

While the only consistent OC-related mood effects experienced by most women are beneficial, a subgroup of women do experience negative mood change. Future research must focus on expounding the individual difference and OC-related risk factors for negative mood change.

### Gene regulation by gonadal hormone receptors underlies brain sex differences [^112eUcUE]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Oestradiol establishes neural sex differences in many vertebrates – and modulates mood, behaviour and energy balance in adulthood –. In the canonical pathway, oestradiol exerts its effects through the transcription factor oestrogen receptor-α (ERα). Although ERα has been extensively characterized in breast cancer, the neuronal targets of ERα, and their involvement in brain sex differences, remain largely unknown. Here we generate a comprehensive map of genomic ERα-binding sites in a sexually dimorphic neural circuit that mediates social behaviours. We conclude that ERα orchestrates sexual differentiation of the mouse brain through two mechanisms: establishing two male-biased neuron types and activating a sustained male-biased gene expression program. Collectively, our findings reveal that sex differences in gene expression are defined by hormonal activation of neuronal steroid receptors. The molecular targets we identify may underlie the effects of oestradiol on brain development, behaviour and disease.

### Associations between testosterone and future PTSD symptoms among middle age and older UK residents [^111SCayo]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Several biological mechanisms for testosterone's impact on the HPA axis have been proposed in previous studies. Testosterone is believed to modulate the HPA axis either through direct actions at androgen receptors or via metabolism to other compounds that interact with androgen and estrogen receptors. Both testosterone and its metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT) have been shown to have anxiolytic effects via actions on the androgen receptor. The testosterone metabolite 3β-diol activates estrogen receptor beta (Erβ), which has an inhibitory effect on the HPA axis. In addition, testosterone can also be metabolized to estrogen, which can have both activating and inhibitory functions on the HPA axis. While androgens are capable of producing these HPA-activating effects through their metabolites, systemic testosterone is generally thought to overall reduce stress-induced HPA responses and increase negative feedback on the HPA axis. Testosterone may affect corticotropic releasing factor receptors, thereby influencing HPA axis functioning. Another mechanism through which higher testosterone could reduce HPA activation is through increasing the activity of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, potentially leading to inhibition of the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to CRH receptors.

The novel nonlinear relationship we observed between testosterone and PTSD symptoms in men and women may also be explained by indirect or competing influences of testosterone on the HPA axis and the brain. The HPA and hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axes are believed to have reciprocal effects on one another, and HPA dysregulation is believed to underlie PTSD and other psychiatric disorders, including depression. The "dual hormone" hypothesis suggests that the combined profile of testosterone and cortisol levels is what affects mood and behavior rather than each hormone individually. For example, there is some evidence that testosterone is related to aggressive disorders only in the presence of low cortisol, but studies to date have not supported a relationship between high testosterone and low cortisol in PTSD. Cortisol measures were not available in UK Biobank, so we could not explore the dual hormone effect in this study. Future studies further exploring this question should collect both testosterone and cortisol levels to differentiate the effects.

### Taking a fresh look at mood, hormones, and menopause [^113g9hXF]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Depression, with or without concomitant anxiety, is one of the most burdensome medical conditions worldwide. Depression affects women more often than men and may cause significant impairment. Reproductive phase-related windows of vulnerability for depression (new or recurrent) have been recognized, including the menopause transition. Midlife depression is likely influenced by both menopause- and nonmenopause-related factors. Antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy remain first-line treatment options for moderate to severe major depressive disorder at any time, with proven efficacy and tolerability in midlife women. Transdermal estradiol can also be part of the treatment armamentarium, but its use as a prophylaxis against midlife depressive symptoms, although promising, warrants further investigation.

### Association between MKP-1, BDNF, and gonadal hormones with depression on perimenopausal women [^112zWRTV]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Perimenopausal depression and BDNF

Studies in rats show that BDNF is involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders, and BDNF expression decreases after exposure to stress, including social-defeat stress. The infusion of BDNF into the hippocampus shows antidepressant effects. Studies in humans show decreased plasma levels of BDNF in bipolar disorder, mania, and depression. However, not all studies report differences in plasma BDNF levels between individuals with depression and controls. It may be the case that relationships between BDNF and depression are more complex, such as the involvement of gene×environment interactionsor the duration of the depression. The data in our study do not suggest an association between plasma BDNF levels and perimenopausal depression. However, we found that serum E 2 levels were significantly positively correlated with BDNF levels, which means that progressively reduced serum E 2 is associated with decreased BDNF serum quantity in the women. Studies suggest that BDNF mediates several of the effects of estrogen in the hippocampus and that these interactions play a role in the normal brain as well as in disease. In addition, increased endogenous BDNF signaling in the ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus of rats may mediate E 2 -induced inhibitory effect on feeding. In both mammalian and zebra finch systems, expression of BDNF protein can be modulated by E 2. Therefore we hypothesize that coregulation may exist between BDNF and E 2 and this relationship influences perimenopausal depression.

### Mental well-being in menopause [^1163ft8p]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The hormonal changes that accompany the transition to menopause are disruptive to most women, and for some, mental health maybe adversely affected. Depressive symptoms and major depression are the best-studied conditions in association with menopause, but anxiety, executive function, and comorbid pre-existing psychiatric conditions all influence the symptomatology that women will experience during this phase of their lives. The epidemiology, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatment guidelines for perimenopausal patients are discussed.

### Effects of combined estrogen and bazedoxifene (CEB) on depressive symptoms in perimenopause [^1138EUeX]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Perimenopause is characterized by ovarian hormone fluctuation and associated with elevated risk for depression. Perimenopausal-onset major depression (PO-MDD) can be alleviated with estrogen treatment. However, due to potential risk for breast and uterine cancer, traditional hormone treatments may not be suitable for some. Conjugated estrogen combined with the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) bazedoxifene (CEB) is a tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC) used to target hot flashes and postmenopausal osteoporosis. CEB's effect on mood during perimenopause remains understudied.

Methods

In this open-label pilot clinical trial, CEB was administered to perimenopausal women (N = 10) for three weeks with weekly symptom assessments and estradiol measurements. Mixed effects models were used to examine changes in affective and menopausal symptoms.

Results

Menopausal symptoms were significantly reduced over the course of treatment, and several depression symptom domains were also reduced (e.g., dysphoria, anhedonia, ill temper, insomnia; all p FDR s < 0.05).

Discussion

The current findings suggest that CEB reduces mood and menopausal symptoms without the concurrent risk profile of standard hormonal treatments. Further research is needed to understand potential links with estradiol variability and implications for the further development of treatments.

### Mood and menopause: findings from the study of women's health across the nation (SWAN) over 10 years [^112e3DX8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from depressive symptoms/disorder. Research has focused on physiologic and psychosocial differences between men and women; an important target of study has been periods of reproductive changes. Controversy has existed regarding the extent to which the menopausal transition or postmenopause increases the risk for depressive symptoms/disorders. This paper presents findings from analyses of data from the SWAN study and an ancillary study on mental health. We found that risk for high depressive symptoms and disorder is greater during and possibly after the menopausal transition. Other factors contribute to risk for depression.

### A population-based observational study using statistical modeling to assess the association between depressive symptom severity and sleep disorders in postmenopausal women [^113GsKni]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The observed dose–response relationship between depressive symptom severity and sleep disorders aligns with previous research indicating that greater depressive symptoms are associated with an increased likelihood of sleep disturbances. Prior studies have reported similar positive correlations, yet many have focused on broader populations or specific clinical groups rather than postmenopausal women, who may experience distinct physiological and psychological changes that exacerbate this relationship. Unlike some earlier research suggesting a potential threshold effect, where sleep disorder risk sharply rises beyond a certain depressive symptom severity, our findings demonstrated a consistent linear trend among postmenopausal women, reinforcing the notion that even mild depressive symptoms can contribute significantly to sleep disturbances in this specific population. This indicates that interventions targeting depressive symptom management in postmenopausal women may be beneficial even at lower levels of symptom severity, potentially preventing further sleep disruption and improving overall health outcomes.

In postmenopausal women, the association between depressive symptom severity and sleep disorders may be driven by two key biological pathways: hormonal dysregulation and neurotransmitter imbalance, both of which play a crucial role in mood regulation and sleep homeostasis. Postmenopause is characterized by a substantial decline in estrogen and progesterone levels, which can adversely impact both emotional stability and sleep regulation. Estrogen plays a key role in modulating serotonin and GABA pathways, both of which are essential for maintaining mood balance and sleep architecture. The reduction in estrogen levels has been linked to increased depressive symptoms and impaired sleep quality, manifesting as shortened sleep duration and frequent nocturnal awakenings. Additionally, progesterone, known for its sedative effects, declines sharply after menopause, contributing to prolonged sleep latency and difficulty maintaining sleep. These hormonal fluctuations may exacerbate depressive symptoms, which in turn further disrupt sleep patterns, creating a bidirectional cycle between depressive symptoms and sleep disorders. Beyond hormonal changes, neurotransmitter imbalances serve as another critical mechanism underlying this relationship. Depressive symptoms are strongly associated with dysfunctions in serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems, all of which play fundamental roles in both mood regulation and sleep–wake control. Serotonin deficiency, a well-established feature associated with depressive symptoms, is particularly relevant in postmenopausal women as it directly influences melatonin production, the key hormone regulating the circadian sleep–wake cycle. A decline in serotonin availability may not only intensify depressive symptoms but also lead to disruptions in sleep initiation and maintenance. Additionally, dopaminergic and noradrenergic dysregulation may contribute to hyperarousal states, further impairing sleep continuity and increasing the risk of chronic insomnia. Given that postmenopausal women already experience age-related declines in neurotransmitter function, these neurochemical alterations may compound the risk of bothdepressive symptoms and sleep disturbances in this population.

### Effects of hormonal contraceptives on mood: a focus on emotion recognition and reactivity, reward processing, and stress response [^115zhf5z]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary and Future Directions

In this review, we provide a summary of the most recent literature on HC-effects on women's mood, with a specific emphasis on some of the psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms that could underlie mood-related side effects of HCs, which have been reported to occur in subgroups of women. We have reviewed the influence of HCs on emotion and reward processing as well as stress responsivity. We conclude that most of the reported results have yet to be replicated, thus no clear consensus can be reached based on these relatively heterogeneous datasets. From a methodological point of view, it is challenging to draw conclusions from neuroimaging results, which are not always paralleled by behavioral outcomes, and vice versa. Moreover, many neurobiological mechanisms are still not well understood. Given these limitations, most of the reported results have to be interpreted with caution, as the evidence is observational in most studies, and therefore, we cannot infer causality.

### The underlying mechanisms of comorbid anxiety and depression among young women: evidence from brain structure and hormone [^112c1rft]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, studies measuring hormones have shown that decreased levels of ovarian steroid hormones (e.g. estrogen and progesterone) in women of childbearing age are closely related to the development of negative emotions. The decrease of estrogen and progesterone is accompanied by changes in the concentration and activity of neurotransmitters, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which can lead to negative emotions. However, further research suggests that the appropriate secretion and regulation of ovarian hormones can enhance neuroplasticity in brain regions such as the frontal lobe, ACC, and hippocampus, leading to alterations in brain structure and, consequently, helping to alleviate negative emotions in women. In other words, healthy hormone function can inhibit the occurrence of mood disorders by enhancing brain plasticity. Even so, current research consistently indicates that abnormal secretion of ovarian hormones is closely associated with the occurrence of depression in women, but its relationships with anxiety remain unclear: some studies have found that steroid hormones may help alleviate anxiety, while others suggest they may worsen it. Therefore, we speculate that, compared to healthy women, those with CAD have abnormal hormone levels associated with significant brain structural differences, whereas women with anxiety may not exhibit distinct brain structural changes. However, direct evidence linking hormone levels to brain structural changes in CAD patients is still lacking, and our study aims to bridge this gap by empirically examining the relationship between hormone levels and brain structural alterations in women with CAD and anxiety.

Therefore, three groups of young women, the anxiety group, the anxiety–depression comorbidity group, and the control group, were selected as the research objects in this study by analyzing the data of the brain structure and hormone. The study proposed the following hypothesis: (1) compared with the anxiety and control group, the volume of the SFG and the SPG decreased in the subjects with anxiety–depression comorbidity group; (2) compared with the anxiety and control group, the cortical thickness of the limbic system became thinner in the subjects with anxiety–depression comorbidity group; and (3) compared with the anxiety and control group, the levels of estrogen and progesterone in the subjects with anxiety–depression comorbidity group were lower, and the levels were significant related to the changes of GMV and thickness.

### Association between MKP-1, BDNF, and gonadal hormones with depression on perimenopausal women [^115VE8Zc]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ehave unequivocally supported the notion that women experience more psychiatric problems during their lives, particularly mood and anxiety symptoms, compared with men. For some women, the increased risk is associated with fluctuating ovarian hormone levels that occur during reproductive cycle events, particularly during the menopausal transition. Estrogens have a mood-enhancing effect in depression arising during the transitional phase of menopause. Recent data show that hormone therapy may prevent mood disorders or even serve as a treatment regimen for women with diagnosed mood disturbances via estrogen regulation. Although estrogen has greater effects on the behaviors and mood of women, androgens such as testosterone also have important effects. Women with major depressive disorder or certain types of anxiety disorder express lower levels of salivary testosterone compared with emotionally healthy women. In more senior men and women, lower levels of testosterone are associated with an increased prevalence of major depressive disorder. Clinical evidence also suggests that testosterone has anxiolytic and antidepressant benefits, with the potential to promote improved mood and mental health in both women and men. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the protective effects of estrogens and testosterone in females remain poorly understood.

### Daily estradiol and progesterone levels moderate genetic and environmental influences on emotional eating across 45 consecutive days in female twins [^1171iWNd]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We focused on single moderator models for estradiol and progesterone. Because estradiol and progesterone levels were significantly correlated in our sample (r 's = 0.48–0.62 across phase), we modeled the independent effects of each hormone by regressing out levels of the other hormone prior to analyses (e.g. regressed progesterone levels out of estradiol values for estrogen analyses). Ideally, we would have also fit double moderator, estradiol × progesterone models. However, our sample size prohibited us from fitting these models, as simulation studies suggest very large samples are needed for these models (Burt, Clark, Pearson, Klump, & Neiderhiser; Purcell). Moreover, we observed non-linear changes in etiologic effects in our models (see below), and double moderator models do not easily allow for these types of non-linear changes.

The above studies serve to show the difficulties in reaching firm conclusions when analysing data generated from studies which utilised a variety of different cognitive function assessment tools and in which there is a range of HRT regimes, ages, medical comorbidities and menopausal status of participants. Moreover, the healthy user bias, whereby women of generally better health are more likely to opt to start HRT, confounds observational studies. RCTs seek to overcome the limiting factors such as healthy user bias posed by observational studies. As exemplified above the findings from these are conflicting.

### Estrogen regulation of the nucleus accumbens as a gateway to understanding menopause associated metabolic dysfunction [^112PLF3m]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

The utterance of "menopause" conjures up a variety of negative connotations. Besides the societal stigmatism of being "old" and unable to reproduce, menopausal women face a myriad of health concerns that are precipitated by the dramatic reduction in circulating estrogen (E2) levels, as well as other hormonal fluctuations. Physiological, neurological, metabolic changes take place during this time, culminating in, not only increased risk of disease, but an overall reduction in quality of life. Mood changes likely include a diminished motivation to engage in physical activity, which exacerbates the already increased risk for obesity and keeps women from achieving sufficient levels of physical activity and its host of benefits that are particularly critical in this population (e.g. cognitive/mood enhancement, improved sleep, improved glucose metabolism, and other physical and mental health attributes). Particularly concerning is that the increased weight gain coincides with dysfunctional (i.e. that which is insulin resistant and inflammatory with suppressed mitochondrial activity) adipose tissue (AT), which is an important predictor of metabolic dysfunction. Comprehensive approaches to support the neurological and metabolic health of aging women are critically needed. Despite this need and the fact that women spend approximately 1/3 of their lives in a post-menopausal state, this topic has received insufficient attention. For decades, the "change" women underwent at this time was considered a taboo topic, yet shifting public awareness has finally spurred media attention, as evidenced by a recent article in Salon titled, " Gen X feels left in the dark with menopause due to a lack of research and support ". Other media resources, including the New York Times and Forbes, have also highlighted critical gaps in our knowledge and need for improved therapies to help menopausal women. These cries for improving the lives of aging women has resulted in the Biden White House health initiative to devote much needed research dollars to this topic The fate of this important research funding likely is in jeopardy with the new Administration, and yet, it is more important than ever to understand how to improve the lives of menopausal women.

### Tailoring strategies for the management of depression in midlife years [^113TMzfF]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Depression affects one in every five adults in North America. Women are more affected than men, possibly because of genetics, coping strategies, and hormone variations. The concept of a menopause-associated depression, however, remains a complex and controversial topic. Although hormone therapy is not recommended as first-line therapy for depression in midlife women, estrogen-based hormone therapy may minimize the need for or enhance the response to antidepressant or behavior-based therapies in select perimenopausal women.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^111pUBBb]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Robust epidemiologic evidence supports the existence of a 'window of vulnerability' for the occurrence of depression (new onset or recurrent) during the menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years. Similar to that observed in other periods in life, antidepressants and psychotherapies continue to be the treatments of choice for depression occurring in midlife women. Nonetheless, accumulated preclinical and clinical data support the benefits of estrogen-based therapies to improve mood and other menopause-related symptoms during this critical window. As such, estrogen should be considered part of the treatment armamentarium for depression, along with other well established benefits (for example, for vasomotor, sexual and other menopause-related complaints). Lastly, the use of specific screening and diagnostic tools for depression in women should help physicians and health professionals to improve early detection and clinical management. Ultimately, treatment strategies should be tailored and incorporate all the resources available to reduce the significant burden and functional impairment associated with depression in women undergoing menopause.

To summarise the available data regarding the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on cognition and mood in women.

Background

Complaints of impaired cognition and mood are common in the peri-menopausal and menopausal period. There is debate as to whether HRT can ameliorate this phenomenon.

Design

A literature search of studies using electronic databases was conducted. Both randomised control trials and observational studies were included.

Patients

Perimenopausal and menopausal women.

Results

Due to the heterogenicity of results it is challenging to draw firm conclusions. The preparations used in many of the studies are older regimes no longer routinely used clinically. The notion of a 'critical window' for HRT is compelling, suggesting HRT has a positive impact on cognition when administered in the peri-menopausal or early postmenopausal period but may have negative effects on cognition in the older, postmenopausal woman. The evidence would seem to suggest importance of hormonal replacement in woman undergoing a surgical menopause, especially when young. It remains unclear for how long they ought to continue HRT though until at least the natural age of the menopause seems reasonable. Evidence for a positive effect of HRT on mood is more convincing, though possibly more efficacious in the younger age group. The effect of HRT on anxiety is less clear.

Conclusions

Further study, particularly focusing on the more contemporaneous HRT preparations, is warranted before evidence-based conclusions can be drawn.

### The effect of exogenous estrogen on depressive mood in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1144bZ8s]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Sex differences exist in the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD). Comparing with males, females are at a higher risk of depression, especially in some reproductive statuses with significant changes in sex hormones. Based on the positive effect on menopausal symptoms in human and on depression-like behaviors in animals, exogenous estrogen was considered as a potential therapeutic approach to the treatment of female depression, however, with inconsistent conclusions in previous studies. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, 14 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included to investigate the effect of exogenous estrogen on depressive mood in women. The results indicated that exogenous estrogens were superior to the control group either alone or in combination with progesterone or antidepressants. Female individuals in perimenopause are more sensitive to estrogen than those in other reproductive statuses, which might be the reason that depressive mood during this stage is more associated with estrogen fluctuations, and exogenous estrogen supplementation can moderate these drastic changes. The finding of meta-regressions that the effect of exogenous estrogen was associated with age in perimenopause and post-menopause rather than the dose or administration of exogenous estrogen, showed again that a stable level of estrogen is more beneficial than a high serum level. This study provides strong evidence of the important role of estrogen fluctuations but not estrogen levels in female depression.

### Pilot validation of blood-based biomarkers during pregnancy and postpartum in women with prior or current depression [^113v9Acr]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Estrogen and progesterone regulate the expression of the mPR genes; E2 can regulate the expression of mPRβ both in the periphery and in the brain, while P4 can do that only in the brain. Progesterone synthesis in the brain is induced by E2 from gonadal origin, and thus it is feasible that gonadal E2 is necessary, but not sufficient, in the regulation of mood for P4 effects on depressive symptoms via mPRβ. When E2 and P4 levels are high, such as during pregnancy, expressions of biomarkers correlated positively with mPRβ in parallel with ESR2. When levels of both these hormones are low, such as postpartum, mPRβ levels are decreased in the blood, and expressions of most of the biomarkers correlated with mPRβ and not ESR2 in postpartum samples. Decreased E2 of gonadal origin would also decrease the synthesis of P4 in the brain. This is significant, since through its neuroactive metabolite, allopregnanolone, P4 modulates the responsiveness to GABAa receptors, which may contribute directly to the etiology of MDD. Furthermore, a recent study shows a significant association between low levels of allopregnanolone and the development of postpartum depression in women with a history of mood disorders. Should decreased mPRβ levels in the periphery and their correlation with the blood markers be an indication of the role of lower brain P4 levels in postpartum will need to be explored in the future.

Limitations of this pilot study include the small sample size, and the lack of matching subjects with others having no prior or present history of MDD. Another limitation includes lack of data from patients with other psychiatric disorders, and no change in transcript levels were assignable to administration of medication. However, these data suggest that this panel of blood-based biomarkers are associated with concurrent depression symptoms in pregnant women. The study also suggests a relationship between transcript levels of a panel of depression-associated biomarkers and estrogen-dependent and independent expression of membrane progesterone receptors, which relationship differs between pregnant and postpartum samples. This latter finding offers a novel understanding of the specific vulnerability of women to depression at times of major hormonal changes.

### Sex steroid hormones and brain function: PET imaging as a tool for research [^113ScwAR]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

2 SEX STEROID HORMONES AND BRAIN FUNCTION

Oestrogens can exert their effects through either intracellular or membrane‐associated oestrogen receptors (ERs); in particular, the intracellular receptors ERα and ERβ, and membrane‐associated G‐protein regulator motifs. Upon binding of oestrogen to the ER, the ligand‐receptor complex dimerises and migrates to the nucleus, where the dimer can bind to hormone response elements (HRE) in the promotor region of oestrogen‐responsive genes. Activation of the HRE leads to the induction or the repression of gene transcription. In addition to this genomic signalling pathway, sex steroids can act via nongenomic signalling (Figure 1 B) (for a review, see Kawata et al 17). Oestrogen signalling can affect various aspects of brain function and behaviour. Most information about the relationship between oestrogens and brain disorders was obtained from studies in female animals or women demonstrating behavioural differences between the different stages of the menstrual cycle. There is ample evidence for a role of oestrogens in anxiety and depression, both from animals and humans. 18 Women are vulnerable to depression when the concentration of sex hormones changes markedly. This can lead to pre‐menstrual dysphoric disorder, post‐partum depression and perimenopausal or postmenopausal depression. 19 Oestrogens have antidepressant effects when they are administered either alone or in combination with antidepressants 20, 21 and, consequently, oestrogen replacement therapy can be used to prevent the development of depression in individuals who are at risk. 22 Oestrogens can also have neuroprotective effects. High levels of circulating oestrogens are associated with less ischaemia‐induced brain injury. 23 A similar effect is also observed when high levels of endogenous oestrogens are synthesised in the brain. 24 Oestrogens were found to play a role in neuronal plasticity and spine synapse formation. 25, 26 Furthermore, many studies have shown positive effects of oestrogens on cognition. 27, 28, 29 In Alzheimer's disease, oestrogens have been shown to protect neurones against the toxicity of amyloid plaques. 30 Nevertheless, more studies are necessary 31 because investigators from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study found that therapy with a combination of oestrogen and progestin increased the risk for dementia in postmenopausal women and did not improve their performance in mild cognitive tasks. 32 For this reason, the contribution of oestrogens and the molecular dynamics of their interaction with other hormones and neurotransmitters should be determined to obtain a better understanding of the role of these steroids in brain function and neuroprotection.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^114JTKhf]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

There is little doubt that women experience a heightened psychiatric morbidity compared to men. A growing body of evidence suggests that, for some women, the menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years may represent a period of vulnerability associated with an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of depression, or for the development of an episode of major depressive disorder. Recent research has begun to shed some light on potential mechanisms that influence this vulnerability. At the same time, a number of studies and clinical trials conducted over the past decade have provided important data regarding efficacy and safety of preventative measures and treatment strategies for midlife women; some of these studies have caused a shift in the current thinking of how menopausal symptoms should be appropriately managed. Essentially, most women will progress from premenopausal into postmenopausal years without developing significant depressive symptoms. However, those with prior history of depression may face a re-emergence of depression during this transition while others may experience a first episode of depression in their lives. Here I provide an overview of what is known about risk factors for depression and the risk posed by the menopausal transition, its associated symptoms, and the underlying changes in the reproductive hormonal milieu, discussing the evidence for the occurrence of mood symptoms in midlife women and the challenges that face clinicians and health professionals who care for this population.

### Hormone therapy and mood in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a narrative review [^116UaJn6]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Between 15% and 50% of women experience depressive symptoms during the menopausal transition; in 15% to 30% of perimenopausal women, they are severe enough to be regarded as a depressive disorder. Fluctuations in gonadal hormone levels are thought to contribute to these depressive conditions. Hormone therapy is commonly used to alleviate climacteric symptoms, but its effects on mood are less clear. We narratively reviewed the literature on the effects of different types of hormone therapy on mood.

Methods

Using PubMed/Medline, we searched for studies of hormone therapy in relation to depressive symptoms and disorders in perimenopause and postmenopause.

Results

A number of studies consistently reported estrogen therapy to be effective in improving mood in perimenopausal women. However, its efficacy for overt depression or during postmenopause was more questionable. The progestogenic component in combined hormone therapy was found to potentially counteract the beneficial influence of estrogens on mood and to even induce negative mood symptoms. In specifically focused studies, a combination of hormone therapy and antidepressants was effective in depressed perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Conclusions

Hormone therapy may contribute to alleviating menopause-related depressive symptoms. Its administration should be followed across time and should be specifically individualized. In cases of more severe depressive conditions, a combination of antidepressant and hormone therapy should be considered.

### The role of physical activity in the link between menopausal status and mental well-being [^113LrPMQ]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Some studies highlight that women are more susceptible to the development of depression in the late perimenopausal stage than in the pre or postmenopausal stages. - However, when menopausal status was closely monitored employing FSH measures, the late peri and early postmenopausal women showed a similar risk for developing depression relative to the premenopausal level. The fact that the postmenopausal status of our participants was established over a 6-month period may explain the peak observed in depressive symptoms in the postmenopausal group, as these women were in a relatively early postmenopausal stage. The nonsignificant difference between the pre and late postmenopausal women in depressive symptoms is, however, somewhat unexpected. It may be due to high variability in depressive symptoms in this group and/or to difficulties in establishing temporal continuity of a rate of depressive symptoms and changes in reproductive function due to the use of a cross-sectional design.

When we added menopausal symptoms to the regression models, the association between menopausal status and depressive symptoms remained only in the postmenopausal group. A similar observation has been made previously. Closer scrutiny of a specific group of symptoms (eg, vasomotor symptoms, somatic or pain symptoms, psychological symptoms, and urogenital symptoms) yielded similar results. This suggests that the association between depressive symptoms and menopausal status may partially be explained by menopausal symptoms: that is, experienced menopausal symptoms may act as a mediator between a fall in estrogen levels and depressive symptoms. However, given that the fall in estrogen extends beyond menopause, it remains unclear whether estrogen deficiency is a primary cause of the elevation in depressive symptoms, as longitudinal studies have reported that depressive symptoms and negative mood return to premenopausal levels in postmenopause.

In contrast to negative mental well-being (eg, depressive symptoms), which fluctuated across the menopausal status groups, positive mental well-being was maintained across the studied groups. Positive well-being is related to multiple outcomes such as employment and family life, and also health and longevity. Thus, positive mental well-being can be viewed as a resource that compensates for an increase in negative well-being.

Physical activity promotes higher quality of life both in middle-aged womenand during menopause. Studies have reported a positive role of physical activity in decreasing anxiety and depression among menopausal women. Our previous study with the present cohortsuggests further that physical activity attenuates the menopause-related decline in physical fitness, which, theoretically, may be linked to improvements in mental well-being.

### Mood sensitivity to estradiol predicts depressive symptoms in the menopause transition [^114Fvnsz]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk for depression markedly rises during the 5–6 years leading up to the cessation of menstruation, known as the menopause transition. Exposure to extreme estradiol levels may help explain this increase but few studies have examined individual sensitivity to estradiol in predicting perimenopausal depression.

Method

The current study recruited 101 perimenopausal women. During Phase 1, we quantified each woman's sensitivity to changes in estradiol using 12 weekly measures of estrone-3-glucuronide (E1G), a urinary metabolite of estradiol, and concurrent depressive symptoms. The weekly cortisol awakening response was measured to examine the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in mediating mood sensitivity to estradiol. In Phase 2, depressive symptoms and major depression diagnoses were assessed monthly for 9 months. The relationship between Phase 1 E1G sensitivity and Phase 2 depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes was examined. Several baseline characteristics were examined as potential moderators of this relationship.

Results

The within-person correlation between weekly E1G and mood varied greatly from woman to woman, both in strength and direction. Phase 1 E1G mood sensitivity predicted the occurrence of clinically significant depressive symptoms in Phase 2 among certain subsets of women: those without a prior history of depression, reporting a low number of baseline stressful life events, and reporting fewer months since their last menstrual period. HPA axis sensitivity to estradiol fluctuation did not predict Phase 2 outcomes.

Conclusion

Mood sensitivity to estradiol predicts risk for perimenopausal depression, particularly among women who are otherwise at low risk and among those who are early in the transition.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^113jVmjL]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence from clinical trials supports the concept of a window of opportunity for hormonal treatment strategies in midlife women, not only for cardiovascular diseases but also, as further discussed, for menopause-associated depression. An age-stratified analysis of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data revealed that several of the adverse events initially associated with menopausal hormone therapies (MHTs) in the entire study population were not evident in the subgroup of younger, postmenopausal women (between 50 and 59 years of age) or among those women who had recently transitioned into menopause. In fact, there seemed to be a cardioprotective effect of MHT (particularly estrogen based) when hormone therapies were administered to women within 10 years of the final menstrual period, possibly because of the fewer preexisting coronary conditions in this subgroup. Further studies are needed to explore the risks and benefits of hormone therapies in younger, symptomatic women. Large-scale clinical studies such as Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estrogen (ELITE; NCT00114517) and Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS; NCT00154180) should be instrumental for the evaluation of 'critical timing' for the use of hormone strategies from a cardiovascular and a cognitive perspective.

Antidepressant agents and psychotherapeutic treatments are widely accepted as first-line treatments for depression across the life span. Indeed, several trials have documented the efficacy of psychotropic medications for the alleviation of mood and other menopause-related symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Despite that, preclinical and clinical evidence supports a possible window of opportunity for hormonal treatments to manage depressive episodes associated with the menopausal transition; after all, estrogen can, in many ways, modulate systems that are critical for mood and behavior regulation, particularly through pathways involving monoaminergic neurotransmission (serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE)).

Estradiol (E2) administration decreases the activity of monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B), which are enzymes involved in 5-HT degradation; E2 administration also increases both isoforms of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme of serotonin synthesis, resulting in an overall increase in 5-HT synthesis and availability. Furthermore, by downregulating 5HT 1a autoreceptors and upregulating 5HT 2a receptors, E2 increases the amount of serotonin found in the synapse and increases the amount available for postsynaptic transmission. Similarly, estrogens increase NE availability by decreasing expression of MAOs and increasing the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway of catecholamine.

### Association between perimenopausal age and greater posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms in trauma-exposed women [^111WWGEo]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The current cross-sectional study found that menopausal status based on age was significantly associated with total PTSD symptom severity; PTSD symptom severity for the hyperarousal, avoidance/numbing, and intrusive symptom clusters; and depression symptom severity. Critically, within our large sample of trauma-exposed, predominantly African American women, perimenopausal women reported greater severity of total PTSD symptoms, greater severity within the hyperarousal PTSD symptom cluster, and elevated depression symptoms compared with both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. However, the results were not completely in line with our hypothesis, as postmenopausal women reported fewer PTSD and depression symptoms than both premenopausal and perimenopausal women. As Brinton and colleaguesassert, perimenopause is a neurological, not merely a reproductive, transition state. The link between the menopause transition and mood symptoms has been gaining more attention in biomedical and psychiatric research, as perimenopause is characterized by not only changes in menstrual cycle patterns but also vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot flashes, sweating), fatigue, urinary and sexual discomfort, sleep patterns, and mood symptoms. For example, vasomotor symptoms and sleep disturbances appear to be driven by the effects of peripheral E2 variability and withdrawal, as the hypothalamus, critical for thermoregulation and the regulation of sleep, is sensitive to the variability in E2 levels because of a high concentration of estrogen receptors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest that perimenopausal age may represent a period of elevated risk for PTSD symptomology.

Perimenopausal women report higher rates of psychological distressand are more likely to endorse persistent mood symptomsand more depression symptoms. Changes in hormone levels during perimenopause, specifically the variability in E2 and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, are associated with greater risk for the onset of depressive symptoms, even among women with no prior history of depression. Our findings of more severe depressive symptoms in the perimenopausal group compared with premenopausal and postmenopausal women in a trauma-exposed sample are in line with this overall pattern. Furthermore, trauma exposure has been previously linked to mood symptoms in older women: women with a history of physical abuse reported worse general well-being, worse psychological menopause symptoms, and greater depression symptoms during midlife. Again, it appears that the hallmark hormonal change during perimenopause — increased variability in E2 levels — is strongly related to the emergence of depressive symptoms and new diagnoses of depressive disorders.

### Hormone replacement therapy in the treatment of perimenopausal depression [^113TuuY5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

The menopause transition is associated with a two to fourfold increased risk in major depressive disorder (MDD) and clinical elevations in depressive symptoms. While the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this increased risk remain uncertain, ovarian hormone fluctuation is believed to play a role. To the extent that this is the case, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), through its hormone-stabilizing effects, represents a viable antidepressant treatment. The current review summarizes the most recent literature evaluating the efficacy of HRT in treating MDD in peri- and postmenopausal women. In addition, to provide a clinical context in which to interpret this research, the endocrinology and clinical phenomenology related to depression with onset in the menopause transition (D-MT) are discussed. The available evidence suggests that HRT, specifically involving estrogen delivered through a skin patch, is a promising intervention in the treatment of D-MT. However, HRT of any form is an ineffective antidepressant in women who are well into the postmenopausal period.

### Menopause and mood: the role of estrogen in midlife depression and beyond [^116VH8oN]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Depression is a disabling condition that often leads to significant burden. Women are more vulnerable to depression during reproductive-related "windows of vulnerability" such as the menopause transition and early postmenopausal years. This heightened vulnerability can be attributed, at least in part, to the neuromodulatory effects of estrogen on mood and cognition and the exposure to rapid fluctuations of estradiol levels during midlife years. The management of midlife depression can be challenging due to the presence and severity of other complaints such as vasomotor symptoms and sleep disturbances. Psychopharmacologic, behavioral, and hormonal interventions should be part of the treatment armamentarium.

### Linear and inverted U-shaped dose-response functions describe estrogen effects on hippocampal activity in young women [^111Wx7qp]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

E2 appears to modulate affective processing, as is suggested by the positive correlation between E2 dose and subjective arousal ratings for neutral pictures. The absence of a significant correlation with negative pictures is likely related to ceiling effects, since negative pictures elicited high arousal ratings even at baseline E2 levels. The increase of arousal for neutral stimuli with increased E2 levels might be caused by a more pronounced induction of negative mood in response to the negative pictures with higher E2 levels, consistent with our supplementary analyses and with animal data showing an increase of depression-like behavior and anxiety at higher E2 levels.

Amygdala activity associated with emotional processing was surprisingly not modulated by E2 despite the robust task-elicited activity in the amygdala. Given the well-controlled increase in this highly estrogen-sensitive sample across a wide range of E2 levels, the absence of such an effect could suggest that the previously reported variation of amygdala activity across the menstrual cycle should be attributed instead to progesterone. The discrepancy between the current study and the established effects of E2 on amygdala functions in animals, is likely caused by the different tasks used that rely on different amygdala nuclei. For instance, fear extinction learning, which is widely used in animal research, is modulated by E2 via the central amygdalawhile the effect of emotional arousal on episodic memory formation implicates the basolateral amygdala. Therefore, our data are consistent with the neuroanatomically specific effects of E2 on different nuclei of the amygdala.

Neuronal activity linked to emotional processing was monotonically lowered by E2 in the posterior precuneus and E2 decreased the connectivity between precuneus and a cluster in the brainstem. Animal research has not focused on the cellular actions of E2 in these two areas, although they express ERs, so we had no predictions on how E2 would modulate these areas during affective processing. However, such a modulation is coherent with previous studies in humans. Both areas have been implicated in affective processing, among other processes, and are anatomically as well as functionally connected. Activity in these regions is known to be modulated by the menstrual cycle or HRT. The monotonically decreasing dose-response function might suggest a lower ERα/ERβ-ratio than in the hippocampus. The observation that subjectively reported emotional arousal increased is consistent with the precuneus having a down-regulating role during affective processing.

### Estrogen receptors: therapies targeted to receptor subtypes [^111JAoWT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, we have learned that estrogens play important physiological roles not only in women but also in men and that the biological effects of estrogen are mediated by not one but two distinct estrogen receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ. Our appreciation of the physiological importance of estrogen and the mechanisms by which it acts has significantly increased over the years; however, we are only now beginning to decipher the roles of ERα and ERβ in different organs and to elucidate how selective ligands, acting through either of the two ERs, can prevent or treat various age- or sex-specific diseases. The specific roles of ERα and ERβ and the therapeutic potential of ER subtype-selective agonists in bone and metabolic homeostasis, depression, vasomotor symptoms, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer are reviewed herein. It must be stated, however, that appropriate clinical studies are necessary to validate these compounds as agents for the prevention and treatment of diseases.

### A review of estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) polymorphisms, mood, and cognition [^114tJzAT]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

There are significant individual differences in the extent to which mood and cognition change as a function of reproductive stage, menstrual phase, postpartum, and hormone therapy use. This review explores the extent to which variations or polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) predict cognitive and mood outcomes.

Methods

A literature search was conducted from 1995 to November 2009 through PubMed, Embase, and PsychINFO. Twenty-five manuscripts that summarize investigations of ESR1 in mental health were reviewed.

Results

Among studies investigating ESR1 in relation to cognition, 11 of 14 case-control studies reported an association between ESR1 polymorphisms and risk for developing dementia. Three of four prospective cohort studies reported an association between ESR1 polymorphisms and significant cognitive decline. There are inconsistencies between case-control and cohort studies regarding whether specific ESR1 alleles increase or decrease the risk for cognitive dysfunction. The relationships between ESR1 and cognitive impairment tend to be specific to or driven by women and restricted to risk for Alzheimer disease rather than other dementia causes. Three of five studies examining ESR1 polymorphisms in relation to anxiety or depressive symptoms found significant associations. Significant associations have also been reported between ESR1 polymorphisms and childhood-onset mood disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

Conclusions

A strong relationship between ESR1 variants and cognitive outcomes is evident, and preliminary evidence suggests a role of the ESR1 gene in certain mood outcomes. Insights into the discordant results will come from future studies that include haplotype analyses, analyses within specific ethnic/racial populations, and sex-stratified analyses.

### "Not feeling like myself" in perimenopause-what does it mean? Observations from the women living better survey [^115Mh5hN]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Volatile mood symptom group

Volatile mood symptoms (irritability, sudden mood changes or mood swings, and feelings of sudden anger or rage) are also indicators of emotional arousal. Each of these was significantly related to NFLM in the analyses presented here. de Wit et alfound that, whereas irritability has usually been associated with depression during perimenopause, irritability was linked to different patterns of changes in estrogen levels compared with estrogen levels in depression, and this suggests that irritability may be a standalone symptom for some women in perimenopause. Expression of sudden anger, a part of the volatile symptom mood group, is less socially acceptable for women and, in general, poorly tolerated. In our prior analyses, volatile mood symptoms were significantly related to interference with activities of daily living and relationships and to women's negative ratings of their health. Taken together, these symptoms may contribute to a woman's feeling of a loss of control over her expression of emotions, interfering in her in everyday life and leaving her feeling "not like herself".

Brain fog symptom group

Reports of brain fog at midlife were documented by Mitchell and Woods, but relationships to hormonal changes associated with perimenopause have not yet been established. In both the POAS cohortand the SWAN cohort, verbal memory changes were associated with reproductive stage but not linked specifically to hormonal changes. The suggested link between changing estrogen levels and cognition is supported by studies in which the ovaries are removed or suppressed. - In our previous work, forgetfulness was the most frequently reported symptom by those in the LRS, before notable menstrual irregularity, as well as after, during the MT. It was also the most bothersome for both the LRS and MT groups. A visitor to the WLB site made this comment about brain fog: "Brain fog seems to be extreme for me. I normally forget little and stay very organized, but I'm not myself anymore. This is extremely frustrating and very concerning. I'm a professional and feel like I've been compromised". This quote links cognitive changes to "not feeling like myself". As with anxiety/vigilance and volatile mood symptoms, brain fog symptoms are frequently not expected and generally not known to be linked to the MT, so when women experience forgetfulness, a harder time concentrating, or more difficulty making decisions, it may feel unfamiliar and unsettling.

### The kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS): what have we learned? [^116baQMn]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

GENERAL EFFECTS OF HT ON POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN IN KEEPS

Cognitive function and mood

Before the publication of results from the WHI ancillary Memory Study (WHIMS), there was conflicting but generally favorable evidence regarding effects of HT on cognitive function and risk of Alzheimer's disease. The WIHMS was a substudy restricted to women in the WHI who initiated therapy at greater than 65 years of age. The initial report from WHIMS found that HT increased the risk for dementia and was most pronounced for therapies using MPA in addition to o-CEE. The end conclusions were based on a small number of participants and raised many concerns regarding the experimental design. These observations influenced the design of the KEEPS cognitive and affective substudy (KEEPS Cog), which was based on the underlying hypothesis of a "critical period" in which initiation of HT in the early postmenopausal phase might benefit or protect brain health. Furthermore, questions remained after WHIMS regarding the influence of the type of estrogen and the use of synthetic progestogens on cognition. Therefore, the basic design of KEEPS that enrolled women within 3 years of menopause, with the inclusion of both o-CEE and t-E 2, with the use of natural and cyclic progesterone, provided an ideal background to examine HT effects on cognition. KEEPS Cog was funded by National Institutes of Health and was open to all KEEPS participants. A set of 19 cognitive measures (many of which were included in WHIMS) were selected to examine intelligence, verbal learning and memory, language and mental flexibility, attention and executive function, working memory, and mood. The tests were administered at four time points: baseline and 18, 36, and 48 months after randomization. The 36-month visit was to be conducted within days 6 to 12 during the administration of progesterone.

### Sexual effects of androgens in women: some theoretical considerations [^114m9c2S]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To consider explanations for the inconsistent evidence concerning behavioral effects of androgens in women. The following possible explanatory mechanisms are explored: [1] Women vary in their behavioral responsiveness to T. [2] Some reported effects of exogenous T may be induced by increasing bioavailable estrogen. [3] Sexual effects of T may be secondary to direct effects on mood. [4] The relationship between T and sexuality is readily obscured by psychological mechanisms. [5] Stress-induced increases in adrenal androgens may further confuse the picture. [6] Women who respond to T respond to levels that are ineffective in men. There is no evidence of a threshold in women above which further increases in T have no additional effect.

Conclusion(S)

A theoretical model, involving desensitization of the central nervous system to T during early development in the male, is presented as a possible explanation for some of these relevant differences between men and women and for much of the conflicting evidence in the literature on women.

### Hormones and mood: from menarche to menopause and beyond [^111Pnjg3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

The lifetime prevalence of mood disorders in women is approximately twice that of men. The underlying causality of this gender difference is not yet understood. There is increasing scientific attention to the modulation of the neuroendocrine system by fluctuating gonadal hormones. This review attempts to summarize our current state of knowledge on the role and potential relevance of estrogen and other sex steroids to psychiatric disorders specific to women from menarche to menopause. The sudden appearance of higher levels of estrogen in puberty alters the sensitivity of the neurotransmitter systems. Moreover, the constant flux of estrogen and progesterone levels throughout the reproductive years portends constant modification of the neurotransmitter systems. Premenstrual syndromes may be the result of an altered activity or sensitivity of certain neurotransmitter systems. Pregnancy and delivery produce dramatic changes in estrogen and progesterone levels as well as significant suppression along the HPA axis, possibly increasing vulnerability to depression. At menopause, estrogen levels decline while pituitary LH and FSH levels increase. The loss of modulating effects of estrogen and progesterone may underlie the development of perimenopausal mood disorders in vulnerable women. The pattern of neuroendocrine events related to female reproduction is vulnerable to change and is sensitive to psychosocial, environmental, and physiological factors. Further research is needed to be able to identify specific genetic markers which might help us better understand how the balance between estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and other steroid hormones affect neurotransmitter function.

### Differential effects of estradiol on neural and emotional stress response in postmenopausal women with remitted major depressive disorder [^1127oHcq]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Estrogen fluctuations throughout the lifespan may contribute to major depressive disorder (MDD) risk in women through effects on brain networks important in stress responding, and mood regulation. Although there is evidence to support ovarian hormone treatment for peri-menopausal depression, postmenopausal use has not been well examined. The objective of this study was to investigate whether estrogen modulation of the neural and emotional cognitive responses to stress differs between postmenopausal women with and without MDD history.

Methods

60 postmenopausal women completed an fMRI psychosocial stress task, after receiving no drug or 3 months of daily estradiol (E2). fMRI activity and subjective mood response were examined.

Results

In women without a history of MDD, E2 was associated with a more negative mood response to stress and less activity in emotional regulation regions. In women with a history of MDD, E2 was associated with a less negative mood response to stress and less activity in emotion perception regions.

Limitations

This study was limited by open-label estradiol administration and inclusion of participants using antidepressants.

Conclusions

These results support a differential effect of estrogen on emotional and neural responses to psychosocial stress in postmenopausal women with MDD history and may reflect a shift in brain activity patterns related to emotion processing following menopause.

### The effect of hormone replacement therapy on cognition and mood [^113Q9Wm2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

3.1 Depression

The 2015 NICE guidance to consider HRT for the treatment of low mood in association with the menopause was derived from several RCTs carried out between 1977 and 2014. These studies utilised a variety of mood assessment tools (Table 2). In addition to these RCTs there are further contemporaneous studies that demonstrate a positive correlation between improvement in mood and use of HRT. Two such studies, included in the revised NICE guidance are those conducted by Gleason et al.and Gordon et al. Gleason at al.randomly allocated women aged between 40 and 60 to three groups: oral CEE only, transdermal 17β‐E2 + micro‐P group or placebo (n = 693, follow up over 4 years). They found that the active treatment groups displayed significantly higher mood scores in comparison with placebo. Gordon et al.compared the effect of transdermal E2 + cyclical micro‐P versus placebo over a 12‐month period in euthymic patients aged 45–60 (n = 172). There was a significantly lower incidence of developing depression in the treatment arm compared with placebo. Furthermore, in 2016, Raz et al.observed a possible association between oestrogen and progesterone levels and platelet content of serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) which in turn is a key determinant of the psychological state of mind (n = 79). The mean platelet content of 5‐HT was used as a surrogate marker for the synthesis and nervous system procurement of 5‐HT. This was measured via enzyme‐linked immunoassay (ELISA). Women were randomised to either oral CEE, transdermal E2 or placebo for a period of 48 months (n = 79). Mood was assessed using the POMS questionnaire. Mean platelet content of 5‐HT showed an enhancement by 84.5%, and 107% in the CEE group and E2 group, respectively. This compared to only an 8.8% rise in the placebo group. An improvement in mood was observed in both the CEE and transdermal E2 groups compared to placebo. Another such study was carried out by Rudolph et al.which randomly allocated women aged 48–65‐year‐old to E2 + dienogest versus placebo (n = 129). The E2 + Dienogest group showed a significant improvement in mood in comparison with the placebo group.

### Hormonal changes in menopause and implications on sexual health [^1161Mrx6]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

The menopause is characterized by an array of changes to the female body caused by modulations which occur in the production of estrogens and androgens. The ovaries are important sites of testosterone production in the peri- and postmenopausal women, but the contribution of testosterone pro-hormones from the adrenal glands falls precipitously to the extent where the ovaries cannot correct the deficit. This results in a net decline in circulating testosterone levels.

Aims

This paper gives an overview of this interesting subject area. Researchers have cogitated on the relationship between the physical effects of the menopause and the observed declines in testosterone levels, but it is now much clearer that falling testosterone levels cannot explain all of these changes.

Main Outcome Measures

The cessation of follicular functioning results in a steep decline in the production of estrogens. This modulation is responsible for the physical manifestations of the menopause — hot flushes, sleep disturbances, mood changes, bleeding problems, local urogenital problems, vaginal changes, etc.

Methods

A review of the pertinent literature was conducted to investigate hormonal changes around the menopause. A précis of the salient information is presented here.

Results

Although the most obvious and well-known effects of the menopause are due to the decline of estrogen levels, the effects of falling testosterone levels are subtle, but by no means less significant. Reductions in sexual motivation, sexual arousal, vaginal lubrication, etc. are all associated with plummeting androgen levels.

Conclusions

Today, several options exist for the treatment of the endocrinological changes associated with the menopause. Estrogen deficiency can be corrected with hormone replacement therapy and topical preparations for the genitalia. A new transdermal system for the administration of testosterone shows a great deal of potential for the treatment of androgen deficiency.

### The effects of estrogen withdrawal on mood symptoms in… [^11662w77]. ClinicalTrials (2003). Low credibility.

The Effects of Estrogen Withdrawal on Mood Symptoms in WomenClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview This study evaluates the effects on mood when stopping estrogen replacement therapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of estrogen levels on perimenopausal depression. This study will examine short-term withdrawal of estrogen in women whose mood had improved with estrogen therapy. Perimenopause-related mood disorders cause significant distress in a large number of women. Evidence suggests that estradiol may have beneficial effects in women with perimenopausal depression. However, the effect of declining estradiol secretion during perimenopause has not been fully examined.

Peri- and post-menopausal women who experience a remission of perimenopause-related depression symptoms while on estrogen therapy and a control group of healthy volunteers on hormone replacement therapy will be switched from their current form of HRT to estradiol for a 3-week period; volunteers will also complete symptom ratings to confirm the absence of mood symptoms. Participants will then be randomly assigned to either continue estradiol or take a placebo for an additional 3 weeks. Mood ratings will be used to determine response to estradiol withdrawal.
- Women with a past perimenopause-related depression and whose depression responded to ET will be recruited to participate in this randomized, parallel-design, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Women with histories of either perimenopausal depression that was not responsive to ET or hormone replacement therapy-induced dysphoria due to either the estrogen or the progesterone components of their hormone replacement will be excluded.
- Age 45 to 65
- In good medical health < TAB > Women without past perimenopausal depression
- To control for the effects of the hormonal manipulations in this protocol, we will also recruit a group of asymptomatic controls who are either currently on ET or were prescribed ET previously and with no previous history of perimenopause-related depression or HRT-induced dysphoria. Women who participate in this study as the asymptomatic comparison group will meet the following criteria:

- Women who received hormone therapy with no previous history of perimenopause-related depression or HT-induced dysphoria
- No current mood or behavioral problems
- Age 45 to 65
- In good medical health EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

### A theory of eu-estrogenemia: a unifying concept [^1143qW4L]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

EU-ESTROGENEMIA AND MENTAL ILLNESS

In dealing with human variables, large numbers of studies are required for meta-analysis. To evaluate estrogen and menopausal depression, Georgakis et alrecently performed meta-analysis of 67,714 women in 14 studies. They found an inverse relationship for postmenopausal depression with increasing age at menopause (OR 0.98, 95% CI of 2-year increments 0.96–0.99) and duration of reproductive period (OR 0.98, 95% CI of 2-year increments 0.96–0.99). The longer exposure to endogenous estrogens, expressed as older age at menopause and longer reproductive period, was associated with a lower risk of depression in later life. In the accompanying editorial, Joffe and Brombergernoted that estrogen improves mood in depressed premenopausal women, but not postmenopausal women, concluding depression in postmenopausal women is not hormonally sensitive. Georgakis et al stated that ERs in postmenopausal women are no longer responsive to estrogen. In evaluating these data, is this not psychiatrists restating eu-estrogenemia and a critical window theory for psychiatry? These are consistent with the theory of eu-estrogenemia.

### Estradiol withdrawal and mood in women with past perimenopausal depression… [^111VtcFr]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance Perimenopause is accompanied by an increased risk of new and recurrent depression. The coincidence of declining ovarian function with the onset of depression led to the inference that "withdrawal" from physiologic estradiol levels underpinned depression in perimenopause. To our knowledge, this is the first controlled systematic study to directly test the estrogen withdrawal theory of perimenopausal depression. Finally, the possible relationships between the magnitude of the change in plasma estradiol and FSH levels and mood symptoms in women with past PMD in whom estradiol therapy was withdrawn were examined using Spearman correlation coefficients as follows.

The difference between the mean plasma estradiol or FSH levels during open-label administration of estradiol and those during administration of placebo were correlated with both the corresponding differences in CES-D symptom scores and the maximum CES-D score during the placebo phase. The lack of depressive symptoms in the control women despite identical hormone manipulation demonstrates that estradiol withdrawal differentially affects central nervous system function in some women so as to render them susceptible to depression. This finding suggests that perimenopausal changes in estradiol levels can trigger depression, but only in the susceptible subgroup. estrogen receptor β reverses depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in animal studies. 40–42 Third, reward responsiveness, which is disturbed in depression, 43 is modulated by estradiol in both rodents and humans.

44, 45 Finally, discontinuation of long-term estradiol therapy in postmenopausal women is accompanied by decreases in medial frontal and temporo-occipital metabolism. 46 Thus, through local signaling or network-level dysfunction, particularly in frontolimbic regions, estradiol withdrawal could precipitate affective dysregulation. What remains unclear is the reason for differential susceptibility to the mood-destabilizing effects of estradiol withdrawal. Of interest in this regard is the recent identification of increased sensitivity to estrogen regulation among transcripts that were differentially expressed in women who developed postpartum depression. 47 Alternatively, basic science studies48 have reported the de novo production of estradiol from androgens in brain regions involved in mood regulation.

Thus, it is possible that women who did not develop depressive symptoms after estradiol withdrawal have sufficient central nervous system aromatase activity to prevent the development of depressive symptom during declining estradiol secretion.

### Sex-specific associations between peripheral oxytocin and emotion perception in schizophrenia [^111Aym5E]. Schizophrenia Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

We previously reported that higher levels of peripheral oxytocin are associated with lower levels of positive, general, and overall symptoms in women but not in men with schizophrenia. Here we investigate the influence of sex, sex steroid hormone fluctuations, and peripheral oxytocin levels on emotional processing in men and women with schizophrenia.

Method

Twenty-two women with schizophrenia and 31 female controls completed the Penn Emotion Acuity Test (PEAT), a facial emotion recognition and perception task, during two menstrual cycle phases: 1) early follicular (Days 2–4; low estrogen/progesterone) and 2) midluteal (Days 20–22; high estrogen/progesterone). Twenty-six males with schizophrenia and 26 male controls completed testing at comparable intervals. We obtained plasma hormone assays of estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and oxytocin.

Results

No sex differences were noted on the PEAT. Plasma oxytocin levels did not fluctuate across phases of the menstrual cycle. However, female patients and controls more accurately identified facial emotions during the early follicular versus midluteal phase (p < 0.05). Higher oxytocin levels related to perceiving faces as happier in both female patients (r = -0.46, p = 0.04) and controls (r = -0.40, p = 0.04) but not in men.

Conclusion

Like healthy women, women with schizophrenia demonstrate menstrual-cycle dependent fluctuations in recognizing emotional cues. Like healthy women, female patients with higher levels of oxytocin perceived faces as happier. Future studies need to address whether this sex-specific relationship is associated with trust and other positive emotions, and whether exogenous oxytocin might enhance mood states and social interaction in female or all schizophrenia patients.

### The impact of hormones on menopausal sexuality: a literature review [^114rGXxP]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with physiological and psychological changes that influence sexuality. During menopause, the primary biological change is a decrease in circulating estrogen levels. Estrogen deficiency initially accounts for altered bleeding and diminished vaginal lubrication. Continual estrogen loss often leads to numerous signs and symptoms, including changes in the vascular and urogenital systems. Alterations in mood, sleep, and cognitive functioning are common as well. These changes may contribute to lower self-esteem, poorer self-image, and diminished sexual responsiveness and sexual desire. Other important nonhormonal factors that affect sexuality are health status and current medications, changes in or dissatisfaction with the partner relationship, social status, and cultural attitudes toward older women. The problems in sexual functioning related to estrogen deficiency can be treated with hormone therapy that includes estrogens alone and estrogens combined with androgens. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers also may be useful in ameliorating postmenopausal sexual complaints. This article reviews the literature on the impact of menopausal estrogen loss on sexuality and on the effect of hormone therapy on sexual function during menopause.

### Sex steroids and cognitive function [^111zkiVc]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Gonadal hormones, most notably oestradiol, enhance some aspects of cognitive function in animal and human models. However, the demonstrated effects are often not large and inconsistent across studies. Nonetheless, because increased numbers of women are living longer in a state of oestrogen deprivation, research on this topic continues to be important. This review traces major developments concerning hormonal influences on cognition and provides some insights from recent studies that may be fruitful for future research.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with transgender and gender nonconforming people [^113sLEn7]. The American Psychologist (2015). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy and mood/emotion adjustment in TGNC people — feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy can positively or negatively affect existing mood disorders; psychologists may also help TGNC people in the initial stages of hormone therapy adjust to normal changes in how they experience emotions, for example trans women beginning estrogens and antiandrogens may experience a broader range of emotions, while trans men beginning testosterone might adjust to a higher libido and feeling more emotionally reactive in stressful situations; these changes can be normalized as similar to the emotional adjustments that cisgender women and men experience during puberty, and readers are encouraged to refer to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care for discussion of possible effects on mood, affect, and behavior.

### Gene regulation by gonadal hormone receptors underlies brain sex differences [^1136EDUM]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Oestradiol establishes neural sex differences in many vertebrates 1–3 and modulates mood, behaviour and energy balance in adulthood 4–8. In the canonical pathway, oestradiol exerts its effects through the transcription factor oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) 9. Although ERα has been extensively characterized in breast cancer, the neuronal targets of ERα, and their involvement in brain sex differences, remain largely unknown. Here we generate a comprehensive map of genomic ERα-binding sites in a sexually dimorphic neural circuit that mediates social behaviours. We conclude that ERα orchestrates sexual differentiation of the mouse brain through two mechanisms: establishing two male-biased neuron types and activating a sustained male-biased gene expression program. Collectively, our findings reveal that sex differences in gene expression are defined by hormonal activation of neuronal steroid receptors. The molecular targets we identify may underlie the effects of oestradiol on brain development, behaviour and disease.

### The effect of hormone replacement therapy on cognition and mood [^1161i3nQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

3.3.1 Summary of mood and HRT

On balance HRT seems to improve low mood associated with the menopause (Figure 2). This effect may be greater in the younger age group. There is conflicting data regarding the notion that oestrogen positively affects mood and progesterone negatively affects it. The type of progestogen used clinically may be relevant. The effect of HRT on anxiety is less clear though it potentially has a more beneficial role in women who have undergone a surgical menopause than those undergoing a natural menopause at a relatively older age. Evidence to suggest a cumulative effect treatment effect for depression when using antidepressants alongside HRT is promising but further exploration is needed. Importantly further data is needed on the more contemporaneous HRT preparations.

### Premenstrual exacerbations of mood disorders: findings and knowledge gaps [^116LVqo6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

In particular, the modulating actions of sex hormones on neurotransmitter systems related to mood disorders and their treatment have been implicated in PMDs. E2 increases neural excitability by potentiating glutamate release, by suppressing transmission of the inhibitory gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, and by increasing dopamine synthesis and decreasing its degradation and reuptake. Furthermore, E2 promotes serotonin synthesis and availability, potentiates serotonergic transmission in limbic regions, and also modulates the noradrenergic system by increasing norepinephrine synthesis and availability. Due to the mood stabilizing effects of E2, its fluctuating and decreasing levels during the premenstrual phase and its interaction with the serotonergic and the noradrenergic system have been proposed to contribute to PMDs.

P4 and its metabolite ALLO inhibit glutamate release, and ALLO inhibits dopamine-induced glutamatergic release in the prefrontal cortex, thereby decreasing neuronal excitability. An important role for ALLO is given by its potentiation of the GABAergic synapses. Positive GABA A receptor (GABA A R) modulators such as ALLO generally exert sedative, anxiolytic, and antiepileptic effects. Lowered GABA concentrations in the orbitofrontal and the prefrontal cortex have been found in patients with MDD, postpartum depression, and postmenopausal depression, and antidepressant therapy has been linked to an increase in ALLO. In animal models, antidepressant effects have been shown by ALLO-induced elevations of the brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF).

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^1179TVay]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Validity of lifetime estradiol exposure hypothesis can be challenged by recent in vivo multimodality imaging study findings showing a gradual increase in estrogen receptor density in the brain during the menopause transition, accompanied by changes in brain volume, perfusion, and energy metabolism. Significant overlap with estrogen-regulated brain networks linked to reproductive and higher-order cognitive functions was observed, independent of chronological age and plasma estradiol levels. This suggests a novel connection between female endocrine aging and heightened expression of estrogen receptors in brain regions associated with cognitive functions, spanning mood, memory, stress, pain, and fine motor skills. Also supporting the concept of estrogenic and biochemical adjustments during perimenopause and early postmenopausal phases that are linked to health issues.

Sex hormones vary throughout the lifespan and most important shifts depend on reproductive stage known as reproductive ageing. Although age correlated with reproductive age, the actual developmental stage cannot be determined solely based on chronological age. At puberty, girls typically experience menarche between ages 9 and 18 years; this stage is characterised by elevated levels of estradiol and profound changes in the brain and body from childhood to puberty, (please see earlier reviews). Menopause marks the end of fertility and is linked to a decrease in estradiol levels, with estrone becoming the dominant form of estrogen in postmenopausal women. These reproductive stages are critical periods defined by major hormonal changes, acting as important proxy measures primarily reflecting fluctuations in estradiol levels.
