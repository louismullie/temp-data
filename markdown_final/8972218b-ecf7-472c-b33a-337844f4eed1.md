## Question

Bartonella henselae associated Kaposi sarcoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is such a thing as "Bartonella henselae associated Kaposi sarcoma", what that means biologically and clinically, and how to distinguish Bartonella-related lesions from true Kaposi sarcoma in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiologies of bacillary angiomatosis versus Kaposi sarcoma. Then, I should compare their epidemiology and clinical presentations. Next, I will review the diagnostic hallmarks on pathology and immunohistochemistry. After that, I'll examine treatment implications, including why steroids matter. Finally, I should synthesize whether any true causal "association" exists and outline a pragmatic diagnostic and management approach with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the core entities to avoid conflating terms. Bacillary angiomatosis is a bacterial infectious vasculoproliferative disorder caused by Bartonella henselae (and B. quintana), particularly in immunocompromised hosts, and it is not a malignancy, which is a key starting point for the differential with Kaposi sarcoma [^112WHj7x]. Kaposi sarcoma, in contrast, is driven by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8/KSHV); wait, I almost said "opportunistic infection", but I need to correct that imprecision — KS is a true angioproliferative neoplasm in which HHV-8 is necessary for tumorigenesis, even though it often arises in settings of immunosuppression and thus behaves as an opportunistic malignancy in clinical contexts [^116Fm5i9] [^113tV4Sj].

> I will now examine bacillary angiomatosis more closely to understand why it is frequently mistaken for KS. Pathophysiologically, B. henselae induces angiogenesis primarily via cytokine modulation and a paracrine loop — VEGF and IL-1β from macrophages and IL-8 from endothelial cells — rather than direct endothelial transformation, which explains the exuberant vascular proliferation that can mimic KS clinically and histologically without HHV-8 involvement [^112WHj7x]. Clinically, BA occurs in immunocompromised patients, especially those with advanced HIV, and presents with violaceous papules, nodules, or plaques that may involve skin and viscera; importantly, BA responds to prolonged macrolide or doxycycline therapy, underscoring its infectious nature and differentiating it therapeutically from KS [^112WHj7x].

> Next, I should review Kaposi sarcoma features for a side-by-side comparison. KS is a HHV-8–associated neoplasm characterized by spindle cell proliferation with viral latency proteins such as LANA-1 detectable by immunohistochemistry; hmm, I initially referred to it as an "opportunistic infection", but let me re-affirm it is an HHV-8–driven malignancy with multiple epidemiologic forms (classic, endemic, iatrogenic, HIV-associated) and a predilection for skin, oral cavity, lymph nodes, and viscera in immunosuppressed hosts [^117AAvYk] [^117JJVbp]. Therapeutically, KS management hinges on ART for people with HIV, with local therapy, radiation, or systemic agents like liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel for symptomatic or advanced disease, which clearly diverges from the antibiotic-responsive nature of BA [^111RS2ab] [^113LQLDJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on appearance alone — the clinical overlap is substantial. Both BA and KS can present with violaceous cutaneous lesions and visceral involvement in immunocompromised patients, and both may appear rapidly or in the setting of immune reconstitution, which can blur clinical distinctions; subtle clues such as prominent lymphedema or oral lesions may favor KS, whereas very rapid onset may suggest BA, but these are not reliable enough to bypass tissue diagnosis [^112WHj7x]. I should double-check that this overlap is precisely why biopsy with appropriate stains is indispensable before committing to oncologic therapy versus antibiotics [^112WHj7x].

> I need to ensure diagnostic rigor: histopathology with targeted immunohistochemistry is the linchpin. For suspected KS, guidelines emphasize obtaining an adequate biopsy, having an expert pathology review, and using an immunohistochemistry panel that includes HHV-8 LANA-1; CD31 and CD34 can assist with confirming vascular origin when needed, and rebiopsy is advised if initial tissue is non-diagnostic, which matters in differentiating from BA or other mimics [^117AAvYk]. For BA, Warthin-Starry or other special stains and careful examination for bacilli alongside a neutrophil-rich infiltrate are supportive, and importantly, BA lesions are HHV-8 negative — features that, together, anchor the distinction from KS when interpreted in the correct clinical context [^112SxR74].

> Let me review treatment divergence because management errors can be harmful. BA is treated with antibiotics such as erythromycin or doxycycline for 8–12 weeks to reduce relapse risk; failure to improve should prompt re-evaluation of the diagnosis and adherence, not escalation to chemotherapy up front [^112WHj7x]. KS, conversely, relies on ART optimization in HIV and disease-directed therapy; preferred first-line systemic regimens include liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel, and in transplant-associated disease, mTOR inhibition with sirolimus may be effective; radiotherapy or local therapies can palliate limited disease while systemic therapy is reserved for advanced or symptomatic cases [^113LQLDJ] [^111RS2ab]. I should also verify a critical safety point: corticosteroids can accelerate KS progression and increase KS-IRIS risk, so guidelines recommend avoiding steroids unless life-threatening conditions necessitate them, which is particularly relevant when differentiating KS from BA in HIV care [^113Xa9Fv] [^11791VKn].

> But wait, what exactly is meant by "Bartonella henselae associated Kaposi sarcoma" — does this imply causation, co-occurrence, or mimicry? I should confirm the causality question first: KS requires HHV-8 infection, and there is no credible evidence that Bartonella henselae causes KS; thus, "association" does not reflect a causal role of Bartonella in KS oncogenesis, even though both diseases involve prominent angiogenesis through different mechanisms [^116Fm5i9] [^113Fyoiq]. Clinically, the association is best understood as epidemiologic co-occurrence in immunocompromised hosts and profound clinical mimicry that mandates biopsy with HHV-8 LANA-1 staining to prevent misdiagnosis and mistreatment, not as Bartonella-induced KS per se [^112WHj7x] [^117AAvYk].

> Let me synthesize the evidence to ensure I'm not overlooking nuance. First, BA and KS are etiologically distinct — bacterial infection versus HHV-8–driven malignancy — even though both can present in HIV and other immunosuppressed states with similar skin and visceral lesions, which explains historical diagnostic confusion and case reports of mimicry rather than causation [^112WHj7x] [^116Fm5i9]. Second, histopathology with HHV-8 immunohistochemistry is essential in any suspected KS, and failure to perform it risks missing treatable BA; conversely, Warthin-Starry or equivalent stains and characteristic neutrophilic infiltrates support BA and help avoid unnecessary chemotherapy [^117AAvYk] [^112SxR74]. Third, management is disease-specific: antibiotics for BA versus ART optimization and oncologic therapies for KS, with a strict caution against routine corticosteroids in KS due to acceleration risk and association with KS-IRIS [^111RS2ab] [^113Xa9Fv].

> I should now translate this into practical clinical guidance. In an HIV patient with new violaceous lesions, do not assume KS based on appearance; obtain a diagnostic biopsy and request HHV-8 LANA-1 and vascular markers, and, if HHV-8 negative or if features suggest infection, ask the pathologist to evaluate for Bartonella with special stains or molecular methods; if results are discordant or non-diagnostic, rebiopsy rather than empirically treating malignancy or infection alone [^117AAvYk] [^112SxR74]. If KS is confirmed, coordinate prompt ART management and stage-directed therapy per NCCN/BHIVA; if BA is confirmed, initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy and reassess clinically and histologically if response is atypical; throughout, avoid corticosteroids unless there is a compelling, life-threatening indication, given the risk of worsening KS and IRIS [^113LQLDJ] [^113Xa9Fv].

> Final answer with self-check: "Bartonella henselae associated Kaposi sarcoma" is a misnomer in terms of causation; Bartonella henselae causes bacillary angiomatosis, which can so closely resemble Kaposi sarcoma — especially in immunocompromised hosts — that the two are clinically indistinguishable without biopsy and HHV-8 immunostaining; accurate tissue diagnosis directs divergent treatments and prevents harm from misclassification, and the only true "association" is overlapping hosts and shared angiogenic phenotypes, not microbial causality for KS [^112WHj7x] [^117AAvYk] [^116Fm5i9].

---

In sum, **Bartonella henselae is not associated with Kaposi sarcoma** (KS); KS is caused by HHV-8, and B. henselae causes bacillary angiomatosis (BA) [^111PG3ZH], which can clinically and histologically mimic KS [^117AAvYk] [^112SxR74]. KS shows HHV-8 LANA-1 positivity, whereas BA shows Warthin-Starry–positive bacilli [^117AAvYk] [^112SxR74]. Accurate diagnosis is essential because KS requires **antiretroviral therapy** [^111RS2ab] and **chemotherapy** [^113LQLDJ], while BA responds to **antibiotics** [^112WHj7x].

## Pathogenesis and clinical features

| **Attribute** | **Kaposi sarcoma** | **Bacillary angiomatosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Etiology | KS is caused by HHV-8, which drives endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis [^117AAvYk] [^116Fm5i9] | BA is caused by B. henselae or B. quintana, with cat exposure as a key risk [^112WHj7x] [^112SxR74] |
| Clinical presentation | Violaceous papules, nodules, or plaques on skin and mucosa; visceral involvement is common in immunocompromised patients [^112tbfkv] | Rapidly growing vascular lesions that mimic KS; often in immunocompromised hosts [^112WHj7x] [^112SxR74] |
| Histopathology | Spindle cells, slit-like vascular spaces, and HHV-8 LANA-1 positivity [^117AAvYk] | Lobular capillary proliferation with neutrophilic infiltrate and Warthin-Starry–positive bacilli [^112SxR74] [^112WHj7x] |

---

## Diagnostic differentiation

Accurate differentiation between KS and BA is critical because **treatments and prognoses differ**. The following table summarizes key diagnostic features:

| **Feature** | **Kaposi sarcoma** | **Bacillary angiomatosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Etiologic agent | HHV-8 [^116Fm5i9] | Bartonella henselae [^112SxR74] |
| Histopathology | Spindle cells, slit-like vascular spaces [^117AAvYk] | Lobular capillary proliferation, neutrophilic infiltrate [^112SxR74] |
| Immunohistochemistry | HHV-8 LANA-1 positive [^117AAvYk] | Warthin-Starry positive bacilli [^112SxR74] |
| Clinical course | Indolent, chronic [^112tbfkv] | Rapidly progressive, acute [^112SxR74] |
| Treatment | Antiretroviral therapy, chemotherapy [^111RS2ab] [^114BgCRf] | Antibiotics (doxycycline, erythromycin) [^112WHj7x] [^112SxR74] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

**Kaposi sarcoma** is managed with antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy; prognosis varies with immune status and disease extent [^115627NE] [^111RS2ab] [^112SvqT4]. In contrast, **bacillary angiomatosis** is treated with antibiotics and carries an excellent prognosis with appropriate therapy [^112WHj7x] [^112SxR74].

---

## Conclusion

**Bartonella henselae is not associated with Kaposi sarcoma**; KS is HHV-8–driven [^116Fm5i9], whereas B. henselae causes BA, a KS mimic [^112SxR74]. Accurate diagnosis using histopathology and immunohistochemistry is essential to guide appropriate therapy [^117AAvYk].

### Successful treatment of bacillary angiomatosis with oral doxycycline in an HIV-infected child with skin lesions mimicking Kaposi sarcoma [^112WHj7x]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a rare multisystem bacterial infectious vasculoproliferative disorder caused by Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana. It is most commonly seen in HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts less than 200 cells per microliter. BA commonly presents in the skin but may affect almost any visceral organ, including the liver, spleen, or nasal cavity. Although there is no consensus treatment for BA, clinicians experienced in treating this condition recommend therapy with oral erythromycin or doxycycline for 8 to 12 weeks to avoid relapses.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a rare angioproliferative opportunistic infection caused by human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) also seen in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 counts. The overlapping constellation of cutaneous manifestations of BA and KS make them clinically indistinguishable from each other when presenting as single or multiple violaceous papules, nodules, plaques, or tumors. Occasionally, clinical clues can lead toward one diagnosis or the other. KS may cause prominent lymphedema of the legs and oral lesions. BA may have a very rapid onset with swift growth of lesions, which may occur with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, further complicating the difficulty in distinguishing these entities without pathology. However, KS can also develop rapidly in severely immunocompromised patients and during immune reconstitution, and BA can have oral lesions that mimic KS. In addition, other HIV-associated dermatologic conditions, such as disseminated mycobacterial or fungal infections, can have similar presentations to those of KS or BA.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining the following workup for the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma:

- **Essential**: Review adequate slides from a paraffin block representative of the tumor by a pathologist with expertise in the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma. Perform a rebiopsy if non-diagnostic. Conduct a histopathology review of an adequate biopsy (e.g. skin punch, incisional, excisional). Ensure adequate immunophenotyping to establish the diagnosis. Use an immunohistochemistry panel with Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, HHV-8, and LANA-1.

- **Useful in certain circumstances**: Utilize immunohistochemistry CD31 and CD34 if it is unclear whether the tumor has a vascular origin. If a coexisting disorder is suspected (e.g. infection, lymphoma, multicentric Castleman disease), encourage additional biopsy of nodal or visceral sites.

### Induction of a potential paracrine angiogenic loop between human THP-1 macrophages and human microvascular endothelial cells during Bartonella henselae infection [^111PG3ZH]. Infection and Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

Bartonella henselae is responsible for various disease syndromes that loosely correlate with the immune status of the host. In the immunocompromised individual, B. henselae-induced angiogenesis, or bacillary angiomatosis, is characterized by vascular proliferative lesions similar to those in Kaposi's sarcoma. We hypothesize that B. henselae-mediated interaction with immune cells, namely, macrophages, induces potential angiogenic growth factors and cytokines which contribute in a paracrine manner to the proliferation of endothelial cells.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a direct inducer of angiogenesis, and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), a potentiator of VEGF, were detected within 12 and 6 hours, respectively, in supernatants from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated human THP-1 macrophages exposed to live B. henselae. Pretreatment of macrophages with cytochalasin D, a phagocytosis inhibitor, yielded comparable results, suggesting that bacterium-cell attachment is sufficient for VEGF and IL-1beta induction.

IL-8, an angiogenic cytokine with chemotactic properties, was induced in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) within 6 hours of infection, whereas no IL-8 induction was observed in infected THP-1 cells. In addition, conditioned medium from infected macrophages induced the proliferation of HMEC-1, thus demonstrating angiogenic potential.

These data suggest that Bartonella modulation of host or target cell cytokines and growth factors, rather than a direct role of the bacterium as an endothelial cell mitogen, is the predominant mechanism responsible for angiogenesis.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115rBX2o]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, specifically concerning the management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (diagnosis), the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend offering systemic therapy to patients with advanced Kaposi sarcoma who are not on antiretroviral therapy at the time of presentation. This should be done as soon as possible after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy to minimize the risk of severe Kaposi sarcoma-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is higher in patients with baseline low CD4 T-cell counts and high HIV viral loads.

### Kaposi sarcoma in mantled guereza [^117JJVbp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), a member of the genus Rhadinovirus, is the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma, an endothelial neoplasm of the dermis, oral cavity, and intestinal organs. The tumors are highly vascularized and characterized by the proliferation of spindle cells that contain KSHV DNA and antigen. Predisposing factors for Kaposi sarcoma include immunodeficiency, especially infection with HIV. Nevertheless, a major portion of Kaposi sarcoma cases in Africa occurs in HIV-negative persons.

Clinically, Kaposi sarcoma is divided into four forms: classical Kaposi sarcoma, African endemic Kaposi sarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma caused by iatrogenic immunosuppression, and HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma. Lesions of classical Kaposi sarcoma initially occur on the lower extremities, progress slowly, and affect visceral organs at a late stage. In contrast, the remaining forms affect lymph nodes, mucosa, and visceral organs at early stages, progress rapidly, and encompass symptoms in the hard palate and oral mucosa.

Rhadinoviruses with high similarity to KSHV have been detected in Old World monkeys, including chimpanzees, macaques, and African green monkeys. These rhadinoviruses have split into two lineages, RV1 and RV2, and many Old World monkeys harbor viruses of both lineages. In contrast, humans harbor only KSHV, which belongs to the RV1 lineage. Kaposi sarcoma-like disease has been observed in rhadinovirus-infected nonhuman primates (NHP), but only in the presence of immunodeficiency induced, for instance, by co-infection with simian immunodeficiency virus.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^112o3o5N]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in reducing the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, HIV-infected individuals who have responded to treatment continue to be diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma. We examine factors associated with the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma among cART-treated HIV-infected homosexual men and changes in their survival after its diagnosis over calendar time.

- **Methods**: Data were from HIV-infected homosexual men with well-estimated dates of HIV seroconversion (i.e. change in status from being HIV negative to having HIV antibodies detected). Incidence of Kaposi sarcoma was calculated. We used Kaplan–Meier methods to determine survival after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis in three calendar periods: before 1996, 1996–2000, and 2001–2006. Poisson models were used to examine the effect of risk factors such as nadir CD4 cell count (i.e. the lowest CD4 cell count ever recorded for a person), duration of infection, and age at diagnosis for Kaposi sarcoma incidence in cART-treated men. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Among the 9473 men, 555 were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma in the period 1986–2006, of whom 319 died. The percentage surviving 24 months after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis rose statistically significantly during the study period from 35% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 29% to 42%) before 1996 to 84% (95% CI = 76% to 90%) in 1996–2000 and to 81% (95% CI = 70% to 88%) in 2001–2006 (P < 0.001). Seventy men were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma after starting cART. Current (i.e. within 6 months) CD4 cell count was associated with survival outcomes.

### KSHV/HHV8-associated intestinal Kaposi's sarcoma in patient with ulcerative colitis receiving immunosuppressive drugs: Report of a case [^111Cqm34]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), has been identified in all four forms of Kaposi's sarcoma: classic, endemic, HIV-associated, and iatrogenic. We report the rare case of intestinal Kaposi's sarcoma, affecting the small intestine and rectosigmoid, in a 62-year-old HIV-negative man with ulcerative colitis. This patient was receiving immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and azathioprine. At the time of writing, the causative role of KSHV/HHV8 in the pathophysiology of Kaposi's sarcoma associated with ulcerative colitis has only been proven for cutaneous lesions but not for intestinal lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma.

We report, for the first time, the expression of HHV8 using immunohistochemistry in colonic Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient with an ulcerative colitis-related tumor. The patient underwent a total proctocolectomy. During laparotomy, numerous Kaposi's sarcoma lesions were found in the small intestine and were left in situ. Forty months post-surgery and following the withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy, the patient had no evidence of any disease and a normal abdominal and thoracic CT scan. Cases of colorectal Kaposi's sarcoma complicating inflammatory bowel disease should be managed with a conservative approach and discontinuation of the immunosuppressive treatment. However, discontinuation of the immunosuppression is not always possible; in such cases, chemotherapy may be indicated.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^11791VKn]. AIDS (2016). High credibility.

During the period between January 2008 and August 2014, 169 individuals were diagnosed with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma at our institution. Of these, 24 were deemed ineligible for this study because they were not receiving ART before or at Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosis and would not be a suitable population for the study of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Consequently, we included 145 individuals who started ART during the aforementioned period and had a clinical and histological diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. Among them, five were women (3.45%). The median age at Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosis was 32 years [interquartile range (IQR), 28–39].

- **Kaposi's sarcoma characteristics**:
	- 63 had mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (43.4%).
	- Nine had visceral Kaposi's sarcoma (6.2%).
	- 73 had both visceral and mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (50.3%).

- **Additional findings**:
	- 102 patients had a concomitant opportunistic infection (70.3%).
	- 51 received chemotherapy (35.2%).
	- 60 received glucocorticoids (41.4%).

- **CD4 and CD8 cell counts at diagnosis**:
	- The median CD4+ cell count was 90.5 cells/μl (IQR, 34.5–160.7).
	- The median CD8+ cell count was 586.5 cells/μl (IQR, 275.5–1057).

- **HIV load at diagnosis**: The median HIV load was 60 805 (IQR, 171.7–313,717.7).

- **IRIS evaluation**:
	- IRIS could not be assessed in 10 individuals due to insufficient follow-up; hence, they were not included in the IRIS analyses.
	- Of the remaining 135 individuals, 50 developed KS-IRIS (37%).
		- 17 had unmasking IRIS (12.6%).
		- 33 had paradoxical IRIS (24.4%).
	- The median time to KS-IRIS was 60 days (IQR, 30–97.5).
	- 58 individuals (42.96%) were treated with glucocorticoids.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^111qpR4b]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

As far as we know, this is the first case-control study reporting the use of glucocorticoids as a risk factor for KS-IRIS and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Some independent risk factors for KS-IRIS reported in the literature include detectable plasma HHV-8 DNA, hematocrit less than 30%, clinical Kaposi's sarcoma at pre-ART visit, CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 50 cells/μl, ART alone as Kaposi's sarcoma treatment, T1 Kaposi's sarcoma stage, plasma HIV-1 RNA more than 5 log 10 copies/ml, and tumor-associated edema. However, exposure to glucocorticoid therapy was not reported in these studies.

Mortality associated with Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported as 32.8% in individuals developing KS-IRIS and 11.1% in non-IRIS individuals, with a 3.3-fold higher mortality in African individuals compared with European individuals. Factors previously associated with mortality include KS-IRIS, lack of chemotherapy, CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells/μl before ART initiation, and a detectable HHV-8 load. To our knowledge, the association of glucocorticoid use with Kaposi's sarcoma-related mortality has not been evaluated before. Our study has shown four-fold odds of Kaposi's sarcoma-related mortality in individuals receiving glucocorticoids, after controlling for possible confounding factors. Glucocorticoid therapy has also been clinically associated with the development of Kaposi's sarcoma in non-HIV-related diseases such as transplant recipients, rheumatic disorders, asthma, lung cancer, dermatologic diseases, and atopic dermatitis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining recent T-cell subsets, including quantitative CD4+ T-cell count and HIV viral load, in all patients who are HIV seropositive to assess immune function and HIV control. It is important to involve an HIV specialist to evaluate for coexisting opportunistic infections, especially in cases of advanced immunosuppression.

### Bartonella species bacteremia in two patients with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma [^115Uartu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Bartonella henselae and B. koehlerae bacteremia were documented in two patients with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and B. koehlerae bacteremia was identified in an asymptomatic partner of one of the patients. Considering the biology and clinically variable natural history of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, these results suggest that chronic Bartonella infection could have a role in the development of this vascular neoplasm. Bartonella spp. are known to induce vasoproliferative tumors in immunocompromised patients and may play a role in the development of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma in immunocompetent patients.

### Bartonella spp. transmission by ticks not established [^112coFqm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Infections with Bartonella spp. appear to be widespread in many animal species besides cats. Some evidence has been advanced in support of the possibility of tick transmission. Such findings have resulted in diagnostic testing and empiric therapies directed at B. henselae infection that are of dubious value with respect to illnesses thought to be caused by deer tick exposure. We critically examined the reported findings regarding tick transmission of Bartonella spp.

Bartonella spp. are common bacterial hemoparasites of mammals; for as long as 100 years, two species have been known to cause infections of public health significance. Trench fever, caused by B. quintana (formerly Rochalimaea quintana) and transmitted by body lice, affected hundreds of thousands of soldiers or displaced persons during World War I and to this day affects homeless persons. Oroya fever (and its chronic manifestation verruga peruana), caused by infection with B. bacilliformis and transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies, is a potentially severe febrile disease. Although it is geographically restricted to the high altitudes of the Andes and affects only a relatively small number of persons, the high case-fatality rate brought attention to this apparent anthroponosis as early as the late 1800s.

B. henselae causes cat-scratch disease, the most common Bartonella spp. infection in the United States. The hallmark of cat-scratch disease is enlargement and tenderness of lymph nodes draining the site of inoculation of the microorganism. In addition, a skin or mucous membrane lesion may be observed at the site.

### Early- and late-stage Kaposi's sarcoma-derived cells but not activated endothelial cells can invade de-epidermized dermis [^111nqUWN]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Whether Kaposi's sarcoma is a true neoplasm or a reactive endothelial cell outgrowth triggered by inflammatory cytokines remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the differential invasive properties of activated endothelial cells and Kaposi's sarcoma cells in a model of de-epidermized dermis, supplying the cells with matrix barriers similar to those found in vivo.

Cells derived from early "patch-stage" and late "nodular-stage" Kaposi's sarcoma lesions exhibited similar invasive properties, indicating that cells with invasive potential are present in the early stages of tumor development. The slow accumulation of cells into the extracellular matrix, along with a low proliferation index and expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, suggests that the progression of Kaposi's sarcoma may be related to escape from cell death rather than increased proliferation. The Kaposi's sarcoma-Y1 cell line, which is tumorigenic in nude mice, also exhibited invasive properties.

In contrast to the Kaposi's sarcoma-derived spindle cells, which were scattered between the collagen bundles, the Kaposi's sarcoma-Y1 cell population had a higher proliferation index and displayed a multilayer arrangement. Inflammatory cytokines and Kaposi's sarcoma cell supernatant could activate and stimulate the growth of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, but could not induce their invasion in this model, demonstrating that activated endothelial cells do not fulfill all the requirements to traverse the various barriers found in the dermal extracellular matrix.

### Molecularly targeted therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma in a kidney transplant patient: case report, "what worked and what did not" [^112uSf7H]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Imatinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for which there is limited information regarding its effects on AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and none in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used for kidney transplants, exhibits antiangiogenic activity related to impaired production of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Clinical benefits have been reported in Kaposi's sarcoma associated with renal grafts.

- **Case presentation**: Here we report a case of an 80-year-old male who developed Kaposi's sarcoma nine months after receiving a living non-related donor kidney transplant at age 74. Three years after treatment with different chemotherapeutic agents for progressive cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, with no visceral involvement, he was prescribed Imatinib (200 mg/day for two weeks followed by 400 mg/day). After four weeks of treatment, he developed anasarca, further progression of KS, and agranulocytosis. Imatinib was discontinued, and there was significant clinical recovery. One year later, his immunosuppressive therapy was changed to Sirolimus, and regression of the Kaposi's sarcoma occurred.

- **Conclusion**: The lack of benefit and severe toxicity associated with the use of Imatinib in this patient should alert clinicians to the potentially adverse consequences of its use in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. On the other hand, the positive response seen in this patient to Sirolimus, even following a long evolution of Kaposi's sarcoma and multiple chemotherapy regimens, suggests its therapeutic potential.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for Kaposi sarcoma according to the NCCN, more specifically with respect to staging, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend using the following staging classification for Kaposi sarcoma:

- **Good risk (all of the following)**: T0. Confined to skin and/or lymph nodes and/or minimal oral disease (non-nodular Kaposi sarcoma confined to palate); I0. CD4+ T-cell count ≥ 150/mcL; S0. No history of opportunistic infection or thrush, No "B" symptoms, and Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70.

- **Poor risk (any of the following)**: T1. Tumor-associated edema or ulceration, extensive oral Kaposi sarcoma, gastrointestinal Kaposi sarcoma, or Kaposi sarcoma in organs other than lymph nodes; I1. CD4+ T-cell count < 150/mcL. S1. History of opportunistic infection or thrush, presence of "B" symptoms (unexplained fever, night sweats, > 10% involuntary weight loss, or diarrhea persisting > 2 weeks), Karnofsky Performance Status < 70, or other HIV-related illnesses (e.g. neurologic disease, lymphoma) (category 2A).

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113uCjcQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, specifically concerning the goals of therapy, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend offering systemic therapy to patients with advanced symptomatic cutaneous, visceral, nodal, or oral disease with the goal of reducing or reversing symptoms, lymphedema, or the threat to organ function. Recognize that complete remissions are rare. The guidelines advise continuing treatment until unacceptable toxicity or a plateau in response is reached and do not recommend maintenance therapy beyond two cycles of systemic therapy after the determination of a plateau. If the response is clinically acceptable, consider observing patients while continuing antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV. Otherwise, initiate alternative therapy.

### Is pyogenic granuloma associated with Bartonella infection [^113CuYdB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Lobular capillary hemangioma and bacillary angiomatosis due to Bartonella infection share several clinical and histopathologic characteristics. We sought to determine whether lobular capillary hemangioma is caused by the same agent as bacillary angiomatosis. Forty-five pathology specimens with a histologic diagnosis of lobular capillary hemangioma, obtained from patients with the same clinical diagnosis, were tested by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction for the presence of DNA elements of Bartonella spp. None of the 45 lobular capillary hemangioma specimens tested positive for Bartonella spp. We conclude that lobular capillary hemangioma is not associated with Bartonella spp infection. Further research is required to determine the etiologic agent.

### Persistent Kaposi sarcoma in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy: Characterizing the predictors of clinical response [^115naBHK]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

To evaluate the role of highly active antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy on tumor response among persons with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, we identified factors associated with response in a clinical setting.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort.

- **Methods**: One hundred and fourteen patients from two HIV clinics with a diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma were identified via a clinical database. Records were reviewed to confirm Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis and abstract clinical and chemotherapy information. Demographics, laboratory values, and highly active antiretroviral therapy use were abstracted electronically. Cox's proportional hazards models identified predictors of Kaposi sarcoma improvement and resolution.

- **Results**: Thirty-six months following Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis, the rate of improvement among 64 patients with confirmed Kaposi sarcoma was 77% and that of complete resolution was 51%. In univariate analyses, recent chemotherapy was associated with Kaposi sarcoma improvement, and recent HIV viral load and highly active antiretroviral therapy were associated with both improvement and resolution. No measured baseline characteristics (tumor stage, diagnosis year, CD4 T-cell count, HIV viral load, or prior highly active antiretroviral therapy history) or recent CD4 T-cell counts predicted improvement or resolution. In multivariate analyses, recent chemotherapy (hazard ratio 5.5, 95% confidence interval: 2.7–11.2, P < 0.001) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (hazard ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.4–12.6, P = 0.01) were predictors of improvement.

### Cat scratch disease and Bartonellaceae: The known, the unknown and the curious [^117LLA2G]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Since the early 1900s, Bartonella species were known only to cause human disease resulting from very restricted geographic (bartonellosis) or environmental influences ("trench fever"). In the 1990s, cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis were definitively linked to Bartonella species. Subsequently, the widespread use of modern diagnostic methods revealed the broad ecological niche of this organism and greatly expanded our knowledge of the epidemiology and clinical presentations associated with this genus. A large number of reservoirs and vectors involved with Bartonella propagation and transmission to humans have been identified; cats and various arthropods remain the most well-studied at the time of writing.

Though not completely understood, it appears that specific immune-modulated interactions between the infecting species and host-related factors play a major role in the observed breadth of human clinical syndromes associated with Bartonellae. These interactions may also explain the large differences in immunopathologic features of tissue samples among different syndromes and potentially the varied responses to antimicrobial therapy. Further, the clinical management for cat scratch disease, in particular, is quite variable among clinicians, reflecting a poor evidence base. No preventive measures have been developed beyond suggestions to avoid at-risk behavior with known vectors.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115627NE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN guidelines, more specifically with respect to antiretroviral therapy, recommend initiating systemic Kaposi sarcoma-directed therapy as soon as possible in all patients with HIV who have symptomatic Kaposi sarcoma such as edema, oral Kaposi sarcoma, or other manifestations that interfere with normal functions or activities. In patients with limited cutaneous disease, consider urgent initiation of systemic Kaposi sarcoma therapy if Kaposi sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is present. Signs of past immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome may also indicate the need for earlier initiation of systemic Kaposi sarcoma therapy. Do not delay or discontinue antiretroviral therapy unless life-threatening immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome develops. Recognize that reconstitution of immune function is important for obtaining and maintaining control or remission of Kaposi sarcoma.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^1142tt7A]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

- **Factors associated with Kaposi sarcoma incidence**: In multivariable models that included other measures of immunosuppression mediated through CD4 cell count, among the cART follow-up group, the CD4 cell count was more strongly associated with the risk of Kaposi sarcoma than the nadir CD4 cell count or the time-weighted average CD4 count. Although there was a borderline statistically significant association between the nadir CD4 cell count at cART initiation and the risk of Kaposi sarcoma (P = 0.06), after adjusting for CD4 cell count, which appeared to be strongly associated with the risk of Kaposi sarcoma (P < .001), the association disappeared (P = 0.59), as did that for the time-weighted average CD4 cell count (P = 0.16).

- **Relationship of nadir CD4 cell count to Kaposi sarcoma**: This relationship was examined in homosexual men treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^113DVAYV]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

We also found that over time, both the CD4 cell count and the nadir for CD4 cell count at Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis shifted to higher levels. One explanation for these findings is that the increased medical care that generally accompanies treatment with cART increases the opportunity for symptoms and lesions to be identified and examined at an early stage. Other explanations are that cART may not control human herpesvirus 8, which is considered a necessary cause of Kaposi sarcoma, and the causal relation between human herpesvirus 8 and Kaposi sarcoma development may not be directly mediated through the improvement of the immune system. Finally, the observed increase in CD4 cell levels at Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis may be due to a change in Kaposi sarcoma site because it has been reported that the decline in Kaposi sarcoma incidence since the introduction of cART has affected Kaposi sarcoma with visceral involvement more strongly than cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma and that, among cART-treated patients, Kaposi sarcoma with nonvisceral involvement appears to be diagnosed at higher levels of CD4 cells than visceral Kaposi sarcoma.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^113Fyoiq]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by infection with the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Disease progression involves a process of viral oncogenesis within a permissive context of deregulated cytokines and immunosuppression. Although the incidence and mortality associated with Kaposi's sarcoma have decreased with the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), it remains the most common malignancy in the HIV-infected population. Notably, almost 20% of Kaposi's sarcoma patients in pooled African cohorts and 8.5% in a London cohort developed Kaposi's sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (KS-IRIS). In resource-limited settings, this condition is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality.

Multiple case reports indicate that the administration of systemic glucocorticoids to HIV-infected individuals accelerates clinical progression of Kaposi's sarcoma. However, no published studies demonstrate the real impact of glucocorticoids on the development or clinical worsening of Kaposi's sarcoma in the HIV-infected population. Our institution is a national referral center for respiratory diseases, with a large number of HIV-infected individuals requiring the use of glucocorticoids for the treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Therefore, it is an ideal place for assessing the association between Kaposi's sarcoma morbidity and mortality and the use of glucocorticoids in the context of HIV infection. This is the first case–control study reporting the use of glucocorticoids as a risk factor for KS-IRIS and for Kaposi's sarcoma.

### Looking for the target cell of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [^112BpBGz]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

The level of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) cellular viremia in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma could be related to both the tumor burden and its progression. The origin of the spindle cell, the hallmark cell of Kaposi's sarcoma, is still debated. Two hypotheses may be formulated, favoring a lymphatic endothelial cell or an endothelial-cell precursor evolving into a lymphatic phenotype, both preferentially targeted by KSHV.

### Kaposi sarcoma in people living with HIV: incidence and associated factors in a French cohort between 2010 and 2015 [^11296tf6]. AIDS (2020). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma is still observed among people living with HIV (PLHIV), including those on ART with undetectable HIV viral load (HIV-VL). We aimed to assess Kaposi sarcoma incidence and trends between 2010 and 2015 in France and to highlight associated factors.

This retrospective study utilized longitudinal data from the Dat'AIDS cohort, which included 44,642 PLWH. For the incidence assessment, Kaposi sarcoma cases occurring within 30 days of cohort enrollment were excluded. Demographic, immunological, and therapeutic characteristics were collected at the time of Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis or at the last visit for patients without Kaposi sarcoma.

Among 180,216.4 person-years, Kaposi sarcoma incidence was 76 (95% CI 64.3–89.9)/10,000 person-years. Multivariate analysis (Poisson regression) revealed a positive association with male sex, MSM transmission route, lower CD4 T-cell count, higher CD8 T-cell count, and not being on ART. In contrast, longer HIV follow-up time and duration with an HIV-VL of 50 copies/ml or less were negatively associated with Kaposi sarcoma. According to the different models tested, HIV-VL, CD4:CD8 ratio, and nadir CD4 cell count were associated with Kaposi sarcoma. Moreover, stratified analysis showed that patients with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.5 or less, or a CD8 T-cell count greater than 1,000 cells/μl, were at a higher risk of Kaposi sarcoma regardless of the CD4 T-cell count.

This study showed that in a resource-rich country setting with high ART coverage, Kaposi sarcoma still occurred among PLWH. CD8 hyperlymphocytosis and CD4:CD8 ratio should now be considered critical factors.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN guidelines from 2019 specifically address the management of limited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma. In HIV-negative patients with symptomatic and/or cosmetically bothersome limited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma, the recommended first-line treatment options are as follows:

- **Local therapy**: Treatments directly applied to the affected area.
- **Radiotherapy**: The use of radiation to destroy cancer cells.
- **Systemic therapy**: Medication that circulates throughout the body to target cancer cells.
- **Clinical trial**: Participation in research studies to explore new treatments.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116th93B]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines emphasize general principles, including the recognition that Kaposi sarcoma is often complicated by lymphedema. This condition increases the risk of cellulitis and deep tissue infections in affected limbs. The risk of severe lymphedema and delayed wound healing may be heightened after radiation, therefore consultation with a lymphedema specialist is advised.

- **Radiation therapy**: In cases of advanced cutaneous disease, reserve radiation for situations where systemic therapy is not feasible. The aim is palliation or short-term disease management until systemic therapy becomes possible. Note that treatment responses may be delayed in the presence of significant lymphedema.

In terms of medical management for Kaposi sarcoma with respect to regimens for systemic therapy (first-line), the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend offering the following options for first-line systemic therapy:

- **Preferred regimens**: Liposomal doxorubicin 20 mg/m² IV every 2 to 3 weeks; sirolimus (for transplant Kaposi sarcoma) with a loading dose of 0.15 mg/kg PO followed by 0.04–0.06 mg/kg/day to maintain trough blood levels of 6–10 ng/mL or 2 mg PO daily (adjust to maintain trough levels of 6–10 ng/mL).

- **Other recommended regimens**: Paclitaxel 60 mg/m² IV weekly, 100 mg/m² IV every 2 weeks, 100 mg/m² IV every 3 weeks, or 135 mg/m² IV every 3 weeks.

### Identification of novel zoonotic activity of Bartonella spp. France [^114cqUYo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Bartonella spp. cause varied and multifaceted human diseases, including cat scratch disease (B. henselae), Carrion's disease (B. bacilliformis), trench fever (B. quintana), endocarditis (B. quintana and B. henselae), bacillary angiomatosis (B. quintana and B. henselae), and hepatic peliosis (B. henselae). Bartonella spp. can also cause prolonged intra-erythrocytic bacteremia in both humans and animals. In humans, B. quintana, B. bacilliformis, and B. rochalimae are known pathogens. In animals, B. henselae, B. clarridgeiae, and B. koehlerae have been identified in felids; B. grahamii, B. taylorii, B. doshiae, B. birtlesii, and others in rodents; and B. bovis, B. chomelii, B. schoenbuchensis in ruminants. In humans, chronic bacteremia caused by B. quintana results in few obvious symptoms apart from generalized fatigue and nonspecific leg pain.

It has been assumed that each Bartonella species infected one or a few closely related mammalian reservoir hosts, where the infection caused long-lasting bacteremia. Non-reservoir hosts were considered incidentally infected without bacteria being detected in blood. Recently, these assumptions have been contradicted by studies describing animal-associated Bartonella spp. indirectly associated with bacteremia and a spectrum of diverse symptoms in immune-competent persons who had contact with animals, arthropods, or both, which are natural routes of Bartonella transmission. In some cases, the source of infection remains unknown; ticks have been suggested as a possible source of animal-associated Bartonella infection in humans.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Kaposi sarcoma per NCCN guidelines (2019), recommendations depend on clinical circumstances, especially if there are signs and symptoms concerning visceral involvement, prior to initiating new therapy, if progression or refractory disease is present, or if there is a noted change in the disease:

- **Evaluation for suspected opportunistic infections**: This should be conducted under clinical suspicion.

- **Obtain stool hemoccult**: Necessary in cases of advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal involvement.

- **CXR**: Recommended in the setting of advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal disease.

- **Chest CT with contrast and bronchoscopy**: Required if there are unexplained pulmonary symptoms or abnormalities on CXR.

- **Abdomen or pelvis CT with contrast or MRI with and without contrast, and EGD or colonoscopy**: These are warranted if gastrointestinal symptoms are present or if the stool hemoccult is positive.

- **FDG-PET or CT and/or laboratory workup**: Useful in patients with clinical features such as fever, dyspnea, or effusions, which are concerning for Kaposi sarcoma inflammatory cytokine syndrome or Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-associated multicentric Castleman disease. Additional tests include CRP, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus serum viral load, SPEP, IL-6, or IL-10. This is important if there are concerns for coexisting Kaposi sarcoma inflammatory cytokine syndrome, multicentric Castleman disease, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-positive lymphoma, or other Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-related diseases.

- **Excisional biopsy of lymphadenopathy**: Recommended to exclude multicentric Castleman disease for the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma inflammatory cytokine syndrome, if feasible.

### Kaposi's sarcoma following immune suppressive therapy for Wegener's granulomatosis [^116pfPFw]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

The association between Kaposi's sarcoma and infection with human herpesvirus 8 is now well recognized. Immunologic impairment is associated with two forms of Kaposi's sarcoma: epidemic (associated with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) and iatrogenic (associated with immunosuppressive treatment); both forms have become more common during the last decade. We describe an HIV-negative 54-year-old man who developed Kaposi's sarcoma two months after beginning immunosuppressive therapy for Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). With tapering of medication, complete remission of Kaposi's sarcoma was achieved in one year. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of iatrogenic Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient with WG.

### Kaposi sarcoma of childhood: Inborn or acquired immunodeficiency to oncogenic HHV-8 [^11126D4h]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an inflammatory neoplasm of endothelial cell origin first described by Hungarian dermatologist Moritz Kaposi in 1872. KS is likely a polyclonal proliferation of spindle cells latently infected by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), which often evolves into an oligoclonal or monoclonal disorder. It is currently classified under four epidemiologic forms. Classic KS primarily affects elderly men, mostly over 60 years old and of Eastern European and Mediterranean origin, typically presenting with indolent and chronic cutaneous plaques and nodules. Endemic KS in Sub-Saharan Africa affects younger adults with a rapidly progressive lymphadenopathic course. Epidemic KS occurs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, while iatrogenic KS occurs in medically immunosuppressed patients (e.g. those who have undergone transplantation), typically following a rapidly progressive course affecting the skin, mucosae, lymphatic system, and visceral organs. HHV-8, also known as KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is the causative agent for all epidemiological forms of KS. The vast majority of individuals infected with HHV-8 (more than 40% in some populations, based on seroprevalence) do not develop KS. This virus can cause at least two other conditions: some forms of multicentric Castleman's disease and primary effusion lymphoma, both of which can occur without HHV-8 infection.

The prevalence of HHV-8 varies globally, with a high level of more than 40% seropositivity in parts of Africa.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^114P1wpP]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is associated with the use of glucocorticoids.

All variables included in the univariate and multivariate analyses are listed in Table 1. The univariate analysis indicated that glucocorticoid use was more frequent in individuals with KS-IRIS than in those without KS-IRIS (54.9% vs. 36.47%, P = 0.0474). After adjusting for possible confounding variables, glucocorticoid use was still a risk factor for the development of KS-IRIS (unadjusted OR = 2.045, 95% CI = 1.005–4.16, P = 0.0484; adjusted OR = 2.3622, 95% CI = 1.0838–5.149, P = 0.0306). Individuals treated with glucocorticoids had a significantly higher hazard ratio for KS-IRIS than those not treated with glucocorticoids (P = 0.03).

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112SvqT4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

The follow-up and surveillance for Kaposi sarcoma, as mentioned in the NCCN 2019 guidelines, emphasize optimizing and monitoring HIV control and immune function in patients with HIV to minimize risk. It is important to recognize that this risk depends on immune function and typically decreases with immune reconstitution. However, Kaposi sarcoma can persist, relapse, or present even when T-cell subset values are normal.

- **HIV viral load and T-cell subsets**: Consider less frequent (every 6–12 months) oncology monitoring for selected patients with undetectable HIV viral loads, normal T-cell subsets, and stable Kaposi sarcoma for two or more years, provided the patient has regular follow-up with an HIV provider.

### Insights into the molecular biology and sero-epidemiology of Kaposi's sarcoma [^111VGoJf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in established market economies has fallen since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it remains the most common tumor in individuals with HIV infection. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, and its role in the subversion of cellular machinery provides an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in immunobiology and carcinogenesis. This review discusses articles published from August 2001 to August 2002, highlighting advances in our knowledge of this process and reviewing new data concerning the transmission and identification of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection in different populations.

- **Recent findings**: We have an improved understanding of the epidemiologies of classic, endemic, post-transplant, and AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. The role of specific genes in tumorigenesis has been further defined, with particular reference to the switch from latent to lytic infection and the involvement of cytokines and angiogenic factors.

- **Summary**: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is widespread in immunosuppressed individuals and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The study of Kaposi's sarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus represents an important model of the interplay between the immune system and cancer, and may lead to the development of clinically useful therapies, including vaccines.

### Bartonellosis [^112SxR74]. Clinics in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Bartonella spp are fastidious bacteria that occur in the blood of humans and mammals; they are usually vector-borne but can also be transmitted by animal scratches and bites. The bartonelloses of medical importance include Carrión's disease, trench fever, cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, and peliosis hepatis. Carrión's disease, known as Oroya fever in the acute phase and verruga peruana (Peruvian wart) in its chronic form, manifests in curious ways that, until recently, were geographically restricted to dwellers of the high, dry Andean valleys. However, new sites of the disease are emerging. Trench fever is associated with louse-borne disease and homelessness. Cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, and peliosis hepatis are increasingly recognized as causes of human disease, especially in susceptible population groups such as HIV-infected individuals. Bartonella spp are considered emerging human pathogens. The clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions are discussed.

### HIV/AIDS: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus disease: Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease [^114AMRht]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection is linked to the development of three proliferative diseases: Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. These conditions are closely associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and significant synergistic interactions between these two viruses have been documented. Despite differences in viral gene expression patterns in each condition, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes similar oncogenic proteins that facilitate the activation of sequential and parallel signaling pathways.

Therapeutic strategies have been implemented to target these unique signaling pathways. This molecular targeting is a major focus of many research efforts. The scope of this review is to present contemporary knowledge about the epidemiology, virology, and immunology of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and to highlight several key oncogene products that may serve as targets for chemotherapy.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology [^117Pqy7M]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, specifically for limited cutaneous cases, the 2019 NCCN guidelines recommend treating patients with relapsed or progressive disease after first-line therapy similarly to those with advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal Kaposi sarcoma. It is advised to perform a biopsy of lesions in cases of progressive, relapsed, or refractory disease, as these may be areas of post-inflammatory pigment or potential mimickers of Kaposi sarcoma. If Kaposi sarcoma is confirmed, evaluate for inadequate HIV control as a contributing factor to the inadequate control of the disease, and address possible changes in antiretroviral therapy in conjunction with an HIV specialist. Consider repeating the use of previously effective therapy if Kaposi sarcoma relapses or progresses after an initial response, particularly if the response was durable.

### Today's Kaposi sarcoma is not the same as it was 40 years ago, or is it [^113LMKg1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

This review provides an overview of the notion that Kaposi sarcoma (KS) manifests under diverse and divergent circumstances. We begin with a historical introduction of KS and KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We highlight the diversity of clinical presentations of KS, summarize what is known about the cell of origin for this tumor, explore KSHV viral load as a potential biomarker for acute KSHV infections and KS-associated complications, and discuss immune modulators that impact KSHV infection, KSHV persistence, and KS disease.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^115uNxz2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Although it has been proposed that the risk of Kaposi sarcoma among HIV-infected individuals who have responded to cART may be a function of age and/or the duration of HIV infection, this association has not, to our knowledge, been fully explored. We, therefore, used a large dataset of men with well-estimated dates of HIV seroconversion (i.e. change in status from being HIV antibody negative to having HIV antibody detected) to evaluate whether the duration of HIV infection and age were associated with the risk of Kaposi sarcoma among HIV-infected homosexual men after the initiation of cART.

Associations of aspects of immunosuppression with risk were also explored, including CD4 cell count, HIV RNA level, nadir CD4 cell count (i.e. the lowest CD4 cell count ever recorded for an individual), and time-weighted average CD4 cell count throughout follow-up since HIV seroconversion. We also explored associations between various CD4 cell levels and Kaposi sarcoma incidence among non-treated and cART-treated HIV-infected men to evaluate the extent to which the association between starting cART and risk of Kaposi sarcoma may be mediated through CD4 cell count.

Finally, because individuals who are known to have undergone HIV seroconversion are, by definition, diagnosed and come under medical care after infection, we compared our estimates of survival following a Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis with those derived from other cohorts of patients with prevalent HIV infection to provide information on whether late diagnosis of HIV is associated with prognosis for Kaposi sarcoma.

### Latent and lytic HHV-8 mRNA expression in PBMCs and Kaposi's sarcoma skin biopsies of AIDS Kaposi's sarcoma patients [^114yzomJ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is associated with all clinical forms of Kaposi's sarcoma. HHV-8 DNA is present in Kaposi's sarcoma biopsies, regularly observed in saliva, and less consistently in the blood of Kaposi's sarcoma patients. The expression pattern of latent (ORF 73) and lytic (vGCR, vBcl-2, and vIL-6) HHV-8 mRNA was studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples and Kaposi's sarcoma skin biopsies from 11 AIDS Kaposi's sarcoma patients. This was done using four different nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assays. Patients were divided into groups according to the clinical stage of Kaposi's sarcoma (stage I-IV). All biopsies were positive for two or more of the mRNA measured. No clear difference could be seen in the expression pattern in the lesions of the different clinical stages.

In the corresponding PBMC samples, very little or no mRNA was measurable in the patients with Kaposi's sarcoma stage I or II, whereas patients with more advanced Kaposi's sarcoma (stage III or IV) had more detectable mRNA in the PBMCs. Thus, the HHV-8 DNA load in the PBMCs increases in more advanced Kaposi's sarcoma, as does the frequency of mRNA detection in PBMCs.

### Evidence for Kaposi sarcoma originating from mesenchymal stem cell through KSHV-induced mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition [^114B69f8]. Cancer Research (2018). Low credibility.

The major transmission route for Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection is the oral cavity through saliva. Kaposi sarcoma (KS) frequently occurs in the oral cavity in HIV-positive individuals and is often the first presenting sign of AIDS. However, the oral target cells for KSHV infection and the cellular origin of Kaposi sarcoma remain unknown.

Here, we present clinical and experimental evidence that Kaposi sarcoma spindle cells may originate from virally modified oral mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). AIDS-KS spindle cells expressed the neuroectodermal stem cell marker Nestin and the oral MSC marker CD29, suggesting an oral/craniofacial MSC lineage of AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma.

Furthermore, oral MSCs were highly susceptible to KSHV infection, and infection promoted multilineage differentiation and mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition (MEndT). KSHV infection of oral MSCs resulted in the expression of a large number of cytokines, a characteristic of Kaposi sarcoma, and the upregulation of Kaposi sarcoma signature and MEndT-associated genes.

These results suggest that Kaposi sarcoma may originate from pluripotent MSCs and that KSHV infection transforms MSCs to Kaposi sarcoma-like cells through MEndT.

- **Significance**: These findings indicate that Kaposi sarcomas, which arise frequently in AIDS patients, originate from neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cells, with possible implications for improving the clinical treatment of this malignancy.

### Classic Kaposi's sarcoma in a Nepalese woman from a purportedly nonendemic area [^113E8rjd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) occurs in four types: classic, endemic, immunosuppression-associated, and AIDS-associated. The presence of KS-associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8) DNA in the tissue samples of 95% of all variants of KS has confirmed its role in the etiopathogenesis of KS. It is now believed that these clinical variants most likely represent different manifestations of the same pathological process. Our case represents the first report of classic KS from our region.

### Skin diseases associated with Bartonella infection: Facts and controversies [^111fbKmx]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The genus *Bartonella* is composed of a series of species and subspecies. Ten of them are responsible for human infections. The best-identified diseases are cat scratch disease (*B. henselae* and possibly *B. clarridgeiae*), trench fever (*B. quintana*), bacillary angiomatosis (*B. quintana* and *B. henselae*), and the spectrum of verruga peruana, Carrion disease, and Oroya fever (*B. bacilliformis*). Controversies exist about the implication of a few other microorganisms being involved in these diseases. Several other conditions have been associated with the presence of *Bartonella* spp, but these observations await confirmation.

### HIV patient with painless bilateral external ear nodules [^112hC9y9]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis**: What is your diagnosis?
A. Sarcoidosis
B. Bacillary angiomatosis
C. Kaposi sarcoma
D. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia
E. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma

- **Answers**:

A. Sarcoidosis — Incorrect. Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that may also rarely manifest with skin-colored nodules of the external ear but can be differentiated from Kaposi sarcoma (KS) according to histopathologic findings of noncaseating granulomas.

B. Bacillary angiomatosis — Incorrect. Bacillary angiomatosis is caused by Bartonella henselae, a gram-negative zoonotic bacterium that also commonly infects immunocompromised patients. It is often clinically indistinguishable from KS but can be differentiated on histopathologic examination, which reveals bacilli and a neutrophilic infiltrate.

C. KS — Correct. This patient has KS, a malignant proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, most commonly associated with HIV. KS of the ear is a rare occurrence that typically occurs unilaterally. There is a predilection for KS of the ear to appear in HIV-negative patients, which makes this case with bilateral ear involvement in an HIV-positive patient a unique presentation of KS.

D. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia — Incorrect. Although angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia also commonly manifests on the head and neck, it is not associated with immunosuppression. In addition, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia can be differentiated from KS by the presence of eosinophils on histopathologic analysis.

E. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma — Incorrect. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma can be differentiated from KS through clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1135UZNZ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining the following workup in selected patients:

- **Pregnancy testing**: for patients of childbearing potential if chemotherapy or radiation therapy is planned.

- **Opportunistic infections evaluation**: for suspected infections.

- **Advanced involvement evaluation**: in cases of advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal involvement, conduct stool hemoccult tests.

- **Pulmonary assessment**: Perform chest X-ray (CXR) for advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal disease, or any pulmonary symptoms. If unexplained pulmonary symptoms or abnormalities are present on CXR, conduct a chest CT with contrast and bronchoscopy.

- **Gastrointestinal assessment**: Conduct abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast or MRI with and without contrast, and EGD/colonoscopy if there are gastrointestinal symptoms or positive hemoccult tests.

- **Coexisting conditions assessment**: Use FDG-PET/CT and/or laboratory workup if there are concerns for coexisting Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-associated inflammatory cytokine syndrome, multicentric Castleman disease, KSHV-positive lymphoma, or other KSHV-associated diseases. Laboratory workup, including CRP, KSHV serum viral load, SPEP, IL-6, or IL-10, is useful in patients with clinical features such as fever, dyspnea, and effusions concerning for KSHV-associated inflammatory cytokine syndrome or KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease.

- **Cardiac evaluation**: Conduct a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) if anthracycline is planned or for suspected pericardial effusion.

### Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-negative men having sex with men [^114xSD3f]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

Four epidemiologic forms of Kaposi's sarcoma have been described, all of which are associated with human herpesvirus-8. In Western countries, human herpesvirus-8 is more prevalent in homosexual men than in the general population, and anecdotal cases of Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-negative homosexual men have been reported.

- **Patients and methods**: We included HIV-negative homosexual and bisexual male patients with histologically proven Kaposi's sarcoma in a retrospective study. Clinical data were collected using a standardized form. Risk factors for human herpesvirus-8 infection and for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma were systematically recorded.

- **Results**: Between 1995 and 2007, 28 men met the defined inclusion criteria. The mean age at first symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma was 53 years. Clinical presentation resembled classical Kaposi's sarcoma, with limited disease in most patients. No cellular or humoral immunodeficiency was observed. Serologic tests for human herpesvirus-8 (latent immunofluorescence assay) were positive in 88% of patients, and only two patients displayed human herpesvirus-8 viremia at the time of Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosis. Three patients developed lymphoproliferative disorders (Castleman disease, follicular lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma). In this population, alpha-interferon was well tolerated and gave a complete response, but most patients require only local treatment, if any.

- **Conclusion**: Kaposi's sarcoma may develop in homosexual or bisexual men without HIV infection. This type of Kaposi's sarcoma has clinical features in common with classic Kaposi's sarcoma.

### Bartonella henselae in skin biopsy specimens of patients with cat-scratch disease [^114Miety]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

We isolated B. henselae from skin biopsy specimens of three patients with CSD. Typically, patients with CSD experience gradual regional lymph node enlargement, accompanied by a papule that develops along the scratch line after 3–10 days. This papule may last from a few days to as long as 2–3 weeks. The histopathologic appearance of the skin lesion is comparable to lymph node changes, consisting of a diffuse inflammatory cell infiltrate with numerous neutrophils and histiocytes interspersed with scattered eosinophils and plasma cells.

Other less common skin manifestations include morbilliform eruptions, urticaria, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme, and erythema marginatum. Wear et al. first proposed the presence of B. henselae in the skin papule, reporting that the primary inoculation site and lymph nodes of patients with CSD contained the same small Gram-negative bacilli. Using immunohistochemical stain, Lin et al. found B. henselae in the cytoplasm of histiocytes within granulomatous lesions in nine lymph nodes and one skin biopsy specimen from patients with CSD. Avidor et al. identified B. henselae in the inflammatory papules and pustules of two patients with CSD. Our group recently identified B. henselae in patients with scalp eschars and neck lymphadenopathy following tick bites. Furthermore, Fournier et al. detected B. henselae in two skin biopsy specimens of a primary papule from patients in Australia who were clinically suspected of having CSD.

However, swabs of lesions for the diagnosis and culture of B. henselae are not widely used. Fournier et al. reported that swabs taken from six primary skin papules from patients did not yield successful cultures of B. henselae.

### Molecularly targeted therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma in a kidney transplant patient: Case report, "what worked and what did not" [^112S2xEG]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for which there is limited information regarding its effects on AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and none in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used for kidney transplants, exhibits antiangiogenic activity related to impaired production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Clinical benefit has been reported in Kaposi's sarcoma associated with renal grafts.

- **Case presentation**: Here we report a case of an 80-year-old male who developed Kaposi's sarcoma nine months after receiving a living non-related donor kidney transplant at age 74. Three years after treatment with different chemotherapeutic agents for progressive cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, with no visceral involvement, he was prescribed Imatinib (200 mg/day for two weeks followed by 400 mg/day). After four weeks of treatment, he developed anasarca, further progression of Kaposi's sarcoma, and agranulocytosis. Imatinib was discontinued, and there was significant clinical recovery. One year later, his immunosuppressive therapy was changed to Sirolimus, and regression of the Kaposi's sarcoma occurred.

- **Conclusion**: The lack of benefit and severe toxicity associated with the use of Imatinib in this patient should alert clinicians to the potentially adverse consequences of its use in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. On the other hand, the positive response seen in this patient to Sirolimus, even following a long evolution of Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple chemotherapy regimens, and extensive cutaneous disease, further suggests its therapeutic potential.

### Kshv/hhv-8 associated Kaposi's sarcoma in lymph nodes concurrent with Epstein-Barr virus associated Hodgkin lymphoma [^113tV4Sj]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

The unusual occurrence of metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in a lymph node affected by Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) was originally reported when the specific virological features of these tumors were not well understood.

- **Aim**: To re-evaluate this case by assessing whether the simultaneous presence of the two tumors was linked with common aetiopathogenetic factors.

- **Methods**: The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was investigated by in situ hybridisation, whereas KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)/human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) was detected by immunohistochemistry. Both viruses were analyzed in the case reported, in 30 lymph nodes from patients with classic HL, and in 22 skin biopsies from patients with KS.

- **Results**: Consistent with findings in HL and KS cases analyzed, in the case showing features of both HL and KS in the same lymph node, EBV was detectable only in Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells but not in KS spindle cells, whereas KSHV/HHV-8 was detectable only in KS spindle cells and not in RS cells.

- **Conclusion**: It is probable that the development of KS and HL was related to two independent aetiological cofactors — KSHV/HHV-8 and EBV, respectively — and that the occurrence of the two malignancies in the same patient was merely fortuitous.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Kaposi sarcoma [^112tbfkv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common neoplasm among people living with HIV today. In Sub-Saharan Africa, KS ranks among the most common cancers in men overall. Not only are HIV-positive individuals at risk, but any immunocompromised person infected with KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus 8 is vulnerable, including the elderly, children in KSHV-endemic areas, and transplant recipients. Diagnosing KS involves detecting the viral protein latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) in a biopsy. However, not all cases of KS are identical, nor will they all respond to the same therapy. Although standard KS therapy has remained unchanged for 20 years, newer modalities are emerging and will be discussed.

### Genotypic and clinicopathological characterization of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection in Japan [^115FQr3r]. Journal of medical virology (2010). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally related to Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and a subset of cases of multicentric Castleman's disease. As the number of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has increased, KSHV-associated diseases have also increased in Japan. Sporadic cases of classic Kaposi's sarcoma have also been reported in Japan. In the present study, the clinicopathological characteristics of 75 samples, comprising 68 cases of Kaposi's sarcoma, 5 cases of primary effusion lymphoma, and 5 cases of multicentric Castleman's disease were investigated. All of these cases were positive for KSHV by immunohistochemistry or PCR analysis.

All fifty-two of the AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma cases were males, whereas 7 of the 13 non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma cases were females. The mean age of patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma or primary effusion lymphoma was 46 years, whereas the mean age of patients with non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma or primary effusion lymphoma was 71.8 and 97.5 years, respectively.

KSHV genotypes were determined based on the sequence of variable region 1 in the K1 gene. Genotypes A and C of KSHV were detected in both AIDS- and non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Genotype A was detected more frequently in AIDS-associated cases than in non-AIDS-associated cases, suggesting that genotype C is broadly distributed in Japan, while genotype A spreads among AIDS patients. Genotype D was detected only in non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. These data confirmed the difference between AIDS- and non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

### Hiv-associated Kaposi sarcoma and related diseases [^116Fm5i9]. AIDS (2017). Low credibility.

The search for the etiologic agent for Kaposi sarcoma led to the discovery of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in 1994. KSHV, also called human herpesvirus-8, has since been shown to be the etiologic agent for several other tumors and diseases, including primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), an extracavitary variant of PEL, KSHV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a form of multicentric Castleman disease, and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome. KSHV encodes several genes that interfere with innate and specific immunity, thwart apoptosis, enhance cell proliferation and cytokine production, and promote angiogenesis, and these play important roles in disease pathogenesis.

HIV is an important cofactor in Kaposi sarcoma pathogenesis, and widespread use of antiretroviral therapy has reduced Kaposi sarcoma incidence. However, Kaposi sarcoma remains the second most frequent tumor arising in HIV-infected patients in the United States and is particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa. KSHV prevalence varies substantially in different populations. KSHV is secreted in saliva, and public health measures to reduce its spread may help reduce the incidence of KSHV-associated diseases.

Although there have been advances in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma, KSHV-multicentric Castleman disease, and PEL, improved therapies are needed, especially those that are appropriate for Kaposi sarcoma in resource-poor regions.

### Bartonella henselae in skin biopsy specimens of patients with cat-scratch disease [^116shi1m]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

During the past two years, we identified live Bartonella henselae in the primary inoculation sites of three patients following a cat scratch. Although our data are preliminary, we report that a cutaneous swab of the skin lesion from a patient in the early stage of cat-scratch disease can be useful for diagnosing the infection.
