## Question

What is the recommended dosing for Tessalon?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosing for Tessalon (benzonatate) with attention to adult and pediatric dosing, maximum daily dose, administration instructions, special populations, pharmacokinetics, safety, and key counseling points to prevent harm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the labeled indication and age limits. Then, I should verify standard dosing ranges and the absolute maximum dose. Next, I will check critical administration warnings and pediatric safety concerns. After that, I should review special populations and pharmacokinetics that affect onset and duration. Finally, I will synthesize safety signals, evidence on effectiveness, and practical counseling pearls to ensure safe use.

> Let me first confirm the identity and indication to anchor dosing. Benzonatate is a peripherally acting non-narcotic antitussive indicated for symptomatic relief of cough in adults and children older than 10 years, acting by anesthetizing stretch receptors in the respiratory tract to reduce the cough reflex [^112dv3J8] [^115MALtT].

> I need to verify the usual adult and pediatric (age > 10 years) dose. The labeled and SPL-consistent regimen is 100 to 200 mg by mouth three times daily as needed, with available capsule strengths of 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg used in TID schedules for cough suppression [^113CLaXs] [^112dv3J8] [^115w3zGA].

> Wait, let me double-check the ceiling dose before we move on. The maximum recommended daily dose is 600 mg per day, given in three divided doses, and escalation to the upper limit should be reserved for patients who require more aggressive cough suppression after demonstrating tolerance to lower doses [^113CLaXs] [^112dv3J8] [^115w3zGA].

> Hold on, I should verify administration precautions because errors here can be catastrophic. Capsules must be swallowed whole and not broken, chewed, dissolved, cut, or crushed, as local anesthetic release in the oropharynx can precipitate severe reactions including bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and cardiovascular collapse, occasionally necessitating vasopressors and advanced support [^112dv3J8] [^115w3zGA] [^111QzdW9] [^113BmwBA].

> Let me consider pediatric safety next because the risk profile differs starkly by age. Safety and effectiveness are not established in children under 10 years, and accidental ingestion in this group has been associated with rapid-onset toxicity within 15–20 minutes and death within 1 hour, so benzonatate should be kept strictly out of reach and avoided in children younger than 10 years [^112TiUke] [^112dv3J8] [^115w3zGA] [^111QzdW9] [^113BmwBA].

> I should confirm pregnancy guidance and acknowledge limitations. Labeling describes benzonatate as pregnancy category C, with no adequate animal or human data, so it should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and after weighing risks and benefits in shared decision-making [^114ArLWJ] [^1116oPpG] [^113Qbqos].

> Next, I should review dosing in renal and hepatic impairment because this often changes antitussive choices. There is no specific dosing guidance or adjustment information provided for renal dysfunction or chronic liver disease in the SPL, so clinicians should use caution, consider alternatives when appropriate, and monitor for adverse effects if used [^11672WwM] [^111JMM9g].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetics to contextualize dose timing. Onset of action is typically 15–20 minutes with duration of effect around 3–8 hours, and benzonatate is chemically related to para-aminobenzoic acid class local anesthetics, without direct depression of the respiratory center when used as recommended [^115EW3Bc] [^117HijpH] [^1174iBVA].

> Wait, let me verify the toxicity profile, especially in overdose scenarios. Overdose can present rapidly with seizures, ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, coma, hypotension, and death, often within an hour of ingestion; both labeling warnings and toxicology data underscore the need for strict household safety and immediate medical evaluation after accidental ingestion [^111QzdW9] [^113BmwBA] [^111mRHsc] [^111qJfJL].

> I need to ensure I cover adverse effects at therapeutic doses as well. Reported reactions include CNS effects such as dizziness, confusion, and visual hallucinations, respiratory reactions including bronchospasm and laryngospasm, cardiovascular collapse, and other systemic and dermatologic reactions; caution is warranted with concomitant CNS-active agents or alcohol given potential additive effects [^117Nj9HZ] [^1119DnkV] [^112NvyeE].

> But wait, what about evidence of effectiveness in acute viral cough, since not all antitussives perform equally there. In a small randomized crossover study using a capsaicin cough-challenge model in adults with acute URI, guaifenesin reduced cough-reflex sensitivity versus placebo whereas benzonatate 200 mg did not; notably, the combination of benzonatate plus guaifenesin suppressed cough-reflex sensitivity more than either agent alone, suggesting potential benefit of combination therapy despite limited standalone evidence for benzonatate in this setting [^112Fvu2W].

> Let me reconsider the practical prescribing summary to be sure no detail is missed. For adults and children over 10 years, use 100–200 mg orally three times daily as needed, not to exceed 600 mg/day; counsel patients to swallow capsules whole and never chew or crush; keep medication locked away from children given the candy-like appearance and risk of fatal ingestion; avoid use in children under 10 years; and escalate dosing only if necessary after ensuring tolerability and benefit, with vigilance for neuropsychiatric and respiratory adverse effects [^113CLaXs] [^112dv3J8] [^115w3zGA] [^111QzdW9] [^113BmwBA].

### Benzonatate [^115EW3Bc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Benzonatate acts peripherally by anesthetizing the stretch receptors located in the respiratory passages, lungs, and pleura. This action dampens their activity, thereby reducing the cough reflex at its source. It begins to act within 15 to 20 minutes, and its effect lasts for 3 to 8 hours. Benzonatate has no inhibitory effect on the respiratory center when taken in recommended dosages.

### Pediatric dose selection [^116XoUJM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Selection of a drug dose in pediatrics is generally based on inadequate or incomplete pharmacokinetic data. Traditionally, allometric or scaling techniques have been used; however, they have inherent limitations and may not make optimal use of the drug-specific clinical pharmacokinetic information that is available. Modeling is a tool that holds promise. The future challenge is to create a structured approach to determining pediatric doses for new therapeutic agents.

### Haloperidol lactate [^116Upgo4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is considerable variation in the amount of medication required for treatment from patient to patient. As with all drugs used to treat schizophrenia, the dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.

To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.

Parenteral medication, administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 mg to 5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely agitated schizophrenic patient with moderately severe to very severe symptoms. Depending on the response of the patient, subsequent doses may be given as often as every hour, although 4 to 8-hour intervals may be satisfactory. The maximum dose is 20 mg/day.

Controlled trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular administration in children have not been conducted.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Depakote [^113Ahd5e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Conversion to monotherapy**: Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50–100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Depakote therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Depakote may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg…

### Model-informed once-daily dosing strategy for bedaquiline and delamanid in children, adolescents and adults with tuberculosis [^115fTUPz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Simulated typical exposures of bedaquiline and delamanid in adults

Simulated typical average concentration profiles of bedaquiline and delamanid, along with maximum concentration profiles of their metabolites in adults under evaluated regimens, are presented in Figure 1. Both the registered dosing and novel model-informed once-daily dosing strategies for bedaquiline achieved peak concentrations at day 14, whereas the highest exposure in the ZeNix dosing scheme occurred at week 8, which is the end of the period given in a higher dose. Compared to the registered regimen, exposures of bedaquiline and its metabolite M2 were 14% higher in the novel model-informed once-daily dosing by the end of the 24-week treatment. Under ZeNix dosing, the cumulative AUC of bedaquiline was 50% lower than the registered and suggested once-daily dosing at day 14, but reached similar levels at 8 weeks. At 24 weeks, the ZeNix dosing approach yielded approximately 20% higher exposures than the registered dosing. For delamanid and its metabolite DM‐6705, the proposed 300-mg once-daily dose provided 13% lower exposures at steady-state. Predicted typical exposures of both drugs and their metabolites are summarized in Tables S1 and S2. Full concentration-time profiles for a typical adult individual are provided in Figure S2. Predicted exposures of both drugs in a representative adult population are displayed in Figure S3.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147cbF6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

The follow-up periods varied among the trials, ranging from 5 to 14 days in human studies and from 8 hours to 28 days in animal studies. Sushma et al. observed an average recovery time of 11.6 ± 6.4 days in the SB group until complete clinical recovery of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Shorter follow-up periods may have missed some effects, underscoring the importance of adequate follow-up time for assessing clinical improvement. Recovery from cerebral edema and neurological symptoms can take weeks, even after blood ammonia levels normalize.

The study was not limited to humans due to the limited number of trials conducted. While the animals studied (dogs and rats) possess functioning urea cycles in their livers similar to humans, the clinical relevance of the findings may be limited.

- **Animal models of HE**: In guidelines concerning animal models, rats with bile duct ligation and surgical portocaval shunts are considered excellent models of HE. In rats, hyperammonemia resulting from end-to-side portocaval shunts is associated with increased brain ammonia and glutamine, alongside reduced memory and learning ability. Dogs also exhibit changes in EEG and neurological status as plasma ammonia rises due to portal-systemic anastomosis. The varying results between the studies, where ammonia-lowering effects were observed in rats but not in dogs, could be attributed to differences in the animal models used.

- **Dosage considerations**: The dose used in the available trials might be considered lower than those recommended for patients with inherited urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Guidelines for managing acute hyperammonemia in UCD patients suggest a dose of 5.5 g/m²/day for individuals weighing over 20 kg.

### Benzodiazepines in clinical practice: Consideration of their long-term use and alternative agents [^117JrqZt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Despite the increasing focus on antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of therapeutic effect, and generally favorable side effect profile. In this article, we examine issues related to the long-term use of benzodiazepines, including concerns about the development of therapeutic tolerance, dose escalation, and adverse cognitive effects. We also consider currently available alternatives to benzodiazepines and novel mechanisms of action that may prove fruitful in the development of future generations of anxiolytics.

### Duramorph [^1149SAS2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Initial dosage**: The starting dose of Duramorph must be individualized. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Duramorph for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g. pain associated with surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, considering the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Duramorph. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

- **Dosage for intravenous administration**
- **Adult dosage**: The initial dose of morphine should be 2 mg to 10 mg/70 kg of body weight.

### Dose optimization during drug development: Whether and when to optimize [^111YAt2i]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

The goal of dose optimization during drug development is to identify a dose that preserves clinical benefit with optimal tolerability. Traditionally, the maximum tolerated dose in a small Phase I dose escalation study is used in the Phase II trial assessing clinical activity of the agent. Although this dose level could be altered in the Phase II trial if an unexpected level of toxicity is seen, no formal dose optimization has routinely been incorporated into later stages of drug development.

Recently, it has been suggested that formal dose optimization (involving randomly assigning patients between two or more dose levels) be routinely performed early in drug development, even before it is known that the experimental therapy has clinical activity at any dose level. We consider the relative merits of performing dose optimization earlier versus later in the drug development process and demonstrate that a considerable number of patients may be exposed to ineffective therapies unless dose optimization is delayed until after the clinical activity or benefit of the new agent has been established.

We conclude that patient and public health interests may be better served by conducting dose optimization after (or during) Phase III evaluation, with some exceptions when dose optimization should be performed after activity is shown in Phase II evaluation.

### Vimpat [^116G1gRc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage information**:
	- The recommended dosage for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older, and for adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older, is included in Table 1. In pediatric patients, the recommended dosing regimen is dependent upon body weight. Dosage should be increased based on clinical response and tolerability, no more frequently than once per week. Titration increments should not exceed those shown in Table 1.

	- In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, a dosage higher than 200 mg twice daily (400 mg per day) was not more effective and was associated with a substantially higher rate of adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

- **Vimpat injection dosage**:
	- Vimpat injection may be used when oral administration is temporarily not feasible [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. It can be administered intravenously to adult and pediatric patients weighing 6 kg or more, with the same dosing regimens described for oral dosing. For pediatric patients weighing less than 6 kg, Vimpat injection may be initiated with a dose of 0.66 mg/kg three times daily (see Table 1). The clinical study experience of intravenous Vimpat is limited to 5 days of consecutive treatment.

- **Alternate initial dosage information to achieve the maintenance dosage in a shorter timeframe**:
	- For monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 1…

### Inhibition of cough-reflex sensitivity by benzonatate and guaifenesin in acute viral cough [^112Fvu2W]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Acute cough due to viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is the most common form of cough and accounts for tremendous expenditure on prescription and non-prescription cough products worldwide. However, few agents have been shown in properly conducted clinical trials to be effective for cough due to URI.

The present study evaluated the effect of benzonatate 200mg (B), guaifenesin 600 mg (G), their combination (B+G), and placebo (P) on capsaicin-induced cough in 30 adult nonsmokers with acute URI. On three separate days within a seven-day period, one hour after ingesting randomly assigned study drug in a double-blind fashion, subjects underwent capsaicin cough challenge testing. This involved the inhalation of incremental doubling concentrations of capsaicin until the concentration inducing five or more coughs (C(5)) was attained. Each subject received three out of four possible study drugs.

Guaifenesin (p = 0.01), but not benzonatate (p = NS), inhibited cough-reflex sensitivity (log C(5)) relative to placebo. The combination of B+G suppressed capsaicin-induced cough to a greater degree than benzonatate alone (p < 0.001) or guaifenesin alone (p = 0.008). The mechanism by which the combination of B+G causes a potentiation of the antitussive effect remains to be elucidated. Our results suggest that B+G may be an effective therapy for acute cough due to the common cold (URI).

### Benzonatate [^1174iBVA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Benzonatate is chemically related to anesthetic agents of the para-aminobenzoic acid class, such as procaine and tetracaine. It has been associated with adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects, possibly related to a prior sensitivity to related agents or interaction with concomitant medication.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride [^111SFBk4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Buprenorphine HCl should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient's treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Buprenorphine HCl for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g. the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due to both the cause of pain and individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Buprenorphine HCl. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

Inspect Buprenorphine HCl for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1167Un45]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of the clinical trials, which included 96 episodes of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) from both the sodium benzoate (SB) and control groups, revealed a significant reduction in ammonia levels with SB compared with the control group, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27–1.51).

In contrast, a meta-analysis of the animal studies, involving 54 animals treated with SB and 38 in the control group, showed an effect size of 1.63 SMD (95% CI: −0.12 to 3.39) for SB compared with the control group; however, this result was not statistically significant.

When combining the results from all subjects treated with SB (either as monotherapy or combined therapy; n = 150) with the control group (either pretreatment subjects or control subjects; n = 134), SB demonstrated a significant reduction in ammonia levels, with an SMD of 1.17 (95% CI: 0.43–1.91).

Significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies, with an I² value of 85%. Egger's regression-based test showed a P-value of 0.245, indicating no significant publication bias. The results are illustrated in Figure 2.

- **Conversion to monotherapy**: Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of valproate sodium injection therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

### Bisacodyl: A review of pharmacology and clinical evidence to guide use in clinical practice in patients with constipation [^113BUziZ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

Kienzle-Horn et al. conducted a randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparison of the safety and efficacy of bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate (both 5–10 mg daily) over a 4-week period in 144 patients with chronic constipation (CC). Both treatments were equally effective in treating CC, with significant improvements in symptoms seen in both groups. Neither treatment significantly affected serum electrolytes.

- **Figure 4**: Serum levels of sodium and potassium at the beginning and end of treatment with bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, and placebo, respectively, for 4 weeks (mean ± SD).

In light of the limited head-to-head randomized controlled trials of treatments for CC, the clinically relevant efficacy and safety findings discussed above have been examined in systematic reviews and meta-analyses by Ford et al, Nelson et al, and Luthra et al. Ford et al. noted that the mean number of stools per week was significantly increased for both osmotic and stimulant laxatives compared with placebo in patients with CC. Nelson et al. observed similar efficacy between bisacodyl, prucalopride, lubiprostone, linaclotide, tegaserod, velusetrag, elobixibat, and sodium picosulfate for the primary endpoints of ≥ 3 complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week and an increase from baseline by ≥ 1 CSBM per week. However, the authors concluded that bisacodyl may be superior in the secondary endpoint of change from baseline of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week. Similar conclusions were reached in a recently published network meta-analysis by Luthra et al.

### Cardiac arrest with residual blindness after overdose of Tessalon® (benzonatate) perles [^111mRHsc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The extent to which benzonatate (Tessalon®), a structurally similar agent to other local anesthetics including tetracaine and procaine, poses a risk to the public is not fully appreciated as it is still one of the most widely prescribed antitussives available.

- **Objectives**: To report a case of cardiac arrest with residual blindness after Tessalon® overdose, review its clinical manifestations, toxicology, and management considerations, and describe the need for rational prescribing.

- **Case report**: A 17-year-old woman with no previous medical history presented to the Emergency Department (ED) status post cardiac arrest. One to two hours prior, the patient had ingested at least ten 200-mg Tessalon® capsules as part of a suicide attempt. The patient was sedated, intubated, and given magnesium as prophylaxis against dysrhythmias. Emergent gastric lavage was performed and well tolerated. A 24-hour hypothermia protocol with a 6-hour cooling period was initiated. Toxicological studies, chest radiograph, and a computed tomography scan of the head were all unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and supportive care. The patient was extubated and able to follow some commands one week post-admission. However, the patient developed blindness and experienced generalized confabulations, which did not resolve.

- **Conclusion**: Ingestion of Tessalon®, a seemingly innocuous and widely prescribed antitussive, may pose a risk to patients due to its potential for the rapid development of life-threatening adverse events and limited treatment options.

### Codeine sulfate [^113Z2Rfh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Codeine sulfate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of codeine sulfate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g. the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with codeine sulfate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments.

Pediatric poisonings account for significant morbidity in the United States each year. Clinicians must keep pace with advances in toxicology to remain familiar with the latest recommended treatment regimens and antidotes. They must also be adept at identifying toxidromes and noting important physical examination findings. Having these skills enables clinicians to determine which patients are at risk for significant morbidity or mortality and to provide appropriate medical care.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116yRKgT]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effect of sodium benzoate (SB) on hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Our analysis demonstrates a significant and dose-dependent reduction in ammonia levels in subjects with end-stage liver disease or portosystemic shunting. We reviewed 16 studies, including four clinical trials, five animal studies, and seven case reports. The meta-analysis of clinical trials revealed a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.27–1.51), indicating a favorable effect of SB. Improvements in mental status were observed in three of four randomized controlled trials. The incidence of adverse events associated with SB therapy was similar to that in control groups. However, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the impact of SB on the duration of hospital stay.

- **Evidence**: All four clinical trials involving humans reported a significant reduction in ammonia levels following SB treatment in patients with HE or portosystemic shunting. Three of these trials found this effect to be statistically significant compared with the control group. However, the largest and most recent trial (Snehavardhan et al.) only showed a significant reduction in ammonia levels compared with the control group during the first 2 days of treatment. In animal studies, SB consistently decreased ammonia levels in all but one study, where the effect was not significant compared with the control group.

The considerable variability in study results can be attributed to several methodological differences, including variations in subjects, treatment duration, follow-up periods, sample sizes, and study designs.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112T5iFF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with impaired liver function caused by end-stage liver disease or liver failure can develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE), where brain function is impaired. Even though the precise underlying pathophysiology of HE is unclear, it is widely accepted that increased amounts of ammonia in the systemic circulation are a key factor. Ammonia is produced during the metabolism of amino acids and other compounds containing nitrogen and in the intestine by intestinal bacterial flora. Physiologically, ammonia is cleared in the liver where it is converted to urea via the urea cycle. Urea is water-soluble and is subsequently excreted via the urine.

If this system is compromised, systemic ammonia levels can rise, potentially crossing the blood–brain barrier and causing brain damage. When ammonia levels rise acutely, astrocytes increase the conversion of ammonia into glutamine via glutamine synthase, which causes brain edema. Due to the increased glutamine production, there is also an increase in reactive oxygen species, which triggers inflammatory cascades. It is hypothesized that, in chronically elevated ammonia, the enzyme glutamine synthase is downregulated, resulting in lower glutamine and higher brain ammonia levels. Ammonia is directly neurotoxic, enhancing inhibitory signaling through multiple mechanisms, including GABA and glutamate. In patients with liver disease, HE is a predictor of poor outcome, associated with a 1-year mortality of up to 54%, making it a serious complication. Currently, treatment for HE in hepatic failure is limited.

### Optimizing the clinical pharmacology of tuberculosis medications [^116RDZLh]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) treatment has changed little in the past 40 years. The standard therapy requires four drugs for 2 months followed by two drugs for 4 months. This "short-course" regimen is not based on optimized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, but empiric evidence. A review of existing data suggests that pharmacokinetic variability with isoniazid and rifampin is greater than previously thought, and that efficacy is not as good as traditionally reported. Adding new drugs to the regimen will be costly and time-consuming. Maximizing the efficacy of the medications is a less expensive and more feasible option. This article reviews the potential of the first-line TB drugs (rifamycins, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), as well as the fluoroquinolones, to introduce a true short-course TB regimen.

### Benzonatate [^111QzdW9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

Warnings

- **Hypersensitivity**: Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and cardiovascular collapse, have been reported. These are possibly related to local anesthesia from sucking or chewing the capsule instead of swallowing it. Severe reactions have sometimes required intervention with vasopressor agents and supportive measures.

- **Psychiatric effects**: Isolated instances of bizarre behavior, including mental confusion and visual hallucinations, have also been reported in patients taking benzonatate in combination with other prescribed drugs.

- **Accidental ingestion and death in children**: Keep benzonatate capsules out of the reach of children. Accidental ingestion of benzonatate, resulting in death, has been reported in children below age 10. Signs and symptoms of overdose have been observed within 15–20 minutes, and death has been reported within one hour of ingestion. If accidental ingestion occurs, seek medical attention immediately (see OVERDOSAGE).

### Apadaz [^113NZ7Qd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

APADAZ should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of APADAZ for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. The total dosage of APADAZ and any concomitant acetaminophen-containing products should not exceed 4000 mg of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period.

### Sabril [^115H5e29]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Important dosing and administration instructions**: Use the lowest dosage and shortest exposure to Sabril consistent with clinical objectives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The Sabril dosing regimen depends on the indication, age group, weight, and dosage form (tablets or oral solution) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Patients with impaired renal function require dose adjustment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitoring Sabril plasma concentrations to optimize therapy is not helpful.

- **Administration**: Sabril is given orally, with or without food. Sabril for oral solution should be mixed with water prior to administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. If a decision is made to discontinue Sabril, the dose should be gradually reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Efficacy and safety of sodium benzoate in the management of hyperammonemia in decompensated chronic liver disease of the childhood - A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111HWnVP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sodium benzoate in the management of hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in decompensated chronic liver disease.

It was a prospective, interventional, double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted from August 2017 to December 2018. Children with decompensated chronic liver disease and hyperammonemia were included in the study. Those with ammonia > 400μg/dL, already receiving sodium benzoate, or with grade III ascites were excluded. Group A received sodium benzoate (400mg/kg loading dose followed by 200mg·kg·day maintenance for 5 days) along with standard medical therapy. Group B received standard medical therapy with placebo.

A total of 108 episodes of hyperammonemia occurred in 86 patients, of whom 16 were excluded. The final analysis included 46 episodes in each group. The median decrease in ammonia from baseline to day 5 was 52μg/dL in group A versus 42μg/dL in group B (P = 0.321). There was a significant decrease in ammonia on days 1 and 2 in group A compared to group B, but not on subsequent days. There was no significant difference in the resolution of HE (57.1% vs. 50%; P = 1), but there was a higher, albeit insignificant, increase in ascites in group A (15.9% vs. 4.5%).

Addition of sodium benzoate significantly reduced the ammonia levels on the first 2 days of therapy, but the effect was not sustained until day 5. The effect of sodium benzoate would probably be more sustained if a higher dosage (400mg·kg·day) could be used under monitoring of benzoate level.

**Precautions**: Benzonatate is chemically related to anesthetic agents of the para-amino-benzoic acid class (e.g. procaine, tetracaine) and has been associated with adverse CNS effects. These effects may possibly relate to a prior sensitivity to related agents or interaction with concomitant medication.

### Valproic acid [^112eN1WL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Valproic acid is intended for oral administration and is used in the treatment of epilepsy. Patients should be informed to take valproic acid every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it is almost time for the next dose. Under no circumstances should a patient double the next dose if a dose is skipped.

Valproic acid is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients as young as 10 years old, as well as for simple and complex absence seizures. As valproic acid dosage is increased, concentrations of other medications such as clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, tolbutamide, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Complex partial seizures**: Valproic acid is approved for adults and children aged 10 years or older.

	- **Monotherapy (Initial Therapy)**: Valproic acid has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Therapy should be initiated at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, with the dosage increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Typically, this response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to ensure they are within the usually accepted therapeutic range of 50 to 100 mcg/mL. No recommendation can be made regarding the safety of valproate at doses exceeding 60 mg/kg/day.

The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^114AYKQn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:

	- **Adults**: The usual oral dose of terbutaline sulfate for adults is 5 mg, administered at approximately six-hour intervals, three times daily, during the hours the patient is usually awake. If side effects are particularly disturbing, the dose may be reduced to 2.5 mg three times daily, while still providing a clinically significant improvement in pulmonary function. The total dose within 24 hours should not exceed 15 mg.

	- **Children**: Terbutaline sulfate is not recommended for use in children below the age of 12 years. A dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily is recommended for children aged 12 to 15 years. The total dose within 24 hours should not exceed 7.5 mg.

If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of seriously worsening asthma that would require reassessment of therapy.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116eu4m5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Another potential factor is the variability in remaining liver function across studies. Sodium benzoate (SB) needs to be conjugated in the hepatocytes to form an active metabolite that effectively removes glycine nitrogen via urine. If the liver function is completely bypassed due to shunting, this functionality will be compromised as well.

In addition, Sushma et al. included patients with recent onset of clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (less than 7 days), whereas other clinical trials included patients with chronic HE. Mechanisms of brain involvement differ between chronic and acute HE, and this may have influenced neurocognitive outcomes.

The clinical trials included in this review reported adverse events, primarily gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. It is important to note that SB may potentially cause fluid overload. Although no increase in fluid decompensation has been observed with SB in metabolic patients who generally do not have hepatic disease, it is worth noting that SB is administered in concentrations of 100 mg/ml in sodium chloride or glucose infusions, with dosages ranging from 250 to 500 mg/kg/day. Each 250 mg dose of SB contains 1.7 mmol of sodium, which could potentially contribute to fluid accumulation.

In Snehavardhan et al.'s study, there was a higher percentage of patients with ascites in the SB group compared with the placebo group, though this difference was not statistically significant but may be clinically relevant. No cases of hypernatremia were reported, and sodium levels did not significantly differ between groups.

### Depakoteer [^113ToDms]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Conversion to monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50–100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at the initiation of Depakote ER therapy or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive therapy

Depakote ER may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MBPrC]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025).

In the subgroup analysis of animal studies, pooled data were used for Campollo et al.'s study. In this study, three subgroups received an SB analog in different doses (250, 500, and 1000 mg). Pooled data were used instead of including the three subgroups apart from each other, as is preferable according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

With only a few trials performed with this drug for this specific indication, all studies demonstrate a positive effect, which could imply a successful drug or positive publication bias. To evaluate the risk of publication bias, Egger's regression-based test was performed, and this was not statistically significant, indicating a low risk for publication bias. Limitations of this test are that nine studies were included; 10 studies are generally considered to be the lower limit to use this test to distinguish real asymmetry.

Neurological assessment would have been our preferred primary outcome measurement for HE. Keeping in mind, however, that neurological assessment has not been described in all studies, differences in ammonia levels were chosen as the primary outcome instead, theorizing that this would allow for the inclusion of more articles. While measuring ammonia concentration to support the diagnosis of HE has been scrutinized due to poor correlation, studies have shown strong correlations between plasma ammonia levels and the severity of HE. The other toxic metabolites, such as glutamine in plasma and brain, would be future additional endpoints to take into account.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Percocet for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due to both the cause of pain and individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Percocet. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nxr16]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows (version 28.0.1.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). If studies included multiple subgroups all receiving sodium benzoate (SB) without additional medication, these subgroups were combined using the formula described in the Cochrane Handbook. If studies expressed data as mean and SEM, the standard deviation (SD) was calculated from this data to perform a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed using Cohen's d or standardized mean difference (SMD) by employing the DerSimonian-Laird method (random effects). Ammonia levels were compared between control and SB groups. In the absence of a control group, baseline data were used as control. Heterogeneity across included studies was assessed using I² statistics. Statistical significance was defined as a P-value equal to or less than 0.05. Following meta-analysis, Egger's regression-based test was performed to evaluate the risk of publication bias.

### Pentobarbital sodium [^115wfVgT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The treatment of barbiturate dependence involves a cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can be withdrawn using a number of different withdrawal regimens. In all cases, withdrawal takes an extended period of time. One method involves substituting a 30 mg dose of phenobarbital for each 100 to 200 mg dose of barbiturate that the patient has been taking. The total daily amount of phenobarbital is then administered in 3 to 4 divided doses, not to exceed 600 mg daily. If signs of withdrawal occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered intramuscularly in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the total daily dose is decreased by 30 mg a day as long as withdrawal is proceeding smoothly. A modification of this regimen involves initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and decreasing the daily dosage by 10 percent if tolerated by the patient.

Infants physically dependent on barbiturates may be given phenobarbital 3 to 10 mg/kg/day. After withdrawal symptoms such as hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, tremors, and hyperreflexia are relieved, the dosage of phenobarbital should be gradually decreased and completely withdrawn over a 2-week period.

### Twelve-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, comparative phase II/III study of benzoyl peroxide gel in patients with acne vulgaris: A secondary publication [^114J6XEL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Participants applied placebo during the observation period, which lasted 2 weeks before treatment initiation. During the 12-week treatment period, they applied either 2.5% or 5% benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or placebo. They were instructed to apply a sufficient quantity of the assigned drug to cover the entire face, avoiding lips and the area around the eyes, once daily at night after cleansing and drying their faces.

During the treatment period, the use of pharmaceutical agents, quasi‐drugs, or cosmetic products, including face washes with scrubbers and azelaic acid‐containing cosmetic products, was prohibited. This also included steroids, antimicrobials, and any other substances that might affect the evaluation of the study drug. However, continued administration of vitamins B2 and B6 for acne was permissible, provided that the dosage remained unchanged from the start of the observation period through the end of the study or until the study's discontinuation. Additionally, chemical peels of the face, laser therapy, phototherapy, comedone suction or extraction, other acne treatments, and esthetic facial procedures were not allowed.

Facial inflammatory lesions (IL) and non-inflammatory lesions (non‐IL) were counted by investigators at each visit. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in IL count from baseline to the final evaluation at week 12 or upon discontinuation. Secondary efficacy endpoints included percentage changes in total lesion (TL) and non‐IL counts from baseline to the final evaluation; absolute changes in TL, IL, and non‐IL counts from baseline to the final evaluation; and percentage changes in TL, IL, and non‐IL counts.

### Lortab [^115K8vWE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain and the response of the patient. It is essential to keep in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone may develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose-related.

The usual adult dosage is 11.25 milliliters every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. The total daily dosage for adults should not exceed 67.5 milliliters.

- **Dosage for children**: The usual dosages for children, to be given every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, correspond to an average individual dose of 0.20 mL/kg of Lortab elixir (providing 0.135 mg/kg of hydrocodone bitartrate and 4.0 mg/kg of acetaminophen). Dosing should be based on weight whenever possible. The total daily dosage for children should not exceed 6 doses per day.

It is of utmost importance that the dose of Lortab elixir be administered accurately. It is strongly recommended that caregivers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device. Health care providers should recommend a dropper that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage.

### Valproic acid [^111ZhyGF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Conversion to monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50–100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at the initiation of valproic acid therapy or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive therapy

Valproic acid may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

### Benzonatate [^113Qbqos]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

**Usage in pregnancy**: Benzonatate is classified as pregnancy category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with benzonatate, and it is unknown whether it can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproductive capacity. Benzonatate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### Lorazepam [^111YPeVt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lorazepam is a medication with specific pharmacokinetic properties crucial for its clinical use:

- **Absorption**:
	- **Intravenous**: A 4-mg dose provides an initial concentration of approximately 70 ng/mL.
	- **Intramuscular**: Following intramuscular administration, lorazepam is completely and rapidly absorbed, reaching peak concentrations within 3 hours. A 4-mg dose provides a Cmax of approximately 48 ng/mL. Following the administration of 1.5 to 5.0 mg of lorazepam IM, the amount of lorazepam delivered to the circulation is proportional to the dose administered.

- **Distribution/metabolism/elimination**: At clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam is 91 ± 2% bound to plasma proteins; its volume of distribution is approximately 1.3 L/kg. Unbound lorazepam penetrates the blood-brain barrier freely by passive diffusion, a fact confirmed by CSF sampling. Following parenteral administration, the terminal half-life and total clearance averaged 14 ± 5 hours and 1.1 ± 0.4 mL/min/kg, respectively. Lorazepam is extensively conjugated to the 3-O-phenolic glucuronide in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. Lorazepam glucuronide is an inactive metabolite and is eliminated mainly by the kidneys.

Following a single 2-mg oral dose of¹⁴C-lorazepam to 8 healthy subjects, 88 ± 4% of the administered dose was recovered in urine, and 7 ± 2% was recovered in feces. The percent of administered dose recovered in urine as lorazepam glucuronide was 74 ± 4%. Only 0.3% of the dose was recovered as unchanged lorazepam, and the remainder of the radioactivity represented minor metabolites.

### The use of a single dose of phenobarbital for inpatient management of benzodiazepine withdrawal: A case report [^115JHhS8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The standard of care for physiological dependence on benzodiazepines requires prolonged outpatient tapers, which present challenges for patients and providers. Novel protocols for accelerated benzodiazepine tapers are needed. We describe a case of successful management of benzodiazepine withdrawal in the inpatient setting using a single, loading dose of phenobarbital with adjunctive valproate therapy.

- **Case report**: A 61-year-old woman with benzodiazepine use disorder, using 3 to 4 mg of alprazolam daily, presented to an inpatient medically supervised withdrawal unit requesting discontinuation of all benzodiazepines and other recreational substances by the time of discharge. Benzodiazepine withdrawal was treated with a single, loading dose of intravenous phenobarbital in line with an approved protocol for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, as well as adjunctive valproate therapy. The patient experienced resolution of withdrawal symptoms, had no complications, and ongoing abstinence at 60 days of follow-up.

- **Discussion**: A single loading dose of phenobarbital in the inpatient setting is a viable alternative to prolonged outpatient tapers for the management of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Although this strategy requires further optimization, the prospect of a single-dose treatment for benzodiazepine withdrawal creates exciting opportunities for alternative management options and settings.

- **Conclusions**: This case describes the successful management of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome using a single loading dose of intravenous phenobarbital.

### Tecvayli [^114aammJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Administer the following pretreatment medications 1 to 3 hours before each dose of the Tecvayli step-up dosing schedule, which includes step-up dose 1, step-up dose 2, and the first treatment dose, to reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]:

- **Corticosteroid**: Oral or intravenous dexamethasone 16 mg
- **Histamine-1 (H1) receptor antagonist**: Oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 50 mg or equivalent
- **Antipyretics**: Oral or intravenous acetaminophen 650 mg to 1,000 mg or equivalent

Administration of pretreatment medications may be required prior to the administration of subsequent doses of Tecvayli in the following patients:

- Patients who repeat doses within the Tecvayli step-up dosing schedule following a dose delay [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
- Patients who experienced CRS following the prior dose of Tecvayli [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Prior to starting treatment with Tecvayli, consider the initiation of antiviral prophylaxis to prevent herpes zoster reactivation per guidelines.

If a dose of Tecvayli is delayed, restart therapy based on the recommendations in Table 2 and resume the treatment schedule accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Administer pretreatment medications as indicated in Table 2. Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicity, including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), patients should be hospitalized for 48 hours after the administration of all doses within the Tecvayli step-up dosing schedule.

### Sodium benzoate as an emerging but problematic allergen: Retrospective analysis of patch test results in 3198 cases underlines the need for an improved test preparation, as even dubious reactions may be clinically relevant [^115QR23s]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we have identified sodium benzoate as a significant allergen, warranting its inclusion in various patch test series. However, patch testing with it presents challenges due to the test preparation's tendency to induce weak allergic positive reactions in allergic individuals. This situation complicates the assessment and necessitates a high degree of suspicion for weak (+) or doubtful (?+) reactors for whom sodium benzoate may be a relevant allergen.

Lowering the concentration tested below the current 5% might reduce the high rate of irritancy but would also decrease relevant weak positives. Conversely, increasing the test concentration could produce stronger allergic positives but would undoubtedly result in more irritants and likely false allergic positives. Nonetheless, some refinement of the test material might resolve these dilemmas.

### Provera [^114gqXSH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Provera should be started at the lowest dose, and you should discuss with your healthcare provider how well that dose is working for you. The lowest effective dose of Provera has not been determined. Regular consultations with your healthcare provider every 3 to 6 months are recommended to discuss the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with Provera.

- **Absence of menstrual period**: Provera may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days.
- **Abnormal uterine bleeding**: Provera may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days.
- **Overgrowth of the lining of the uterus**: When used in combination with oral conjugated estrogens in postmenopausal women with a uterus, Provera may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month.

Possible side effects of Provera:

The following side effects have been reported with the use of Provera alone:

- **Menstrual and breast-related**: Breast tenderness, breast milk secretion, breakthrough bleeding, spotting (minor vaginal bleeding), irregular periods, amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods), vaginal secretions.
- **Neurological and psychological**: Headaches, nervousness, dizziness, depression, insomnia, sleepiness, fatigue, premenstrual syndrome-like symptoms.
- **Vascular**: Thrombophlebitis (inflamed veins), blood clot.
- **Dermatological**: Itching, hives, skin rash, acne, hair loss, hair growth.
- **Gastrointestinal and general**: Abdominal discomfort, nausea, bloating, fever.
- **Changes in weight and appearance**: Increase in weight, swelling, changes in vision and sensitivity to contact lenses.

### Roxybond [^114H6wAg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosage and administration instructions**: Roxybond should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Roxybond for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

Many acute pain conditions (e.g. pain associated with surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines for opioid prescribing in certain acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain, which can be influenced by both the cause of pain and individual patient factors.

### Oral and intravenous amoxicillin dosing recommendations in neonates: A pooled population pharmacokinetic study [^111jZHYT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The study examines the percentage of target attainment in a typical patient for oral amoxicillin 100 mg/kg/day administered every 12 hours (typical patient postnatal age 7 days) for a range of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) during the first day (0–24 hours) and second day (24–48 hours) of treatment. The primary outcome is highlighted in green, with an MIC of 8 mg/L. Abbreviations include MIC for minimal inhibitory concentration, q for every, q8 h for three times daily, and q12 h for two times daily.

- **International dosing regimen evaluation**: An overview of model-based dosing recommendations for both oral and intravenous amoxicillin treatment is presented, subdivided by age category. The selection of dosing recommendations is based on the mean percentage of simulated patients per age category who achieved 50% T > MIC (as detailed in Supplementary Tables 5A, 5B, 7A, and 7B). Delayed absorption following oral administration results in a twice-daily dosing recommendation. For intravenous administration, a three-times daily regimen is chosen for children with a PNA greater than 7 days, as it provides slightly better exposure and lower peak concentrations compared to a twice-daily regimen. Gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA) significantly impact amoxicillin exposure in neonates. Dosing regimens need to be adjusted based on these maturational indicators, irrespective of the route of administration.

### Pentobarbital sodium [^1163XrUD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of barbiturate dependence involves cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Patients who are dependent on barbiturates can use a variety of withdrawal regimens, and in all cases, withdrawal requires an extended period. One method includes substituting a 30 mg dose of phenobarbital for each 100 to 200 mg dose of barbiturate that the patient has been using. The total daily amount of phenobarbital is then divided into 3 to 4 doses, not exceeding 600 mg daily. If withdrawal signs occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered intramuscularly in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the daily dose is decreased by 30 mg per day as withdrawal proceeds smoothly. A modification of this regimen involves starting treatment at the patient's regular dosage level, then decreasing the daily dosage by 10 percent if the patient tolerates it.

Infants who are physically dependent on barbiturates may be given phenobarbital at 3 to 10 mg/kg/day. Once withdrawal symptoms (hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, tremors, hyperreflexia) are relieved, the phenobarbital dosage should be gradually reduced and fully withdrawn over a two-week period.

### Tivorbex [^116V3A3R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018).

- **Dosage and administration**: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. The dosage is 20 mg orally three times daily or 40 mg orally two or three times daily. Tivorbex capsules are not interchangeable with other formulations of oral indomethacin.

- **General dosing instructions**: Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Tivorbex and other treatment options before deciding to use Tivorbex. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. For treatment of mild to moderate acute pain, the dosage is 20 mg three times daily or 40 mg two or three times daily.

- **Non-interchangeability with other formulations of indomethacin**: Different dose strengths and formulations of oral indomethacin are not interchangeable. This difference should be taken into consideration when changing strengths or formulations.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112SEsGe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Two of the human studies evaluated the use of sodium benzoate (SB) alongside standard treatments, whereas the other two studies tested SB as monotherapy. In two of the animal studies, the effect of SB combined with other ammonia-lowering medication was studied. Campollo et al. examined SB with lactulose and found the combination was more effective in reducing ammonia levels than either drug alone. In Mejia et al.'s study, the effect of SB in combination with LOLA was studied and observed that the combined treatment led to a greater ammonia reduction than either medication used individually. These findings suggest that SB enhances the effect of other ammonia-lowering therapies. This additive effect is consistent with the standard care for urea cycle disorders (UCDs), where combined treatment with multiple drugs is common. For treating hepatic encephalopathy (HE) or acute hyperammonemia, SB is typically used as an adjunct therapy when standard treatments have failed or in acute situations where immediate effects are needed.

- **Limitations**: This study has several limitations. First, the evidence level from the included studies is lower than necessary for definite evidence. This is due to the limited number of papers on SB as an alternative treatment for HE in liver failure or shunting. The four randomized controlled human trials analyzed were small, involving only 195 patients in total. To strengthen the review, animal studies and case reports were also included. The quality assessment revealed a risk of bias in three of the four randomized controlled trials. Issues included the potential of unblinding of patients and/or investigators due to drug-specific effects.

### Benzonatate ingestion reported to the National Poison Center Database System (NPDS) [^111qJfJL]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Little has been published on benzonatate ingestion, though the few case reports suggest a significant risk of seizures following poisoning. A retrospective 7-year review analyzed all single substance ingestion cases of benzonatate reported to the National Poison Center Database System (NPDS) from 2000 to 2006. This review included 2,172 patients, of whom 1,280 (58%) were female. The mean age was 20 years, with 676 (30%) being under 6 years old. Serious outcomes occurred in 116 cases, classified as moderate (n = 81, 4%), major (n = 31, 1%), and death (n = 4, 0.2%). The mean age of those with serious outcomes was 21 years, with 41 (35%) being children under 6 years old.

Forty-nine percent (1,084) of patients were treated in a healthcare facility (HCF); 148 (7%) of these were admitted for medical care. Clinically significant effects documented included tachycardia (n = 31, 1%), agitation (n = 30, 1%), seizure (n = 23, 1%), coma (n = 14, 0.6%), ventricular dysrhythmia (n = 9, 0.4%), cardiac arrest (n = 8, 0.3%), hypotension (n = 7, 0.3%), and asystole (n = 6, 0.2%). Among patients with reported seizures, eight (0.4%) experienced multiple/discrete seizures, and two had documented status epilepticus. Dysrhythmias, but not seizures, occurred in all fatalities reviewed. Significant central nervous system and cardiac effects occurred in a small subset of patients (< 1%), while half received direct medical care in an HCF. No correlation between age and the severity of medical outcomes was detected through statistical analysis. A prospective study may be warranted to better evaluate potential HCF triage criteria, such as dosage, age, or preexisting conditions.
