## Question

What is the appropriate workup for a high serum copper level?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate workup for a high serum copper level, with emphasis on Wilson disease and copper biomarkers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming that the elevation is real and excluding physiologic or artifactual causes. Then, I should obtain a focused history and examination to stratify hepatic versus neurologic phenotypes. Next, I will order first-line laboratory tests to assess copper metabolism and liver injury. After that, I need to consider second-line diagnostics such as exchangeable copper metrics, hepatic copper quantification, and ATP7B genetic testing when results are equivocal. Finally, I should outline differential diagnoses, family screening, and principles for monitoring therapy and avoiding over- or under-treatment.

> Let me first confirm whether the serum copper is truly elevated and not an artifact or a physiologic rise; I should repeat the test in a copper-free collection tube after an overnight fast because copper is prone to contamination and shows diurnal variation, and I must review age, sex, pregnancy status, inflammatory markers, and estrogen or oral contraceptive use since ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant and will drive up total serum copper in these settings, potentially mimicking copper overload, while I also need to ask about supplements and drinking water sources as exogenous copper intake can transiently increase serum levels and mislead interpretation [^11317Qxf] [^1155BFdt] [^1179Kyh4] [^113aiHJJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before a careful bedside assessment; I will now obtain a focused history for family members with Wilson disease, unexplained liver disease, or neuropsychiatric illness and elicit hepatic symptoms such as jaundice or variceal bleeding and neurologic or psychiatric features like tremor, dystonia, dysarthria, mood changes, or psychosis, and I should perform a well-structured neurologic examination and arrange a slit-lamp exam for Kayser-Fleischer rings, because these clinical data anchor pretest probability and influence the choice and interpretation of subsequent copper tests [^114mWSnQ] [^111AXyCv] [^115PeRPJ].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory panel; I need to check serum ceruloplasmin recognizing that extremely low values below about 5 mg/dL strongly suggest Wilson disease but normal values do not exclude it, measure a basal 24-hour urinary copper with cutoffs of greater than 100 μg/24 h in symptomatic patients and greater than 40 μg/24 h in asymptomatic or pediatric patients as thresholds that mandate further work-up, obtain liver tests to gauge severity, and assess a complete blood count and Coombs test because Coombs-negative hemolysis plus liver failure raises alarm for Wilson disease, and if available, I should measure exchangeable copper and calculate relative exchangeable copper since REC values at or above roughly 14–18% have shown strong diagnostic performance, although I need to confirm local assay performance and context, particularly in acute liver failure and pediatrics [^113ZpQ3Y] [^113AudPD] [^116LSVJ3] [^114ZyFwR] [^1112hxWt].

> Wait, let me verify the role and limitations of "free" copper calculations; the traditional non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper is estimated by subtracting the ceruloplasmin-bound copper (assuming approximately 3 μg of copper per mg ceruloplasmin) from total serum copper, but this approach is undermined by variability in ceruloplasmin assays and can produce biologically implausible negative values, so while NCC can be trend-informative in follow-up, I should avoid relying on it for diagnosis, and consider exchangeable copper methods or REC where available and validated locally [^1116REez] [^1156X1jj] [^115jXupA] [^115ZUfdr] [^114ZyFwR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, in suspected Wilson-related acute liver failure I should rapidly integrate bedside clues; I will now examine for Coombs-negative hemolysis, relatively low aminotransferases, and a low alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin ratio below 4 since these patterns can support an ALF-WD phenotype, but I should confirm performance in the clinical context because pediatric data suggest these ratios perform less well, and when available I should prioritize REC given reports of excellent discrimination in ALF with cutoffs around 14–14.4%, while remembering that no single test is perfect and treatment should not be delayed in life-threatening scenarios [^116LSVJ3] [^115Tx8FQ] [^113amyPC].

> I need to ensure second-line diagnostics are considered when first-line tests are equivocal; if noninvasive results remain indeterminate, I should consider liver biopsy with quantitative hepatic copper on dry weight, where values at or above 250 μg/g strongly support Wilson disease in the absence of cholestasis and values below 50 μg/g essentially exclude untreated disease, and I must request histology on the core but recognize that histology is not pathognomonic and that cholestatic diseases can elevate hepatic copper and confound interpretation, so the copper value must be read in full clinical context [^1155BFdt] [^117V5tAc] [^113Kg9qc] [^117DthUu].

> Let me consider molecular confirmation now; I should obtain ATP7B genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis when biochemical testing is supportive or equivocal, pursue testing urgently in acute liver failure without delaying empiric treatment, and use testing to enable cascade screening of siblings and first-degree relatives with a stepwise approach starting from common variants to full gene sequencing as needed [^116wKu3H] [^116ubvZx] [^113pXs9s] [^114peS7m] [^112p3rcr].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances; in children I will start with ceruloplasmin and basal 24-hour urinary copper and, if available, obtain relative exchangeable copper, interpreting results using pediatric reference intervals for total and exchangeable copper metrics, and I should correlate with phenotype because cutoffs and assay performance may vary by age group and clinical stability [^1125Fv3M] [^114Zfeym] [^116YFGQ9].

> I need to check alternative explanations and confounders for elevated serum copper before labeling copper overload; ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant and is increased with systemic inflammation, metabolic conditions like type 2 diabetes, estrogen exposure, and pregnancy, and therefore total serum copper may be spuriously high in these states, which I should correct for by contextualizing results with inflammatory markers and medication history and by favoring disease-specific indices such as urinary copper, hepatic copper, and REC rather than total copper alone [^1179Kyh4] [^11317Qxf] [^1155BFdt].

> Let me now outline monitoring and treatment-response markers while being cautious about over- or under-treatment; for patients on chelators such as penicillamine or trientine, I should track 24-hour urinary copper excretion knowing it is dose dependent and generally elevated with chelation, whereas with zinc therapy urinary copper gradually declines into or near the normal range, and I should suspect overtreatment when urine copper is disproportionately low for the chelator dose or below roughly 100 μg/24 h on chelation and below roughly 20 μg/24 h on zinc, confirm with low serum copper and very low urinary copper, then reduce or briefly pause therapy with close reassessment, and I can also use NCC or exchangeable copper to assess adherence if locally validated, recognizing that no single biomarker suffices in isolation [^115zQeMc] [^115PLjoA] [^113ct7gH] [^1112hxWt].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall I almost glossed over; relying on a calculated NCC as a diagnostic gatekeeper is a mistake because of assay variability and the occurrence of negative values, so if I initially leaned on an NCC threshold to "rule in" Wilson disease, I should correct course and instead integrate urinary copper, ceruloplasmin, REC where available, hepatic copper quantification when needed, and ATP7B genetics to reach a robust diagnosis in line with guideline-based multiparametric approaches [^1116REez] [^113AudPD] [^1155BFdt] [^116wKu3H].

> Next, I should review family implications; once I diagnose an index case, I must screen first-degree relatives with clinical assessment, serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, and genetic testing guided by the proband's ATP7B variants, because early identification of presymptomatic disease markedly improves prognosis with timely therapy [^112p3rcr] [^115QC5Rn] [^114iWgVW].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure no gaps remain; I will repeat and validate the serum copper measurement, exclude physiologic and exogenous causes, stratify by phenotype with targeted history and exam, obtain guideline-directed first-line labs including ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, REC where available, and liver tests, escalate to liver copper quantification and ATP7B sequencing when equivocal, triage urgent cases using ALF red flags without delaying treatment, and plan longitudinal monitoring of urinary copper and complementary indices to titrate therapy and avoid over- or under-treatment in accordance with AASLD and EASL-ERN recommendations [^114mWSnQ] [^116YFGQ9] [^113Kg9qc] [^113ct7gH].

---

The workup for a high serum copper level should start with a **focused history and exam** to identify symptoms, exposures, and risk factors, then proceed to **confirmatory testing** with serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, and liver function tests [^114mWSnQ] [^113AudPD]. If **Wilson disease** is suspected, add slit-lamp exam for Kayser-Fleischer rings, ATP7B genetic testing, and consider liver biopsy for hepatic copper quantification [^114iWgVW] [^1155BFdt]. Also assess for other causes such as cholestasis, inflammation, or exogenous copper exposure, and monitor trends with repeat testing and clinical correlation [^11317Qxf].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A detailed clinical history and physical examination are **essential first steps** in evaluating elevated serum copper levels. Key aspects include:

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain, neurological symptoms (tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric changes) [^114mWSnQ].

- **Family history**: Liver disease, neurological disorders, or known genetic disorders of copper metabolism [^114mWSnQ].

- **Exposure history**: Occupational or environmental exposure to copper, dietary supplements, or copper-containing water pipes.

- **Physical examination**: Signs of liver disease (hepatomegaly, jaundice), neurological abnormalities, and Kayser-Fleischer rings (brownish-green corneal rings) [^114mWSnQ] [^111AXyCv].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory tests are **critical** for confirming the elevation and identifying underlying causes:

| **Test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Serum ceruloplasmin | Major copper-binding protein; low levels suggest Wilson disease; elevated in inflammation [^113ZpQ3Y] [^113k6ynm] |
| 24-hour urinary copper excretion | Elevated (> 100 µg/24h) in Wilson disease; useful for diagnosis and monitoring [^113AudPD] |
| Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin) | Assess liver involvement; elevated in hepatic copper accumulation [^1138LeVU] |
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Evaluate for hemolytic anemia, common in Wilson disease |
| Serum free copper (non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper) | Elevated in Wilson disease; useful for monitoring treatment [^113ct7gH] |

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies assess organ involvement and guide further diagnostic steps. Liver ultrasound or MRI can be used to evaluate **hepatic copper accumulation**, liver structure, and fibrosis. Brain MRI evaluates **neurological involvement**, particularly when Wilson disease is suspected.

---

## Genetic testing

Genetic testing is essential for confirming hereditary copper metabolism disorders. ATP7B gene analysis confirms the diagnosis of **Wilson disease** and enables **family screening** [^114iWgVW]. Family screening involves testing first-degree relatives for **ATP7B mutations** and abnormal copper metabolism [^112p3rcr].

---

## Liver biopsy

Liver biopsy is indicated when the diagnosis remains uncertain or to confirm hepatic copper accumulation. Hepatic copper quantification with levels **≥ 250 µg/g dry weight** strongly suggests **Wilson disease** [^1155BFdt]. Histological evaluation assesses **liver damage and fibrosis** [^117DthUu].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Elevated serum copper levels can arise from several conditions:

- **Wilson disease**: Genetic disorder causing copper accumulation in liver and brain.

- **Cholestatic liver diseases**: Primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Inflammatory conditions**: Elevated ceruloplasmin as an acute-phase reactant.

- **Exogenous copper exposure**: Occupational, environmental, or dietary sources.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are **essential** to assess treatment efficacy and prevent complications. This includes tracking serum copper and ceruloplasmin to monitor trends and treatment response [^11317Qxf], measuring 24-hour urinary copper excretion to evaluate treatment adequacy and adherence [^113ct7gH], and conducting regular clinical assessments, including neurological and hepatic evaluations [^115zQeMc].

---

## Management strategies

Management is tailored to the **underlying cause**:

- **Wilson disease**: Chelating agents (penicillamine, trientine), zinc therapy, liver transplantation in severe cases [^114bpFvA].

- **Cholestatic liver diseases**: Treat underlying liver condition.

- **Exogenous copper exposure**: Remove source of exposure, supportive care.

---

A structured approach to elevated serum copper includes history, exam, labs, imaging, genetics, and biopsy when needed, with **management** tailored to the cause and **regular monitoring** to guide therapy and prevent complications.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Wilson's disease, specifically in terms of clinical and laboratory monitoring, the AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend considering the monitoring of serum copper and ceruloplasmin for trends. This includes very high or very low serum copper levels, or serum copper levels disproportionately high relative to simultaneous serum ceruloplasmin levels. Such variations may indicate exogenous copper intake (higher copper) or total-body depletion (lower copper and ceruloplasmin).

### Designing clinical trials in Wilson's disease [^116xWENt]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Twenty-four-hour urinary copper excretion is used for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of Wilson's disease (WD). Symptomatic patients treated with cupriuretic chelators experience initial increases in copper excretion, which decrease over time but remain above the normal range. Although there is pronounced intraindividual variation, it is lower than with nontreated conditions. Because 24-hour urine copper excretion is dose dependent and reflects dietary intake and total body copper content, it is useful for monitoring the treatment of a patient, assuming relatively consistent dietary copper intake.

With zinc therapy, which has no cupriuretic effect, the pattern changes, and patients show a slow decrease in copper excretion that takes months to years to reach the normal range. Measurement of 24-hour urinary copper excretion following a 48-hour "drug holiday" might overcome interpretation issues during chelator therapy and may better reflect whole-body copper. In compliant patients, urinary copper excretion following a 48-hour drug holiday reflects whole-body copper content, independent of dosing or drug absorption differences, thus facilitating treatment comparisons.

Twenty-four-hour urinary copper excretion should be included in clinical studies as a surrogate marker. In studies involving chelating agents, collection following a 48-hour drug holiday may be preferred to facilitate comparison between treatments.

### Serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and their relations to metabolic factors in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a cross-sectional study [^111i3JzV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate serum copper (Cu) and ceruloplasmin (Cer) levels and their relations to metabolic factors in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition characterized by excessive intrahepatic fat accumulation that is increasing worldwide.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional study included 141 subjects with NAFLD, diagnosed using abdominal ultrasonography. Personal information, anthropometric measures, glucose and lipid profiles, and serum levels of liver enzymes were assessed. Fasting serum levels of Cu and Cer were determined using colorimetry and nephelometry assays, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) were utilized to examine the associations of serum Cu and Cer levels with NAFLD risk.

- **Results**: The study results, based on 85 patients with NAFLD and 56 apparently healthy participants, showed that all NAFLD cases and 53.6% of the healthy subjects were overweight or obese. More than half of the patients (58.8%) showed mild NAFLD. Age, weight, BMI, lipid profile, uric acid, and ferritin were significantly higher in NAFLD patients than in healthy subjects. No significant differences were found in the concentrations of Cu and Cer between the groups. Only 7.4% of the healthy subjects and 2.4% of the patients were Cu deficient (< 70 µg/dl). No association was found between the risk of NAFLD and serum Cu [OR: 0.994; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.981–1.006] and Cer levels (OR: 0.414; 95% CI: 0.001–123.604) after adjusting for confounders.

- **Conclusion**: Our findings revealed no association between Cu deficiency and NAFLD risk. Further human studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results.

### Benefits of using exchangeable copper and the ratio of exchangeable copper in a real-world cohort of patients with Wilson disease [^114ZyFwR]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2023). High credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) is a complex condition in which diagnosis and long-term metabolic copper control remain challenging. The absence of accurate biomarkers necessitates the combination of different parameters to ensure copper homeostasis. Exchangeable copper and its ratio (REC) have been suggested as useful biomarkers in this context. We aimed to introduce these measurements and evaluate their performance and accuracy in our real-world cohort of WD patients.

Exchangeable copper and REC were measured in 48 WD patients and 56 control individuals using inductively coupled plasma-mass-spectrometry. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. REC was significantly higher among WD patients compared to controls and proved useful for WD identification using the previously established cutoffs: 71.4% of WD patients with a recent diagnosis had REC ≥ 18.5%, and 95.1% of long-term treated WD had REC ≥ 14%. Only four patients in the cohort presented discordant levels. Moreover, REC values were below 15% in all control individuals.

Exchangeable copper was significantly higher in WD patients compared to controls and showed a tendency to be reduced among WD patients who were compliant with medication. This real-life study confirmed that exchangeable copper and REC are valuable serum biomarkers. They can be used as complementary tests to ensure WD diagnosis (REC) and maintain copper homeostasis over time (exchangeable copper). The desirable target levels for this last objective still need to be validated in prospective cohorts.

### Present situation of biomarkers for copper status [^116Ctfqu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Serum or plasma copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations are the most widely used laboratory indicators to evaluate copper status. Both indicators decrease in moderate to severe copper deficiency. The activity of several cuproenzymes is also reduced in mild copper deficiency. However, their use is limited due to the lack of standardized assays, high interindividual variability, and the influence of other conditions. Recently, it was found that the protein expression of the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) is increased in erythrocytes of rodents with mild copper deficiency. Unfortunately, no traditional laboratory indicators have been identified as potential early markers of copper excess.

It is possible that the biomarkers studied thus far are not sensitive enough to detect an increase in body copper before the appearance of functional or clinical effects. Alternatively, the homeostatic mechanisms may be so robust that no significant changes in body copper occur with mild-to-moderate copper exposure. The identification of suitable biomarkers for early detection of increased body copper represents a significant challenge for future research.

Developing new approaches, such as network biology, could help propose new candidates for further study. Recently, research found that CCS mRNA abundance in mononuclear blood cells significantly decreased after copper supplementation. The potential usefulness of this indicator to detect an increase in body copper should be assessed in clinical trials.

### Establishment of a labile bound copper reference interval in a healthy population via an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry dual filtration-based assay [^114FuJyV]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Clinical testing for Wilson disease (WD) is potentially challenging. Measuring the fraction of labile bound copper (LBC) to total copper may be a promising alternative diagnostic tool with better sensitivity and specificity than some biomarker approaches. A dual filtration-based inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) assay to measure LBC in serum was developed.

- **Objective**: To establish a reference interval for LBC and LBC to total copper (LBC fraction) in a healthy adult population, and to examine associations between total copper, LBC, and LBC fraction with age, sex, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, and supplement use.

- **Design**: Serum samples were collected from healthy male (n = 110) and female (n = 104) patients between the ages of 19 and 80 years. Total copper and LBC were analyzed using ICP-MS. Results were used to calculate the LBC fraction. Reference intervals were calculated for the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for both LBC and LBC fraction.

- **Results**: The reference intervals for LBC were determined to be 13 to 105 ng/mL and 12 to 107 ng/mL for female and male patients, respectively. The reference intervals for the LBC fraction were 1.0% to 8.1% and 1.2% to 10.5% for female and male patients, respectively. No significant associations were found regarding age, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, or vitamin and supplement use.

- **Conclusions**: Sex-specific reference intervals have now been established for LBC and LBC fraction. These data, in conjunction with further testing of WD populations, can be used to assess.

### Seizures of unknown etiology associated with brittle hair: A diagnostic challenge [^113zaTwb]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In a given patient, the constellation of hair findings (brittle, steely, kinky hair), the LM findings of PT and TN, and low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels are all highly suggestive of MD. However, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels may be normal during early disease and, thus, are not completely reliable in early cases such as ours. In such cases, hair and LM findings alone are highly suggestive of disease and support early treatment initiation while waiting for confirmatory molecular genetic studies. Given that prompt treatment with copper histidine may prevent some neurologic sequelae, recognizing the hair-related clinical manifestations as indicative of MD early in the disease process is of vital importance and highlights the potentially significant role of dermatology in aiding rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation.

This case was unusual in that the patient experienced hair-related (scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes) clinical manifestations of MD earlier than is the norm. In this case, the combination of characteristic hair findings and the history of new-onset, intractable seizures was highly suggestive of MD, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in such cases to prevent delays in treatment of what is a rare, usually fatal, disease.

### Prognostic value of elevated serum ceruloplasmin levels in patients with heart failure [^113k6ynm]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a copper-binding acute-phase protein that is increased in inflammatory states and deficient in Wilson's disease. Recent studies demonstrate that increased levels of Cp are associated with an increased risk of developing heart failure. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that serum Cp provides incremental and independent prediction of survival in stable patients with heart failure.

- **Methods and results**: We measured serum Cp levels in 890 patients with stable heart failure undergoing elective cardiac evaluation, which included coronary angiography. We examined the role of Cp levels in predicting survival over 5 years of follow-up. The mean Cp level was 26.6 ± 6.9 mg/dL, and it demonstrated a relatively weak correlation with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; r = 0.187; P < .001). Increased Cp levels were associated with increased 5-year all-cause mortality (quartile [Q] 4 vs. Q1 hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–2.8; P < .001). When controlled for coronary disease traditional risk factors, creatinine clearance, dialysis, body mass index, medications, history of myocardial infarction, BNP, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), heart rate, QRS duration, left bundle branch blockage, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement, higher Cp remained an independent predictor of increased mortality (Q4 vs. Q1 HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6; P < .05). Model quality was improved with the addition of Cp to the aforementioned covariables (net reclassification improvement of 9.3%; P < .001).

Ceruloplasmin is an independent predictor.

### Designing clinical trials in Wilson's disease [^1116REez]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Determination of "free" bioavailable copper concentration has been proposed as a possible surrogate marker. This copper fraction is considered biologically active and is the target of treatment to prevent the extrahepatic uptake of copper. There are several approaches to measure free copper.

- **Non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC)**: NCC is estimated by subtracting ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total serum copper concentration. A weakness of the methodology is biologically implausible negative values in some patients (Supporting Information S.3.1). Reports on the correlation between NCC normalization and clinical outcome are conflicting, but in a recent phase 2 study, the NCC estimate correlated with clinical outcome during treatment with bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate.

- **Measurement of exchangeable copper (CuEXC)**: CuEXC is obtained by the incubation of serum with EDTA to remove loosely bound copper, followed by the subsequent removal of ceruloplasmin-bound copper by ultrafiltration. The method does not depend on the measurement of ceruloplasmin. Correlation between CuEXC and organ damage was observed in an animal study. CuEXC was related to patient compliance, but longitudinal data in patients have not been reported.

For further discussion of the measurement of bioavailable (free) copper, see Supporting Information S.3.1. At the present stage, neither NCC nor CuEXC has been validated as a surrogate endpoint. The data do not allow a conclusion as to which is more valuable for treatment monitoring. At least one of these should be included as an exploratory endpoint.

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: A potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^1126m2zh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD) remains a challenge since no single test has an accuracy of 100%. Molecular testing for ATP7B gene mutations can aid diagnosis when routine testing is equivocal. We report an asymptomatic WD patient diagnosed accidentally via genetic analysis. This case suggests WD is challenging even in specific contexts, such as family screening. Genetic testing of the ATP7B gene should be recommended for family members of WD patients with minimal alterations in specific tests, such as ceruloplasmin levels, and in cases of steatosis or increased body mass index.

### EASL-ERN clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^115PeRPJ]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, and specifically in relation to history and physical examination, EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend performing a detailed neurological examination using a validated scale in all adult patients following a diagnosis of WD.

### EASL-ERN clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^117V5tAc]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for Wilson's disease, specifically concerning liver biopsy, the EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining hepatic parenchymal copper quantification (dry weight) in patients with predominantly hepatic manifestations if the diagnosis remains questionable.

### EASL-ERN clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^116LSVJ3]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of Wilson's disease, with respect to indications for testing, the EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend suspecting WD in patients present with acute liver failure (ALF) and Coombs-negative hemolysis, Kayser-Fleischer rings, or suggestive neurological symptoms, as these findings are highly indicative of WD.

### Serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity is a sensitive and highly specific diagnostic marker for Wilson's disease [^112V74X8]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

A low serum ceruloplasmin concentration is considered diagnostic for Wilson's disease. This study aimed to evaluate an enzymatic test for ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and compare it with the routinely used immunological ceruloplasmin measurement.

- **Methods**: Serum ceruloplasmin was measured enzymatically using o-dianisidine dihydrochloride as a substrate and immunologically. The study included 110 Wilson's disease patients, 52 healthy controls, and 51 patients with impaired liver function not due to Wilson's disease. Assay performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the McNemar test, and Spearman's rank correlation.

- **Results**: The enzymatic ceruloplasmin assay showed the greatest sum of sensitivity and specificity at a cut-off point of 55 U/L (93.6% and 100%, respectively), and the immunologic assay at a cut-off point of 0.19 g/L (93.6% and 78.8%, respectively). For healthy controls, differences in specificity between the two assays were statistically significant (McNemar, p = 0.02). Including patients with impaired liver function in the control group reduced specificity to 84.5% for the enzymatic assay and 68.9% for the immunologic assay. Correlation between the enzymatic and immunologic assays was high in healthy controls (r = 0.94), but weaker in Wilson's disease patients (r = 0.70) and patients with impaired liver function not due to Wilson's disease (r = 0.65).

- **Conclusions**: For the enzymatic assay, the best cut-off point for predicting Wilson's disease was estimated to be 55 U/L. Our data suggest that the…

### Key biomarkers in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review [^1179Kyh4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Ceruloplasmin is the major copper-carrying protein. It transports approximately 95% of copper in the blood and exhibits a ferroxidase activity that catalyzes the oxidation of ferrous iron into ferric iron, assisting the transportation of iron by transferrin in the bloodstream. Ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant produced by hepatocytes when induced by cytokines released from activated monocytes and macrophages. The level of ceruloplasmin was significantly higher among T2DM patients compared to CTL (1222.82 ± 306.15 IU/L vs. 868.38 ± 198.80 IU/L, p < 0.01) in diabetes. Elevated ceruloplasmin levels have been reported as a marker of abnormally high oxidative stress in T2DM. Diabetic retinopathy is a common microvascular complication that can cause blindness. A study reported that high levels of ceruloplasmin are related to T2DM patients with retinopathy (p < 0.01). Increased ceruloplasmin blood levels (4.9 ± 1.3 mg/g) are also seen in other T2DM studies. IFN-γ and TNF-α are responsible for the induction of ceruloplasmin synthesis by human myeloid cells.

Haptoglobin binds to free hemoglobin and forms a high-affinity complex that is eliminated from circulation by the reticulocyte system, CD163-positive macrophages, and hepatocytes. The complex's removal time is approximately 20 minutes. Haptoglobin acts as a clearance protein and antioxidant, thereby reducing the oxidative activity of heme iron. With antioxidant properties, haptoglobin is involved in innate immune mechanisms, restricts the accessibility of iron to pathogens, and stimulates tissue repair in an inflammatory response.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Wilson's disease, specifically with respect to indications for testing, the EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion measurements. Additionally, test for relative exchangeable copper if available in siblings and first-degree relatives (parents and offspring of an index case). Evaluate clinical symptoms and obtain liver tests.

### Wilson's disease [^112iH7qv]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Progressive hepatolenticular degeneration, or Wilson's disease, is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Knowledge of the clinical presentations and treatment of the disease is important both to the generalist and to specialists in gastroenterology, hepatology, neurology, psychiatry, and pediatrics. Wilson's disease invariably results in severe disability and death if untreated. The diagnosis is easily overlooked but, if discovered early, effective treatments are available that will prevent or reverse many manifestations of this disorder.

Studies have identified the role of copper in disease pathogenesis and clinical, biochemical, and genetic markers that can be useful in diagnosis. Several chelating agents and zinc salts are available for medical therapy. Liver transplantation corrects the underlying pathophysiology and can be lifesaving. The discovery of the Wilson's disease gene has opened up a new molecular diagnostic approach and could form the basis of future gene therapy.

### Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content, as determined using the entire core of a liver biopsy sample [^113t4ubZ]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

A hepatic copper level ≥ 250 μg/g dry weight in the absence of cholestasis has been considered the most valid evidence for the diagnosis of Wilson's Disease (WD) since the late 1960s. However, this threshold value has been criticized recently by Ferenci et al. as being too high and based on relatively few cases. They stated that the sensitivity of hepatic copper level for the diagnosis of WD in the absence of cholestasis at the cut‐off value of 250 μg/g dry weight was 83.3%, and the most useful threshold value was 75 μg/g dry weight. This cut‐off value has been cited by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines on WD, as well as some articles. However, whether this cut‐off value is appropriate has not yet been evidenced by other studies.

### Neuroimaging correlates of cognitive deficits in Wilson's disease [^117Nzsc2]. Movement Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

We have previously demonstrated that increasing serum non-caeruloplasmin-bound copper levels are associated with white matter microstructural abnormalities and cortical, but not basal ganglia, atrophy in the same cohort of chronically treated patients. It has also been shown that patients with Wilson's disease, including those with hepatic presentations, have ubiquitous increases in brain copper content. It is therefore plausible that our novel neurological phenotype is driven by widespread, but mostly subclinical, copper toxicity in the brain. Dysfunction of ATP7B, which is expressed in neurons and glia, might also contribute. The classical neurological phenotype likely relates to a selective neuronal vulnerability within the basal ganglia present only in a subset of patients. We have previously suggested that a tendency to mishandle brain iron in response to copper toxicity might account for this. This overarching theory on the evolution of neurological involvement in Wilson's disease is consistent with previous observations that subclinical psychiatric features and neuroimaging abnormalities are common in patients with hepatic presentations. It also explains why copper indices do not differ between patients with neurological and hepatic presentations or correlate with the severity of movement disorders.

Our findings also have implications for the binary phenotypic classification of Wilson's disease. Patients are divided into neurological and hepatic presentation depending on the presence or absence of overt neurological and/or psychiatric symptoms at diagnosis. Our data suggest that more comprehensive cognitive assessment is needed to accurately classify patients.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis of Wilson's disease [^114WpeTG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease, first described by Samuel Wilson in 1912, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting from mutations in the ATP7B gene. The disease develops as a consequence of copper accumulating in affected tissues. There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which is often delayed due to the non-specific clinical features and the need for a combination of clinical and laboratory tests for diagnosis. This delay may, in turn, affect clinical outcomes and has implications for other family members in terms of diagnosis. The Leipzig criteria were established to help standardize diagnosis and management. However, it should be emphasized that these criteria date from 2003, and many of these have not been formally evaluated; this review examines the evidence behind biochemical testing for Wilson's disease.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of three biochemical tests at specified cut-off levels for Wilson's disease. The index tests covered by this Cochrane Review are caeruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, and hepatic copper content. These tests were evaluated in those with suspected Wilson's disease and appropriate controls (either healthy individuals or those with chronic liver disease other than Wilson's). In the absence of a gold standard for diagnosing Wilson's disease, the Leipzig criteria have been used as a clinical reference standard. The review aims to investigate whether index tests should be performed in all individuals who have been recommended for testing for Wilson's disease, or whether these tests should be limited to subgroups of individuals.

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: A potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^115Husvu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this case adds more information about the natural history of Wilson's disease (WD) and suggests that WD is a challenge even in particular contexts such as family screening. This is particularly true in asymptomatic patients, including the pediatric age group and in adults with asymptomatic increases in liver tests. In these patients, the presence of normal values in some copper metabolism tests decreases the accuracy of the Leipzig score. Thus, the use of genetic testing becomes imperative in the diagnosis of WD. Genetic testing of the entire ATP7B gene should be conducted in cases of relatives of WD patients with minimal alterations of copper metabolism in tests such as ceruloplasmin and signs such as steatosis, even in overweight patients.

### Excessive copper impairs intrahepatocyte trafficking and secretion of selenoprotein P [^111ksnQq]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We next analyzed the selenium status in serum samples of Wilson's disease patients at the time of diagnosis before the onset of therapeutic interventions. Overall, the clinical parameters of the patients were very heterogeneous. For example, a very broad range of serum copper concentrations was observed. Based on their serum ceruloplasmin (CP), the patients were divided into two groups with normal (> 90 µg/L) or low (< 90 µg/L) serum CP concentrations, which was confirmed by measuring the functional holo-CP reflected by CP oxidase activity. Low CP is one of the parameters used for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease and most likely indicates a higher hepatic copper accumulation, as shown in the rat Wilson model.

In addition, a third group, referred to as 'diseased', was established for those patients with high clinical serum parameters, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and hepatic transaminases. This indicates a more severe disease state resulting in copper leakage from destroyed hepatocytes (for patient characteristics, see Table S1). To further characterize the patients' copper status, both total and free copper levels were analyzed. Consistent with the CP concentrations, total copper levels were reduced in the 'low CP' group compared to the 'normal CP' group. Free copper levels confirmed the division of patients into the 'diseased' group, with higher concentrations in comparison to the other two groups. The SELENOP concentration was significantly decreased in the serum of patients with low serum copper.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Wilson's disease, specifically with respect to clinical and laboratory monitoring, the EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend assessing medication adherence based on monitoring serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper levels, serum exchangeable copper, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion at baseline and 48 hours after cessation of chelators.

### EASL-ern clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^114riHm4]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, affecting the liver, brain, and other organs. Diagnosis is based on clinical features; biochemical tests, including plasma ceruloplasmin concentration, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and copper content in the liver; and molecular analysis. The Leipzig score and relative exchangeable copper determination are recommended for diagnosis.

Pharmacological therapy includes chelating agents, such as penicillamine and trientine, and zinc salts. However, only chelators are recommended for significant liver disease. Monitoring is based on clinical symptoms, liver tests, and copper metabolism, including urinary copper excretion and exchangeable copper, to detect poor compliance and over/under-treatment.

Acute liver failure presents a challenge, as making a diagnosis is difficult, and pharmacological therapy may not be sufficient to save life. Liver transplantation has a well-defined role in Wilsonian acute hepatic failure but may also be considered in neurological disease.

### Copper deficiency in children with intestinal failure: Risk factors and influence on hematological cytopenias [^1131oJQV]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

We investigated to what extent serum copper influences hemoglobin (Hb), neutrophil, and platelet counts, and the factors associated with serum copper in children with intestinal failure (IF) who have their micronutrient status monitored according to a standard protocol.

- **Methods**: Children with IF admitted to a pediatric intestinal rehabilitation program and receiving home parenteral nutrition (PN) were followed up prospectively. Patients received vitamins and multi-trace elements (TEs) as part of the PN. Copper, iron, zinc, vitamin A, and cobalamin serum levels were routinely monitored at 3-month intervals or monthly when a deficiency was detected. Complete blood counts were performed biweekly. Repeated-measures analyses were used to estimate the effect of explanatory variables on the outcomes.

- **Results**: Thirteen children with a median time receiving PN of 16.6 months were included. An average of 7 copper measurements per patient were performed; 53.8% of patients had a low serum level at least twice during the follow-up. Eight patients with cholestasis had TEs of PN discontinued. In the multivariable analysis, copper was not associated with Hb levels; an increase of 10 µg/dL in serum copper resulted in an increase of 240/mm³ (95% confidence interval, 18.0–30.1) neutrophils and of 8429/mm³ (95% CI, 466–1219) platelets (P < .001). Time of PN without copper, direct bilirubin levels, and ostomy were associated with lower serum copper.

- **Conclusion**: The increase in serum copper was associated with significant increases in neutrophil and platelet counts. Time with…

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, specifically with respect to genetic testing, the AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining molecular genetic investigation of ATP7B, depending on logistics, in patients with suspected WD. Consider obtaining genetic testing for ATP7B mutations as part of a routine evaluation and to provide diagnostic confirmation when biochemical testing is not definitive.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: Executive summary of the 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115PLjoA]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Wilson's disease, particularly in clinical and laboratory monitoring, the AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend suspecting overtreatment with pharmacological therapy directed at removing or detoxifying based on the development of cytopenias or retention of tissue iron associated with raised serum ferritin. Confirm overtreatment based on low serum copper and a very low 24-hour urinary copper output.

- **Overtreatment with oral chelators**: Suspect this based on 24-hour urinary copper excretion being disproportionately low for the dose of chelator administered (below therapeutic target or specifically < 100 mcg/24-hour).
- **Overtreatment with zinc therapy**: Suspect this when 24-hour urinary copper is < 20 mcg/24-hour.

Reduce the dose of medical therapy or interrupt briefly once overtreatment is confirmed. Ensure close follow-up for reassessment.

### Serum iron, zinc, and copper levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease: A replication study and meta-analyses [^113PHPUi]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether iron, zinc, and copper levels in serum are disarranged in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we performed meta-analyses of all studies on the topic published from 1984 to 2014 and contextually carried out a replication study in serum as well. Our meta-analysis results showed that serum zinc was significantly lower in AD patients. Our replication and meta-analysis results showed that serum copper was significantly higher in AD patients than in healthy controls, consistent with the conclusions of four previously published copper meta-analyses.

Even though a possible role of iron in the pathophysiology of the disease could not be ruled out, our meta-analysis showed no change in serum iron levels in AD patients, but this conclusion was not robust and requires further investigation. The meta-regression analyses revealed that in some studies, differences in serum iron levels could be due to the different mean ages, while differences in zinc levels appeared to be due to the different sex ratios. However, the effect of sex ratio on serum zinc levels in our meta-analysis is subtle and needs further confirmation.

Additionally, diverse demographic terms and methodological approaches appeared not to explain the high heterogeneity of our copper meta-analysis. Therefore, when investigating trace elements, covariates such as age and sex have to be taken into account in the analyses. In light of these findings, we suggest that the possible alteration of serum zinc and copper levels is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

### Insights into the management of Wilson's disease [^114bpFvA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism, where the causative gene, ATP7B, results in absent or reduced function of the ATP7B transporter, which is important for the biliary excretion of copper and incorporation of copper into caeruloplasmin. Affected patients accumulate excessive copper within the liver, brain, and other tissues. This disease mainly affects children, adolescents, and young adults, and clinical features vary from the asymptomatic state to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, and neuropsychiatric manifestations.

Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is based on a combination of clinical signs, biochemical tests, hepatic copper content assays, and mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene. At the time of writing, there are more than 500 mutations of ATP7B in patients with Wilson's disease. Early recognition and treatment can result in an excellent prognosis, whereas untreated disease is almost always fatal. Drug therapies include chelating agents, such as penicillamine or trientine, and zinc salts. Liver transplantation is curative, correcting the underlying pathophysiology, and is traditionally indicated in acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease refractory to medical therapy.

This review provides an overview of various aspects of Wilson's disease, including the molecular basis of the disease, clinical features, diagnostic and management strategies, and their limitations.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^115Tx8FQ]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Being Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia, a frequent characteristic of ALF-WD, haemoglobin values have been proposed as an element of a scoring system for diagnosing WD using a cut-off point of 2.2 had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 86%. The alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin ratio < 4 demonstrated a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 96%. Moreover, a sensitivity and specificity of 100% can be reached when combining these ratios.

In our study, these tests performed much less well, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 45.5% and 31.8%, respectively, when combining the ratios. This could be explained by the important proportion of paediatric patients included in our study, particularly in the non-WD group, where they were significantly more prevalent. A meta-analysis of paediatric cases of ALF showed a sensitivity of 49% using the combined ratios. These tests have the value of being readily accessible and with minimum delay; however, they have more limited value in paediatric populations.

### Total and exchangeable copper assay using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and establishment of a pediatric reference interval [^114Zfeym]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Recently, an exchangeable copper (CuEXC) assay has been suggested as a robust and feasible diagnostic tool for Wilson disease (WD). Although WD is a disorder that requires lifelong treatment and monitoring, few data are currently available regarding the status of copper levels in children.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of copper assays and establish a reference interval for total copper and CuEXC in the pediatric population.

Serum samples from children aged 1–5 (n = 122), 6–12 (n = 125), and 13–18 years (n = 120) were analyzed. Total copper and CuEXC concentrations were directly measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and relative CuEXC levels were calculated. Total copper reference intervals, CuEXC levels, and relative CuEXC levels were determined based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the data with 90% confidence intervals.

The results indicated significant differences in the median concentrations of total copper and relative CuEXC among the age groups. Reference intervals determined for total copper were 82 to 167, 75 to 139, and 64 to 133 μg/dL for children aged 1 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 18 years, respectively. The reference intervals for CuEXC were 4.29 to 9.79, 4.02 to 9.09, and 3.55 to 8.25 μg/dL for children aged 1 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 18 years, respectively. Among 11 patients with suspected WD, relative CuEXC values were elevated in all 3 diagnosed with WD.

The pediatric reference intervals derived in this study are expected to be useful for the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of WD in the pediatric population.

### Copper: caeruloplasmin ratio [^115jXupA]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Investigation of copper status can be a diagnostic challenge. The non-caeruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) has deficiencies; accordingly, the copper: caeruloplasmin ratio has been suggested as an alternative index of copper status. A reference interval for this index was derived. In addition to making the interpretation of copper easier, the copper: caeruloplasmin ratio should also enable adjustment for relatively high caeruloplasmin concentrations without recourse to producing gender- and age-derived intervals.

The copper: caeruloplasmin ratio has weaknesses similar to those identified for NCC in that immunological methods used for caeruloplasmin can cross-react with apocaeruloplasmin, and there is no standardized method for caeruloplasmin. Caeruloplasmin assays also have uncertainty from precision, bias, and specificity, and, accordingly, method-related differences may have a large effect on the copper: caeruloplasmin ratio in a manner similar to the NCC.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^113y4m1Q]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the ATP7B gene. It is characterized by copper accumulation, mainly in the liver and the brain, due to impaired biliary copper elimination. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, laboratory results, and genetic analysis.

The clinical presentation can be heterogeneous, typically including acute or chronic liver disease and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Acute liver failure (ALF) can be the initial manifestation of WD in approximately 10% to 36.5% of cases and accounts for about 3% to 6% of pediatric and adult ALF cases. Without liver transplantation, this presentation is often fatal; however, timely diagnosis and treatment of WD could prevent this outcome. The prognosis of WD-ALF cases can be assessed using validated scores developed to identify patients unlikely to respond to treatment and who may need liver transplantation. However, timely and appropriate treatment might avert this need. Diagnosis of WD is also crucial for family screening.

A few laboratory findings suggestive of WD in ALF include Coombs-negative intravascular hemolysis, comparatively low serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and significantly low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP). However, these findings are not systematically present, particularly in children. The utilization of the Leipzig score is standardly recommended to confirm WD.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel? There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned the Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study, which reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. However, the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting, GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients.

Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%, and notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### ACP best practice No 163. Wilson's disease: acute and presymptomatic laboratory diagnosis and monitoring [^113URtsL]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2000). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease, the most common inherited disorder of copper metabolism, is a recessive genetic condition. The clinical presentation of Wilson's disease is highly variable. It is characterized by low serum copper and caeruloplasmin concentrations coupled with the pathological accumulation of copper in the tissues. However, there are diagnostic difficulties, and these are discussed. The value of DNA diagnosis, both in gene tracking in families or as applied to de novo cases, is examined. Wilson's disease can be treated successfully, but treatment must be lifelong. Patients are best treated by specialist centers with experience and expertise in the condition.

### Wilson disease [^116sZv7A]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Wilson's disease:

- **Definition**: WD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired copper metabolism.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of WD involves impaired copper homeostasis due to ATP7B mutations, leading to copper overload in the liver, brain, and other organs. This copper accumulation results in cellular damage and apoptosis, leading to the clinical manifestations of the disease.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of WD worldwide is estimated at 3.3 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for WD include having two copies of a mutated ATP7B gene, indicating an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
- **Disease course**: WD manifests through a broad spectrum of hepatic and extrahepatic symptoms, reflecting systemic copper deposition. The hepatic presentation can range from asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes to progressive liver dysfunction, encompassing hepatomegaly, jaundice, and in more advanced cases, cirrhosis. Neurological involvement includes tremors, dystonia, dysarthria, and other extrapyramidal signs arising from copper accumulation in the basal ganglia. Kayser-Fleischer rings, which appear as a brownish-green discoloration around the corneal limbus, differing from the white-yellow rings of arcus senilis or hyperlipidemia due to lipid deposition, are a classic ophthalmologic sign in WD, although not specific, as they can be seen in chronic cholestatic conditions.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of WD is generally good with early diagnosis and treatment.

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: A potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^1152wJCb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD) remains a challenge since no single test has an accuracy of 100%. Molecular testing for ATP7B gene mutations can aid in reaching a diagnosis when routine testing is equivocal. We report an asymptomatic WD patient diagnosed accidentally by genetic analysis. This case suggests that WD is a challenge even in specific contexts such as family screening. Genetic testing of the ATP7B gene should be recommended for family members of WD patients with minimal alterations in specific tests, such as ceruloplasmin, and the presence of steatosis or an increased body mass index.

### The copper/caeruloplasmin ratio in routine clinical practice in different laboratories [^115ZUfdr]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of copper deficiency and excess states is challenging. It was hoped that the non-caeruloplasmin-bound ("free") copper would reduce this difficulty; however, it has its own problems. The copper/caeruloplasmin ratio has been advocated as an alternative index of copper status, especially as it would not need gender-derived or age-derived reference intervals. However, there are no comparative data for different populations using different assays.

- **Method**: Independent paired copper and caeruloplasmin data were retrospectively obtained for three laboratories. From these data, the copper/caeruloplasmin ratio was calculated, and descriptive statistics for the populations and methods were obtained. The relationship between the copper/caeruloplasmin ratio and both copper and caeruloplasmin were also investigated for the three laboratories.

- **Results**: All three datasets displayed a non-Gaussian distribution. The Burton median was statistically different from the two other medians, which did not differ significantly from each other. The regression lines for both copper and caeruloplasmin with the ratio differed from each other.

- **Conclusion**: The copper/caeruloplasmin ratio behaves differently depending on the laboratory, the population studied, or both. Thus, cut-offs in the literature are not transferable. Each laboratory should therefore derive its own cut-offs.

### Resolution of decompensated cirrhosis from Wilson's disease with zinc monotherapy: A potential therapeutic option [^116Qy2M2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease is a genetic autosomal-recessive copper deposition disorder often presenting with neurologic or hepatic symptoms. In cases of hepatic presentation, treatment usually is initiated with potentially toxic copper chelators, such as D-penicillamine or trientine. Although multiple studies have introduced zinc as a low-toxicity and low-cost Wilson's disease treatment, its use has been limited to adjunctive or single-agent maintenance options. In this report, we describe the use of zinc monotherapy in a patient with a severe hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease.

- **Methods**: Zinc has not been evaluated as a single-agent treatment option for active hepatic Wilson's disease. Zinc monotherapy was initiated for a single patient with fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease while awaiting liver transplantation.

- **Results**: Over a 1-year period with zinc monotherapy, this patient experienced normalization of hepatic synthetic function and resolution of hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy. Clinical stabilization of variceal bleeds, ascites, and lower-extremity edema was also observed. The patient is no longer a transplant candidate as a result of clinical recovery and improvement of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores.

- **Conclusions**: This case highlights the potential use of zinc as a low-toxicity and low-cost single-agent treatment in severely decompensated hepatic Wilson's disease. Despite promising results in this case, further clinical evaluation will be necessary to fully assess the clinical efficacy of zinc monotherapy.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116VTxiw]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflects an increase in hepatic iron content. Hemochromatosis can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers, such as transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin, are widely available, and the majority of patients with hemochromatosis are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Certain high-risk groups should be targeted for evaluation, including those with a family history of hemochromatosis, those with suspected organ involvement, and those with chance detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of the possibility of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function undergo iron studies at some point in their evaluation. The algorithm outlined can provide further direction regarding testing and is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

- **Algorithm use**: An algorithm can provide further direction regarding testing and treatment for hemochromatosis. The algorithm is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

The initial approach to diagnosis involves indirect markers of iron stores, namely transferrin saturation or unsaturated iron-binding capacity, and serum ferritin. Transferrin saturation is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity.

### Direct measurement of free copper in serum or plasma ultrafiltrate [^116ewjXN]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Copper is an essential element and, under conditions of overload, a toxicant. A dramatic example of copper toxicity is Wilson disease (WD), a treatable but often fatal condition that is difficult to diagnose and monitor. A method for direct measurement of free copper concentrations in serum or plasma ultrafiltrate by inductively coupled mass spectrometry was developed and validated to assist with diagnosing and monitoring WD. The method was shown to be accurate (94%-109% recoveries), linear (0.5–800 microg/dL [0.08–126 micromol/L]), and precise (coefficient of variation, < 15% over the analytic measurement range).

A reference interval (0–10 microg/dL [0–1.6 micromol/L]) was determined parametrically with 137 healthy adult blood donors (20–59 years). No statistically significant difference was observed between males (n = 69) and females (n = 68). Free copper concentrations for patients diagnosed with WD were at least 6-fold greater than the upper limit of the reference interval before treatment but fell within the reference interval after treatment.

### Adjusting copper concentrations for caeruloplasmin levels in routine clinical practice [^1156X1jj]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

An investigation on copper metabolism usually includes the measurement of serum levels of copper and caeruloplasmin. Using these levels, some laboratories derive levels of non-caeruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC); however, a considerable number of patients may show negative values, which is not physiologically possible.

- **Aim**: To derive an equation for adjusted copper in a manner similar to that widely accepted for adjusted calcium.

- **Methods**: A linear regression equation for the relationship between caeruloplasmin and copper was used: [copper] (micromol/l) = 0.052 x [caeruloplasmin] (mg/l). An equation for copper adjusted for caeruloplasmin was derived using this equation and the reference interval of 10–25 micromol/l for copper.

- **Results**: The derived equation was [adjusted copper] (micromol/l) = [total copper] (micromol/l) + 0.052 x [caeruloplasmin] (mg/l) + 17.5 (micromol/l). The adjusted copper concentrations at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were 12.7 and 21.5 micromol/l, respectively, with the population having a Gaussian distribution. The relationship between NCC and the adjusted copper concentrations is linear and independent of caeruloplasmin concentration.

- **Conclusion**: Calculation of copper adjusted for caeruloplasmin uses the same variables as those for NCC. Accordingly, the problems that are caused by the lack of specificity of caeruloplasmin immunoassays are the same as those identified for NCC. This calculation, however, overcomes the negative values that are found in a considerable minority of patients with NCC, as well as age and sex differences in the caeruloplasmin concentration.

### Galzin [^115zQeMc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be monitored primarily by assessment of existing signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease and 24-hour urine copper. Neuropsychiatric evaluations, including speech, as well as liver function tests including bilirubin and aminotransferases, should be conducted as appropriate.

The urinary excretion of copper is an accurate reflection of the body's status of copper when patients are not on chelation therapy. Clinicians should be aware that urinary copper levels are usually increased with chelation therapy, such as penicillamine or trientine. Adequate zinc therapy will eventually decrease urinary copper excretion to 125 μg per 24 hours or less. A significant trend upward indicates impending loss of copper control. The non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper (also known as free copper) is obtained by subtracting the ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total plasma copper, with each mg of ceruloplasmin containing 3 μg of copper. In the United States study, non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper concentration was kept below 20 μg/dL. Urine and plasma for copper determinations should be collected in copper-free containers and assayed with equipment capable of accurately measuring copper at levels as low as 0.01 μg/mL.

An additional monitoring tool, if available, is the measurement of radioactivity in the plasma 1 or 2 hours after orally administered 64cuprate. In adequately controlled patients, the amount is less than 1.2% of the administered dose. The level of hepatic copper should not be used to manage therapy since it does not differentiate between potentially toxic free copper and other forms.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: Executive summary of the 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113Kg9qc]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend a critical approach to the diagnostic procedures for Wilson's disease, particularly regarding liver biopsy. It is important to recognize that a hepatic parenchymal copper content greater than 250 mcg/g dry weight is observed in most patients. However, a lower copper content that is still above normal should prompt additional confirmatory testing to ensure accurate diagnosis. In untreated patients, Wilson's disease can be excluded if the hepatic copper content is normal, measured as less than 50 mcg/g dry weight.

### Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content, as determined using the entire core of a liver biopsy sample [^112BwSAq]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The final diagnosis of Wilson's Disease (WD) was made in 178 patients, including 105 hepatic (H) patients (59.0%), 25 neurological type 1 (N1) patients (14.0%), 31 neurological type 2 (N2) patients (17.4%), and 17 presymptomatic (P) patients (9.6%). Among them, 174 (97.8%) had a WD score of at least 4, whereas only 4 had a WD score less than 4. Among these 4 patients, 3 were siblings of index cases and had mildly decreased ceruloplasmin levels and markedly increased liver copper levels. The remaining patient was evaluated because of elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and serum aspartate aminotransferase for 3 years; this patient had a ceruloplasmin level of 272 mg/L and markedly elevated liver copper content of 1,125.0 μg/g dry wt. Four patients who refused genetic testing were treated with penicillamine or zinc, and their liver function tests gradually returned to normal. They were diagnosed with WD based on a combination of WD score, family history, and positive response to chelator therapy, even though their WD scores were less than 4.

Hepatic copper level in WD patients did not correlate with sex, the grade of hepatic inflammation, or stage of hepatic fibrosis but negatively correlated with age at diagnosis (r = −0.304; P = 0.001). Mean hepatic copper level was significantly higher in H patients than in other phenotypes (P = 0.001). It was also higher in patients 14 years old or younger than in older patients. All 105 H patients, including 60 patients 14 years old or younger, had hepatic copper levels over 250 μg/g dry wt. Among 31 N2 patients, 7 (22.6%) had hepatic copper levels above this threshold.

### Copper deficiency and excess in infancy: Developing a research agenda [^112c7NXa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency and excess are recognized as potential health problems for infants and children worldwide. The clinical manifestations of copper deficiency and excess are well characterized, but the precise sequence by which high copper intake interacts with genetic control systems, leading to liver damage in infants, is unknown. The possibility that genetic mutations or epigenetic factors related to the functional development of copper homeostasis could make otherwise normal infants on normal copper intake more susceptible to copper toxicity has been an issue of concern.

In January 2001, a group of pediatricians and researchers met at Tegernsee, Bavaria, Germany, to review the state of knowledge on the topic. They addressed six main issues:

- **The relevance of copper deficit and excess as health problems**: They discussed the significance of these conditions as global health problems for infants and children.

- **The appropriate biomarkers to identify and characterize copper status**: Identifying the proper biomarkers to assess copper status was a pivotal topic.

- **The genetic variability in copper metabolism**: The role of genetic variability in how copper is metabolized was considered crucial.

- **The mechanisms of whole-body copper homeostasis in early life and their changes with age**: The group examined how copper homeostasis mechanisms function in early life and evolve with age.

- **The development of experimental and animal models to address research questions on copper homeostasis in infants**: They highlighted the importance of developing models to explore copper homeostasis-related questions.

- **The safe upper and lower limits of copper intake/exposure from water and food**: Determining the safety margins for copper intake was essential for infant health.

We present here the highlights of the discussions and the main conclusions of the meeting.

### Regulatory frameworks for copper considering chronic exposures of the population [^113aiHJJ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Copper is an essential nutrient that becomes toxic when consumed in excess. Copper intake from a balanced diet generally meets the needs of most healthy individuals, as both overt deficiency and toxicity are rare. However, some uncertainty remains due to limitations in the currently available biomarkers used to assess copper status and the lack of sufficient data to establish tolerable upper levels of intake.

Policies and regulations related to food fortification, nutritional supplements, and drinking water appear effective in ensuring adequate copper intake for many populations. Nonetheless, high levels of exposure may occur through excessive fortification, supplementation, or drinking water contamination under certain circumstances. It is crucial that surveillance and monitoring programs evaluating copper exposures in human populations continue and are further refined as new biomarkers become available.

### Exchangeable copper for patients with Wilson disease at follow-up: Rethinking normal ranges or changing methodology [^113d9hoR]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Determining suitable copper parameters for monitoring Wilson disease remains a topic of ongoing discussion. International recommendations currently rely on the combination of urinary copper excretion and nonspecific liver markers when considering therapy and time elapsed since diagnosis. The emergence of exchangeable copper (CuEX) as a novel measurement reflecting the "free copper pool" held promise as a valuable target to ensure metabolic stability during follow-up, although the validation of target ranges remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate CuEX quantification in repeated samples from 92 real-world patients with Wilson disease during a 2-year period.

- **Approach**: Patients were classified as "stable" if a diagnosis had been made more than 1 year before and were compliant with stable anti-copper drug and dose. Otherwise, patients were classified as "nonstable".

- **Results**: Two hundred and thirteen CuEX samples were obtained per clinical practice. Overall, 57% of CuEX measurements fell below the reference "range of normality", whereas only 34% were within and 9% were above normal levels. There was no association of CuEX levels with therapy, elapsed time from diagnosis, or clinical stability, although most of the samples above normality corresponded to nonstable patients. Only 23.4% of the CuEX samples were aligned with data obtained from concomitant urinary copper excretion.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that CuEX is a suboptimal tool for assessing copper homeostasis when used alone and should be used with caution if no additional information is available.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^113KZD3Z]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

The calculated NCC has historically been used to monitor the evolution of Wilson's disease patients, but its diagnostic use has never been validated. A cut-off of > 25 μg/dL has been proposed as most untreated Wilson disease patients have these values, but this can also occur in other circumstances, like liver failure of any etiology, limiting its diagnostic value. Our results illustrate this problem, given the inadequate performance this method showed in diagnosing Wilson disease in an acute liver failure scenario.

Exchangeable copper and its ratio to serum copper, known as relative exchangeable copper (REC), have proven value in multiple situations related to Wilson disease. Initial studies showed the utility of the REC for diagnosis, with values > 14% or > 18% having 100% sensitivity and specificity. A more recent study from a different team evidenced that a cut-off of > 14% allowed for 100% specificity and a sensitivity of 93.8%. Our findings indicate that the best REC cut-off is > 14.4%, consistent with previous studies.

We have previously published a study comparing the REC values of two Wilson disease cohorts (recently diagnosed or non-stabilized and well-controlled patients) with two groups (adults and children) of other liver diseases. This study showed that a REC value > 14% has excellent diagnostic performance for Wilson disease, but both groups, Wilson disease, and non-Wilson disease, included either chronic patients or patients not in a situation of acute liver failure. Our study is the first to evaluate this performance in an acute liver failure setting, and it shows that it is comparable to previous results.

### EASL-ERN clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^116YFGQ9]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining both serum ceruloplasmin and basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion as the first step for screening for copper metabolism abnormalities in adult patients with suspected WD presenting with either predominantly hepatic, neurological, or neuropsychiatric manifestations. Obtain relative exchangeable copper determination in serum if available.

### Estimating risk from copper excess in human populations [^111aRtG5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Risk assessment for nutrients assumes a single population with a normal distribution of indexes of requirements and excess. Toxic levels are, by definition, intakes above the upper level. For copper, however, because we lack noninvasive, sensitive biomarkers of storage or early damage from excess, excess is based on the infrequent occurrence of clinical disease, such as unexplained liver cirrhosis. We examine the limitations of this approach for copper, given the very low prevalence of clinical and subclinical disease, and suggest that the population risk for copper excess be based on hepatic copper loading as a potentially quantifiable measurement. The challenge ahead is to develop biomarkers that predict the population risk of elevated hepatic copper stores and thus the possibility of disease in a population.

### Lower serum copper concentrations are associated with higher prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: a matched case-control study [^112qSQrR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Copper is an essential trace element involved in oxidative stress reactions and energy metabolism. While nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related to metabolic dysfunction, the role of copper in the development of simple steatosis (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is still unclear. We aimed to compare serum copper levels between patients with simple steatosis and those with NASH.

- **Methods and results**: We studied 102 patients with biopsy-proven NASH (cases) and 102 NAFL controls, who were matched for age, sex, and residential city. Multivariable conditional logistic analysis was performed to explore associations between serum copper levels and the presence of NASH. Serum copper levels were significantly lower in patients with NASH than in those with matched NAFL controls (15.53 ± 2.41 μmol/l vs. 16.34 ± 3.23 μmol/l; P = 0.029). This intergroup difference in serum copper levels was more pronounced in men than in women. The per unit, per SD, and per doubling of serum copper levels were associated, respectively, with an approximately 20, 40, and 90% decrease in risk of having NASH, even after adjustment for potential confounding factors.

- **Conclusion**: Lower serum copper concentrations are significantly associated with higher prevalence of NASH among biopsied-proven NAFLD patients, particularly in men.

### Adherence to treatment, a challenge even in treatable metabolic rare diseases: A cross sectional study of Wilson's disease [^112dhVdZ]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). High credibility.

Wilson's disease (WD), a rare genetic disorder responsible for copper accumulation in the body, is fatal if left untreated. Although there are effective treatments, adherence to treatment tends to be low. We evaluated the medication adherence of 139 patients using the Morisky scale. Adherence was correlated with age at diagnosis and at inclusion in the study, the form of the disease, the treatment, the duration of treatment, delivery and storage problems, depression, anxiety, the level of education, and the biological data.

- **Adherence levels**: 32.4% of the patients had low adherence; their levels of exchangeable copper were significantly higher than those of the patients with high or medium adherence (P = .049). The average age of the patients at the time of the study was significantly higher in those with high adherence than in those with medium or low adherence (P = .043).
- **Disease form and symptoms**: 75.9% of the patients with high adherence had a neurological form and 26.7% of the patients with low adherence were asymptomatic (P = .0090).
- **Duration of treatment**: The duration of treatment was significantly longer in the patients with high adherence than in those with medium or low adherence (P = .0192). The type of treatment (chelators or zinc) had no impact on the level of adherence.
- **Dispensing and storage issues**: Forty-four percent of the patients experienced problems dispensing and storing medications.

Despite the availability of effective treatments for this rare disease, adherence problems occur with Wilson's disease, in particular among asymptomatic patients. Although different factors are involved, sustained multidisciplinary management on a case-by-case basis is necessary.

### Elevation of serum copper in the New Orleans bariatric clinic population: The norm or geographically localized findings [^115PxdRf]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Circulating micronutrient levels of both serum copper and zinc have been studied to varying degrees in both the general public and patients having undergone bariatric surgery. According to the 2019 ASMBS clinical guidelines, copper supplementation is recommended for patients undergoing metabolic surgery, especially after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and duodenal switch. Copper excess has not been previously reported to any significant degree in any population.

- **Objective**: In this study, we investigate an elevated serum copper level in the pre-surgical intervention population of the Bariatric Center of the University Medical Center-New Orleans, a primary safety net hospital for the state of Louisiana.

- **Methods**: Five hundred five consecutive patients from the bariatric surgery undergoing a workup for surgical intervention were assessed. Patients were included regardless of whether they proceeded to surgery. The study was conducted as a retrospective review of deidentified data that was collected as part of our routine workup for bariatric surgery.

- **Results**: The study population of the clinic consisted of a mean BMI of approximately 50 kg/m², with 91% of the population reporting female and 69% recording an African American race. It was discovered in this population that 26% of the patients had an elevated copper level of > 155 mcg/dl. Additional analysis was performed attempting to elucidate an environmental role in the elevation by qualitative analysis of patients' location of residence using reported home address. Additional variables were studied as well including…

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^113tLamh]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

The calculated non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) has historically been used to monitor the evolution of Wilson disease (WD), but it has never been validated for diagnosis. Several limitations have been raised against the utilization of this method, particularly its dependence on the method employed for ceruloplasmin determination, which can sometimes lead to negative and difficult-to-interpret values.

A different assay to directly determine the NCC is known as the exchangeable copper (CuEXC) and represents the labile portion of copper bound to albumin and other peptides, but not to ceruloplasmin.

The ratio of the CuEXC to total serum copper is known as relative exchangeable copper (REC). The REC has demonstrated its utility in the diagnosis of WD. In a previous study, we reported that both the sensitivity and specificity of the REC for the diagnosis of WD were 100%, comparing cohorts of adults and children with WD with other hepatic diseases in a chronic and stable setting, thus not including any case of acute liver failure (ALF). The present study aims to evaluate the performance of the REC in diagnosing WD in ALF.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's Disease, particularly concerning serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, the AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend recognizing that an extremely low serum ceruloplasmin level (< 5 mg/dL) more strongly suggests a diagnosis of Wilson Disease than modestly subnormal levels. However, serum ceruloplasmin alone is insufficient for making a diagnosis of Wilson Disease. Do not exclude Wilson Disease based on normal serum ceruloplasmin levels.
