## Question

Admission protocol for two broken arms elderly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the admission protocol for an elderly patient with bilateral upper extremity fractures ("two broken arms"). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about prehospital triage and whether bilateral proximal long-bone fractures meet trauma activation criteria. Then, I should verify the ED priorities: ABCs, analgesia, and early imaging. Next, I will consider geriatric-specific assessments, including frailty, cognition, and fall risk. After that, I need to check indications for operative versus nonoperative management and the timing of surgery. I will then review VTE prophylaxis, rehabilitation planning, and secondary prevention including osteoporosis and falls. Finally, I should confirm disposition planning, special considerations like elder abuse screening, and summarize a practical protocol with checkpoints and quality metrics.

> Let me first confirm the prehospital implications. Bilateral upper extremity fractures meet Step Two anatomic criteria for field triage to a trauma center, specifically "two or more proximal long-bone fractures", which should trigger transport to the highest level of care within the trauma system, so I need to ensure the patient is routed appropriately and that the receiving hospital is prepared for geriatric trauma activation [^115Rx9yE] [^113DbYTv].

> Wait, let me verify the ED priorities before jumping to orthopedics. Airway, breathing, and circulation come first, with particular attention to hemorrhage control, hemodynamic stability, and early recognition of shock physiology in older adults, where a systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg or a shock index greater than 1 should heighten concern even in the absence of classic hypotension, and I should also screen for concomitant injuries that are common in geriatric falls, including head, cervical spine, and thoracic injuries [^111Z158p] [^112uDkRD].

> I need to ensure adequate analgesia early because pain drives immobility, atelectasis, and delirium in older adults. A multimodal approach with acetaminophen as first-line, regional anesthesia when feasible, and cautious opioid titration is recommended, and I should remember to reduce opioid starting doses by about 25% at age 60 and 50% at age 80 to mitigate overdose risk while reassessing pain frequently per Joint Commission-aligned standards [^116hYAa1] [^115mJ3ry].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy. Standard AP and lateral radiographs of both affected extremities are essential, and I should obtain a chest X-ray given the high prevalence of rib fractures and pulmonary complications in elderly falls. Let me consider whether a CT pan-scan is warranted; in low-energy fragility fracture presentations, routine whole-body CT rarely changes orthopedic management and may delay care, so I should reserve pan-scan for high-energy mechanisms, altered mental status, or clinical suspicion of additional injuries rather than using it reflexively [^111hTYaQ] [^117QZPbj].

> Hold on, I should verify geriatric-specific assessments that influence risk and disposition. I will assess frailty, baseline functional status, cognition, and fall risk, using tools like the Timed Up and Go where feasible, and I should document preinjury independence and living situation because these drive rehabilitation needs and discharge planning; I also need to check for anticoagulant use and bleeding risk, and screen for elder abuse when injury patterns are atypical or inconsistent with history, especially bilateral fractures or polytrauma in various stages of healing [^116GaCGL] [^1179KPLV] [^111Ga1Ep].

> Let me think about operative versus nonoperative decision-making. For most distal radius fractures in patients over 65, high-quality evidence shows no long-term functional advantage to operative fixation compared with nonoperative care, so I should default to closed reduction and immobilization unless there is unstable displacement, open injury, or high-demand functional goals; for both-bone forearm fractures, surgical fixation is generally indicated to restore length, alignment, and rotation, and I should confirm neurovascular status and compartment risk before deciding on timing [^1146PpnR] [^117HDfPM].

> I should double-check timing if surgery is indicated. Early fixation within 24–48 hours reduces complications and length of stay in geriatric fracture care, so once medically optimized, I should expedite operative management and coordinate anesthesia and geriatric input to minimize delays; if nonoperative care is chosen, I need to ensure close follow-up for loss of reduction and early mobilization planning [^116ztgR9] [^112uzDvA].

> Next, I should review VTE prophylaxis because immobilization plus age elevates risk. Pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH or UFH should begin as soon as bleeding risk allows, and if pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated, mechanical compression should be used; I need to tailor agent and dose to renal function and weight, and consider extending prophylaxis after discharge in high-risk patients per trauma VTE protocols [^117TadD8] [^117C3qaY].

> I will now examine rehabilitation planning, since this is pivotal with bilateral upper extremity fractures. Early involvement of physical and occupational therapy within 24 hours is recommended even if the patient cannot fully participate initially, with focus on ADL adaptation, assistive device training, and caregiver education; I should confirm that discharge planning starts immediately, including home safety evaluation and equipment procurement, because functional dependence is high with bilateral upper extremity injuries [^114Btc4T].

> But wait, what about secondary prevention. I need to ensure osteoporosis evaluation and treatment initiation via a fracture liaison service or equivalent, including calcium, vitamin D, and anti-resorptive therapy when indicated, and I should arrange falls risk assessment with balance and strength training; these steps reduce refracture risk and improve long-term outcomes, though I should acknowledge that some programs show improved prescription rates without short-term refracture reduction, underscoring the need for sustained follow-up [^115aAkHA] [^113TWHHJ].

> I should confirm disposition planning early. Many elderly patients with bilateral upper extremity fractures will require inpatient rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility placement, and I need to anticipate longer length of stay and higher likelihood of non-home discharge compared with isolated injuries; coordinating with case management and social work from day 1 helps avoid delays and reduces alternative-level-of-care days [^1122BMyG] [^113LEYHt].

> Hold on, I should verify special considerations. Elder abuse screening is essential when injuries are bilateral, unexplained, or inconsistent with the reported mechanism, and I should involve social work and follow institutional reporting pathways; I also need to reassess pain control regularly given the high risk of undertreatment in older adults with cognitive impairment and the potential for opioid-related adverse effects [^1179KPLV] [^115mJ3ry].

> Let me reconsider the practical protocol to ensure nothing is missing. A concise, stepwise approach includes: trauma activation for bilateral proximal long-bone fractures; ED ABCs with early multimodal analgesia; targeted imaging with bilateral extremity radiographs and chest X-ray, reserving CT pan-scan for select indications; geriatric assessment of frailty, cognition, function, and falls; operative versus nonoperative decision-making aligned with evidence for distal radius and both-bone forearm patterns; expedited surgery when indicated; early VTE prophylaxis; immediate rehabilitation and ADL planning; osteoporosis and falls prevention; and early disposition planning with abuse screening as indicated, with quality metrics tracked for time to OR, VTE prophylaxis initiation, and functional outcomes at discharge [^115Rx9yE] [^1146PpnR] [^112uzDvA] [^117TadD8] [^114Btc4T] [^111BBPtd].

---

For an elderly patient with bilateral upper extremity fractures, use a **geriatric-focused protocol** with early trauma activation, multimodal analgesia, and rapid surgical decision-making to reduce complications and length of stay. Key steps: activate trauma for bilateral proximal long-bone fractures [^115Rx9yE]; obtain bilateral AP/lateral radiographs and a chest X-ray; start multimodal analgesia and assess neurovascular status; initiate VTE prophylaxis unless contraindicated [^117TadD8]; involve orthopedics, geriatrics, and PT/OT early; and plan discharge with early rehabilitation and osteoporosis management [^111BBPtd]. This approach addresses the high risk of pain, functional loss, and complications in this population [^112uDkRD].

---

## Initial assessment and triage

- **Trauma activation**: Activate trauma for bilateral proximal long-bone fractures, as these meet anatomic criteria for high-acuity trauma [^115Rx9yE].

- **Primary survey**: Follow ATLS principles, with emphasis on airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure, while assessing for concomitant injuries.

- **Vital signs and hemodynamics**: Monitor closely; older adults may have blunted responses, so subtle changes can signal significant compromise [^111Z158p].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Obtain **bilateral AP and lateral radiographs** of the affected upper extremities to define fracture pattern, displacement, and joint involvement. Obtain a **chest X-ray** to screen for rib fractures, pneumothorax, or pulmonary contusion, which are common in elderly falls. Use **CT scans selectively** for complex intra-articular fractures, suspected associated injuries, or when radiographs are inconclusive.

---

## Pain management

Use a **multimodal analgesic approach** — acetaminophen, NSAIDs (if not contraindicated), and regional anesthesia (e.g. brachial plexus block) — to reduce opioid use and adverse effects [^1177AfSr]. Titrate **opioids cautiously**, starting at 50–75% of standard adult doses to minimize sedation, delirium, and respiratory depression [^116hYAa1].

---

## Hemodynamic stabilization and fluid management

Use **restrictive transfusion** with a hemoglobin threshold of 7–8 g/dL in stable patients without cardiovascular compromise; transfuse at 8–10 g/dL for those with cardiac disease or symptomatic anemia. Avoid **fluid overload** by using small boluses (250–500 mL) with frequent reassessment to prevent pulmonary edema and respiratory complications [^1151VKL6].

---

## Surgical decision-making

- **Early orthopedic consultation**: Involve orthopedics within 24 hours to determine operative versus nonoperative management based on fracture type, displacement, and patient factors [^notfound].

- **Operative indications**: Consider ORIF for unstable, displaced, or intra-articular fractures; nonoperative care for stable, minimally displaced fractures with close follow-up.

- **Timing**: Aim for surgery within 24–48 hours when indicated to reduce complications and length of stay [^116z81Dp].

---

## Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis

Start **pharmacologic prophylaxis** with LMWH or UFH as soon as bleeding risk allows, and continue until the patient is mobile or discharged [^117TadD8]. If anticoagulation is contraindicated, use **mechanical prophylaxis** with sequential compression devices.

---

## Rehabilitation and functional recovery

Initiate **early PT/OT** within 24–48 hours to preserve function, prevent stiffness, and facilitate ADL adaptation. Provide **adaptive devices** and train caregivers to support independence and safety.

---

## Geriatric-specific considerations

Assess **frailty and comorbidities** using validated tools (e.g. Clinical Frailty Scale, Charlson Comorbidity Index) to guide care intensity and disposition [^116ya6B7]. Screen for **cognitive impairment and delirium** with CAM-ICU or 4AT, and implement delirium prevention strategies. Evaluate **nutritional status** and provide supplementation as needed to support healing [^1177AfSr].

---

## Discharge planning and follow-up

Plan **disposition** to home with support, inpatient rehabilitation, or skilled nursing based on function, comorbidities, and social support. Ensure **osteoporosis management** with calcium, vitamin D, and anti-resorptives, and arrange fall-risk assessment and secondary prevention [^111BBPtd]. Schedule **follow-up** within 2 weeks for wound check, radiographs, and functional reassessment.

---

## Potential complications and mitigation strategies

| **Complication** | **Mitigation strategy** |
|-|-|
| Delirium | - Multimodal analgesia <br/> - Early mobilization <br/> - Sleep hygiene <br/> - Cognitive stimulation [^notfound] |
| Infection | - Strict aseptic technique <br/> - Early wound care <br/> - Antibiotic prophylaxis when indicated [^1177AfSr] |
| Nonunion/malunion | - Early surgical fixation <br/> - Close follow-up <br/> - Patient education [^notfound] |
| VTE | - Early pharmacologic prophylaxis <br/> - Mechanical devices <br/> - Early mobilization [^117TadD8] |
| Functional decline | - Early rehabilitation <br/> - Adaptive devices <br/> - Home modifications [^114Btc4T] |

---

A structured, geriatric-focused protocol for bilateral upper extremity fractures in the elderly emphasizes **early trauma activation**, multimodal analgesia, rapid surgical decision-making, VTE prophylaxis, and early rehabilitation, with attention to frailty, cognition, and osteoporosis. This approach reduces complications, shortens length of stay, and improves functional outcomes.

Risk of bias

We contacted authors to resolve areas of uncertainty and successfully clarified details in five randomized controlled trials. We considered six trials to be at low risk of bias, and the remaining 20 studies to be at high risk of bias (table 2). The main limitations were failure to report method for allocation concealment (15 trials), unblinded patients (10 trials), unblinded caregivers or outcome assessors (10 trials), and high or unclear numbers of patients excluded from the analysis (13 trials; table 2).

### Predictors of mortality in elder patients with proximal humeral fracture [^115ccSix]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Patients and Methods

The research was performed at a community-based hospital with level 1 trauma center designation. By searching Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes, we identified 648 patients aged ≥ 60 years with fractures of the proximal humerus, treated between 2006 and 2012. Eligible study patients were ≥ 60 years old with an isolated and unilateral fracture of the proximal humerus. Exclusion criteria included polytrauma patients, bilateral fractures, shoulder dislocations, and pathologic fractures. Admission, at the discretion of the emergency department (ED), orthopaedic, or medical attending physician, was typically secondary either to a degree of social or medical dependence or to plans for early operative intervention. Fracture care was at the discretion of the treating senior author (JAS).

Three hundred nineteen patients aged 60 and over with isolated fractures of the proximal humerus met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical records (EMRs). The information obtained included general patient demographics, admission status, treatment method, length of stay, discharge facility, prefracture level of independence, residence at 1-year postinjury, ambulatory status at 1-year postinjury, and mortality at 1-year and 2-year postinjury. Comorbidities were captured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. Changes in living and ambulatory status were ranked as "worse" or "same or better" (Figure 1). Fractures were classified according to both Neer and Orthopedic Trauma Association (OTA) classification schemes. Mortality was captured from the EMRs when documented or from, if date of death was not recorded in the EMRs or if clinical activity was not documented beyond 2 years of fracture. Those not identified as deceased at 1-year or 2-year postinjury by the EMRs orwere assumed to be alive at that point.

### Single-stage versus 2-stage bilateral intramedullary nail fixation in patients with bilateral femur fractures: a multicenter retrospective review [^114fK81g]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate rates of complications in patients with bilateral femur fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (IMN) during either 1 single procedure or 2 separate procedures.

Design

A multicenter retrospective review of patients sustaining bilateral femur fractures, treated with IMN in single or 2-stage procedure, from 1998 to 2018 was performed at 10 Level-1 trauma centers.

Setting

Ten Level-1 trauma centers.

Patients/Participants

Two hundred forty-six patients with bilateral femur fractures.

Interventions

Intramedullary nailing.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence of complications.

Results

A total of 246 patients were included, with 188 single-stage and 58 two-stage patients. Gender, age, injury severity score, abbreviated injury score, secondary injuries, Glasgow coma scale, and proportion of open fractures were similar between both groups. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred at higher rates in the 2-stage group (13.8% vs. 5.9%; P value = 0.05). When further adjusted for age, gender, injury severity score, abbreviated injury score, Glasgow coma scale, and admission lactate, the single-stage group had a 78% reduced risk for ARDS. In-hospital mortality was higher in the single-stage cohort (2.7% compared with 0%), although this did not meet statistical significance (P = 0.22).

Conclusions

This is the largest multicenter study to date evaluating the outcomes between single- and 2-stage IMN fixation for bilateral femoral shaft fractures. Single-stage bilateral femur IMN may decrease rates of ARDS in polytrauma patients who are able to undergo simultaneous definitive fixation. However, a future prospective study with standardized protocols in place will be required to discern whether single- versus 2-stage fixation has an effect on mortality and to identify those individuals at risk.

### Plate of ribs: single institution's matched comparison of patients managed operatively and non-operatively for rib fractures [^111KuzMm]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were mechanical ventilator duration, ICU LOS, HLOS, development of pneumonia and diagnosis of severe ARDS. The secondary outcomes are discharge disposition and PRBC transfusion. All patients in the study population were treated similarly, regardless of SSRF status, with multimodal pain control, ventilator management and pulmonary care.

During this time frame, patients were treated by a single trauma surgery group with institutional guidelines for employing multimodal pain control and admission criteria to the ICU. Admission criteria to the ICU consisted of elderly trauma patients over the age of 65, respiratory insufficiency, inability to inspire greater than 1000 cc on incentive spirometer, mechanical ventilation, or any other concerning signs or symptoms at the discretion of the attending physician. Multimodal pain control consisted of use of scheduled Tylenol and narcotic medications as needed; these could be supplemented by scheduled gabapentin, scheduled muscle relaxants, scheduled intravenous ketorolac and/or epidural catheter analgesia. In 2017, our institution began using a low-dose lidocaine peripheral intravenous infusion for pain control in rib fracture pathological findings. The decision to pursue SSRF did not alter the patient's pain regimen plan, as the patient was still treated according to our guidelines in both operative and non-operative groups.

Patient matching

We matched the operative patients with four non-operative patients with similar ages (± 2 years) and similar number of rib fractures within one rib fracture difference while staying within the age range, up to eight rib fractures. Patients in the operative arm with 8 to 12 rib fractures were matched to non-operative patients within two rib fractures due to difficulty in finding matches otherwise and the lack of evidence suggesting statistical difference in outcomes for patients with more than eight rib fractures. For operative patients with 13 or more rib fractures, we matched to non-operative patients within the age range that had 13 to 24 rib fractures, as both patients would have bilateral rib fractures and also due to the difficulty in matching otherwise. This resulted in 132 patients who were matched to the 33 patients in the operative group (figure 1).

### Hip fracture protocols: what have we changed? [^1126drcx]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Early surgical intervention is thought to reduce in-hospital morbidity and mortality as well as short-term mortality rates for elderly patients with hip fractures. However, hip fractures are also thought to be a symptom of progressive decline in elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities. A measured approach to medical optimization, which may preclude rapid surgical intervention, is often required to improve the patient's ability to resume a prefracture standard of living. Of late, new models of geriatric hip-fracture care have emerged, most of which entail early involvement of geriatricians and interdisciplinary care pathways, while continuing to focus on rapid surgical treatment.

### Cracking the hip: does protocol matter? A retrospective cohort study investigating the effect of protocol implementation [^116z81Dp]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using our institution's trauma registry. Our institution is a Level-1 Trauma Center located in a large urban area. The center's trauma registry contains retrospectively collected data of all trauma patients 18 years of age or older who come to our Level-1 Trauma Center. For each patient, information such as demographics, time spent in the emergency room, and resulting surgical operations are collected as well as postoperative complications, mortality, and discharge disposition. Appropriate approval by the institutional review board was obtained prior to initiation of any aspect of this study.

To effectively improve outcomes, our protocol defines the hospital stay into 4 discrete phases: Emergency Department (ED), Admission, Preoperative, and Postoperative with clearly defined roles for all personnel in each area. The ED phase focuses on diagnosing patients so that they may be admitted in under 4 hours. The Admission phase ensures that patients are accurately allocated to orthopedic, Medicine or Trauma teams and that History and Physicals are completed in a timely matter. The Preoperative phase details the roles of the orthopedics and anesthesia in expediently organizing the OR, giving DVT prophylaxis, and completing the necessary preoperative clearance, including consults to other services as an echocardiogram when necessary so that surgery is performed within 24 hours of admission. The Postoperative phase calls upon a multidisciplinary team including physical therapy, nutrition, social work and when appropriate geriatrics and palliative to optimize the patient to be discharged within 96 hours of surgery. The time frame of 96 hours was a steep goal, the collaborating teams decided on to strive for when creating the protocol. The protocol also enlists a Quality Assurance (QA) process so that delays in these phases will be reviewed by the Trauma Performance Improvement and Patient Safety program. The protocol is signed by heads of ED, Medicine, Anesthesia, Surgery, Cardiology, Rehab, Social Work, and Nursing. By distinctly defining responsibilities for all involved services, crucial patient care tasks may be undertaken simultaneously.

### Rib fractures in the elderly: physiology trumps anatomy [^1139XRns]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, we retrospectively reviewed all patients in our center's level one trauma registry with a diagnosis of one or more rib fractures from January 2014 to June 2017 (figure 1). We excluded patients with penetrating trauma, incomplete medical records, and patients who were pregnant. We further limited our analysis to patients who were 55 years of age or older who underwent a chest CT scan during admission. The age of 55 was chosen based on institutional practice patterns described below.

Figure 1
Flow chart of patients meeting inclusion criteria.

The following demographics were extracted from the database: age, gender, ISS, a history of comorbidities, history of smoking and associated injuries. All patients presenting to the emergency department per protocol receive an arterial blood gas within 60 min of presentation. The data from the arterial blood gas was collected for each patient.

Associated injuries were obtained via our institution's trauma registry. Injuries included the following: head injuries including skull fractures, epidural or subdural hematoma or other intracranial hemorrhage; pulmonary contusions or lacerations; abdominal injuries including solid organ hematomas; hemothorax or pneumothorax identified radiographically and fractures of the clavicle, sternum, scapula, spine, pelvis or facial bones.

The RibScore is an anatomic score that has been proposed as a model to predict the subsequent inpatient course of patients presenting with rib fractures. The CT scans of each patient were reviewed to extract the six components of the RibScore which are as follows: (1) ≥ 6 total rib fractures; (2) severe rib fractures ≥ 3 (bicortical displacement); (3) presence of flail chest (≥ 3 consecutive ribs fractured in two or more places); (4) bilateral rib fractures; (5) first rib fracture and (6) at least one fracture in three anatomic locations. The RibScore was subsequently calculated for each patient.

### Is prescribed lower extremity weight-bearing status after geriatric lower extremity trauma associated with increased mortality? [^1119zLSt]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Evaluate whether mortality after discharge is elevated in geriatric fracture patients whose lower extremity weight-bearing is restricted.

Design

Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Urban Level 1 trauma center PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: 1746 patients > 65 years of age INTERVENTION: Post-operative lower extremity weight-bearing status MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality, as determined by the Social Security Death Index RESULTS: Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients who were weight-bearing as tolerated on bilateral lower extremities (BLE) had significantly higher 5-year mortality compared to patients with restricted weight-bearing on one lower extremity and restricted weight-bearing on BLE (30%, 21% and 22% respectively, p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis controlling for variables including age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Injury Severity Scale, combined UE/LE injury, injury mechanism (high vs low), sex, BMI and GCS demonstrated that, in comparison to patients who were weight bearing as tolerated on BLE, restricted weight-bearing on one lower extremity had a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.20, p = 0.76) and restricted weight-bearing in BLE had a HR of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.36, p = 0.73).

Conclusions

In geriatric patients, prescribed weight-bearing status did not have a statistically significant association with mortality after discharge, when controlling for age, sex, body mass index, medical comorbidities, Injury Severity Scale (ISS), mechanism of injury, nonoperative treatment and admission GCS. This remained true in when the analysis was restricted to operative injuries only.

### Characteristics and diagnostic workup of the patient at risk to sustain fragility fracture [^111DbnJM]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

The human body undergoes several physiological adaptations as a result of the aging process. Amongst other organs, the skeleton is also affected and when bone fragility is present, an increase in both morbidity and mortality has been reported. Identification of risk factors to calculate the probability for a given patient to develop a fragility fracture it is therefore of paramount importance. Moreover, the existence of an in house protocol for diagnostic work up using biochemical tests and imaging investigations is essential. In the herein study we discuss a diagnostic protocol that has been developed in our clinic based on knowledge from the literature and our clinical experience.

### Cracking the hip: does protocol matter? A retrospective cohort study investigating the effect of protocol implementation [^116UHuKK]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With over 300000 traumatic hip fractures occurring each year in the United States, neither orthopedic nor trauma surgery teams are strangers to the management of these patients. Knowing that early intervention is key in reducing morbidity and mortality, the orthopedic and trauma surgery departments at our Level-1 Trauma Center created a protocol to streamline already existing processes in order to reduce time to OR and hospital length of stay. These processes included having distinct phases of treatment, specifying time intervals and expediting time to the OR. It included protocolization of the indication of preoperative echocardiogram, increasing availability of orthopedic operating room staff over the weekend, and involving social work and rehabilitation services early on in patient admission. A year and a half after the protocol was implemented, we sought to determine whether the protocol made a difference.

### Direct admission to improve timely access to care for patients requiring transfer to a level 1 trauma center [^115kSAhh]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Study design and population

We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients exposed to the DA protocol during Code Help and compared them to a contemporaneous control group of patients who were transferred during non-Code Help hours from a referring ED to our ED and were thus not exposed to the DA protocol. We included patients from May 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. Patients were eligible for DA if (1) they were older than 18 years of age; (2) a referring hospital ED requested transfer to our hospital's ED; (3) the referring ED stated that the patient's primary diagnosis was trauma-related (excluding isolated orthopedic extremity fracture (Fx) as hospitals in our trauma network did not advocate for the need to transfer this population urgently); and (4) our hospital's ED was in Code Help status. If patients during the study period met these criteria but our hospital ED was not in Code Help status, the DA protocol was not used and they were transferred in the typical fashion from the referring hospital's ED to our hospital's ED.

Clinical data and outcomes measures

The DA protocol was implemented as a part of a hospital quality improvement initiative and was exempt from the institutional review. Participants did not provide informed consent as the DA protocol was a quality improvement initiative at the study hospital.

Patients exposed to the protocol were tracked prospectively during their hospitalization by a member of the study team. Data collected included patient age, sex, race, ethnicity, mechanism of injury, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS and admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Injury details were classified according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) system per the National Trauma Data Bank definitions. The trauma diagnosis known at triage was analyzed by the surgical team in the history and physical admission note. The final trauma diagnosis was analyzed as specified by the surgical team in the patient's discharge summary notes, imaging reports and operative notes.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^114Gfare]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in pelvic fracture patients reports that among patients with pelvic fractures, up to 34 percent develop proximal DVTs and up to 12 percent go on to have pulmonary embolism, that pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis with either low-molecular weight heparin or low-dose heparin should be initiated as quickly as possible, that if immediate pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices should be considered, that there is no high quality evidence regarding preferred timing or agent, and that it is reasonable to start pharmacologic prophylaxis once bleeding has ceased as defined by lack of ongoing transfusion and stabilization of hemoglobin, supported by a study of 100 patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin within 24 hours of admission.

### Cracking the hip: does protocol matter? A retrospective cohort study investigating the effect of protocol implementation [^114qaC8a]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

As a level-1 trauma center that routinely manages hip fracture patients, we have implemented our own unique collaborative hip fracture protocol (Figure 1), streamlining existing processes to expedite surgical intervention for isolated hip fracture patients. The protocol's purpose was to optimize the number of patients going to the operating room within 24 hours of their triage time and to maintain a hospital length of hospital stay of under 96 hours. Our study's objective was to determine if this protocol had an effect on time from admission to surgery, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and mortality rates.

### Is there a role for CT pan-scans in the initial workup of fragility fracture patients? [^117QZPbj]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the geriatric patient population continues to grow, it has become increasingly important for orthopedists to understand how the treatment of the elderly individuals differs from that of younger patients. The population of people older than 65 is expected to double in the United States by 2060. Health-care cost in the United States from traumatic injury in this population is estimated to cost more than $34 billion annually, and the cost is only predicted to increase as the population ages. Consequently, fragility fractures, which are fractures caused by a mechanism that would normally be insufficient to break otherwise healthy bone, will comprise an even larger portion of fractures that are managed by orthopedists. - More attention must be paid to traumatic injuries in geriatric patients, as elderly patients are frail, have diminished physiological reserve, and are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. -,

One area of interest is the utility of performing a whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan, often referred to as a pan-scan, in the setting of lower energy mechanisms of injury. - The benefits of these pan-scans include minimizing missed diagnoses of soft tissue injuries, decreased time needed for workup, and lesser intensive care requirements.,- Pan-scans have proven to be effective and, in recent years, have become a commonplace part of the initial workup for the general trauma population. However, there has been a dearth of research focusing on the utility of obtaining a pan-scan in the geriatric trauma population with isolated orthopedic injuries.

The evidence regarding the utility of CT pan-scans in the geriatric trauma population is mixed, with some studies finding benefit while others failing to show significant impact on outcomes. Increased utilization of pan-scans has led to a commensurate increase in incidental findings while portending little to no impact on final treatment or outcomes in this patient population. Ultimately, this represents an unnecessary health-care cost and may lead to a potential delay in definitive management of their presenting complaint. Protocol-based use of pan-scans have failed to show any improvement in patient mortality. Several studies have shown some benefit, such as preventing under triage, decreased time to diagnosis, and improved diagnostic accuracy. However, these studies address the general trauma population or any trauma occurring in the geriatric population. To our knowledge, no study has directly addressed orthopedic management in patients who have sustained fragility fractures and are subject to this diagnostic strategy. This study seeks to determine how CT pan-scans impact the total care of the elderly trauma patient who has sustained a fragility fracture.

### Cracking the hip: does protocol matter? A retrospective cohort study investigating the effect of protocol implementation [^116ztgR9]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As we are faced with an expanding elderly population, traumatic isolated hip fractures in patients over 60 years old will become more common. Given the importance of surgical timing in reducing morbidity and mortality in these patients, efficiency in optimizing these patients to undergo surgery and discharging them from the hospital is critical. Implementing a collaborative hip fracture protocol helped achieve goals of decreasing overall mortality for patients with isolated hip fractures and revealed the utility of protocol in reducing length of hospital stay, time to OR, and postoperative complications. It is important to build on the progress that has already been made. The departments involved in the protocol (ED, orthopedic surgery, trauma surgery, anesthesia, cardiology, rehabilitation medicine) should all be aware of the goals for each patient and the specifics of the protocol. Geriatricians should be made an integral part in the postoperative care of these patients. Education on the protocol should be expanded to all healthcare personnel involved in the care of a patient with a hip fracture.

Future work will focus on expansion and improvement of the granularity of postoperative complication reporting in the trauma registry. Additionally, further efforts will be taken to improve follow-up reporting for these patients after discharge. As we believe that implementation of a hip fracture protocol could significantly reduce the financial impact of hip fractures, as it reduces the TTO, LOS and complication rates, we will continue to expand and re-evaluate our hip fracture protocol. We believe our findings should encourage other centers to adopt inter-disciplinary hip fracture protocols.

### Predictors of mortality in elder patients with proximal humeral fracture [^1145vdTW]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Proximal humerus fractures are the third most common fracture in patients over the age of 65. Historically, these patients have been considered to be more robust than patients with hip fractures but frailer than patients with distal radius fractures. – Although the incidence of these fractures is rising, only sparse literature addresses the significance of this injury in elderly individuals, especially in frail elderly individuals.

During previous decades, the implication of hip fractures on morbidity and mortality has been well studied and has also driven care. Examples of this effect include the development of hip fracture protocols that prescribe immediate full weight bearing, surgical repair within 48 hours, and the stratification of risk relative to age and comorbidities. – In contrast to this work in hip fracture care, relatively little analogous data exist to help counsel elderly patients regarding survival or living independence following a fracture of the proximal humerus.

The primary aim of this study was to identify risk factors for mortality in elderly patients with proximal humeral fracture. Secondarily, we investigated correlates in patient characteristics and patient outcomes. Specifically, we examined mortality in elderly patients with isolated fractures of the proximal humerus in relation to patient factors including comorbid conditions, body mass index (BMI), hospital admission status, treatment method, level of discharge facility, and level of prefracture patient independence.

Study registration

The study is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR7245; date 10-06-2018).

Study population and eligibility criteria

This study focuses on frail institutionalized elderly who have a limited life expectancy and fracture their proximal femur. In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet all of the following criteria:
Frail institutionalized elderly person (i.e. 70 years or older, living in a nursing home pretrauma, who either: is malnutritioned (i.e. cachexia or a Body Mass Index, BMI, of < 18.5 kg/m²); or has mobility issues with increased risk of falling pretrauma (i.e. Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) 2 or less) *; or has severe comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 4 or 5).
Acute proximal femoral fracture, confirmed on X-ray or CT-scan
Provision of informed consent by patient or proxy

* The FAC is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device. FAC category 2 are patients who require manual contact of no more than one person during ambulation on level surfaces to prevent falling, consisting of continuous or intermittent light touch to assist balance or coordination. Patients categorized as 0 (nonfunctional ambulatory), 1 (dependent for continuous and necessary physical assistance) to 2 due to a temporary and easily resolvable problem will not be eligible.

A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:
Bilateral proximal femoral fractures
Periprosthetic fracture
Fracture diagnosed more than 7 days after trauma
Patients with a known metastatic disease and a confirmed pathological fracture of the proximal femur
Insufficient comprehension of Dutch language to understand rehabilitation programs and other treatment information (this applies to the person signing consent, being either the patient or proxy)
Participation in another surgical intervention or drug study that might influence any of the outcome parameters

### Orthopedic trauma and aging: It isn' T just about mortality [^1166xfpi]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

The elderly (age 70+) patient with orthopedic trauma is a rapidly growing subset of patients in the United States. Due to increased medical comorbidities and decreased physiological reserve, morbidity and mortality after trauma may significantly differ from those patients younger than 70 years old. A retrospective review was performed to investigate the effect of age on orthopedic trauma. A total of 870 records of patients with orthopedic trauma from 2006 to 2009 at our Level One trauma center were reviewed. A database was created to include demographics, type and number of comorbid conditions at presentation, injuries, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and description of the fracture. Patients aged 70 years and older had an increased number of comorbidities per person (3.3214-P < .0001). Length of stay in patients aged 70 years and older was not significantly greater than that of the younger patients. They spent an average of 14.76 days in the hospital compared to 13.42 days for the combined younger patients (P = 0.45), but they spent significantly (P < .0001) more of their stay in the ICU (52.74% vs 34.9% for the younger cohorts). The number of fractures per patient was lower (1.66) in the 70 and older age-group when compared to younger populations (P < .0001). The 70 and older group was more likely to have their injury due to a fall and less likely to have solid organ injuries. As the number of elderly patients increase, continued research in the management of elderly patients with trauma can lead to protocols and practice guidelines to improve outcomes.

### Postoperative treatment of proximal humerus fractures with an early active motion protocol: a prospective randomized controlled trail [^113Hc3tg]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Proximal humerus fractures are common injuries in elderly patients. Although a majority of fractures can be treated conservatively, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with locking plates is still the most commonly used operative treatment modality. Regarding postoperative treatment, there is currently no consensus in the literature. A restrictive rehabilitation regimen, which can lead to a prolonged and effortful rehabilitation process, may not make full use of the possibilities that modern angular stable implants in combination with adequate patient selection and improved operative techniques have to offer. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the functional results of a novel early active motion rehabilitation protocol for postoperative treatment of proximal humerus fractures treated with a locking plate.

Methods

From March 1, 2016, to February 29, 2023, patients were prospectively screened for inclusion. In the conventional group (CG), patients underwent a strict postoperative protocol with immobilization in a shoulder-arm sling for 4 weeks, which should be worn day and night. In the early functional group (EFG), no restrictions regarding movement and force were given. In both groups, no heavy lifting, no exhausting physical activity, and no blunt force on the arm was performed for 3 months postoperatively. Within a follow-up of 24 months, primary and secondary outcome parameters were collected.

Results

No significant difference was found in the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, Constant score (CS), and relative CS for the injured shoulder at any point of observation. After 24 months, the CS showed a mean of 81.3 (standard deviation [SD] 11.6) points in the CG and 78.4 (SD 14.0) points in the EFG. Relative CS was 89.8% of the uninjured side in both groups, respectively. DASH score showed a mean of 15.9 (SD 15.8) in the CG and 13.9 (SD 15.2) in the EFG. There was also no significant difference in visual analog pain scale score, patient satisfaction, and EuroQol-5 Dimensions visual analog scale score in between the groups.

Conclusion

It could be demonstrated that early active motion rehabilitation for postoperative treatment after locking plate fixation of proximal humerus fractures was not inferior to a restrictive treatment protocol after a follow-up period of 24 months, even in a slightly older and more comorbid patient population. Further studies investigating postoperative rehabilitation after ORIF of proximal humerus fractures should be conducted.

### Effect of a fracture liaison service on the rate of subsequent fracture among patients with a fragility fracture in the Norwegian capture the fracture initiative (NoFRACT): a trial protocol [^111BBPtd]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Adherence to the Protocol and to the Intervention

The coordinating nurses at the NoFRACT hospitals underwent training in FLS with a well-trained nurse and physician to ensure standardization of the program. The University Hospital of North Norway was scheduled to start on May 1, 2015, but was delayed for 5 months and started on October 1, 2015. All other hospitals initiated the intervention on the date as scheduled.

The patients who were prescribed treatment with antiosteoporotic drugs were offered follow-up with the coordinating nurse. After 3 months, a phone consultation was performed to rule out misunderstandings, answer questions, and take care of potential adverse events. The close follow-up was conducted to improve the adherence to treatment. After 12 months, the patients were again offered a phone consultation or an appointment with a nurse. Each patient and their general practitioner were advised concerning length of treatment, and the patient could be referred for a reassessment after 2 to 3 years to decide further treatment.

Potential Harm From the Intervention

Exposure to the intervention is associated with minimal discomfort; however, blood samples are obtained at baseline (start of the intervention), during which some patients may experience a slight discomfort. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is a painless imaging modality with a modest dose of radiation. The most common adverse effects of antiosteoporotic drugs are muscle pains and gastrointestinal symptoms, the latter of which are caused by oral bisphosphonates. Intravenous treatment with zoledronic acid is associated with transient hypocalcemia and influenzalike symptoms. In addition, bisphosphonates are rarely associated with risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture. The patients were informed of potential adverse effects from the treatment.

Study Outcomes

The primary study outcome is change in the rate of subsequent fracture (per 10 000 person-years) for patients with the following ICD-10 codes: S22 (rib[s], sternum, and thoracic spine), S32 (lumbar spine, pelvis), S42 (shoulder, upper arm), S52 (forearm), S62 (wrist, hand), S72 (femur), S82 (patella, lower leg, and ankle), and S92 (foot). The secondary study outcome is all-cause mortality among patients with the following ICD-10 codes: S72.0-S72.2 (hip fracture).

### Real-world effectiveness of anti-resorptive treatment in patients with incident fragility fractures-the STORM cohort – A Swedish retrospective observational study [^116Dx2wN]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Matching procedure

Each AR‐treated patient (case) was matched to five non‐AR‐treated patients (controls), matching on age (maximum difference of 1 year), sex, and fracture type (see Fracture Episode Definition). Each individual was considered a valid control until becoming a case or having a new fracture after index fracture. The matching was done by randomly selecting, with replacement, five controls from the pool of valid controls; i.e. patients not yet AR‐treated at the given number of days from the index fracture. This means that each patient can appear several times in the analysis database: as a case (at most once), and as a control (several times). Controls that later become cases are censored on the day of AR treatment. This procedure is similar to the one discussed in Bergman and colleagues and Lu with the purpose to avoid immortal time bias.

Fracture episode definition

In order to avoid misclassification of fractures (i.e. if patients have several instances of visits/admissions with fracture diagnoses recorded for the same actual fracture), we established so called fracture episodes for the following five fracture sites (ICD‐10 codes presented in Tables S1 –S5):
Fracture of forearm (ulna and radius)
Fracture of upper arm
Hip fracture
Pelvic fracture
Vertebral fracture

The fracture episode start date was defined as the date of the patient's first recorded fracture diagnosis (Fig. S1). If the time to a subsequent fracture diagnosis at the same site was < 365 days, that fracture diagnosis was attributed to the first fracture episode. If the time to the subsequent recorded fracture diagnosis was > 365 days, that diagnosis will initiate a new fracture episode. Furthermore, to be categorized as a valid fracture episode, at least one of the diagnoses recorded within the episode must be recorded by a treating physician.

Additionally, to be categorized as a fragility fracture episode, at least one of the diagnoses within the fracture episode must include an ICD‐10 code of fall in the same level (ICD‐10 codes presented in Supplementary Table 6).

Outcome definition

Our primary outcome was occurrence of any new fracture after index fracture. As secondary outcomes, we analyzed (i) a composite of all‐cause mortality and any new fracture, (ii) hip fracture separately, (iii) a composite of all‐cause mortality and hip fracture, and (iv) all‐cause mortality separately. Any fracture was defined as fracture of forearm, upper arm, hip, pelvis and vertebral fractures.

### Polytrauma patient with a massive pulmonary embolism and ischemic stroke in the setting of a patent foramen ovale [^112eMcCh]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A patient in their 50s presented as a level-2 trauma activation after a motor vehicle collision. Their primary survey was intact. A FAST examination demonstrated a trace pericardial effusion without hemodynamic compromise and absent intraperitoneal fluid. Further radiographic investigations found left fourth through eighth and right seventh and eighth rib fractures, a right femur fracture, and right first through fourth metatarsal fractures. The patient was admitted to the Trauma Service, started on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) chemoprophylaxis (Lovenox 30 mg two times per day), and underwent a right femoral intramedullary nail placement and right metatarsal open reduction and internal fixation. The patient's hospital course was complicated by (1) acute blood loss anemia (hemoglobin: 6.6 g/dL) secondary to a splenic laceration not present on index imaging requiring splenic and left gastric artery embolization (figure 1a, b), and (2) delayed bilateral upper extremity weakness secondary to chronic spinal stenosis and cervical subluxation found on MRI requiring a C 3–6 decompressive laminectomy. In the setting of a newly found left lower extremity DVT, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed due to institutional protocol to refrain from chemoprophylaxis immediately after neurosurgical interventions. Heparin 7500U TID was started on postoperative day 4. On the planned day of discharge, the patient underwent a left upper extremity ultrasound due to new onset edema in the setting of a previously placed peripherally inserted central catheter. An extensive DVT was found in the left innominate, axillary, and brachial veins. Later that day, secondary to acute onset hypoxia (SpO₂: 75%), tachycardia (HR: 135 BPM), and hypotension (SBP: 70 mm Hg), the patient was intubated and required three vasopressors to maintain a MAP of 65 mm Hg. A CT pulmonary embolus protocol angiogram showed evidence of acute bilateral pulmonary arterial emboli (figure 1c, d).

### Geriatric trauma management [^111Z158p]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Trauma team activation in older adults — trauma activation protocols must have specific criteria for older adults because using standard adult trauma activation criteria can lead to undertriage and delays in the recognition of injury severity in older adults. The National Trauma Triage Protocol suggests a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 110 mm Hg as a criterion for older adults for transport to a trauma center, and changing the heart rate criterion from 120 beats per minute to 90 is also recommended for the older adult trauma patient. The shock index (SI), equal to heart rate divided by SBP, can also be integrated into the trauma activation criteria, and an SI greater than 1 reliably predicts mortality. At this time, no protocol is recommended for ground-level fall (GLF) activation for hip fracture, and a recent systematic review contends that uncertainty remains over the optimal geriatric-specific prehospital trauma triage criteria. Current recommended geriatric trauma activation criteria include GLF for patients on antithrombotic agents, SBP less than 110, heart rate above 90, SI greater than 1, and GLF patients not on anticoagulants with GCS < 14 and signs of head trauma.

### Financial implications of trauma patients at a Canadian level 1 trauma center: a retrospective cohort study [^113LEYHt]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With temporal trends showing a general increase in trauma admissions related to all studied MOIs during the 5-year study time span (figure 2), our trauma center will undoubtedly encounter hospital management-related logistical stresses. We have shown that both modifiable and non-modifiable factors are significantly associated with hospital costs. We describe that lengthy admissions that may be related to ALC status and placement issues for patients with increased care needs correlate with significant cost and constitute the largest users of hospital expenditure in our quintile analysis of trauma patients. We outline the importance of specific protocols in reducing costly adverse events and we emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the care of the trauma patient. We posit that systems-based enhanced recovery protocols may similarly correlate with economic and clinical benefits in the trauma population. Unique care protocols for distinct populations such as the elderly may be required, notably given that injuries are highly likely to be life-altering and carry a significant social and economic burden within geriatric populations. With further studies, we hope that the benefits of these studies can aid in resource allocation and encourage funding in the highly variable field of caring for injured patients.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^114Btc4T]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Rehabilitation of the multisystem trauma patient — key messages emphasize that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team can provide optimal care to multiply-injured patients and should be integrated into the acute care hospitalization. Initial evaluation by a rehabilitation team should occur as early as possible following admission, even for critically ill patients unable to actively participate. Early evaluation provides an opportunity for the development of a proactive rehabilitation program and might reduce functional decline during hospitalization.

### Immediate weight bearing of plated both-bone forearm fractures using eight cortices proximal and distal to the fracture in the polytrauma patient is safe [^117HDfPM]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rehabilitation of trauma patients is facilitated by surgical stabilization permitting weight bearing (WB) of the fractured extremity. Both-bone forearm fracture (BBFx) plate osteosynthesis is an accepted technique with high union and low complication rates; yet, postoperative WB protocols have not been adequately investigated. There exists concern for increased complications in plated BBFx fractures for patients prescribed immediate WB. We hypothesized that immediate WB of surgically treated BBFxs results in acceptable rates of complications.

Methods

Patients presenting to a Level-1 trauma center from 2007 to 2016 with a BBFx were identified retrospectively. Patients were skeletally mature, surgically treated with prescribed immediate WB protocol, and followed for 6 months or to fracture union. Collected data included demographics, fracture characteristics, associated injuries, and WB protocols for all extremities. Complications recorded included nonunion, hardware failure, and infection. Standard statistical comparisons were used to evaluate the risk of complication in polytrauma patients with modified lower extremity WB protocols (polytrauma group) and patients with no lower extremity WB restrictions (isolated group).

Results

Two hundred thirteen patients were included with 75 (35%) females and 138 (65%) males. Mean age was 40 years and mean follow-up was 46 weeks. There were 142 (67%) patients in the poly-trauma and 71 (33%) patients in the isolated groups. In the poly-trauma group 21 (10%) patients had bilateral lower extremity WB restrictions. There were 11 (6%) complications noted: 2 non-unions, 4 hardware failures, and 5 infections. Demographics did not vary between the two groups. There was no difference in complications in the isolated (5.7%) versus poly-trauma groups (5.0%) (P = 0.75).

Conclusion

Immediate WB rehabilitation after BBFx plate osteosynthesis seems to be safe and associated with low nonunion and complication rates. Our results demonstrate that polytrauma patients using ambulatory aids for lower extremity injuries can immediately WB without increased risk compared with isolated BBFx patients.

### Assessment of anatomic restoration of distal radius fractures among older adults: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115jJwoo]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Study Cohort

We used data collected as part of the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial (WRIST), an international, 24-site randomized clinical trial of DRF treatment in older adults. At each participating site, 2190 patients aged 60 years or older were screened for eligibility from April 10, 2012, to December 31, 2016. Inclusion criteria were isolated DRFs (exception: concomitant ulnar styloid fracture) with displacement warranting surgical intervention (AO [Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (Association for the Study of Internal Fixation)] type A2, A3, C1, or C2 and meeting one of the following radiographic criteria after reduction attempt: dorsal tilt > 10°, radial inclination < 15°, or radial shortening > 3 mm). All fractures were amenable to treatment with all 3 surgical options. Patients with open fractures, bilateral fractures, prior ipsilateral DRF, or additional serious trauma were ineligible. Also excluded were patients living in nursing homes or other assisted living facilities and those with neurologic conditions affecting upper extremity sensation or movement, comorbid conditions prohibiting surgery, serious neurologic or psychiatric conditions precluding informed consent, or inability to complete study questionnaires and follow directions. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 1. The parent study WRIST was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Michigan, which included secondary analyses of the data.

Enrolled patients were randomized (after written consent was obtained) to receive percutaneous pinning, external fixation with or without supplemental k-wire fixation, or internal fixation with volar plate, stratified by study site. Those who consented to study participation but did not wish to undergo surgery despite the recommendation and who met identical eligibility criteria as randomized participants were treated with casting and were considered an observation group (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Follow-up care and rehabilitation and/or physical therapy were carried out per institutional standards at each site with 2 years of follow-up. For the present study, we included in our cohort the participants who completed 12-month functional evaluation, patient-reported outcomes questionnaires, and radiographic assessment.

### American Association for the Surgery of Trauma / American college of surgeons committee on trauma clinical protocol for postdischarge venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after trauma [^117C3qaY]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Trauma patients are at an elevated risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. In the inpatient setting, prompt pharmacologic prophylaxis is utilized to prevent VTE. For patients with lower extremity fractures or limited mobility, VTE risk does not return to baseline levels postdischarge. Currently, there are limited data to guide postdischarge VTE prophylaxis in trauma patients. The goal of these postdischarge VTE prophylaxis guidelines are to identify patients at the highest risk of developing VTE after discharge and to offer pharmacologic prophylaxis strategies to limit this risk.

### Implementation of a chest injury pathway in the emergency department [^112oRVxC]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Problem

Rib fractures represent a substantial health burden. Around 20% of patients admitted after trauma will have at least one rib fracture. Chest injuries contribute to 25% of deaths after trauma and survivors can experience long-standing consequences, such as reduced functional capabilities and loss of work. The importance of early detection and aggressive management of rib fracture has been well described in the literature, especially in the older population. In the elderly, trauma to the thorax represents the second most common site of injury and mortality rates are two to five times higher compared with their younger counterparts. Poor pain management leads to hypoventilation, pneumonia and respiratory failure and is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Each additional rib fracture increases the odds of mortality by 19% and of developing pneumonia by 27%. Early detection and aggressive pain management of these patients in the emergency department (ED) are important as even patients with initial normal respiratory status can develop complications up to 72 hours later. The development of protocols in the ED for management of patients with chest wall injuries has been demonstrated elsewhere to reduce the incidence of pneumonia.

The Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH) is a level 4 teaching hospital based in Dublin's north inner city. It provides dedicated national services for spinal surgery and cardiothoracic surgery including heart and lung transplant, and it has been recently announced to become one of the major trauma centres for the country. The ED is an adult-only department in Dublin that has an annual attendance of around 80 000 patients, it is staffed by 8 whole time equivalent emergency medicine (EM) consultants, 19 registrars, 18 senior house officers and 2 interns. MMUH did not have a specific guideline and standardised method to manage patients presenting with blunt chest injuries in the ED. Our inspiration to improve patient care with this project started with an encounter with an elderly patient who presented to the ED with torso trauma from a simple fall. She was discharged from the ED and re-presented a few days later after having developed pneumonia, which resulted in a long and complicated inpatient admission.

Our aim was to standardise the management of patients presenting with blunt chest trauma to our ED by introducing a multidisciplinary care pathway; more specifically to increase the rate of documented analgesia from 39% to 100%, to increase the rate of regional anaesthetic blocks performed in the ED from 0% to 50% and to increase the rate of discharge advice given from 7% to 100% within 1 year.

### Association of trauma center designation with postdischarge survival among older adults with injuries [^111VvNib]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Older adults account for most injury-related hospital admissions and deaths in the US, yet the results of this cohort study suggest that they do not benefit from existing TC care as younger adults do. Current guidelines for geriatric trauma care are built on the presumption that benefits of TC care are consistent across the life span. As the US trauma care system moves to develop and implement protocols for geriatric trauma care, we must understand long-term outcomes of TC care in the older adult population and identify the most effective practices for managing injuries from all mechanisms and including all anatomical patterns.

### Improving analgesia in fractured neck of femur with a standardised fascia iliaca block protocol [^114uqaXi]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Problem

Fractured neck of femur (#NOF) is a common cause of admission among the elderly population to Weston General Hospital (a district general hospital in the UK). Many patients wait up to 36 hours before surgical intervention. During this time their pain is treated with systemic analgesia on the wards. For many frail patients it can be difficult for the team to balance adequate analgesia with side effects of opioids. As a result, pain can be difficult to manage pre-operatively. In addition, many of the patients admitted with #NOF have either long-standing cognitive impairment or delirium and may not be able to adequately communicate their pain levels. It is likely that analgesia in this group is often sub-optimal.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^113XFZXW]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging in geriatric patients with low-energy mechanism injuries — elderly persons aged 65 and older face rising trauma burden, with the geriatric population projected to double in size, from 46 million in 2016 to more than 98 million by 2060 and the share of the population expected to grow from 15 percent to nearly 24 percent. The most common injury mechanism is a ground-level fall, accounting for 75 percent of trauma events, and 90 percent of those falls are from the standing position. Injuries are often underestimated and this population is highly susceptible to trauma recidivism due to physiologic and psychosocial vulnerability, while changes in physiology, especially age-related balance and flexibility deficits, are responsible for a higher risk of injury following a low-impact mechanism.

### A rare entity: traumatic thoracic aortic injury in a patient with aberrant right subclavian artery [^116Z3u6Q]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Aberrant right subclavian artery is an uncommon entity incidence ranging from 0.5 to 2.5%. Management of thoracic aortic injury in the presence of such anomalies can be a challenge. We present here a case of traumatic aortic injury, which was incidentally found to have an asymptomatic aberrant right subclavian artery. The patient was managed by an endovascular repair of thoracic aortic injury with an endograft and a right carotid to subclavian artery bypass as a hybrid procedure.

Methods

A 40-year male patient was brought to the emergency in shock with an alleged history of road traffic accident an hour back. After initial resuscitation as per advance trauma life support protocol, imaging revealed thoracic aortic injury with aberrant right subclavian artery with multiple rib and bilateral humerus fracture. After primary stabilization of arm fractures, the patient was shifted to a hybrid operation room. As the aortic injury was within 10 mm of the origin of both subclavian arteries, it was decided to cover the origin of both subclavian arteries and land the endograft distal to the left carotid artery origin. Since there was a right dominant vertebral artery on imaging, right carotid to right subclavian artery bypass was done with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft to prevent posterior circulatory stroke along with thoracic endovascular aortic repair to seal the thoracic aortic injury.

Results

After endovascular repair of thoracic aortic injury, left subclavian artery perfusion was maintained through left vertebral artery; and hence, revascularization of left subclavian artery was deferred. After management of all fractures, the patient was discharged 3 weeks after the date of admission without any complications. At 6 months follow-up, patient was stable and images showed patent bypass graft and sealed aortic injury.

Conclusions

In a trauma setting with multiple injuries, hybrid procedure with a thoracic endograft is associated with low mortality and morbidity; hence, it is the treatment of choice for thoracic aortic injury over open surgical repair. A hybrid suite can be life and time saving in situations which mandate simultaneous endovascular repair along with surgical revascularization when indicated, especially in cases with aberrant aortic arch anatomy.

### Implementation of a multidisciplinary preoperative protocol for geriatric hip fractures improves time to surgery at a level III trauma center [^113evkQ8]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

At our institution, this protocol was initiated in August 2020, and data from Cohort #2 was collected from August 2021 to September 2022. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital operations were already stressed. Initiating a new protocol at any point would naturally require some time for clinical teams to adjust to the new process, subsequently resulting in a lag time before seeing the desired results. By initiating a new protocol in 2020 and collecting data in 2021 when the effects of the pandemic are still being felt within an already-stressed hospital system, one can only expect that lag time to be prolonged. After initial analysis revealed the increased LOS in Cohort #2 and postulating that it was largely due to COVID-19, we performed a secondary analysis of a subset of Cohort #2 (Subgroup 2B) that included only patients admitted from May to September 2022 (a period where the effects of COVID-19 have more than likely dissipated) with the hypothesis that the LOS in these patients would not significantly differ from the LOS in Cohort #1. Analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in LOS between these groups. This supports our hypothesis that COVID-19 was a large confounding variable that was inflating the average LOS in our post-protocol group. In contrast, however, other studies have demonstrated that LOS was decreased during the pandemic. - So the question still remains: how exactly did COVID-19 affect our study, and why was LOS increased post-protocol? It is difficult to precisely measure the effects of COVID-19 on our study, but one possible explanation for the prolonged LOS in the post-protocol group is the difficulty in getting patients discharged to rehabilitation centers (ie SNFs). As the population ages, more geriatric patients are likely to need some form of rehabilitation prior to returning home. Some may not be able to return home at all due to social factors such as family support and the type of home (older homes may have narrowed stairways, smaller bathrooms, and may not be a safe environment). After the pandemic, in our area, there have also been staffing issues impacting the number of beds available in rehabilitation centers. We believe this is a significant contributor and a confounding variable leading to the extended LOS observed in the post-protocol group. This theory is supported by our results which demonstrated a significant increase in LOS in Cohort #2 for patients who were discharged to a SNF, but no significant difference in LOS between the cohorts for patients who were discharged home, as patients who are going home are not under any formal COVID-19-related restrictions. There is minimal literature investigating the differences in LOS depending on discharge disposition, so further exploration of this topic may potentially elucidate some important modifiable factors for geriatric hip fracture care in the post-operative period.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^114WRRci]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Orthopaedic trauma — indications warranting transfer to a Level I or Level II trauma center: Strong consideration for transfer to a Level I or Level II trauma center should be given to patients with the following orthopaedic injuries, including unstable pelvic fracture requiring transfusion of more than six units of red blood cells in six hours, complex pelvic or acetabular fractures, fracture or dislocation with a loss of distal pulses, vertebral fractures or findings concerning for spinal cord injury, and more than two unilateral rib fractures or bilateral rib fractures with pulmonary contusion(s) in the absence of critical care availability. In some situations, patients with minor orthopaedic injuries warrant strong consideration for transfer to a Level I or Level II trauma center; examples include carotid artery, vertebral artery, or other significant vascular injury, bilateral pulmonary contusions with a PaO₂:FiO₂ ratio < 200, grade IV or V liver injuries requiring transfusion of more than six units of red blood cells in six hours, penetrating injuries or open fracture of the skull, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) < 14 or lateralizing physical examination findings, significant torso injury in the setting of advance comorbid disease, such as coronary artery disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and extremes of age, particularly with respect to the pediatric population.

### Trauma patients at risk for venous thromboembolism who undergo routine duplex ultrasound screening experience fewer pulmonary emboli: a prospective randomized trial [^116jVPDA]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although guidelines are established for the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in trauma, no consensus exists regarding protocols for the diagnostic approach. We hypothesized that at-risk trauma patients who undergo duplex ultrasound (DUS) surveillance for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) will have a lower rate of symptomatic or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) than those who do not undergo routine surveillance.

Methods

Prospective, randomized trial between March 2017 and September 2019 of trauma patients admitted to a single, level 1 trauma center, with a risk assessment profile score of ≥ 5. Patients were randomized to receive either bilateral lower extremity DUS surveillance on days 1, 3, and 7 and weekly during hospitalization ultrasound group (US) or no surveillance no ultrasound group (NoUS). Rates of in-hospital and 90-day DVT and PE were reported as was DVT propagation and all-cause mortality. Standard care for the prevention and management of VTE per established institutional protocols was provided to all patients.

Results

A total of 3,236 trauma service admissions were screened, and 1,989 moderate- and high-risk patients were randomized (US, 995; NoUS, 994). The mean ± SD age was 62 ± 20.1 years, Injury Severity Score was 14 ± 9.7, risk assessment profile was 7.1 ± 2.4, and 97% suffered blunt trauma. There was no difference in demographics or VTE risk factors between the groups. There were significantly fewer in-hospital PE in the US group than the NoUS group (1 [0.1%] vs. 9 [0.9%], p = 0.01). The US group experienced more in-hospital below-knee DVTs (124 [12.5%] vs. 8 [0.8%], p < 0.001) and above-knee DVTs (19 [1.9%] vs. 8 [0.8%], p = 0.05). There was no difference in 90-day PE or DVT, or overall mortality.

Conclusion

The implementation of a selective routine DUS protocol was associated with significantly fewer in-hospital PE. More DVTs were identified with routine screening; however, surveillance bias appears to exist primarily with distal DVT. Larger trials are needed to further characterize the relationship between routine DUS screening and VTE outcomes in the high-risk trauma population.

### Risk factors for the second contralateral hip fracture in elderly patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Q4eno]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To achieve a quantitative and comprehensive conclusion concerning the risk factors for the second contralateral hip fracture in elderly patients with initial hip fractures.

Data Sources

This search was applied to Medline, Embase, Cochrane central database (all up to April 2014).

Methods

All the studies on bilateral hip fractures in elderly patients published in English were reviewed and qualities of included studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. All the data were carefully and independently abstracted by two reviewers, any disagreement was settled by discussion. Data was pooled and a meta-analysis completed.

Results

A total of 13 case-control studies were identified for the meta-analysis. The significant risk factors were female (odds ratio (OR), 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–1.64), living in institutions (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.33–4.85), osteoporosis (OR, 10.02; 95% CI, 5.41–18.57), low vision (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.06–4.12), dementia (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.54–2.65), dizziness (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.42–5.87) cardiac diseases (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.00–1.78) and respiration diseases (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.22–5.47). No significant difference was found in admission age between patients with the unilateral hip fracture and the first hip fracture of bilateral hip groups (standardized mean difference, 0.02, 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.35].

Conclusions

Patients involved with female, living in institutions, osteoporosis, low vision, dizziness, dementia, respiration diseases and cardiac diseases were at risk for a second contralateral hip fracture after the initial hip fracture.

### American Association for the Surgery of Trauma / American college of surgeons-committee on trauma clinical protocol for inpatient venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after trauma [^117TadD8]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Trauma patients are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is a critical component of optimal trauma care that significantly decreases VTE risk. Optimal VTE prophylaxis protocols must manage the risk of VTE with the competing risk of hemorrhage in patients following significant trauma. Currently, there is variability in VTE prophylaxis protocols across trauma centers. In an attempt to optimize VTE prophylaxis for the injured patient, stakeholders from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the American College of Surgeons-Committee on Trauma collaborated to develop a group of consensus recommendations as a resource for trauma centers. The primary goal of these recommendations is to help standardize VTE prophylaxis strategies for adult trauma patients (age ≥ 15 years) across all trauma centers. This clinical protocol has been developed to (1) provide standardized medication dosing for VTE prophylaxis in the injured patient; and (2) promote evidence-based, prompt VTE prophylaxis in common, high-risk traumatic injuries.

The transfer of all patients with orthopaedic injuries to a higher level of care is conducted in a timely (as defined by institutional protocol) manner, and all deviations from predetermined transfer agreements are reviewed and discussed both within and between the involved centers and are processed through a secondary level of review by the trauma PIPS or equivalent committee within the hospital. Direct and timely communication between orthopaedic providers at each facility occurs prior to all patient transfers, and when it does not occur, the reasons are clearly documented by providers on both ends of the transfer.

### Improved outcomes and reduced medical costs through multidisciplinary co-management protocol for geriatric proximal femur fractures: a one-year retrospective study [^115aAkHA]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To manage the rapidly growing incidence of, and related medical burden resulting from hip fractures in older adults in an aging society, studies involving orthogeriatric co-management treatment models have reported improved outcomes, including reduced medical costs. The treatment gap for osteoporosis was however seldom emphasized in the published treatment protocols. Aiming to improve the existing orthogeriatric protocol, we have established a patient-centered protocol for elderly patient hip fractures, which simultaneously focuses on fracture care and anti-osteoporosis agent prescription in regarding to healthcare quality and medical expense.

Methods

This was a retrospective study comparing patients who enrolled in the multidisciplinary co-managed protocol for geriatric hip fractures and those who did not. The inclusion criteria for this study were: (a) single-sided hip fractures treated from 1 to 2018 to 30 June 2020, (b) patients who were 60-years or older (c) trauma treated within 3 days from time of injury, and (d) minimal follow-up period of 12 months after surgery.

Results

From 1 to 2018 to 30 June 2020, 578 patients were included (267 patients in the protocol group vs. 331 patients in the conventional group). The protocol group was associated with significantly reduced lengths of hospital stay (p = 0.041), medical expenditures (p = 0.006), and mortality (p = 0.029) during their acute in-hospital admission period. Early osteoporosis diagnosis and anti-osteoporosis agent prescription were achieved in the protocol group, with a significantly wider coverage for BMD assessment (p < 0.001) and prescriptions for anti-osteoporosis medication (p < 0.001). Yet, there was no significant decline in the one-year refracture rate in the protocol group.

Conclusions

The implementation of a multidisciplinary co-managed care protocol for geriatric proximal femur fractures successfully improved patient outcomes with significantly reduced lengths of stay, medical expenditures, and mortality during the acute in-hospital admission period. The high prescription rate of anti-osteoporosis medication after hip fractures in the protocol group was not associated with a significantly lower re-fracture rate in the 12-month follow-up. However, the association between early anti-osteoporosis agent prescription and reduced long-term medical expenses in this group of patients has provided a direction for future research.

### Epidemiology of distal radius fractures: elucidating mechanisms, comorbidities, and fracture classification using the national trauma data bank [^1142udPA]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

An update on the epidemiology of distal radius fractures in the United States is necessary, particularly as the elderly population grows. Additionally, age and frailty have been associated with complications following surgical fixation of DRFs. Herein, we utilize the National Trauma Data Bank, a robust nationwide resource, to investigate the relationship between demographics, comorbidities, injury and fracture characteristics, and admission details.

Methods

Patients with isolated distal radius fractures were identified from the National Trauma Data Bank (2016–2019) according to ICD-10 codes. Univariate and multivariate regressions were conducted to determine independent risk factors for bilateral fractures, displaced fractures, open fractures, as well as length of hospital stay and adverse discharge disposition for patients undergoing inpatient surgical fixation.

Results

The incidence of DRFs was 3.6/1,000 trauma-related emergency department visits and 10.8/1,000 upper extremity traumas. Trauma mechanism was significantly associated with displaced and open fractures. Age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01–1.01), BMI (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.02), smoking (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15–1.57), and alcohol level (trace: OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.41–3.29; intoxicated: OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.63–2.95) were significantly associated with open fractures. Machinery (β = 2.04, 95% CI 1.00–3.08) and MVT (β = 0.39, 95% CI 0.08–0.69) mechanisms were independent risk factors for longer length of stay. mFI-5 was an independent risk factor, in a stepwise fashion, for both length of stay and adverse discharge disposition.

Conclusions

High-energy mechanisms and risk factors for poor skin quality were significantly associated with open fractures. mFI-5 was an independent risk factor for longer length of stay and non-routine discharges in patients of all ages, despite controlling for other comorbidities, unrelated complications, and mechanism of injury. Trauma mechanism was an independent risk factor for prolonged length of stay only, particularly in patients younger than 65 years of age.

### Comprehensive approach to the management of the patient with multiple rib fractures: a review and introduction of a bundled rib fracture management protocol [^115WSSHk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Rib fractures are common among patients sustaining blunt trauma, and are markers of severe bodily and solid organ injury. They are associated with high morbidity and mortality, including multiple pulmonary complications, and can lead to chronic pain and disability. Clinical and radiographic scoring systems have been developed at several institutions to predict risk of complications. Clinical strategies to reduce morbidity have been studied, including multimodal pain management, catheter-based analgesia, pulmonary hygiene, and operative stabilization. In this article, we review risk factors for morbidity and complications, intervention strategies, and discuss experience with bundled clinical pathways for rib fractures. In addition, we introduce the multidisciplinary rib fracture management protocol used at our level I trauma center.

Material and Methods

Trial Design and Eligibility Criteria

This study was a single-center, parallel, two-arm, RCT conducted at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. The inclusion criteria were a traumatic fracture of the distal part of the femur of AO/OTA types A2, A3, B1, B2, C1, and C2and age 65 years or older. Exclusion criteria were concurrent injury or any pre-existing condition that could considerably affect rehabilitation, preinjury inability to ambulate independently with or without walking aids (crutches or walker), inability to communicate in the Swedish language, severe cognitive impairment (6 points or fewer) according to the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, and open fractures of types II and III according to the Gustilo–Andersson classification.

Surgery

Surgery was carried out within 72 hours after admission. All patients underwent surgery according to a standardized protocol based on pre-existing routine. Procedures were done by 1 of 7 consultant orthopedic trauma surgeons. The written protocol was made readily available to the involved surgeons who were also briefed on its content. The surgical protocol included positioning the patient on a traction table and reducing the fracture using closed techniques such as traction, with the fracture dorsally supported by a femur-support (Figure 1). The limited skin incision could be extended to allow additional open reduction when necessary. A stainless-steel LCP ® Distal Femur Plate (Synthes™, Oberdorf, Switzerland) was introduced under the fascia lata using a minimally invasive technique. A 13- or 15-hole plate was used depending on the length of the femur (Figure 2). The plate was fixed to bone with locking screws. Distally 5 bi-cortical screws were used. Proximally 4 screws were inserted through stab incisions, the most proximal of these was mono-cortical but the remaining screws were bi-cortical. Only a strictly bridge-plating construct was allowed, no screws or cerclage wires were used across the fracture site. A biplanar image intensifier was used to verify adequate fracture reduction and hardware positioning.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^117TEX2C]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Triage and transfer of orthopaedic injuries — key messages emphasize that optimal care of orthopaedic injuries occurs when both the health care providers and hospitals are capable of providing high-quality care, and direct communication between transferring and receiving institutions is important prior to patient transfer and when breakdowns in the transfer process occur. Patients with a combination of TBI (GCS score ≤ 15) and moderate to severe extra-cranial anatomic injuries and Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) ≥ 3 should be rapidly transferred to the highest level of care within a defined trauma system to allow for expedient neurosurgical and multidisciplinary assessment and intervention. Hospitals should develop protocols and procedures for identifying patients with orthopaedic injuries who are likely to benefit from transfer to a designated trauma center, and certain orthopaedic injuries always warrant strong consideration for transfer to a designated trauma center. In the setting of concurrent injuries, co-morbidities, or extremes of age, strong consideration should be given to transferring patients with minor orthopaedic injuries, and transfer agreements between hospitals can facilitate the timely transfer of injured patients. To ensure optimal care is provided, patients with musculoskeletal injuries should be treated where both the provider and hospital are able to adequately care for a patient's injuries; in the event that a provider feels comfortable managing a given injury but the facility does not have the adequate resources to provide ideal care, the patient should be transferred to a facility that does have the capability of providing an optimal level of care. The variability in provider and institutional capabilities make it difficult to establish uniformly applicable criteria for whom to transfer and whom to manage locally; the best interest of the patient should be the underlying principle guiding all transfer decisions, and Appendix B is an example of a tool that a trauma center might use to identify who can be cared for locally and who should be transferred to a higher level of trauma care, which hospitals can use as a template to develop institutional protocols and procedures.

### Is there a role for CT pan-scans in the initial workup of fragility fracture patients? [^111hTYaQ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Whole-body CT imaging has been increasingly used in the setting of acute trauma in the United States and has become protocolled as part of the initial general trauma workup at many institutions. - However, the benefits of this practice in elderly patients with low-energy trauma are unclear. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the impact CT pan-scans have on the management of fragility fracture patients. Ours is the first study to seek to determine whether routine CT pan-scans should remain part of TS and ED protocols.

This study demonstrated that of the 109 patients who underwent CT scans, only 1 patient had a change in orthopedic management and 12 had a change in nonorthopedic management, despite over half of the study population being found to have additional acute findings. Furthermore, patients who underwent a pan-scan did not have significantly different TTS or LOS compared to those who did not, indicating that their workup did not expedite surgical intervention or early discharge. The FFS at our institution was established in 2012, and we feel that TTS and LOS being similar between cohorts is due to the maturity of this service. An institution with a less experienced FFS may have shown significantly increased TTS or LOS in patients who underwent CT pan-scans, which is concerning as unnecessary delays in surgical management in this patient population and has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality.

Several studies have examined the benefits of CT pan-scans in the general trauma population. Whole-body CT imaging has been found to improve diagnostic accuracy, decrease time to diagnosis, decreased time to operative treatment, and reduction in overall mortality. However, this study did not support these findings when applied to the fragility fracture population. Other studies looking at elderly patients who sustain traumatic injuries have demonstrated no difference in injury severity and no impact on mortality when pan-scans were utilized in lower energy mechanisms. This discrepancy demonstrates that whole-body CT imaging has greater utility for younger patients and in higher energy trauma.

There is limited reporting in the literature on how CT pan-scans have altered specific patient care. Roberts et al and Kim et al both examined changes in care following whole-body CT imaging in low-risk patients. Roberts et al found that only 5% of their study population had an emergent intervention as a result of a CT pan-scan. Kim et al found only 3% of elderly trauma patients required some form of procedural intervention based on a CT pan-scan.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^1177AfSr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The trauma mortality rate is higher in the elderly compared with younger patients. Ageing is associated with physiological changes in multiple systems and correlated with frailty. Frailty is a risk factor for mortality in elderly trauma patients. We aim to provide evidence-based guidelines for the management of geriatric trauma patients to improve it and reduce futile procedures.

Methods

Six working groups of expert acute care and trauma surgeons reviewed extensively the literature according to the topic and the PICO question assigned. Statements and recommendations were assessed according to the GRADE methodology and approved by a consensus of experts in the field at the 10th international congress of the WSES in 2023.

Results

The management of elderly trauma patients requires knowledge of ageing physiology, a focused triage, including drug history, frailty assessment, nutritional status, and early activation of trauma protocol to improve outcomes. Acute trauma pain in the elderly has to be managed in a multimodal analgesic approach, to avoid side effects of opioid use. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in penetrating (abdominal, thoracic) trauma, in severely burned and in open fractures elderly patients to decrease septic complications. Antibiotics are not recommended in blunt trauma in the absence of signs of sepsis and septic shock. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with LMWH or UFH should be administrated as soon as possible in high and moderate-risk elderly trauma patients according to the renal function, weight of the patient and bleeding risk. A palliative care team should be involved as soon as possible to discuss the end of life in a multidisciplinary approach considering the patient's directives, family feelings and representatives' desires, and all decisions should be shared.

Conclusions

The management of elderly trauma patients requires knowledge of ageing physiology, a focused triage based on assessing frailty and early activation of trauma protocol to improve outcomes. Geriatric Intensive Care Units are needed to care for elderly and frail trauma patients in a multidisciplinary approach to decrease mortality and improve outcomes.

### Isolated hip fracture in the elderly and time to surgery: is there an outcome difference? [^115nX3N2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Study design and methods

This is a retrospective review of data collected from our level 1 trauma center's registry during the 3-year study period from January 2015 through December 2017. Data were collected from adult trauma patients ≥ 65 years old with IHF and subsequent repair during the 3-year study period. Patients were stratified into two groups based on time to surgery after admission: < 48 hours (group 1) versus > 48 hours (group 2). Demographic characteristics include age, gender, race, and Injury Severity Score (ISS). Postoperative variables included intensive care unit length of stay (ICU-LOS), total length of stay, and complication rates defined as DVT and PE rate, 30-day readmission rate, and mortality rate. The decision to admit to the ICU postoperatively was made by the admitting service in consultation with the orthopedic surgeon. Evaluation for DVT or PE was done based on symptoms, with no routine screening examinations. Standard venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis as per institution policy was adhered to for each patient, which required chemoprophylaxis at admission and for 35 days postoperatively. All patients admitted with IHF were treated with the same VTE prophylaxis protocol; additionally, all patients who subsequently developed VTE or PE were not on any home anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, whereas 11.4% and 12% of patients were on home antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy in the < 48 hours and > 48 hours groups, respectively. The trauma service retained responsibility for these patients but worked in consultation with the internal medicine service. Due to substantially uneven distribution of patients, we were unable to control for comorbidities between groups. Demographic characteristics and outcome measures were collected and compared between both groups. χ² test and analysis of variance were used for data analysis, with statistical significance defined as a p value < 0.05.

### Variability in discharge disposition across US trauma centers after treatment for high-energy lower extremity injuries [^1122BMyG]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association between patient- and center-level characteristics and discharge to an inpatient facility versus home after treatment for lower extremity trauma, as well as examine the variability in discharge disposition across clinical centers after controlling for these factors.

Design

This is an analysis of data collected prospectively across 5 multicenter studies of extremity trauma.

Setting

US Trauma Centers.

Participants

Patients 18–80 years with lower extremity trauma treated at 1 of 55 participating centers.

Main Outcome Measure

Discharge disposition.

Results

Among 2365 patients treated at 1 of 55 centers across 13 states, 673 (28.5%) were discharged to an inpatient facility, and 1692 (71.5%) were discharged home. Individuals who were older, female, unmarried, insured, higher body mass index, history of severe alcohol abuse, Gustilo type IIIB or IIIC open injuries, bilateral, spine and upper extremity injuries, higher injury severity score scores, or intensive care unit stay were more likely to be discharged to an inpatient facility. Even after accounting for patient- and center-level characteristics, there was substantial variation in discharge disposition across centers (likelihood ratio test: P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Variation in discharge disposition may represent a potential for improvement in resource utilization and cost savings. Further studies are needed to examine the relationship between utilization of postdischarge inpatient facility after trauma and outcomes.

Appendix A. Protocol for NASS literature searches — A preliminary search of the evidence is conducted using clearly defined search parameters, and the following parameters are provided to research staff: time frames for search; foreign and/or English language; order of results (chronological, by journal, etc.); key search terms and connectors, with or without MeSH terms to be employed; and age range. This preliminary search should encompass a search of the Cochrane database when access is available. Search results with abstracts will be compiled by the medical librarian in both Endnote software and a PubMed account, whenever possible, and the medical librarian typically responds to requests and completes the searches within 2–5 business days. NASS staff shares the search results with an appropriate content expert to assess relevance of articles and identify appropriate articles to review and on which to run a "related articles" search, and based on content expert's review, NASS Research staff will then coordinate with the medical librarian the second level searching to identify relevant "related articles". NASS staff shares related articles search results with an appropriate content expert to assess relevance of these second set of articles and identify appropriate articles to review and on which to run a second "related articles" search, and NASS Research staff will work with the medical librarian to obtain the 2nd related articles search results and any necessary full-text articles for review. The preliminary search must answer the following questions: "Should duplicates be eliminated between searches?", "Should searches be separated by term or as one large package?", and "Should human studies, animal studies or cadaver studies be included?". For additional retrieval, NASS members reviewing full-text articles should also review the references at the end of each article to identify additional articles which should be reviewed, but may have been missed in the search.

### Establishment of a novel triage system for SARS-CoV-2 among trauma victims in trauma centers with limited facilities [^115vhHF5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

The evaluation of patients with a positive RT-PCR test showed that 86.7% of patients with positive RT-PCR test results would be identified in the first three steps of our proposed triage protocol within 1 hour.

Considering the possibility of asymptomatic carriers, the existence of patients in the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease, and the likelihood of COVID-19 infection due to hospital contact, we recommend triaging other patients, who were not included in the first three steps, according to the fourth step of our triage protocol. Furthermore, considering the high possibility of direct contact with asymptomatic carriers following nursing care in patients admitted to ICUs, evaluating all patients at the ICU admission by RT-PCR test is recommended in this step.

Overall, our data indicate that the proposed novel triage system described in this study can help physicians detect the most suspicious and definite COVID-19 cases with this stepwise system in less than an hour. This approach significantly decreases the time to diagnosis, leading to a reduction in non-protected exposure between suspected and healthy patients and medical staff, and decreasing the risk of COVID-19 spread. The implementation of this triage protocol detected 28 COVID-19 positive patients (93.3%) during the first hour of hospital admission, which reduced the risk of cross-infection to our medical staff and other patients. This triage protocol also detected two asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients on arrival with normal laboratory findings. They were detected on ICU admission after orthopedic surgery.

Among other triage protocols for the general patient population, the WHO protocol had the most specific definition for suspicious individuals (100%), but it showed low sensitivity (13.3%). ECDC was the most sensitive protocol, which showed 93.3% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity, but did not prioritize patients based on trauma and their unstable condition. Instead, our pathway focused on managing trauma patients and detecting suspicious cases limiting disease transmission in the shortest period.

To the best of our knowledge, few studies have been conducted to design a stepwise pathway to manage trauma patients during the pandemic. Porcel et al recommended evaluating all patients with the RT-PCR test to find asymptomatic, positive cases in trauma patients with low-energy fractures. As mentioned above, we (and other low- and middle-income countries) cannot run this system due to our limitations.

### Use of an integrated pulmonary index pathway decreased unplanned ICU admissions in elderly patients with rib fractures [^116CAZUo]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The current study is a retrospective review of trauma patients admitted to a community level 1 trauma center between February 2020 and February 2023. The study followed the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines.

In February 2020, our hospital began IPI monitoring for elderly patients with rib fracture at high risk for respiratory failure. Patients ≥ 65 with four or more rib fractures, or two rib fractures and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were considered high risk and recommended to have IPI monitoring once they were admitted to the trauma unit. Per the protocol, nursing was instructed to contact the trauma provider for an IPI score of ≤ 7. Providers used their discretion in evaluating and managing the patient. Patients whose IPI scores were ≥ 8 for 72 hours completed the protocol and were taken off IPI monitoring. During the study period, not every eligible elderly trauma patient was offered, or agreed to receive, IPI monitoring.

Enrollment in the IPI cohort was done prospectively. IPI monitoring was done only on the trauma unit. Patients transferred from the ICU to the trauma unit were also eligible for IPI monitoring. To assess the value of IPI monitoring in patients who met criteria, we compared IPI-monitored patients to a non-IPI-monitored cohort from the same time period, February 2020 to February 2023. The comparator group was identified retrospectively using data from our institutional trauma registry. Inclusion criterion for the comparator group was patients ≥ 65 years with chest Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of ≥ 3. This inclusion criterion was selected to identify a cohort of patients who most closely matched the chest wall injuries in the IPI group. Patients were excluded if they did not meet inpatient criteria, were not treated on the trauma unit, or did not have restorative care on the floor (death in ICU or emergency room, discharged from ICU, or on comfort care only measures at admission or transition out of the ICU). Review of the electronic health record was performed to collect additional data for both cohorts including the number of rib fractures. Any patient who had initiation of IPI monitoring, but subsequently stopped IPI monitoring prior to completion of the protocol, was analyzed as a member of the IPI group.

### The effect of a pre-and post-operative orthogeriatric service on cognitive function in patients with hip fracture. the protocol of the oslo orthogeriatrics trial [^113egGKF]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Study population

Eligible patients are those admitted acutely to Ullevaal University Hospital (now: the Ullevaal Clinic of Oslo University Hospital) for a femoral neck fracture, a trochanteric or a sub-trochanteric femoral fracture as result of a low energy trauma, defined as fall from own height or from a level not higher than 1 metre.

Patients are excluded if the hip fracture is part of multi-trauma or high energy trauma (defined as a fall from a higher level than 1 metre). One recent fracture in addition to the hip fracture (e.g. radius or shoulder) is acceptable. We also exclude patients who are regarded as moribund at admittance (as judged by the admitting orthopaedic surgeon) and patients lacking a valid informed consent or assent.

There are no exclusion criteria related to age. Most younger (below 70 years) hip fracture patients have suffered a high energy trauma, and thus are excluded. The small number of patients of this age that suffer a hip fracture from a low energy trauma, are expected to be frail and thus potentially benefit from an orthogeriatric service. We also include patients who fracture their hip when already permanently institutionalised in a nursing home. We believe that this particularly frail group may benefit as much as more fit individuals from this type of service.

Some patients initially admitted to the Ullevaal Clinic, are sent to other hospitals in Oslo for surgery due to capacity problems in the operation theatre, and then back again for further care within a few hours postoperatively. Such patients are eligible, and are randomised to receive either the intervention or the usual care preoperatively as well as postoperatively. On the other side, patients are not eligible if they come from other nations or from other parts of the country, fracturing their hip during a visit to Oslo, and thus are sent to a hospital at their domicile shortly after surgery.

Some eligible patients have not been included due to surgical procedure failure. Patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain at admittance have been admitted to the orthopaedic ward whilst waiting for further diagnostic procedures (CT or MR of the hip), and thus not included. Inclusion of patients has also been put on hold in periods where intake to the acute geriatric ward is closed due to uncontrolled outbreaks of infections (mostly Noro virus). A Refused, Missed or Otherwise excluded (RMO) database is maintained to determine the feasibility of a larger study and to assess the generalisability of the enrolled sample to all cases.

### Elder abuse in the orthopaedic patient: an updated review of prevalence, identification, and screening tools for orthopaedic surgeons [^111Ga1Ep]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Practical Recommendations for Identifying and Assessing Elder Abuse

When assessing for elder abuse, it is clear that a multidisciplinary approach is most effective. Since some of the aforementioned risk assessment tools may be lengthy or have limited reliability, a tailored approach using a combination of physical examination, patient and caregiver interviews, and observation can help identify at-risk individuals. Orthopaedic surgeons and healthcare providers must be trained to recognize these signs and understand when to refer patients to social workers or other support services for further intervention. This involves evaluating not only physical indicators but also considering the patient's social and family history, as well as the psychological history of both the patient and their caregiver (Lachs & Pillemer, 2015).

Physical Indicators

Physical indicators include bruises and contusions, fractures, and dislocations. Unexplained bruises, particularly those in various stages of healing, may indicate repeated abuse. Certain fractures are more indicative of abuse, such as bilateral fractures, polytrauma, and fractures at different stages of healing. Skull and rib fractures are particularly associated with physical abuse, whereas femur and foot/ankle fractures are less likely. Dislocations are commonly seen in the shoulder, hip, and knee joints. These injuries can result from direct trauma or from pulling and twisting actions. Soft tissue injuries including contusions, abrasions, and lacerations, especially on the face, arms, legs, and trunk are also common in elder abuse patients. Pressure ulcers and burns can be indicative of neglect and improper care (Lee et al. 2023).

Coexisting Conditions

Those with mental disorders and dementia are at higher risk of abuse due to cognitive impairments that can make it difficult for them to report mistreatment. Additionally, individuals with intellectual disabilities are particularly vulnerable because of their increased dependence on caregivers (Nemati-Vakilabad et al. 2023).

### Geriatric trauma management [^112uDkRD]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Geriatric trauma management — introduction and key points — highlight that adults 65 years and older are the fastest-growing segment of the United States population and that trauma in older adults is increasing, both in number of cases and as a proportion of the total trauma center volume; unintentional injury is the seventh leading cause of death for older adults. In 2019, 54.1 million adults aged 65 years and older lived in the US and accounted for 16% of the population, and older adults are expected to account for 21.6% of the US population, or 80.8 million people, by 2040. Trauma outcomes for geriatric patients are worse than for younger patients; irrespective of mechanism, older age is an independent risk factor for mortality, and frailty is also a strong predictor of poor outcome. Neither age nor mechanism of injury appears to be correlated with injury severity in older adults, as less severe mechanisms can result in substantial injury. In this document, adults aged 65 years and older are referred to either as older adults or geriatric patients.

Surgical Techniques and Perioperative Management

All surgical procedures were performed by the same experienced surgical team to ensure consistency. For patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty, cementless arthroplasty with a bipolar head was utilized. For those treated with proximal femoral nailing (PFN), the Intertan PFN design was used in all cases. Postoperatively, all patients were mobilized with full weight-bearing as tolerated, starting within 48 h after surgery under the supervision of healthcare personnel. In our institution, short-term Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (typically < 24 h) is a common precautionary practice for elderly patients, based on preoperative assessment by anesthesiologists. Many patients are monitored in a first-level ICU unit located within the operating complex and are transferred to the ward as soon as clinically stable. As institutional protocol, early mobilization is attempted even in ICU-monitored patients, provided their condition permits.

All patients received low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis for four weeks following surgery. Preoperatively, all included patients were ambulatory without assistive devices and able to perform their daily activities independently, aligning with the inclusion criterion of pre-fracture physical activity independence.

In this study, postoperative blood transfusions were administered according to standardized clinical guidelines specifically tailored for elderly patients with hip fractures.

The primary triggers for transfusion, both before and after surgery, included hemoglobin levels falling below 8 g/dL, symptomatic anemia (eg, shortness of breath, dizziness, tachycardia, or chest pain), significant blood loss exceeding 500 mL, or the need for hemodynamic stabilization. Additionally, patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary insufficiency were also considered for transfusion under these criteria.

For those with a history of cardiovascular disease, a more conservative approach was taken, with transfusions initiated when hemoglobin levels dropped below 10 g/dL. This protocol was designed to optimize oxygen delivery and reduce potential complications, prioritizing safety and positive outcomes for this high-risk elderly population.

Prehospital selective spine assessment (Maine protocol) — Since 2002, patients with qualified mechanism of injury (axial load, blunt trauma, motor vehicle collision, adult fall from standing height) are not immobilized if they are reliable (no intoxication or altered mental status), have no distracting injury, have a normal neurological examination, and have no spine pain tenderness. During one 12 month study period only one patient with an unstable spine fracture and 19 stable fractures were found to have been not immobilized by the protocol in approximately 32,000 trauma encounters, and the protocol had a sensitivity of 94%, negative predictive value of 100%, specificity of 59%, and positive predictive value of 0%. The single unstable spine injury occurred in an 86-y-old female, elderly patients (> 65 y of age) represented the largest number of stable spine fractures without neurologic compromise but also demonstrated a higher risk of complications from spinal immobilization, and further data revealed that 1301 of 2220 patients were immobilized on the basis of the protocol.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / American society for surgery of the hand clinical practice guideline summary management of distal radius fractures [^1146PpnR]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Indications for fixation (geriatric patients) — distal radius fractures: Strong evidence suggests that operative treatment for geriatric patients (most commonly defined in studies as 65 years of age and older) does not lead to improved long-term patient reported outcomes compared to non-operative treatment, with Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Evidence description states evidence from two or more "High" quality studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. The guideline draws on 2 high quality studies and 11 moderate quality studies comparing operative and nonoperative treatment in those > 65 years of age. Some studies demonstrated improvements in patient reported outcomes in the short term (usually less than 3 mo.), but studies consistently showed no difference in patient reported outcomes in the long-term (1 year or greater) despite improvements in radiographic parameters. Age is used as a proxy for functional demand; a high functioning patient with high functional demands, despite having an age greater than 65, may benefit from operative fixation, whereas there may be low functioning younger patients with low functional demands, despite having an age less than 65, that may benefit from non-operative treatment. Recommendations are principally based upon literature studying distal radius fracture as an isolated injury, and this clinical practice guideline uses age greater than 65 as this is what is used in the literature.

### Geriatric trauma management [^1151VKL6]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Geriatric trauma — hemoglobin, transfusion, and fluid resuscitation are characterized by lower admission hemoglobin, frequent anemia, and careful fluid strategies. Older adult trauma patients generally have lower admission hemoglobin levels and receive more early and total units of packed RBC transfusions, and about 10% of geriatric trauma patients are anemic at baseline; low baseline hemoglobin could be an independent mortality predictor, and older adult patients also leave the hospital with lower hemoglobin levels. Restrictive transfusion protocols appear to be safe in geriatric trauma patients, and they may be associated with decreased complications and shortened LOS. When shock is due to hemorrhage, limiting crystalloids after hospital arrival is advised because fluid resuscitation may promote coagulopathy by diluting coagulation factors, may also cause hypothermia, and the excessive rise of mean arterial pressure may promote further hemorrhage; optimal fluid type, volume and velocity, endpoints, and perfusion pressure regulation remain controversial and definitive standards are undefined in critically ill patients. For nonhemorrhagic shock states, be cautious regarding iatrogenic fluid overload but do not let this concern delay or prevent resuscitation; combine the repeated administration of 250 mL to 500 mL boluses with frequent patient reassessment to minimize the risk of iatrogenic fluid overload. Older adults often take anticoagulant medication, which increases risk of hemorrhage.

### Blunt cerebrovascular injury in elderly fall patients: are we screening enough? [^1117bP7i]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

BCVI incidence from the local institutional data was determined by selecting all patients ≥ 18 years of age with an ICD-9 code for BCVI. The incidence of BCVI in younger patients, elderly non-GLF patients, and EGLF patients with and without risk factors for BCVI was determined. Specific screening practices, complications from screening, and outcomes were then obtained via chart review. BCVI injury grade was defined by the BCVI grading scale. Radiology reports that indicated that the injury was more likely due to a pre-existing process (atherosclerotic changes) were not included in the positive BCVI groups.

Patients with specific risk factors for BCVI were examined to determine screening rates at our institution. Upper cervical spine fractures were studied in depth as this injury complex was the most common risk factor for BCVI in the elderly. Additionally, local institutional screening protocol recommends screening for all upper cervical spine fractures. Screening rates were calculated by selecting all patients with an upper cervical spine fracture who survived for at least 24 h. Rates of BCVI screening with computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within 72 h of admission were determined via chart review. Time until BCVI screening was defined as the amount of time between admission and BCVI radiologic screening exam. Patients with BCVI screening were compared to those that were not screened for all patients with upper cervical spine fractures. Demographics, injury characteristics, renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), and pre-injury anti-thrombotic (aspirin, p2y 12 inhibitors, heparin, warfarin, and novel oral anticoagulants) were compared between the two groups.

Patients and Methods

Study Setting and Participants

We conducted a single-center retrospective study with a total of 158 patients. This study was done at the Clinique Romande de Réadaptation in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Patients, mostly blue collar workers with shoulder injuries, were included between May 2012 and January 2015. Patients are referred from all of the French-speaking counties of Switzerland, which includes urban and industrial city centers or more rural regions. The patients were sent to the rehabilitation hospital by surgeons, general practitioners, or insurance medical advisors when they had persistent (≥ 3 months) pain and functional limitations incompatible with returning to work (median, 9 months; interquartile range, 5.5–15 months). The aim of the therapeutic program was to manage patients using an interdisciplinary approach (physiotherapy with individual and group therapies, psychological sessions with a cognitive approach, social advice and vocational training) to reduce pain and disabilities and improve chances of returning to work (usual or adapted). The therapeutic program lasted 4 to 5 weeks (at least 2 to 3 hours of daily therapy, excluding weekends). All patients, hospitalized after shoulder injuries, were eligible for this study if they had no severe traumatic brain injury at the time of the accident (Glasgow coma Scale ≤ 8), had no spinal cord injury, were capable of judgment, and were not under legal custody. Patients were injured after traffic, leisure, or work (59%) accidents.

The electronic patients' files allowed all patients with shoulder injuries to be identified. Shoulder injuries were classified in the following categories: rotator cuff/bursa injuries and other shoulder injuries (clavicular fracture, proximal humerus or scapula fracture, glenohumeral dislocation, and acromioclavicular pathology). Inclusion criteria were unilateral shoulder injury and being between 18 and 65 years old. Exclusion criteria were bilateral injuries, concomitant injuries in another location (eg, spine), presence of an upper limb neuropathy (major and minor), or any missing data. Patients unable to read and understand the available validated versions of the PROMs also were excluded (see below). The protocol was approved by the local medical ethics committee (CCVEM 041/07). The study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.

### Elder abuse in the orthopaedic patient: an updated review of prevalence, identification, and screening tools for orthopaedic surgeons [^1179KPLV]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Injury Mechanisms and Patterns

Elder abuse and neglect can have significant physical consequences, many of which may present in orthopedic settings. Common injury patterns seen in orthopedic settings among elderly individuals who have been abused or neglected include fractures, dislocations, and soft tissue injuries. Fractures are the most common type of injury observed in orthopedic settings among elderly individuals who have experienced abuse or neglect. These fractures are often found in the upper extremities, particularly the humerus and forearm bones. Fractures in the lower extremities, including the femur, tibia, and fibula, are also frequently seen. Since there is a lack of well-defined predictors for elder abuse in patients with fractures, utilizing data from the National Emergency Department Sample database spanning 2007 to 2017, Gardezi et al aimed to identify independent predictors of elder abuse in comparison to nonabuse fracture controls. Among elder physical abuse patients in the emergency department, 13% presented with fractures. Findings indicated that elder abuse patients with fractures tended to be younger, female, and associated with lower income quartiles. Additionally, coexisting conditions such as volume depletion, mental disorders, dementia, and intellectual disability were prevalent in this group. The study also highlighted associations with other forms of elder abuse, such as psychological abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse, as well as multiple fractures. The multivariate regression analysis revealed that elder physical abuse was more likely with skull and rib fractures but less likely with femur and foot/ankle fractures. This research underscores the need for increased awareness of potential elder physical abuse, particularly in higher-risk patients aged 60 and above.

Common features of fractures associated with elder abuse include bilaterality, polytrauma, and varied stages of healing, indicating a pattern of repeated abuse. Dislocations are another common injury seen in orthopedic settings among elderly individuals who have experienced abuse or neglect. The shoulder joint is most commonly affected, followed by the hip and knee joints. Dislocations may occur due to direct trauma or from pulling and twisting of the affected limb. Soft tissue injuries, including contusions, abrasions, and lacerations, are also frequently seen in orthopedic settings among elderly individuals who have experienced abuse or neglect. These injuries may be located on the face, arms, legs, and trunk. In addition to these injuries, orthopedic clinicians may also encounter pressure ulcers, burns, and other injuries indicative of neglect.

### Elderly patients presenting to a level I trauma center with physician orders for a life-sustaining treatment form: a propensity-matched analysis [^113R51C3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) forms are portable medical orders documenting patient treatment preferences in an acute health decline. It is unclear how these forms are used in the management of elderly trauma patients.

Methods

Patients 65 years and older presenting to a Level I trauma center were identified between 2012 and 2017. Hospital trauma registry and medical records were used to identify a preinjury POLST and its acknowledgment by providers within 24 hours of arrival. A 1:1 propensity score matched sample was used to evaluate clinical outcomes based on the presence of a POLST limiting interventions with p less than 0.05 deemed significant.

Results

There were 3,342 elderly trauma patients identified. One hundred ninety-two (6%) had a POLST identified by the institutional trauma registry dated before the injury. Do not attempt resuscitation (DNR) was listed in 154 patients (80%), and 79% desired to avoid the intensive care unit (ICU) with limited (54%) or comfort measures only (CMO, 25%). One hundred seven (76%) of admitted POLST DNR patients had a DNR code status for the majority of their admission. 59 (58%) of the limited and 29 (60%) of the comfort measures only patients were admitted to the ICU. Acknowledgment of a preinjury POLST or code status was explicitly documented in 110 cases (57%). Propensity score analysis yielded a comparison sample of 288 patients. In the matched comparison, an acknowledged POLST with limitations was associated with a shorter ICU stay (1.7 vs. 2.8 days, p = 0.008) but there was no difference in ICU admission (58% vs. 61%, p = 0.69), total length of stay (3.8 days vs. 4.8 days, p = 0.08), or in-hospital mortality (13% vs. 8%, p = 0.2).

Conclusion

Limited provider acknowledgment of preinjury medical directives necessitates protocol development for the management of frail elderly trauma patients. When acknowledged, patients with a POLST limiting interventions had fewer ICU days without increased in-hospital mortality compared with similarly injured elderly patients.

Additionally, Mulhall et al found a ratio of 2.4:1 females to males in hip fracture alone versus 8:1 for combined fractures. In our study, there was a higher percentage of females in the hip and upper extremity fracture group than the isolated hip fracture group (67.9% of patients with hip fracture alone and 72.4% of patients with hip and upper extremity fracture). They comment on a "usual mechanism of injury" in both groups of fall onto the side which matches the most common injury of fall in our study. They also found a longer length of stay for the combined injury group (15.6 vs 20.5 days, P = 0.010).

Tow et al in 2009 performed a retrospective review on 33 patients admitted for hip and upper extremity injuries. These patients were matched to patients of similar age with hip fracture alone. They found an average age for hip and upper extremity fracture patients of 79.5 years, very similar to our average age of 79.3. The median length of hospital stay in their study was 23 versus 17 days for isolated hip fracture, much higher than our reported length of stay but consistent with the hypothesis that patients with additional fractures required a longer length of stay.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / American society for surgery of the hand clinical practice guideline summary management of distal radius fractures [^112p3NRV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Distal radius fractures — epidemiology, burden, risk factors, impact, and decision-making: Distal radius fractures account for almost 20% of fractures seen by physicians and is the second most common fracture experienced by older adults, and in 2005 alone the treatment for distal radius fractures in the elderly was estimated at $500 million with this burden expected to increase by 20% by 2025; they are one of the most common fractures seen by orthopaedic surgeons with an incidence of 195.2/100,000 persons per year. Distal radius fractures occur as a result of both high energy and low energy trauma with a bimodal distribution where high-energy fractures occur in younger persons (predominately male) and high and low-energy fractures occur in older persons (predominately female), and age (e.g. older women with osteoporosis) and sex (e.g. young males) are known risk factors for distal radius fracture in adults. Acute distal radius fracture results in pain, limitations in function, stress, and the potential inability to work, and the time to return to normal function after appropriate treatment can be prolonged and, in some cases, never return to normal. The aim of treatment is pain relief and return of function while weighing the risks and benefits of nonoperative and operative treatment, and therefore an open shared decision-making process should be undertaken that includes available treatments and their respective risks and benefits in the setting of the values and preferences of the individual patient; adoption of technology and novel treatments requires evidentiary support of efficacy and effectiveness while acknowledging cost and value.

### Implementation and adoption of advanced care planning in the elderly trauma patient [^113qRXCL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Geriatric trauma has high morbidity and mortality, often requiring extensive hospital stays and interventions. The number of geriatric trauma patients is also increasing significantly and accounts for a large proportion of trauma care. Specific geriatric trauma protocols exist to improve care for this complex patient population, who often have various comorbidities, pre-existing medications, and extensive injury within a trauma perspective. These guidelines for geriatric trauma care often suggest early advanced care planning (ACP) discussions and documentation to guide patient and family-centered care.

Methods

A provincial ACP program was implemented in April of 2012, which has since been used by our level 1 trauma center. We applied a before and after study design to assess the documentation of goals of care in elderly trauma patients following implementation of the standardized provincial ACP tool on April 1, 2012.

Results

Documentation of ACP in elderly major trauma patients following the implementation of this tool increased significantly from 16 to 35%. Additionally, secondary outcomes demonstrated that many more patients received goals of care documentation within 24 h of admission, and 93% of patients had goals of care documented prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The number of trauma patients that were admitted to the ICU also decreased from 17 to 5%.

Conclusion

Early advanced care planning is crucial for geriatric trauma patients to improve patient and family-centered care. Here, we have outlined our approach with modest improvements in goals of care documentation for our geriatric population at a level 1 trauma center. We also outline the benefits and drawbacks of this approach and identify the areas for improvement to support improved patient-centered care for the injured geriatric patient. Here, we have provided a framework for others to implement and further develop.

### Accuracy of prehospital trauma triage to select older adults requiring urgent and specialized trauma care [^116XgdFG]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study aims to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a 5-step prehospital trauma triage protocol to identify older adults who require urgent and specialized trauma care using different age cut-offs to define an older adult (≥ 55, ≥ 65, and ≥ 75 y old).

Methods

Prehospital and in-hospital medical records were reviewed for injured patients transported by an ambulance to an emergency department (ED) between November 11, 2016 and March 3, 2017 in Quebec City, Canada. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated to assess the accuracy of our prehospital trauma triage protocol to identify patients who required at least one urgent in-hospital trauma intervention.

Results

A total of 822 patients were included of which 62.9% were ≥ 55 y old and 56.3% were female. Fall (65.8%) was the main trauma mechanism. Seventy-six (9.2%) patients required urgent trauma care. This proportion was similar regardless of age (8.9%-9.5%). The proportion of patients who needed to be transported to the level-1 trauma center as per the triage protocol tended to decrease with increasing age (20.6% [whole cohort], 15.3% [≥ 55 y old], 11.4% [≥ 65 y old], and 9.0% [≥ 75 y old]). The sensitivity of the protocol for steps 1, 2, and 3 was 56.6% (whole cohort) and 30.0% for patients aged ≥ 75 y. The specificity ranged between 83.1% (whole cohort) and 93.1% (≥ 75 y old).

Conclusions

Our prehospital trauma triage protocol has insufficient sensitivity to identify patients with urgent trauma care needs, particularly in older adults.

### Fix or replace? Patient preferences for the treatment of geriatric lower extremity fractures: a discrete choice experiment [^112EZGMC]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

We conducted a discrete choice experiment to quantify the relative importance of outcomes and variation in preferences among geriatric patients when faced with a lower extremity fracture. The study was performed at a single academic Level I trauma center from November 2021 through April 2022. The Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study.

Study Population

The study enrolled orthopaedic trauma patients, age ≥ 60 years, who presented for outpatient follow-up. Patients were approached during their outpatient appointment and surveys were administered by research assistants. All patients who had the capacity to comprehend and complete the survey were eligible for participation. Patients presenting for both upper and lower extremity injuries were included. Patients were excluded from participation in the study if they were unable to speak or read English, or lacked the mental status to comprehend or complete the survey. Relatives or guardians of the patient could not complete the survey on their behalf.

### Geriatric co-management of proximal femur fractures: total quality management and protocol-driven care result in better outcomes for a frail patient population [^115ZTeVN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

Hip fractures in older adults are a common event, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Hip fractures have been previously described as a "geriatric, rather than orthopedic disease". Patients with this condition have a high prevalence of comorbidity and a high risk of complications from surgery, and for this reason, geriatricians may be well suited to improve outcomes of care. Co-management of hip fracture patients by orthopedic surgeons and geriatricians has led to better outcomes in other countries but has rarely been described in the United States. This article describes a co-managed Geriatric Fracture Center program that has resulted in lower-than-predicted length of stay and readmission rates, with short time to surgery, low complication rates, and low mortality. This program is based on the principles of early evaluation of patients, ongoing co-management, protocol-driven geriatric-focused care, and early discharge planning. This is a potentially replicable model of care that uses the expertise of geriatricians to optimize the management of a common and serious condition.

### Tranexamic acid administration at hospital admission decreases transfusion rates in geriatric hip fracture patients undergoing surgery [^116amcmz]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

There are limited studies that have examined the efficacy of early IV TXA administration to further decrease the hidden blood loss in fragility hip fractures. Baskaran et al performed a meta-analysis of 8 studies (6 randomized controlled trials and 2 cohort studies) examining TXA use in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery and only one study reported results from an admission dose of TXA. While this study reported a significant decrease in transfusions, it was limited to only 43 patients who underwent surgery for intertrochanteric fixation. Similarly, Ma et al. conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial and reported that early (within 6 hours of admission) treatment with 1g IV TXA at hospital admission reduced pre-operative transfusion rates and post-traumatic hidden blood loss in elderly patients with intertrochanter fractures, without increasing the risk of venous thrombosis. However, these studies used only a control group that received no TXA treatment, did not compare the efficacy of admission TXA dose(s) to other TXA dosing regimens, and were confined to only intertrochanteric fractures. The findings in the current study are in agreement with those reported by Baskaran and Ma. However, it is important to note that our cohort of patients were not confined to only intertrochanteric fractures, and included all types of hip fractures which may increase the generalizability of our reported findings to better define TXA guidelines.

The safety profile of TXA administration (compared to no TXA treatment) in fragility hip fracture patients is well reported and has not been associated with an increased risk of mortality, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Additionally, the 4-dose TXA model used at our institution has been shown to have no increase in vascular thrombotic events in hip fracture patients compared to those who received no TXA treatment. Although the number of patients in the current study receiving only the admission dose of TXA was small (n = 32), there was no significant difference in adverse events between patients who received TXA doses only at hospital admission compared to those who received the 4-dose TXA protocol (n = 183). While administering 4 doses compared to the admission dose of TXA will most likely not increase the risk for vascular thrombotic events, the benefits of utilizing a single admission TXA dose over the 4-dose protocol may aid in decreasing health care costs and improve medication schedule management for the providing healthcare team.
