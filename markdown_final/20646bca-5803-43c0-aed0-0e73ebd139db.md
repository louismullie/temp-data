## Question

Do you have to treat pyoderma gangrenosum immediately?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pyoderma gangrenosum requires immediate treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease biology and why it behaves aggressively. Then, I should verify the consequences of diagnostic delay and inappropriate interventions like debridement. Next, I will examine direct statements from high-credibility sources about timing of therapy. After that, I need to check outcomes data that show whether early treatment changes healing and complications. Finally, I will consider nuances such as disease severity, patient factors, and special populations before synthesizing a practical, evidence-based answer with safety cautions [^notfound].

> Let me first confirm the clinical behavior and risks of untreated PG, because that frames urgency. PG is a rapidly evolving, painful, neutrophilic ulcerative dermatosis with undermined violaceous borders that can enlarge within days to weeks, and it is associated with substantial morbidity and increased mortality compared with matched populations, underscoring the potential for serious harm if not controlled promptly [^113Auyvc] [^1128sGrL] [^117A9s2B].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic pitfalls and how they intersect with timing. PG is a diagnosis of exclusion; misdiagnosis as infection or ischemic ulceration is common, leading to harmful debridement and delayed immunosuppression. Large series document that patients with ulcer mimics were treated as PG for months, some worsened with immunosuppression, and others improved — highlighting the cost of misclassification and the need for rigorous exclusion of alternatives before committing to potent immunosuppression [^113ZkKzs]. I initially thought biopsy was always required, but hold on, I should correct that: histology is supportive but not pathognomonic, and biopsy carries a risk of pathergy; biopsy is used selectively to exclude mimics when the diagnosis is uncertain, balancing risk and diagnostic yield [^1164txj8] [^113ZkKzs].

> I will now examine direct statements on treatment timing. High-credibility case-based guidance emphasizes that PG warrants prompt initiation of systemic immunosuppressive therapy once the diagnosis is established or strongly suspected, and that early involvement of dermatology and avoidance of surgical trauma are critical to prevent deterioration via pathergy [^117A9s2B] [^112STfb6]. A systematic review similarly notes that rapidly progressive or refractory cases require early initiation of systemic therapy to halt spread, reinforcing that "immediately" is appropriate in many active presentations [^117Ti8oJ]. Even the STOP GAP RCT preamble acknowledged that leaving patients with a serious, potentially fatal disease untreated was ethically untenable, reflecting clinical urgency despite the trial comparing active agents rather than versus no treatment [^113XDmu6].

> Next, I should review whether outcomes improve with earlier treatment. The STOP GAP RCT found that with prednisolone or ciclosporin, only about 15–21% healed by 6 weeks and roughly 47% by 6 months, and both drugs had meaningful adverse event burdens, suggesting that neither agent is reliably curative and that early recognition and treatment selection matter for timely control and healing trajectories, even if complete closure can take months [^116oUjJs] [^113XDmu6]. Let me double-check: a smaller RCT of infliximab showed superiority to placebo at 2 weeks, consistent with rapid anti-TNF benefit in selected patients, again supporting the concept that earlier targeted immunosuppression can alter short-term disease activity when appropriately selected [^116DUHsi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider the pathergy phenomenon because it changes procedural decisions that can worsen outcomes if delayed. Sharp debridement and unnecessary surgery frequently exacerbate PG by triggering new lesions, and many reports show dramatic deterioration after surgical debridement until immunosuppression is instituted, with recovery once steroids or other agents are started promptly; this is why perioperative strategies emphasize quiescence and immunosuppressive cover if surgery cannot be deferred [^1144Cnse] [^111pLiBb] [^112Xa5SE].

> I should confirm special contexts where immediacy is even more critical. Postoperative PG, peristomal PG, and PG in pregnancy or immunocompromised hosts are repeatedly described as high-risk scenarios with frequent misdiagnosis, rapid progression, and poor outcomes if therapy is delayed; early dermatology input and initiation of systemic therapy are consistently emphasized in these settings to avert disfigurement and systemic complications [^112STfb6] [^111u5wc1] [^112ZTzGU].

> Let me consider whether all cases require immediate systemic therapy. For very small, early, localized lesions, high-potency topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors can be reasonable first-line therapy, and some patients heal with topical regimens alone; however, if there is rapid progression, pain, or any sign of spreading inflammation, escalation to systemic therapy without delay is prudent, as supported by wound care algorithms and case series showing that early systemic control reduces time to healing and recurrence risk [^112uWtET] [^116AL4Ge] [^113Z4x5t].

> I should double-check safety caveats so I don't overstate immediacy without context. Systemic immunosuppression carries infection risk, so before starting steroids or other agents, it is reasonable to screen for latent infections and address modifiable risks; in addition, I must reiterate to avoid sharp debridement during active inflammation unless absolutely necessary, and to coordinate procedures with immunosuppressive coverage if they cannot be postponed until quiescence [^1144Cnse] [^111pLiBb].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise. Yes, pyoderma gangrenosum generally requires immediate treatment when the diagnosis is established or strongly suspected, because the disease is rapidly progressive, painful, and associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality; delays lead to larger ulcers, pathergy from inappropriate surgery, and prolonged immunosuppression with adverse effects, whereas early systemic immunosuppression — most commonly corticosteroids, cyclosporine, or biologics in selected contexts — can halt progression and improve healing trajectories, even though complete closure often takes weeks to months and recurrence is common, necessitating individualized, multidisciplinary care and vigilant wound management [^113Auyvc] [^1128sGrL] [^116oUjJs] [^117A9s2B] [^113Z4x5t].

---

Immediate treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is **essential** to prevent rapid progression, tissue destruction, and serious complications [^113Auyvc]. Delays increase the risk of **infection, sepsis, and permanent scarring** [^1128sGrL], and can worsen underlying systemic disease [^notfound]. Early systemic immunosuppression — typically with corticosteroids or cyclosporine — is first-line [^116xkncu] and should be started promptly once PG is suspected, even before biopsy results, to halt disease activity [^114bwMES]. Local wound care and pain control are critical, but **immunosuppression is the cornerstone** of therapy [^111D4Mdp].

---

## Clinical course and progression

PG is characterized by **rapidly progressive, painful ulcers** with undermined, violaceous borders and a predilection for the lower extremities [^1151FDr9] [^114qxMVd]. Without treatment, ulcers enlarge quickly, often within days, and can involve deeper tissues, including muscle and bone [^notfound]. The disease course is unpredictable, with frequent relapses and exacerbations, especially after minor trauma (pathergy) [^111X4U4H] [^1151FDr9] [^112wArhb].

---

## Risks of delayed treatment

Delaying treatment for PG can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Infection and sepsis**: Open ulcers are prone to secondary bacterial infections, which can progress to sepsis, a life-threatening condition [^111pLiBb].

- **Permanent tissue damage and scarring**: Rapid progression can cause extensive tissue destruction, leading to permanent disfigurement and functional impairment [^1149uBXV].

- **Exacerbation of underlying systemic diseases**: PG is often associated with systemic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, and hematologic malignancies. Delayed treatment can worsen these underlying conditions, leading to significant morbidity and mortality [^1128sGrL].

- **Psychological impact**: Chronic, painful ulcers can cause significant psychological distress, anxiety, and depression, adversely affecting quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Evidence supporting immediate treatment

Several studies and clinical guidelines emphasize the **importance of immediate treatment**:

- **STOP GAP trial**: This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that early systemic treatment with corticosteroids or cyclosporine significantly improves healing rates and reduces disease progression [^notfound].

- **Clinical guidelines**: The Japanese clinical practice guidance for PG recommends prompt initiation of systemic immunosuppressive therapy to control inflammation and prevent complications [^notfound].

- **Case reports**: Numerous case reports highlight the rapid deterioration of PG lesions and the dramatic improvement observed with early immunosuppressive therapy [^114bwMES].

---

## Recommended immediate treatment strategies

Immediate treatment of PG involves a **multimodal approach**, including:

- **Systemic immunosuppressive therapy**: Corticosteroids (prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day) or cyclosporine (3–5 mg/kg/day) are first-line treatments [^notfound]. These agents rapidly suppress inflammation and halt disease progression [^111JpwEx].

- **Biologic therapies**: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab) are effective, particularly in patients with underlying IBD or refractory cases [^1123qKFT].

- **Local wound care**: Gentle cleansing, moisture-retentive dressings, and avoidance of trauma or surgical debridement are essential to prevent pathergy and promote healing [^111D4Mdp].

- **Pain management**: Adequate analgesia is crucial to improve patient comfort and quality of life [^112Kddxd].

---

## Consequences of delayed treatment

Delayed treatment of PG can result in **significant morbidity and mortality**. Patients may experience prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare costs, and a higher risk of complications such as infection, sepsis, and permanent disability. Moreover, delayed treatment can exacerbate underlying systemic diseases, leading to poor overall prognosis [^112cg9Fp].

---

Immediate treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum is **critical** to prevent rapid progression, tissue destruction, and serious complications. Early systemic immunosuppressive therapy, combined with appropriate wound care and pain management, significantly improves outcomes and reduces morbidity and mortality. Delays in treatment can lead to severe complications, including infection, permanent scarring, and exacerbation of underlying systemic diseases. Therefore, **prompt recognition and initiation of therapy are essential** in managing PG effectively [^112UiHo7].

### Management of pyoderma gangrenosum [^116fvwWF]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The management of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) requires a structured approach to establishing diagnosis of the disease and assessment of the patient. Clinical management of active PG lesions should be carried out in coordination with other specialists (such as nurses and pain managers) and often necessitates a flexible, innovate attitude to therapy, because the needs of individual patients may vary widely. Although there is no single successful treatment for this disease, certain types of PG lesions are recognized to respond more readily to accepted therapies than others. We outline guidelines to the management of the patient with PG and discuss alternative therapies.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^117Ti8oJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory neutrophilic disorder with prototypical clinical presentations. Its pathophysiology is complex and not fully explained. Recent information regarding the genetic basis of PG and the role of auto-inflammation provides a better understanding of the disease and new therapeutic targets. PG equally affects patients of both sexes and of any age. Uncontrolled cutaneous neutrophilic inflammation is the cornerstone in a genetically predisposed individual. Multimodality management is often required to reduce inflammation, optimize wound healing, and treat underlying disease. A gold standard for the management of PG does not exist and high-level evidence is limited. Multiple factors must be taken into account when deciding on the optimum treatment for individual patients: location, number and size of lesion/ulceration(s), extracutaneous involvement, presence of associated disease, cost, and side effects of treatment, as well as patient comorbidities and preferences. Refractory and rapidly progressive cases require early initiation of systemic therapy. Newer targeted therapies represent a promising pathway for the management of PG, and the main focus of this review is the management and evidence supporting the role of new targeted therapies in PG.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare and often painful skin disease that can be unpredictable in its response to treatment. There is currently no gold standard of treatment or published algorithm for choice of therapy. The majority of data comes from case studies that lack a standard protocol not only for treatment administration but also for the objective assessment of lesion response to a specific therapy. This review provides an update to the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with a particular focus on new systemic therapies.

### Management strategies for pyoderma gangrenosum: case studies and review of literature [^112UiHo7]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a systemic disease with cutaneous manifestations consisting of necrotizing ulceration. The etiology of PG is controversial, and optimal management strategies have not been established. Current management is primarily medical to control the systemic inflammatory process, with occasional surgical intervention at the ulcer site. Based on the current literature and on the authors' clinical experience, the optimal outcome depends on early diagnoses and a combination of medical and surgical therapy. Initial management is directed toward medical control of the inflammatory process and local wound care. Surgical strategies involve recipient site preparation via local wound care and serial allograft followed by autologous skin graft or muscle flap coverage when necessary. Long-term wound stabilization is obtained only through control of the systemic and local inflammatory process.

Significance: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic ulcerative dermatosis that poses a high burden of morbidity due to underdiagnosis, resistance to therapy, and limited therapeutic options. Optimization of wound care strategies and multimodal anti-inflammatory approaches are necessary to mitigate multiple converging pathways of inflammation leading to delayed healing, which is further complicated by additional factors such as pathergy. Recent Advances: PG treatment typically involves reducing inflammation, controlling pain, promoting wound healing, and treating the underlying etiology. Recent advances have been made with regard to targeted therapies for PG with topical, intralesional, and systemic medications. Wound management includes gentle cleansing without sharp debridement, limited topical antibacterial use, and maintenance of a moist environment to promote epithelial migration. Critical Issues: Wound dressings and compression therapy, in particular, introduce a wide variety of therapeutic options. Dressings should aim to target the specific PG wound type, depending on the depth and exudative nature of the wound, as well as local secondary factors. Superficial wounds, eschar, exudative wounds, granulating wounds, and colonized wounds are managed with variable approaches to the same underlying principles of pathergy avoidance, moisture balance, and reduction of immunogenic inflammatory stimuli. The importance of compression therapy to decrease edema and overgranulation fits within this treatment paradigm. Future Directions: As each of these treatment modalities offers a complex mixture of advantages and limitations, development of a systematic treatment algorithm in the future can help direct a more tailored path toward wound healing.

### Pathophysiology of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG): an updated review [^117X3E3x]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a challenging skin condition to identify and treat because of its multifactorial pathogenesis. It is a rare cutaneous manifestation diagnosed clinically by exclusion of infection, neoplasia, thrombophilia, and other inflammatory conditions. Pathogenetic and treatment studies are scarce. Abnormalities in the function of inflammatory cytokines, the immune system, and neutrophils combined with specific genetic mutations predispose patients to develop this complex disease process. Early recognition of patients at risk for pyoderma gangrenosum, the necessity to improve its early diagnosis, and the future outlook of targeted and personalized therapies relies on the improved comprehension of the complex pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Etiology and management of pyoderma gangrenosum: a comprehensive review [^114qxMVd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by painful, necrotic ulceration. It typically affects patients in the third to sixth decades of life, with almost equal incidence in men and women. PG occurs most frequently on the lower extremities. Five clinical variants are currently recognized: classic, bullous, pustular, vegetative, and peristomal types. Half of PG cases are seen in association with systemic disease. Mimickers include infection, vascular insufficiency ulcers, systemic vasculitides, autoimmune disease, cancer, and exogenous tissue injury, among others. PG is often a diagnosis of exclusion, as there are no specific laboratory or histopathologic findings to confirm the diagnosis. PG thus presents many clinical challenges: it is difficult to diagnose, is frequently misdiagnosed, and often requires a work-up for underlying systemic disease. Successful management of PG typically requires multiple modalities to reduce inflammation and optimize wound healing, in addition to treatment of any underlying diseases. Prednisone and cyclosporine have been mainstays of systemic treatment for PG, although increasing evidence supports the use of biologic therapies, such as tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, for refractory cases of PG. Here, we review the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of PG, as well as its associated conditions, diagnostic work-up, and management.

### What do autoinflammatory syndromes teach about common cutaneous diseases such as pyoderma gangrenosum? A commentary [^111aMsrr]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by ulcerating skin lesions with rapid onset and recalcitrant treatment course. PG treatment targets an array of inflammatory pathways with variable success. One of the hallmark features of PG is its association with a broad spectrum of systemic disorders. The authors hypothesize that there are common inflammatory pathways linking these systemic disorders to neutrophilic dermatoses. Rare autoinflammatory diseases offer insights into the understanding of inflammatory skin conditions. This article explores observations of the natural history of PG that illuminate aspects of PG pathogenesis, highlighting the role of autoinflammatory mediators.

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^113XDmu6]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

This trial is four times larger than the only other randomised controlled trial conducted in pyoderma gangrenosum, and it required national collaboration through the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network. Patient recruitment from 39 UK hospitals ensured representative sampling; the protocol reflected normal clinical practice, with dosing adjusted according to clinical need; and outcomes included clinician assessed, patient assessed, and independent assessment of digital images.

Every effort was made to capture the primary outcome in a blinded fashion, and all secondary analyses were supportive of this main analysis, although power to explore the impact on quality of life was limited owing to missing data from postal questionnaires.

Given the lack of a placebo or no treatment third arm in this study, it is possible that neither drug is effective in treating pyoderma gangrenosum. However, it was considered unethical to leave patients with a serious, potentially fatal disease, without treatment.

The obtained sample size was slightly smaller than had been planned, but the narrow confidence intervals for between group comparisons suggest that we did not miss clinically important differences. The trial was stopped after achieving 86% of target recruitment owing to time and financial limitations. This decision was made before the database was locked and data analysed.

Conclusion

Patients who require systemic treatment are likely to respond similarly to prednisolone or ciclosporin in the short term, but neither treatment is especially effective when healing at six months is considered. Differences in side effect profiles should be taken into account when choosing treatments. Table 8provides an outline of key comorbidities that clinicians may wish to consider when choosing between prednisolone and ciclosporin for individual patients.

Authors' suggestions on when to consider prednisolone versus ciclosporin for patients with pyoderma gangrenosum based on pre-existing comorbidities

These results provide robust evidence to inform shared treatment decision making between clinicians and patients, including information on duration of treatment, response rates, adverse effect profiles, and likelihood of recurrence. However, our results suggest that better treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum are urgently needed.

### The 5 P's of pyoderma gangrenosum [^112wArhb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is often difficult to establish based on a clinical presentation, which can mimic other dermatologic conditions. The formation of a mnemonic that incorporates the most prevalent clinical features of PG could aid in accuracy and speed of diagnosis. The 5 P's of PG: Painful, Progressive, Purple, Pretibial, Pathergy, and systemic associations, incorporate parameters recognizable on the first encounter with a patient with PG without reliance on histopathology and laboratory findings or treatment response. We postulate that this simple mnemonic will have the most utility with non-dermatology clinicians encountering a lesion suspicious for PG. By assisting in differential diagnosis formation, this mnemonic may lead to timelier biopsies and treatment initiation. The limitations of this approach mirror those of other studies and include lower sensitivities in patients with an atypical PG presentation. In conclusion, the 5 P's of PG offer a useful mnemonic for the diagnosis of PG, particularly in the initial clinical diagnosis prior to skin biopsy and treatment.

### Therapy insight: pyoderma gangrenosum-old disease, new management [^1129SYxM]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Well-designed studies that help guide physicians to apply the optimal therapeutic strategy for the management of pyoderma gangrenosum are lacking in the literature. A multidisciplinary approach is paramount for the effective management of this condition, with close involvement of a wound-care specialist and a microbiologist. Treatment should be stepwise in nature. Local wound care, avoidance of trauma and the application of local steroid or tacrolimus ointment are the first-line treatments. Steroid therapy is the most widely published effective therapy for achieving resolution of pyoderma gangrenosum, although there is growing evidence for the efficacy of infliximab in refractory cases. Other therapies such as dapsone and clofazamine should be left as third-line agents for refractory pyoderma gangrenosum, while novel treatments such as granulocyte apheresis should only be used under trial conditions, to gain an objective evaluation of their efficacy. This article reviews the published treatment strategies in current use, and aims to guide the effective management of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: an updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^1151FDr9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare inflammatory skin disease classified within the group of neutrophilic dermatoses and clinically characterized by painful, rapidly evolving cutaneous ulcers with undermined, irregular, erythematous-violaceous edges. Pyoderma gangrenosum pathogenesis is complex and involves a profound dysregulation of components of both innate and adaptive immunity in genetically predisposed individuals, with the follicular unit increasingly recognized as the putative initial target. T helper 17/T helper 1-skewed inflammation and exaggerated inflammasome activation lead to a dysregulated neutrophil-dominant milieu with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1α, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-36. Low-evidence studies and a lack of validated diagnostic and response criteria have hindered the discovery and validation of new effective treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum. We review established and emerging treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum. A therapeutic algorithm based on available evidence is also provided. For emerging treatments, we review target molecules and their role in the pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum.

Secondary outcomes

Time to healing — defined as the time at which sterile dressings were no longer required (reported by patients and confirmed by clinicians at subsequent clinic visits). We identified this outcome as the most important of the secondary outcomes.

Pyoderma gangrenosum specific global treatment response — to assess treatment response we used a seven point Likert scale ranging from completely clear through to worse (assessed by clinicians and participants and from digital images for blinded assessment).

Resolution of inflammation — this was recorded by clinicians and participants using a scale reported by Foss.

Self reported pain — participants self reported the severity of pain daily using a score from 0 to 4 (none, mild, moderate, severe, or extreme).

Health related quality of life — assessed using the dermatology life quality indexand European quality of life-5 dimensions, three levels (EQ-5D-3L and EQ VAS).

Time to recurrence — defined as the interval between the target lesion healing and a further episode of pyoderma gangrenosum (at any site). The period of follow-up available varied depending on the time at which participants were randomised into the trial.

Number of treatment failures — defined as those who withdrew from their randomised treatment because of treatment intolerance, whose pyoderma gangrenosum worsened, or whose target lesion remained unhealed after six months of follow-up.

Adverse reactions to study drugs — adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug.

Sample size

This was a superiority trial, with prednisolone as the control intervention. To provide 80% power (5% level of significance) to detect a difference in means of 0.5 standard deviations in the primary outcome of speed of healing over six weeks, the target sample size was 140 participants, assuming a loss to follow-up of 10%. We chose a difference of 0.5 standard deviations as being a clinically meaningful between group difference, as observational data suggested that ciclosporin was potentially more effective, but at higher cost, than prednisolone. As a result, we felt that a substantial treatment effect was necessary to justify a change in clinical practice.

### Optimal treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum [^117AhtBd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum includes a combination of local wound care and systemic medications. Oral and pulse intravenous corticosteroids have traditionally been the most commonly recommended first-line systemic therapies. Cyclosporine, with or without corticosteroids, has more recently emerged as a first-line systemic treatment. A multitude of immunosuppressive and immune-modulating medications, as well as antimicrobial agents with anti-inflammatory properties have also been widely prescribed. Often, it is difficult to achieve control of aggressive cases of pyoderma gangrenosum, necessitating administration of a combination of systemic therapies. Furthermore, patients recalcitrant to one or many medications are frequently reported. Concomitant disease, intolerance to a class of medications, and the patient's response to prior therapies can help guide a practitioner in choosing the optimal treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum [^113Auyvc]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that presents with rapidly developing, painful skin ulcers hallmarked by undermined borders and peripheral erythema. Epidemiological studies indicate that the average age of PG onset is in the mid-40s, with an incidence of a few cases per million person-years. PG is often associated with a variety of other immune-mediated diseases, most commonly inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The cause of PG is not well understood, but PG is generally considered an autoinflammatory disorder. Studies have focused on the role of T cells, especially at the wound margin; these cells may support the destructive autoinflammatory response by the innate immune system. PG is difficult to diagnose as several differential diagnoses are possible; in addition to clinical examination, laboratory tests of biopsied wound tissue are required for an accurate diagnosis, and new validated diagnostic criteria will facilitate the process. Treatment of PG typically starts with fast-acting immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids and/or cyclosporine) to reduce inflammation followed by the addition of more slowly acting immunosuppressive drugs with superior adverse event profiles, including biologics (in particular, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents). Appropriate wound care is also essential. Future research should focus on PG-specific outcome measures and PG quality-of-life studies.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum – a systemic disease? [^113r11Z2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an orphan disease. It belongs to the group of neutrophilic dermatoses. Four major subtypes and several rare manifestations illustrate the great variety of clinical presentations and clinical course. PG is potentially life threatening and associated with a number of internal diseases including chronic inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic disorders, and malignancies. PG itself shows extracutaneous manifestations. These findings are in favor of PG as a systemic disease.

### PG-TIME: a practical approach to the clinical management of pyoderma gangrenosum [^116AL4Ge]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis which may be rapidly progressive. Standard guidelines for local treatment are lacking. Through our experience, we suggested a local treatment algorithm based on the tissue, infection, moisture balance, and epithelization (TIME) concept. The clinical and histopathological features of 52 patients with PG, the duration, and the evolution of the lesions were retrospectively evaluated. Systemic therapies, local treatments, and standard wound treatments were reported. We observed ulcerative PG in the majority of the patients (82.6%), followed by the pustular form (9.6%), the peristomal type (3.8%), the vegetative form (1.9%), and the bullous type (1.9%). The lower leg was the most commonly area affected (90.4% of cases). Pathergy was reported in 15.3% of cases. The first-line treatment was the use of oral glucocorticosteroids (GCSs). We observed healing after 3weeks of GCS in 17.3% of cases. In 25% of all cases, we obtained complete healing with long-term low doses (< 0.5mg/kg) of GCS in the range of 2 to 6 months. We used second-line treatments in 57.6% of patients. Local, systemic treatment, and correct wound management can be associated with better clinical results. We suggest a new local therapeutic algorithm in both the inflammatory and noninflammatory healing phases.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Pyoderma gangrenosum

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a relatively rare inflammatory skin disease, classified under the umbrella of neutrophilic hypodermal dermatoses. Clinically, it manifests as painful, rapidly progressing skin ulcers distinguished by their undermined, irregular borders, and peripheral erythema. Globally, the estimated incidence of PG is between 3 and 10 cases per million individuals annually.PG indicates an autoinflammatory disorder, frequently correlating with other immune‐mediated systemic diseases. The most common among these are inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematological malignancies. Moreover, PG can also be a feature of autoinflammatory syndromes such as pyogenic arthritis, PG, and acne (PAPA), PG, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa (PASH), and pyogenic arthritis, PG, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa (PAPASH).

The pathogenesis of PG is multifaceted, stemming from significant dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immunity in genetically susceptible individuals. An emerging understanding points to the follicular unitand, in cases involving the palms or soles, likely the sweat gland unit, as primary sites of initial impact. Such triggers precipitate a shift towards type 1/type 3‐biased inflammationand heightened inflammasome activation in those predisposed. This cascade culminates in a dysregulated environment dominated by neutrophils, marked by elevated concentrations of tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin (IL)‐1α, IL‐1β, IL‐8, IL‐12, IL‐15, IL‐17, IL‐23, and IL‐36.,

Given the multifaceted array of cytokines involved, targeting a single cytokine with antibody therapy may not always yield optimal results. In instances of resistance to biological treatments, systemic suppression of the overexpressed cytokines might prove beneficial. An effective therapeutic approach generally starts with rapid‐acting immunosuppressants, such as corticosteroids and cyclosporine, to curb inflammation. This can be followed by the introduction of slower‐acting immunosuppressants that have more favorable safety profiles including biologics. While ulcerative lesions tend to require an extended period for epithelization, it is advisable to periodically evaluate the efficacy of treatments, with intervals reaching up to a month. Once immune suppression has been successfully achieved, surgical interventions, including vacuum‐assisted closure and skin grafting, emerge as effective solutions, particularly for extensive skin ulcers.

### Diagnosis and management of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum: a systematic review [^112ZTzGU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum (PPG) is an uncommon subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum. PPG is a challenging condition to diagnose and treat; no evidence-based guidelines exist.

Objective

We sought to identify important clinical features of PPG and effective treatments available for its management.

Methods

A systematic literature review of PPG was performed using PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases.

Results

We describe 335 patients with PPG from 79 studies. Clinical features include a painful, rapidly progressing ulcer with undermined, violaceous borders with a history of ostomy leakage and local skin irritation or trauma. Systemic steroids are first-line therapy; infliximab and adalimumab provide concomitant control of active inflammatory bowel disease. Combination local and systemic therapy was commonly used. Wound dressings, vehicle selection, and appropriate ostomy devices to minimize leakage, irritation, and pressure-induced ischemia can improve healing. Distinct from classic ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum, surgical approaches, such as stoma closure and resection of active inflammatory bowel disease, have an effective role in PPG management.

Limitations

PPG is a rare disease lacking randomized trials or diagnostic guidelines. Treatment duration and follow-up time among studies are variable.

Conclusions

Key clinical characteristics of PPG are highlighted. Several treatments, including a more prominent role for surgical intervention, may be effective for PPG treatment.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: a great marauder [^1135uK2D]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a progressively necrotizing and ulcerative skin disease that mimics a severe bacterial infection. However, the cause is not infectious in nature and the lesions are refractory to local wound care and antibiotic therapy. The etiology of pyoderma remains unknown, although pathogenic mechanisms may involve immunologically mediated cutaneous damage. The authors report a 67-year-old woman in whom a necrotic ulcer developed at a chest tube site. Treated with local wound care and antibiotics, this lesion spread progressively to involve 15% of her body surface area. A septic clinical picture developed despite sterile cultures, and she required several operative debridements. Her disease continued to spread and finally a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum was considered. Treated with systemic steroids, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), and local wound care, she eventually underwent skin grafts.

### Insights into the pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum [^112cPpUq]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis of unclear etiology. Numerous theories of its underlying pathogenesis have been proposed, including external triggers, neutrophilic dysfunction, complement activation, and autoimmunity, as well as a possible component of underlying genetic susceptibility. This review seeks to synthesize current understanding of the pathogenesis of PG and integrate interactions between the multitude of implicated host immune pathways to guide and inform future directions into the treatment of PG.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: an updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^113Z4x5t]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Wound Care (Level of Evidence 3A)

Wound care is crucial for the appropriate management of PG cases. Pyoderma gangrenosum ulcers evolve through inflammatory and healing phases, requiring a differentiated approach depending on depth and exudation. Recently, an algorithm based on the Tissue, Infection or inflammation, Moisture and Edge (TIME) model has been adapted for PG. Adequate control of wound bed and perilesional inflammation with topical CS or topical calcineurin inhibitors, as well as lidocaine for pain management, is key during the inflammatory phase. In this setting, to avoid pathergy only gentle cleansing without sharp debridement should be performed. Similarly, enzymatic (collagenases) or autolytic debridement (hydrogel) can aid reducing fibrin and necrotic tissues, and may be followed be the application of either absorbent (alginate, hydrofiber) or nonadherent (silicone, foam) dressings to control the exudate. Alginates are best employed for bleeding PG ulcers because of their hemostatic properties, while polyurethane foam with a silicon layer could be useful on inflamed PG lesions. Antimicrobial dressings to decrease microbial burden and compressive bandages to reduce the exudate, edema, and overgranulation of PG ulcers may also have a role during the inflammatory phase. Indeed, according to a systematic review of the literature, antimicrobial and hyperabsorbent dressings appear to be the most commonly used dressings for the management of PG ulcers, requiring less frequent changes and manipulation. Bioactive dressings such as collagen sheets, dermal and/or epidermal substitutes, and grafts may be considered if the wound bed is not excessively inflamed or devitalized.

### Ciclosporin compared with prednisolone therapy for patients with pyoderma gangrenosum: cost-effectiveness analysis of the STOP GAP trial [^116adPmp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, inflammatory skin disease characterized by progressive and painful necrotizing ulcers. Typically, PG presents as a tender erythematous nodule or pustule, quickly progressing to a large, demarcated ulcer with purplish, undermined edges. 1 PG is associated with underlying systemic disease, and in particular with inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis and haematological malignancies. 2 Additionally it may develop following incidental or iatrogenic trauma. 3, 4, 5 Compared with mortality in the general population, PG is associated with a three fold increased risk of death; 6 its ulcers are characterized by debilitating pain and may require narcotic analgesia. 1, 2, 7

PG is diagnosed clinically after excluding other diagnoses because there are no adequate diagnostic tests and histological findings are relatively nonspecific. No national or international guidelines address PG management, which currently includes a range of poorly evidenced topical and systemic treatment options including antibiotics, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors and immunosupressants. 8, 9 Only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) of treatments has previously been reported in patients with PG: a study of 30 patients compared infliximab against placebo and showed benefit for infliximab at 2 weeks. However, infliximab is not a first‐line treatment for this condition. 10

### Treatment recommendations for pyoderma gangrenosum: an evidence-based review of the literature based on more than 350 patients [^116xkncu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Because the incidence of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is low, no prospective randomized controlled trials and only a few studies with case numbers of more than 15 patients have been published. To date no guidelines for treatment of PG have been established far. The aim of the study was to provide an evidence-based review of the literature and an evaluation of recommendations for PG treatment. We performed an electronic search using the PubMed database and the term "pyoderma-gangrenosum". Literature published in the English language during the past two decades was reviewed. All relevant studies that could be obtained regardless of the study design were evaluated for grades of recommendation and levels of evidence. Data on patient characteristics including severity of the disease, localization of lesions, associated diseases, and treatment procedures were abstracted and evaluated for therapeutic outcome. We conclude that therapeutic efficacy of systemic treatment with corticosteroids and cyclosporine is best documented in the literature for disseminated as well as for localized disease and should be considered first-line therapy. In cases that do not respond to this treatment, we recommend alternative therapeutic procedures (eg, systemic treatment with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil; mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine; tacrolimus; infliximab; or plasmapheresis), considering additional factors including associated diseases.

### Perioperative management of pyoderma gangrenosum [^1144Cnse]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) classically presents with an acute inflammatory stage, characterized by rapid evolution of painful ulcerations. The pathergy associated with PG lesions complicates disease management. Although PG is commonly treated with immunosuppression, some patients have refractory noninflammatory ulcers. In this subpopulation, there are case reports of successful surgical treatment. However, there is no consensus on optimal perioperative treatment for patients with PG undergoing surgery of any kind, PG related or otherwise. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review describing perioperative management practices and risk factors that may predict response to surgical intervention. We identified 126 cases of surgical intervention in patients with active PG; among these, only 16.7% experienced postoperative disease progression. No perioperative treatments or clinical risk factors were identified as statistically significant predictors of disease recurrence. Although limited by case series design and publication bias, this study is a valuable means of hypothesis generation for this rare condition.

### Skin ulcers misdiagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum [^113ZkKzs]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a diagnosis of exclusion, and the misdiagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum can result in substantial complications in patients who have other causes of severe cutaneous ulceration.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of 240 patients with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum who were evaluated at our institution from 1975 through 2000, including 157 consecutive patients treated for presumed pyoderma gangrenosum from 1984 through 1992. We also reviewed the English-language literature.

Results

Ninety-five patients (49 from our institution and 46 described in the literature) had skin ulcers with a clinical resemblance to pyoderma gangrenosum. The final diagnoses were vascular occlusive or venous disease, vasculitis, cancer, primary infection, drug-induced or exogenous tissue injury, and other inflammatory disorders. Of the 95 patients studied, 64 had been treated for pyoderma gangrenosum for a median of 10 months (range, 3 to 180). These 64 included 15 of the 157 consecutive patients treated for pyoderma gangrenosum at our institution (10 percent). Of the ulcers in the 64 patients treated for pyoderma gangrenosum, it was clear that those in 23 patients (36 percent) did not respond to treatment directed at pyoderma gangrenosum, those in 8 (12 percent) were exacerbated by such treatment, and those in 15 (23 percent) improved with such treatment.

Conclusions

The misdiagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is not uncommon and exposes patients to risks associated with its treatment. A thorough evaluation is required in all patients suspected of having pyoderma gangrenosum in order to rule out alternative diagnoses.

### Eligibility criteria for active ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum in clinical trials: a Delphi consensus on behalf of the UPGRADE (understanding pyoderma gangrenosum: review and assessment of disease effects) group [^1156z9yb]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

At present, there are no standardized guidelines for determining patient eligibility for pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) clinical trials. Thus, we aim to determine which clinical features, histopathological features, or laboratory features should be included in active ulcerative PG clinical trial eligibility criteria for treatment-naïve patients and patients already treated with immunomodulating medications (treatment-exposed patients). This study employed 4 rounds of the Delphi technique. Electronic surveys were administered to 21 international board-certified dermatologists and plastic surgeon PG experts (June 2022-December 2022). Our results demonstrated that for a patient to be eligible for a PG trial, they must meet the following criteria: (i) presence of ulcer(s) with erythematous/violaceous undermining wound borders, (ii) presence of a painful or tender ulcer, (iii) history/presence of rapidly progressing disease, (iv) exclusion of infection and other causes of cutaneous ulceration, (v) biopsy for H&E staining, and (vi) a presence/history of pathergy. These criteria vary in importance for treatment-naïve versus treatment-exposed patients. Given the international cohort, we were unable to facilitate live discussions between rounds. This Delphi consensus study provides a set of specific, standardized eligibility criteria for PG clinical trials, thus addressing one of the main issues hampering progress toward Food and Drug Administration approval of medications for PG.

### Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum [^117Hu5PM]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that results in painful cutaneous ulcers and is frequently associated with underlying hematologic disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, or other autoimmune disorders. Pathogenesis involves an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators, leading to tissue damage from neutrophils. First-line treatment options with the greatest evidence include systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors. Other steroid-sparing therapies such as dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immunoglobulin, and targeted biologic or small molecule inhibitors also have evidence supporting their use. Wound care and management of underlying associated disorders are critical parts of the treatment regimen.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: an update [^113J2MKX]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) can be differentiated into classic and atypical forms. The classic form is characterized by ulcers and the atypical form by deep erosions with bullous blue-gray margins. Pathergy, the development of cutaneous lesions at sites of trauma, is a common feature of both forms of PG. Approximately 50% of patients who have PG have underlying systemic diseases, most commonly inflammatory bowel disease, myeloproliferative disorders, and various forms of inflammatory arthritis. The diagnosis of PG is one of exclusion. The management of this disorder begins with treatment of any underlying disease and local or systemic glucocorticoids or immunomodulating therapies.

### Progression of pyoderma gangrenosum with angioinvasive fungus [^1134zY7L]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of anakinra for PG has been reported but remains rare in the literature. This treatment had promising results in our patient with a severely recalcitrant ulcer with a duration of more than a year. However, this case involved an important complication in the management of PG requiring immunosuppression. Our patient was being treated with 2 immunosuppressants, cyclosporine and anakinra, and was therefore less able to mount an immune response. We were in the process of bridging the patient to anakinra, and her complication occurred at an especially vulnerable point in her care. Because she had had numerous flares previously, we were reluctant to transition rapidly to monomodal anakinra and planned to taper her cyclosporine over time. Repeat biopsy of her worsening plaque revealed AIF and required an immediate change in her treatment. This finding highlights the need to consider broadly any sudden change in clinical course in a patient whose condition is improving. Patients with complicated PG are commonly iatrogenically immunosuppressed and have a break in the skin barrier, which makes them particularly susceptible to infections. Because of the exuberant inflammatory dysregulation, potent immunosuppressants, often in combination as described in our case, are necessary to attenuate the severely abnormal immune response. Therefore, patients with PG who are treated with anakinra (especially those on multimodal immunosuppression) require special attention, frequent surveillance, and a low threshold for biopsy if they have unexplained worsening of their disease.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum after reduction mammaplasty in an otherwise healthy patient [^112ZHKYr]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare postoperative complication of plastic surgery of the breast. Initial signs and symptoms resemble those of infection, and antimicrobial therapy is usually initiated and fails before considering PG as a diagnosis. Therapy consists of immune modulators, and use of corticosteroids is frequent, as is local wound care. Sufficiently small wounds are allowed to heal secondarily, but larger wounds require coverage with either skin grafts or flaps. Long-term (1 year or more) postoperative surveillance is necessary because late failure of the graft or flap can occur.

### Clinical features of pyoderma gangrenosum and current diagnostic trends [^1111SDeV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) can be exceedingly difficult, and misdiagnosis can potentially yield serious consequences. Clinical criteria for establishing a reliable diagnosis have been previously proposed, but a consensus in their application has yet to be reached.

Objective

We sought to review recent trends in diagnosing PG and compare them with previously suggested diagnostic criteria.

Methods

Data for this article were obtained by searching the PubMed database using the key words "pyoderma gangrenosum". Our search was limited to adult case reports that appeared in the English-language literature and received a final diagnosis of PG. The full text of the latest published 30 case reports that fulfilled these search criteria was reviewed. The articles spanned the years 2008 and 2009. Clinical features that appeared in the case descriptions were summarized and compared with the diagnostic criteria for the disease that were previously proposed.

Results

Of the 30 case reports, 16 described ulcers involving one or both legs, whereas only one case had peristomal involvement. Although 8 cases were associated with inflammatory bowel disease, 11 of the 30 patients did not have a systemic comorbidity. Fifteen lesions were noted to manifest at sites of trauma, which ranged from surgical incision sites to prolonged seatbelt compression. Nine case reports mentioned an undermined border in their clinical description, whereas only 5 authors commented on pustules and 6 described a purulent discharge. Only two authors commented on cribriform scarring.

Limitations

We only reviewed the latest published 30 case reports. Case series, which may have shown more typical cases, were excluded.

Conclusion

Currently, there is an underemphasis of clinical features in the diagnosis of PG, which can potentially lead to overdiagnosis. Establishing firm clinical criteria for diagnosing PG will ensure that case reports describe the same disease. This has implications in optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: an updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^114Rm4PV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and Future Directions

The treatment of PG can be challenging. In addition to medical therapy, wound care, with appropriate dressings depending on inflammatory vs non-inflammatory phase, and pain control are crucial in the management of PG cases. Based on current knowledge and a previously published severity classification, the authors are proposing an algorithm (Fig. 1), which could be useful in the management of patients with classic ulcerative PG. There is insufficient evidence to clearly define the preferred therapeutic management for each PG variant. However, based on our experience as well as the literature, few considerations may be presented. Management of peristomal and postoperative PG is usually similar to that of unilesional/localized PG. For peristomal PG particularly, management is generally that of the underlying condition, for example, IBD. For bullous and vegetative PG, the therapeutic ladder is substantially the same as in classic ulcerative PG, although wound care approaches may need to be adapted to these settings, favoring hyperabsorbing and nonadherent dressings.

In addition to the well-known diagnostic challenges in PG, its clinical heterogeneity as well as a lack of validated severity and response criteria has complicated the planning of clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of therapeutic agents. Recently, the UPGRADE (Understanding Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Review of Adverse Disease Effects) initiative has developed a platform for clinicians, researchers, industry, and patients to collaborate in the creation of a core outcome set for PG that could be used for future clinical trials. Research for PG and other neutrophilic dermatoses seems to be promising as more specific and targeted therapies are currently being developed.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: a review for the gastroenterologist [^111X4U4H]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare ulcerative skin disease of unknown etiology often associated with systemic inflammatory conditions, most commonly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The most common presentation of PG is spontaneous rapid formation of an extremely painful ulcer on the extremities, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Rarely, PG can also occur as a chronic peristomal complication or as an acute postoperative complication of a surgical wound. The clinical course is unpredictable; it may not correlate with IBD activity and may even precede a diagnosis of IBD. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment is challenging, often involving a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. This review aims to provide an update for the gastroenterologist on the pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and management of PG, a rare complication of IBD.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum following gynaecological surgery [^117A9s2B]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

When approaching a suspected case of PG, clinical guidelines recommend a thorough evaluation to exclude underlying autoimmune diseases or other systemic conditions. A biopsy of the affected tissue is essential for histopathological examination. Prompt initiation of systemic immunosuppressive therapy, often with corticosteroids, is the mainstay of treatment. Other immunomodulatory agents, such as cyclosporine or biologics, may be considered in refractory cases. It is crucial to avoid surgical procedures or trauma in PG, as they can exacerbate the condition. Due to the diverse clinical and histopathological features of PG, an individualised approach to treatment and close monitoring are essential for optimal management of this challenging dermatological disorder.

In conclusion, although PG is not commonly encountered in gynaecology, its prompt recognition, diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent poor outcomes. The rarity of PG in the gynaecological setting emphasises the importance of awareness and an expert multidisciplinary approach for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Understanding the histopathological findings, the role of neutrophils in tissue destruction and the potential for pathergy in the gynaecological postsurgical period aids in the comprehensive management of this challenging condition.

Learning points

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare complication of surgery that is characterised by painful, rapidly progressing skin ulcers. Its diagnosis can be challenging as it often mimics conditions such as necrotising fasciitis.
PG lesions demonstrate pathergy, a phenomenon where skin trauma triggers the development of new lesions at the site of injury. Therefore, surgical debridement is contraindicated in the management of PG.
Systemic immunosuppressive therapy, often with corticosteroids, is the mainstay of treatment when PG is identified. Optimising medical management and consulting with dermatology are critical to avoid misdiagnosis or delay in care.

### Inpatient management of pyoderma gangrenosum: treatments, outcomes, and clinical implications [^116RhXjM]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, ulcerative neutrophilic skin condition of unknown etiology. The disease continues to pose therapeutic challenges, with ongoing controversy regarding the role of surgery.

Methods

A retrospective medical records review was conducted for 29 patients who were diagnosed and treated for PG at an Australian tertiary center over 10 years, from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2010.

Results

A total of 29 patients had a diagnosis of PG, with a total of 35 admissions. Nearly all patients had immunosuppressant therapy and 10 (35%) patients underwent surgery. Eight (28%) received hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Complications secondary to medical therapy occurred in 23 (66%) of admissions, with the commonest being poor blood sugar control in patients with diabetes (n = 6, 17%) and steroid-induced diabetes (n = 5, 14%). At discharge, 21 (72%) patients' ulcers had improved and there were 4 (14%) inpatient deaths. At 6 months, 3 of 10 cases with available follow-up showed complete ulcer healing. Most of the patients (n = 8, 80%) who underwent combined medical and surgical therapy had ulcers that had either completely healed or improved at 6 months after discharge. All 3 patients who underwent split skin grafting under immunosuppressive cover (with 2 having hyperbaric oxygen therapy) had no postoperative graft failure or pathergy.

Conclusions

Pyoderma gangrenosum remains a therapeutic challenge, with significant complications and morbidity from long-term medical treatment. Surgery should be considered in conjunction with combined hyperbaric and immunosuppressive therapy once the disease is quiescent, to reduce disease-related comorbidity as well as the consequent adverse effects of long-term immunosuppressant therapy.

### New treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa: a review [^111DEmeJ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 CONCLUSION

This review evaluates both established and emerging immunotherapies for PG and HS, drawing primarily from clinical observations. Managing PG and HS remains a formidable challenge, with immunosuppressive treatments standing as the foundational therapeutic approach. A deeper comprehension of the molecular underpinnings of PG and HS promises to usher in innovative, targeted interventions.

Early diagnosis and intervention for PG and HS are crucial, not only to ensure effective treatment and enhance the patient's quality of life but also to counteract systemic inflammation, a phenomenon observed in conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. While direct evidence for such systemic effects remains elusive in the context of PG and HS, the activation of white blood cells and ensuing cutaneous inflammation could potentially herald complications in the cardiovascular system and other organs. Given these potential risks, it is imperative to recognize the value of timely deployment of potent treatments, such as biologics and small molecules, to mitigate inflammation.

### Challenge of diagnosing pyoderma gangrenosum after caesarean section [^112STfb6]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic skin disease that leads to extensive, painful, necrotic ulcerations, particularly at surgical sites. As obstetric cases with pyoderma gangrenosum are rare and, therefore, often misdiagnosed initially, it is important to raise awareness about this rare complication. Here, we describe a patient who presented with pyoderma gangrenosum at the surgical site 4days after undergoing a caesarean section. The erythema was initially misdiagnosed as wound infection, and the patient, who was experiencing pain, underwent antibiotic treatment and surgical wound debridement. When the wound was unresponsive to these treatments, a dermatologist was consulted who suspected pyoderma gangrenosum and began a high-dose corticosteroids therapy, which led to a fulminant improvement of the local wound. In conclusion, the rare diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a suspected surgical wound infection. Early interdisciplinary treatment is essential to avoid further complications.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum mimicking a diabetic foot infection: a case report [^115xfpr6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

An adult with ulcerative colitis and diabetes presented with a painful, swollen, edematous left foot. Diagnostic images and laboratory tests were inconclusive. Antibiotics were started immediately but aggravated his symptoms, and the laboratory results worsened. His foot was debrided twice per protocol for treating diabetic foot ulcers or cellulitis. After debridement, his condition worsened rapidly. Pyoderma gangrenosum was correctly diagnosed on the basis of massive neutrophilic infiltration detected in the biopsy tissue and because the lesion was well-defined and colored deep red to violet, unlike the bullosis diabeticorum blisters observed in the diabetic foot. His foot improved with systemic corticosteroids and topical wound care, and a skin defect was treated with a skin graft. After 9 months, his foot was well healed. Pyoderma gangrenosum can be diagnosed by careful examination and must be distinguished from an ulcerated diabetic foot lesion.

### Real-world utilization of Delphi consensus diagnostic criteria for suspected pyoderma gangrenosum [^116bcKgB]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

We found that the systematic use of Delphi consensus diagnostic criteria resulted in substantial changes in management patterns in cases of suspected pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), including a reduction in systemic corticosteroid use, and significantly improved clinical outcomes. This improvement may have resulted from a combination of reduced misdiagnosis, optimized management and reduced iatrogenic harm. Increased utilization of validated diagnostic criteria for PG could optimize provider heuristics, increase diagnostic accuracy, and optimize management and clinical outcomes.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: an updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^1125ezzo]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare debilitating inflammatory skin disease clinically characterized by painful, rapidly evolving cutaneous ulcers with undermined, irregular, erythematous-violaceous edges. First described by Brocq and Simon in 1908 as " phagédénisme géométrique " and subsequently renamed by Brunsting et al. in 1930, PG represents the prototype of neutrophilic dermatoses and is currently classified within deep/hypodermal neutrophilic dermatoses, with a worldwide estimated incidence of 3–10 cases/million people/year. Several clinical variants have been described, including classic ulcerative, bullous, pustular, vegetative, peristomal, and postoperative. Bullous PG is hallmarked by blisters that are present at onset and later evolve into ulcerative lesions. Vegetating lesions usually develop on the surface of a previously classic ulcerative PG, often during treatment, while pustular lesions usually precede or are concomitant to PG ulcers. Pyoderma gangrenosum lesions mostly affect the lower limbs. Pyoderma gangrenosum may be idiopathic, associated with systemic conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), rheumatological disorders, and hematological malignancies, or present in the setting of autoinflammatory syndromes such as PAPA (Pyogenic Arthritis, PG and Acne), PASH (PG, Acne, and Suppurative Hidradenitis), PAPASH (Pyogenic Arthritis, PG, Acne, and Suppurative Hidradenitis), and in a small proportion of SAPHO (Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, and Osteitis) cases.

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^116oUjJs]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, no difference was found between the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum, ciclosporin and prednisolone, across a range of outcome measures. Contrary to the anecdotally derived belief that these drugs are efficacious in pyoderma gangrenosum, we found that fewer than half of the ulcers healed, even after prolonged treatment, and the speed of onset of response did not differ between the two treatments. Approximately two thirds of participants reported adverse reactions; 12% of whom experienced a serious event. The side effects observed were in line with the known side effect profiles of these drugs. More serious adverse reactions, especially serious infections, were reported in the prednisolone group, although patients receiving ciclosporin were at increased risk of renal toxicity.

A recent expert consensus paper considering safety, efficacy, and cost placed prednisolone as preferred treatment and ciclosporin as second ranked treatment among the many suggested interventions for pyoderma gangrenosum. None the less, previous studies have reported large proportions of people with pyoderma gangrenosum achieving complete response with ciclosporin, which led the current researchers of the STOP GAP (Study of Treatments fOr Pyoderma GAngrenosum Patients) randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that ciclosporin was superior to prednisolone for the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.

Healing responses at six weeks in our study were broadly similar to those observed for the randomised controlled trial of infliximab compared with placebo. In the STOP GAP trial, ulcers had healed at six weeks in 15% of participants in the ciclosporin group and 21% in the prednisolone group. By comparison, ulcers had healed at six weeks in 21% of participants in the infliximab trial (all participants who had not responded to treatment at week 2 were offered infliximab regardless of the randomised allocation to infliximab or placebo). Subsequent observational studies suggest that treatment with antitumour necrosis factor is potentially more effective in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but we did not have the power to look at this in the current trial. Head to head comparisons of antitumour necrosis factor with ciclosporin or prednisolone are needed, along with investigation of topical interventions that may provide a better risk-benefit profile for patients.

### Effectiveness of systemic treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: a systematic review of observational studies and clinical trials [^116DUHsi]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis with substantial morbidity. There is no consensus on gold-standard treatments.

Objectives

To review the effectiveness of systemic therapy for PG.

Methods

We searched six databases for 24 systemic therapies for PG. Primary outcomes were complete healing and clinical improvement; secondary outcomes were time to healing and adverse effects.

Results

We found 3326 citations and 375 articles underwent full-text review; 41 studies met the inclusion criteria. There were 704 participants in 26 retrospective cohort studies, three prospective cohort studies, seven case series, one case-control study, two open-label trials and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Systemic corticosteroids were the most studied (32 studies), followed by ciclosporin (21 studies), biologics (16 studies) and oral dapsone (11 studies). One RCT (STOP-GAP, n = 121) showed that prednisolone and ciclosporin were similar: 15–20% of patients showed complete healing at 6 weeks and 47% at 6 months. Another RCT (n = 30) found that infliximab was superior to placebo at 2 weeks (46% vs. 6% response), with a 21% complete healing rate at 6 weeks. Two uncontrolled trials showed 60% and 37% healing within 4 months for canakinumab and infliximab, respectively; other data suggest that patients with concurrent inflammatory bowel disease may benefit from biologics. The remaining studies were poor quality and had small sample sizes but supported the use of corticosteroids, ciclosporin and biologics.

Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids, ciclosporin, infliximab and canakinumab had the most evidence in treating PG. However, current literature is limited to small and lower-quality studies with substantial heterogeneity.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the neutrophilic dermatoses (pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome) [^113y15pN]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Neutrophilic dermatoses include a spectrum of disorders with similar histologic appearance and pathologic processes. Clinically, however, they have different physical manifestations and associations. This group includes two diseases for which dermatologists are commonly consulted in the hospital, namely pyoderma gangrenosum and acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, or Sweet's syndrome. Evaluation is challenging, and many therapeutic approaches have been described for both. The previously reported diagnostic criteria, physical descriptions, differential diagnosis, workup, and treatment options are reviewed. A practical approach to pyoderma gangrenosum and Sweet's syndrome for the provider is described.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: diagnostic criteria, subtypes, systemic associations, and workup [^115RQRJS]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis with variable clinical features. The classic presentation is an ulceration with an erythematous to violaceous undermined border. Extracutaneous manifestations may occur. Associated systemic diseases include inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritides, and hematologic disorders. The pathophysiologic mechanism of disease is not completely known but likely related to the cumulative impact of inflammation, immune-mediated neutrophilic dysfunction, and genetic predisposition. Incidence is between 3 and 10 people per million but may be greater due to under recognition. In this article, we will discuss the diagnostic criteria, disease subtypes, systemic associations, and workup.

### Atypical pyoderma gangrenosum after breast reduction [^111AmzHS]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Although rare, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) occurs as one of the worst local complications following plastic surgery to the breast. The early manifestations are similar to a necrotizing wound infection, so diagnosis and correct management are often delayed. Failure of response to the aggressive treatment strategies needed for necrotizing wound infections and the phenomenon of pathergy will often raise the clinical suspicion of PG. The main steps of therapy consist of minimal wound debridement and initiation of corticosteroids and/or immune modulation. Repair of skin defects requires care and attention. Smaller defects are best left to heal by secondary intention, as pathergy can reactivate the syndrome and cause an even larger skin wound. Larger defects are repaired with skin grafts or flaps. We report a case of atypical (bullous) PG in a healthy 57 year-old white woman following reduction mammaplasty.

### Infliximab for treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum associated with inflammatory bowel disease [^1123qKFT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an immune-mediated inflammatory condition characterized by ulcerative skin lesions affecting 1–2% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Treatment includes wound care, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators. However, response to therapy varies, and many patients with pyoderma gangrenosum have disease that is refractory to these agents. The aim of this study was to assess the response of medically refractory pyoderma gangrenosum to infliximab.

Methods

This was a multicenter retrospective study of patients with IBD and medically refractory pyoderma gangrenosum treated with infliximab. Data collected included the following: baseline demographics; duration of IBD; history of bowel resection; duration of skin lesions; number, size, and location of pyoderma gangrenosum lesions; prior medications; dose and number of infliximab infusions; bowel activity before and after infliximab; pyoderma gangrenosum activity before and after infliximab therapy; time to response and time to healing of pyoderma gangrenosum lesions; recurrence of pyoderma gangrenosum after infliximab; corticosteroid taper; and adverse reactions to infliximab.

Results

There were 13 patients with moderate to severe pyoderma gangrenosum and IBD treated with infliximab. All patients demonstrated complete healing of the skin lesions. Three patients had a complete response to induction infliximab therapy and did not require additional treatment. Ten patients responded to induction infliximab and have maintained pyoderma gangrenosum healing with infusions every 4–12 wk. All patients receiving corticosteroids were able to discontinue them completely after institution of infliximab treatment. Infliximab was well tolerated; the only treatment-related adverse events were sunburn in one patient and an infusion reaction in another.

Conclusions

Infliximab is a safe and effective treatment for IBD-associated pyoderma gangrenosum.

### A case of rituximab-induced pyoderma gangrenosum [^1156gDdh]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The dermatology department was consulted for diagnosis and discussion of ongoing management. Examination found large full-thickness ulcers covering 30% of the bilateral buttocks surface and vulvovaginal region (Fig 1). Multiple ulcers extended into subcutaneous tissue, and wound edges were overhanding with purple-grey discolouration compared with the unaffected skin. Histopathology derived from in-patient operative procedures was reviewed by an independent dermatopathologist. This report showed "extensive ulceration of the epidermis with underlying edema of the dermis and mixed acute and chronic inflammatory cells… slight undermining of the inflammation at the periphery of the ulcer is seen. The inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of neutrophils, lymphocytes and rare scattered multinucleated giant cells". The overall features were nonspecific; however, PG was favoured. The diagnosis of PG was made based on the cutaneous findings, review of histopathology, medical history including RA and large B-cell lymphoma, and the rapid onset of extensive ulcers that worsened with sharp debridement. Immediate management included prednisone, 1 mg/kg orally, and gentle wound care with particular avoidance of sharp debridement.

Fig 1
Initial visit to the dermatology office and before prednisone therapy. The figure depicts the patient lying on their left side with the upper body extending to the left and lower body to the right. Examination found large full-thickness ulcers covering 30% of the bilateral buttocks surface and vulvovaginal region with purple-grey discolored wound edges overhanding.

Two weeks later the patient was discharged from the hospital with significant improvement in cutaneous lesions. Three months after their first dose of prednisone, they returned to the dermatology clinic with almost complete healing of all ulcers. The prednisone was tapered over approximately 3 months, and sulfasalazine was initiated as a steroid-sparing agent given the history of RA and lymphoma. Recalcitrant small ulcers on the patient's buttocks were treated with intralesional triamcinolone injection to the active borders. Because of her excellent response to treatment, the patient subsequently underwent reversal of her loop ileostomy.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum following reduction mammoplasty: systematic review of the literature and case report [^112BVhzZ]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis that can develop at a surgical site. Diagnosis can be challenging at its presentation causing delays in appropriate treatment. The aim of this study is to review the current literature as well as to describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic pathway, and treatment of PG after reduction mammaplasty in order to define a standardized multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic approach. In the future, this may ease early identification and prompt treatment, and eventually minimize severe morbidity and long-term sequelae.

Methods

The entire PubMed/Medline database was screened following the PRISMA guidelines to identify studies describing PG that have occurred after reduction mammoplasty.

Results

Twenty-eight articles including 31 patients reported a PG after breast reduction surgery between January 1988 and March 2022. Twenty-one (68%) patients presented with skin ulcerations, 14 (45%) with erythema, and 5 (16%) with vesicles. Out of the 30 cases that underwent bilateral surgery, 18 (60%) developed PG bilaterally. In 12 out of 31 patients, nipple-areolar complex (NAC) involvement was evaluated, though in 10 patients (83%) the NAC was spared. Of the 20 patients (65%) who underwent skin biopsies for histopathological examination, 18 (90%) showed neutrophilic infiltration of the dermal layers. All 31 patients (100%) showed rapid clinical improvement after the introduction of immunosuppressive therapy.

Conclusions

PG can result in devastating skin alterations also after reduction mammoplasty, if misdiagnosed. However, it presents with constant yet unspecific local and general signs and symptoms that can be recognized to early initiate an appropriate pharmacological treatment.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^1121wzoW]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Patient and wound assessment

The care for chronic wounds therefore relies upon basic tenets that aim to not only remove or ameliorate the etiologic causes but also to address underlying systemic and metabolic perturbations such as infection or peripheral arterial disease. Proper care of the wound is facilitated initially by employing thorough patient and wound assessment. Factors contributing to the development or recalcitrance of the wounds are then addressed accordingly. Concurrent with the management of associated complications or etiologic factors, wound bed preparation plays a key role in encouraging the proper environment in which tissue repair can take place. Of course, appropriate diagnosis is mandatory to establish the etiology of the nonhealing wound. DFUs, venous leg ulcers (VLUs), PUs, post surgical wounds, and wound dehiscences are the most commonly seen wounds in wound care practice. Atypical wounds such as pyoderma gangrenosum can also be very challenging. Each has its own underlying etiopathogenesis that must be addressed upon initial presentation. Nonetheless, the clinician must be diligent in taking care to rule out the presence of malignancy in the wound either secondarily due to malignant degeneration as in the case of squamous cell carcinoma or as a primary lesion (Fig. 2A). Aside from neoplastic lesions, the basic tenets of wound assessment and care as presented in Table 1 serve as a guide to facilitate the management of most chronic wounds.

Figure 2.
(A) Recurrent plantar ulcer not responsive to offloading. Biopsy revealed amelanotic melanoma. The clinician must be diligent in taking care to rule out the presence of malignancy in the wound either secondarily due to malignant degeneration as in the case of squamous cell carcinoma or as a primary lesion. (B) Cellulitis from infected digital wound with associated ischemia. Significant erythema can indicate cellulitis or infection requiring immediate hospitalization or might be an indicator of significant ischemia (dependent rubor). (C) Probe-to-bone test. If the bone is directly appreciated at the base of a wound, osteomyelitis is likely. A positive probe-to-bone test has a high predictive value for underlying osteomyelitis, even in the absence of acute signs of deep infection.

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^1164txj8]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

The trial protocol has been published previously.

Trial design and oversight

We carried out a multicentre, parallel group, observer blind randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of ciclosporin with that of prednisolone. Participants gave written informed consent. Oversight of the trial included a trial management group and independent trial steering and data monitoring committees. Patients suitable for topical treatment were entered into a parallel observational study, the results of which will be reported separately.

Patient involvement

Patients were involved in the design and conduct of this research. During the feasibility stage, priority of the research question, choice of outcome measures, and methods of recruitment were informed by discussions with patients through a focus group session and two structured interviews. During the trial, a patient joined the independent trial steering committee. Members of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network also identified this research as being a priority area for clinicians treating patients with pyoderma gangrenosum. Once the trial has been published, participants will be informed of the results through a dedicated website and will be sent details of the results in a study newsletter suitable for a non-specialist audience.

Participants

Recruitment took place at 39 hospitals in the United Kingdom. Participants were aged 18 years or more, with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum made by a recruiting dermatologist. Histopathology is rarely pathognomonic for pyoderma gangrenosum, and many clinicians avoid biopsy because of the risk of an immunological reaction that results in ulcer extension at the biopsy site. If the clinical diagnosis was uncertain, a biopsy was performed to exclude other diagnoses such as malignancy, granulomatous pyoderma gangrenosum, and arteritis, and advice was sought from an expert panel as necessary.

We excluded patients with pustular or granulomatous variants of pyoderma gangrenosum (as they may respond differently to treatment, and measurement of a single ulcer was not possible); patients receiving oral prednisolone, ciclosporin, or intravenous immunoglobulin in the previous month; patients participating in another clinical trial; women who were pregnant, lactating, or at risk of pregnancy; patients with known hypersensitivity to either of the study treatments; patients with clinically important renal impairment or other pretreatment findings that would result in the investigator not using either of the study drugs; patients with malignant or premalignant disease; patients with a concurrent medical condition for which treatments might interfere with ongoing treatment or cause harm; and patients taking rosuvastatin or those who had received a live vaccine in the two weeks before randomisation.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum in pregnancy: a systematic review of clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, and maternofetal implications [^111u5wc1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although cases of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) during pregnancy have been reported, comprehensive data are limited. This review aims to (1) analyze the demographic and clinical characteristics of PG in pregnant and postpartum patients, (2) assess the frequency and effectiveness of treatments, and (3) explore the maternal and fetal implications of PG.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, with searches in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to September 27, 2023. Studies were included if they reported PG during pregnancy or within six weeks postpartum. Data extraction and screening were independently performed by 2 reviewers using Covidence.

Results

Sixty-two studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 63 patient cases. Most cases (N = 55, 87.3%) occurred without inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatologic disease. PG was frequently misdiagnosed (N = 45), resulting in treatment delays and inappropriate interventions. Fifty-six cases (88.9%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids, while 21 (33.3%) were treated with cyclosporine. Emergency Cesarean section was the most common pregnancy complication (N = 19).

Discussion

Increased awareness of PG in pregnant or postpartum patients could reduce misdiagnosis and improve outcomes. Immunological changes during pregnancy may trigger PG in susceptible patients, yet the safety and efficacy of treatment options are not well-established in this population, underscoring the need for research to guide management.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum after abdominal free tissue transfer for breast reconstruction: case series and management guidelines [^112Xa5SE]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyoderma gangrenosum following free tissue transfer for breast reconstruction is rare. This unusual ulcerative condition is frequently misdiagnosed, leading to inappropriate debridement and escalation of the subsequent wound through pathergy. Once diagnosed, treatment with immunosuppressive agents, including corticosteroids, results in an initial rapid response, but prolonged treatment is required. There is a paucity of literature regarding how to approach future surgery.

Methods

This was a retrospective case review from a single center over a 17-year period. All patients diagnosed with postsurgical pyoderma gangrenosum after free tissue transfer from the abdomen for breast reconstruction were included.

Results

Of 456 free tissue transfers from the abdomen for breast reconstruction, 8 women who underwent 13 free flaps were diagnosed with postsurgical pyoderma gangrenosum in 10 flaps. The surgeries performed included transverse rectus abdominis muscle (n = 5), deep inferior epigastric perforator (n = 4) and superficial inferior epigastric artery (n = 4) flaps. Mean age at diagnosis was 52.8 years, and 3 patients had preexisting autoimmune conditions: type 2 diabetes mellitus, dermatomyositis, and Graves disease. The mean time of presentation of wound symptoms was 3.9 days after surgery, and mean time diagnosis was made was 9.4 days.

Conclusions

Pyoderma gangrenosum after autologous breast reconstruction is a rare, but serious, complication that is worsened by misdiagnosis and inappropriate debridement. We present a case series of 8 patients and emphasize the importance of early recognition and treatment with immune suppression. We include a treatment algorithm to manage these patients, once the diagnosis is suspected. Future surgery can be considered with a fully informed patient and careful collaboration with dermatology colleagues.

### Postoperative pyoderma gangrenosum after spinal fusion with instrumentation: case report [^112GcZgd]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory dermatosis that is most often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, but which can occur as a pathergic reaction around surgical incisions. The authors report the case of a patient who developed postoperative PG over the course of several months after undergoing extensive spinal instrumentation between the T4 and iliac levels. This is only the second such case occurring after spine surgery to be reported. The authors additionally review the literature to characterize treatment approaches and outcomes for this condition. The case highlights a potentially severe adverse effect of surgery that can be difficult to recognize and causes delays in effective treatment. It also demonstrates the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the effective care of patients.

### Outcomes and risk factors of pyoderma gangrenosum after reduction mammoplasty: a systematic review of the literature and case report [^114bwMES]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The initial misdiagnosis of PG after reduction mammoplasty is common. The condition is mostly diagnosed as wound infection or necrotizing fasciitis, and patients are treated with antimicrobial therapy and wound debridement. Besides the delay in diagnosis, surgical debridement potentially exacerbates the condition and disfigures the breasts with the involvement of the surrounding healthy breast tissues. This was consistent with Ehlr et al. 2018 who reported single debridement in 49% of patients with PG after breast surgeries, and unnecessary removal of breast implants in 61% of patients. Despite that, wounds tended to progress after surgical debridement and after removal of the implants. Brucato et al. 2024 review reported the lack of data regarding the diagnosis and management of PG after reduction mammoplasty, in which the majority of cases were diagnosed late after subjecting to unnecessary and often harmful interventions. The development of PG in response to mechanical injury or surgery to the breast skin is considered a hyperactivity response. Surgical interventions before controlling the condition may worsen the PG. This systematic review highlighted the lack of evidence regarding PG after reduction mammoplasty, including cases with the involvement of NAC. Tuffaha et al. 2014 reported that surgical debridement accelerates PG and induces pathergy in healthy surrounding tissues that were yet uninvolved.

Prompt consultation with a dermatologist is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PG, particularly with ineffective antibiotic therapy. The treatment needed to be initiated promptly before the results of histopathology or bacteriology, which may be non-specific for PG. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose PG after reduction mammoplasty. The involvement of the breast is sharply demarcated, sparing the NAC. Immunosuppressive therapies should begin immediately once the diagnosis of PG is established. Timely initiation of immunosuppressive therapy leads to dramatic improvement in wound activity. All further surgical interventions should be commenced under the coverage of immunosuppressive therapies and after lesions become quiescent. Noteworthy, reconstruction of wounds associated with PG is mostly unnecessary, and complete wound healing tends to occur with medical treatment only. The majority of cases in our review showed complete healing with secondary intention, and a limited number of cases needed reconstruction after controlling the condition. Pop et al. 2024 recommended an individualized treatment plan for patients with PG after breast surgery, emphasizing the need for timely diagnosis, meticulous planning, and comprehensive care to optimize patient outcomes.

### Rapidly progressive idiopathic pyoderma gangrenosum in a pediatric patient successfully treated with infliximab [^111mjtum]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare skin disorder with poorly understood pathophysiology. PG infrequently occurs in children, and approximately 4% of patients with PG are infants and children. First line therapy is topical and systemic corticosteroids, which typically yields rapid response. We report a case of rapidly progressive pediatric PG of unknown inciting cause that ultimately required multi-modal therapy with systemic and topical corticosteroids, high-dose infliximab, and colchicine.

### Successful management of anti-TNF-induced psoriasis despite continuation of therapy in a pyoderma gangrenosum patient [^115apQDw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an inflammatory, neutrophil-mediated disorder that is difficult to treat. Tumor necrosis factor and other inflammatory mediators are among the most promising therapeutic targets. We present a case of a 60-year-old woman with recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum treated with adalimumab, who paradoxically developed psoriasis. Secukinumab, an interleukin-17 inhibitor, was added to her regimen, resulting in successful treatment of her psoriasis. Secukinumab was later replaced by methotrexate, resulting in remission of both pyoderma gangrenosum and maintenance of a psoriasis-free state. We conclude that paradoxically induced psoriatic lesions can resolve with adjunct therapy despite continuation of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents.

### Spesolimab use in treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum [^116hym9B]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, inflammatory neutrophilic disease that is characterized by rapidly progressing, painful skin ulcers with peripheral, violaceous erythema and undermined borders. While the pathophysiology of PG has not been fully elucidated, pathogenesis has been largely attributed to pathergy. Upon trauma, keratinocytes release interleukin 36 (IL-36) which is thought to play a role in PG pathogenesis and neutrophil recruitment.

To date, there is no standardized treatment for PG. Rapidly progressing cases require early systemic therapies such as prednisone, cyclosporine and anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapies to contain lesions and halt spread.,

Spesolimab is an interleukin (IL)-36 receptor blocker that was recently approved for generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). Bachelez et aldemonstrated in a phase 2 randomized trial that spesolimab treatment resulted in significant clearing of GPP lesions compared to placebo. Given similar mechanisms, we hypothesized that targeting IL-36 in refractory, ulcerative, PG may also result in resolution of a patients' lesions.

Prior to its approval, spesolimab was obtained for emergency investigational novel drug use in PG (eIND 163533). Permission to administer spesolimab to patient #1 was approved by our institutional review board and the Food and Drug Administration for 4 doses of 900 mg every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. Patient #2 was infused after Food and Drug Administration approval of spesolimab for GPP flares and was prescribed for off-label use.

### Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with the anti-TNFalpha drug-etanercept [^112QPGcx]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare and painful skin condition of uncertain aetiology characterised by one or more areas of chronic ulceration with well demarcated and undermined borders. The exact pathogenesis of PG is poorly understood but an abnormality in the regulation of the immune system or its effectors is suspected. Pathergy (the development of lesions in areas of trauma) may also play a role in the development of PG. This implies that PG may be the result of an uncontrolled and exaggerated/altered inflammatory response to nonspecific stimuli. Patients of any age may be affected by PG but it occurs predominantly in the fourth or fifth decades of life. Patients with PG present with recurrent and destructive ulcers which may begin as pustules and eventually resolve as crater-like scars. As there are currently no diagnostic tests for PG the diagnosis must be made by exclusion. We now report the successful treatment of a patient with pyoderma gangrenosum, resistant to standard steroid therapy, using the anti-TNFalpha drug Etanercept. We believe that this is the first such report in the plastic surgery literature.

Topical Treatment and Wound Care

Topical Corticosteroids (Level of Evidence 2B)

Topical CS can be effective for the treatment of mild or localized/unilesional PG. Typically, high-potency CS, such as clobetasol propionate, are used, although others were also reported to be beneficial. In a prospective cohort study, 49 patients were treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream monotherapy, resulting in a median healing time of 136 days. Overall, 42.6% of patients healed completely at 6 months; however, 21.1% of the former had subsequent recurrences. The size of the lesion at presentation was noted to be a significant predictor of time to healing.

### Hidden in plain sight: considerations for an ulcer of the scalp [^1128X5QM]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory skin condition characterized by painful, irregularly shaped skin ulcers mainly affecting the lower extremities. PG rarely affects the head and neck, making the diagnosis of this condition even more challenging. A high index of suspicion is paramount in the diagnosis of PG, especially after surgical procedures.

Methods

We describe a clinical case of a patient with initially undiagnosed PG of the scalp who underwent surgical excision and full thickness skin graft with subsequent graft necrosis as initial clue for the diagnosis.

Results

Twenty months after initial presentation, this patient healed with a multimodal medical approach of immunosuppressive therapy and wound care.

Conclusion

Prompt recognition of PG by physicians assessing any surgical wounds is vital in reducing misdiagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

### Effective strategies for the management of pyoderma gangrenosum [^114qj1tY]. Advances in Wound Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an inflammatory disease characterized by painful ulcerations. It is often associated with other systemic inflammatory diseases, especially inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune arthritis.

The Problem

PG does not have characteristic serologic or histologic features. Therefore, other potential causes such as malignancy, vasculitis, infection, and coagulation disorders should be ruled out. In addition, patients often have aggressive disease that is refractory to immunosuppressive therapy, but there is only a paucity of clinical data to help direct therapy.

Basic/Clinical Science Advances

There are several lines of evidence to support an immunologic etiology of PG. Although the pathogenesis is still not well understood, it is clear that PG is associated with the upregulation of several cytokines including interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β, IL-6, and interferon gamma, among many others. TNF and IL-1β are of particular interest, because some biologic medications that target these cytokines have been effective in treating PG.

Clinical Care Relevance

Multiple drugs are available to help control PG. Biologics, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and conventional immunosuppressive drugs have been reported to be effective. Multidrug therapies should be considered for refractory cases.

Conclusion

PG is a complex inflammatory disease with multiple involved pathways. Anti-TNF agents and IVIG represent a significant advancement in treatment options. Since some biologic therapies are relatively new, their unknown long-term side effects should be taken into consideration.

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^1128sGrL]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare inflammatory disorder that causes progressive necrotising ulceration. A retrospective cohort study of UK cases reported an age and sex adjusted incidence of 0.63 per 100 000 person years. Several variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been recognised, but the classic form of the disease is the most commonly encountered. Manifestations of pyoderma gangrenosum are predominantly cutaneous, typically beginning as a tender erythematous nodule or pustule that rapidly breaks down to form a large, well demarcated ulcer with purplish, undermined edges. The condition is often observed in patients with an underlying systemic disease and has been particularly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and haematological malignancies. Approximately 25% of cases are precipitated by incidental or iatrogenic trauma, a phenomenon known as pathergy. The development of pyoderma gangrenosum is associated with a threefold increased risk of death (hazard ratio 3.03) compared with that of controls from the general population, and a 72% increased mortality over controls with inflammatory bowel disease.

Currently there are no national or international guidelines covering the management of pyoderma gangrenosum. Patient information issued by the British Association of Dermatologists describes topical and systemic treatment options, as well as lesser used options such as intravenous steroids or biologics. The most commonly prescribed topical treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum are potent steroid preparations and calcineurin inhibitors, and commonly prescribed systemic treatments include steroids and immunosuppressants.

Only one randomised controlled trial in patients with pyoderma gangrenosum is reported in the literature. This small, placebo controlled study of 30 patients assessed infliximab, which is not considered to be a first line treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum. There is a complete lack of studies assessing the efficacy of commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum, so systematic reviews have primarily relied on anecdotal reports or retrospective case series. Given the complete absence of high quality evidence on treatments, we carried out a randomised controlled trial (STOP GAP, Study of Treatments fOr Pyoderma GAngrenosum Patients) to test the hypothesis that ciclosporin is superior to prednisolone in the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in severe peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum [^1142m6VD]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
(A) The progression of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum with β-lactam antibiotic therapy. (B) The isolated skin lesions had merged into one penetrating ulcer measuring approximately 37 × 15 cm. To resolve the constant maceration and contamination by fecal matter, the ileostoma was repositioned to the left upper abdomen. (C) The appearance of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum during the course of ustekinumab treatment.

The diagnosis of peristomal PG is challenging. Because no validated diagnostic criteria for PG exist, the diagnosis is based on the combination of a comprehensive clinical assessment and the exclusion of other causes of skin ulceration. Nonhealing ulcers require dermatology consultation. Inadequate treatment of PG can lead to life-threatening complications and permanent impairment.

UST is currently not approved for use in PG. In the present case, the administration of UST was based on the good results reported in previous case series and retrospective studies on PG. Furthermore, UST was used to achieve sustained remission after urgent subtotal colectomy for refractory UC.

Our case suggests that UST might be an effective and safe therapeutic option for peristomal PG. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.

2.5 Treatment of

The treatment of PG is challenging. Alongside medical therapy, proper wound care is essential in managing PG cases, which includes the use of appropriate dressings based on the inflammatory or noninflammatory phase. Pain control also plays a crucial role. The use of immunosuppressants and biologics, targeting such as TNF‐α, IL‐1, IL‐12/23, IL‐17, IL‐23, IL‐36 and JAK, has been proposed for PG treatment. For more detailed information on medical therapy options, refer to the referenced review articles. Of note, frequent debridement of the wound or surgical procedures is generally recommended to be avoided during the active phase of the disease due to concerns about pathergy response.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum of the breast 17 years after breast cancer treatment [^113hCs8x]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present a case of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) affecting the breast of a 74-year-old woman, with a history of breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy 17 years prior. She presented to the hospital with worsening breast ulceration, after a punch biopsy was performed at the site. She had surrounding cellulitis and concurrent infection to that breast which required antibiotics. The ulceration persisted even after treatment, and incisional biopsies of the area of ulceration confirmed the diagnosis of PG. Her condition was managed effectively with the use of immunosuppressive therapy, and she continued to display a good clinical response 2months post discharge from the hospital.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum of the breast in a patient with a history of silicone augmentation mastopexy and suction-assisted lipectomy of the trunk [^111JpwEx]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

PG treatment consists of 4 approaches: suppression of the exacerbating inflammation, promoting healing, controlling pain, and treating the underlying cause (if such exists). First-line therapy consists of systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporine; treatment with other immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, dapsone, and azathioprine has also been described in the literature.PG responds well, almost immediately halting progression. Unfortunately, lesions already present take weeks to months to heal. Antibiotics such as mezlocillin, rifampin, tetracycline, and vancomycin have been used to prevent secondary bacterial superinfection and modulate PG course secondarily as anti-inflammatories. There are reports of treating PG with topical or intralesional injection of corticosteroids and other topical immunosuppressants. One study used hydrocolloid dressing and allograft installation; however, sample size was small, and no further conclusions can be made at this time regarding their use. Debridement is contraindicated; if a patient does require further surgery, it is suggested they be immunosuppressed and without evidence of active disease to prevent recurrence. Treatment using antiseptic and dressings combined with systemic immunosuppression is advised for cases of PG.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum controlled with rituximab [^1113HBKz]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory cutaneous disease. Much of the underlying pathophysiology and etiology remain poorly understood, but PG is often associated with autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory and/or neoplastic diseases. The disease can be extremely variable in presentation with either single or multiple lesions presenting on various parts of the body.

PG is often difficult to diagnose because of variability of presentation, nonspecific laboratory findings, and indeterminate histology. Other conditions associated with cutaneous ulcerations must be considered in the differential diagnosis, such as infections, vasculitis, and malignancies. No official protocol exists for treatment of PG, but therapy usually involves immunosuppression in conjunction with wound care. We present a case of recalcitrant PG with widespread involvement that resolved with rituximab.

### A case of extracutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with persistent cutaneous and systemic symptoms: implications for differential diagnosis and treatment [^117FSpxB]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

As PG with systemic involvement is a diagnosis of exclusion, patients typically undergo extensive medical and infectious workup. They may experience critical delays in diagnosis and inappropriate management. While it is essential to rule out infection, vasculitis, and malignancy, extracutaneous PG should be included in the differential for patients presenting with flares of cutaneous PG and concomitant systemic symptoms.

While neutrophilic dermatoses can be part of the spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases, our patient did not have features of defined syndromes. A diagnosis of extracutaneous PG, PAPA (pyogenic arthritis, PG, and acne), PAPASH (pyogenic arthritis, acne, PG, and suppurative hidradenitis), and aseptic abscess syndrome rely on the patterns of presentation, associated signs and symptoms, and genetic testing. Our patient lacked acne and hidradenitis suppurativa, as well as any joint pain during these episodes. Antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody, and antiphospholipid antibody tests have been negative to date. Her rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated peptide antibody have normalized with immunosuppressive treatment. Microscopically, lung tissue has consistently shown numerous neutrophils and negative infectious stains and tissue cultures, which can be seen in both extracutaneous PG and aseptic abscess syndrome. However, the patient's history of cutaneous PG flares in parallel with the extracutaneous lesions suggests extracutaneous PG as the most likely diagnosis. As we regard extracutaneous PG to reside within the spectrum of autoinflammatory disease, the distinction is not likely to affect management. The more important management issue is correct identification as inflammatory rather than infectious disease.

### Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with apremilast monotherapy [^1144iftK]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by rapidly developing painful ulcers with overhanging borders and peripheral erythema. It is typically treated with local and systemic immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids, cyclosporin, dapsone, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors, but many lesions exhibit treatment-resistant or relapse following a successful therapeutic response. Additionally, as there is currently a paucity of clinical data to guide the treatment of PG, management often revolves around guidelines set forth by case reports or small clinical trials, highlighting the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies for this disease. Here, we report a case of PG treated with apremilast monotherapy, which is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor.

### A core domain set for pyoderma gangrenosum trial outcomes: an international eDelphi and consensus study from the UPGRADE initiative [^114NG3XQ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare ulcerative skin condition with no current standardized outcomes or outcome measures. With a rich investigational therapeutic pipeline, standardization of outcomes and improvement of data quality and interpretability will promote the appropriate and consistent evaluation of potential new therapies. Core outcome sets (COS) are agreed, standardized sets of outcomes that represent the minimum that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials of a specific condition.

Objectives

To identify and reach a consensus on which domains (what to be measured) should be included in the Understanding Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Review and Analysis of Disease Effects (UPGRADE) core domain set for clinical trials in PG.

Methods

Collaborative discussions between patients and PG experts, and a systematic review of the literature identified items and prospective domains. A three-round international eDelphi exercise was performed to prioritize the domains and refine the provisional items (consensus: ≥ 70% of participants rating a domain as 'extremely important' and < 15% of participants voting 'not important'), followed by an international meeting to reach consensus on the core domain set (consensus: < 30% disagreement). Item-generation discussions and consensus meetings were hosted via online videoconferences. The eDelphi exercise and consensus voting were performed using Qualtrics survey software. Participants were adults with PG, healthcare professionals, researchers and industry representatives.

Results

Collaborative discussions and systematic reviews yielded 115 items, which were distilled into 15 prospective domains. The eDelphi exercise removed the three lowest-priority domains ('laboratory tests', 'treatment costs' and 'disease impact on family') and ranked 'pain', 'quality of life' and 'physical symptoms' as the highest-priority prospective domains. Consensus was reached on the domains of 'pain', 'quality of life' and 'clinical signs'. The domain of 'disease course/disease progression' narrowly failed to reach consensus for inclusion in the core set (32% of participants voted 'no'). Refinement of this domain definition will be required and presented for consideration at future consensus meetings.

Conclusions

The UPGRADE core domain set for clinical trials in PG has been agreed by international multistakeholder consensus. Future work will develop and/or select outcome measurement instruments for these domains to establish a COS.

### Fulminant pyoderma gangrenosum after outpatient knee arthroscopy [^115DJdDr]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an immunologic, ulcerative cutaneous condition often associated with systemic disease and frequently precipitated by trauma. It is noninfectious, but the inflammatory assault can resemble a malignant infection such as necrotizing fasciitis. Despite its clinical resemblance to infection, surgical débridement worsens the condition and may remove morphologic clues to the true disease, thus creating a vicious cycle of surgical débridements and disease progression. Furthermore, diagnostic histopathologic and laboratory features are nonspecific, requiring exclusion of other processes. Therefore, appropriate nonsurgical treatment and immunosuppression are commonly delayed, often at a significant cost to the patient. We present a case of pyoderma gangrenosum occurring after outpatient knee arthroscopy that masqueraded as a postsurgical infection. We discuss the diagnostic approach and how a complex reconstruction involving cartilage restoration and soft-tissue coverage was achieved.

### Progression of pyoderma gangrenosum with angioinvasive fungus [^117S1Q1j]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that classically manifests as painful, rapidly evolving, violaceous ulcers that display pathergy. The etiology of PG is poorly understood, but inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1 (IL-1), and IL-17, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Biologic immunomodulators targeting inflammatory cytokines have shown great potential for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. Recent studies have demonstrated that these agents are also effective in some PG cases. Although many PG patients will recover with standard therapy, treatment with combination immunomodulators may be necessary for patients who are suffering from severe chronic or relapsing PG lesions. However, treatment with immunosuppressive agents requires finding the appropriate balance between suppressing inflammation and avoiding opportunistic infection.

Anakinra is an IL-1 receptor antagonist that has been used for treatment of several autoimmune disorders. IL-1 is an innate proinflammatory cytokine that binds the IL-1 receptor to promote inflammation and recruitment of immune cells. Inhibition of IL-1 broadly reduces inflammation but may also prevent a proper immune response to pathogens. It is estimated that 1% to 10% of patients treated with anakinra will suffer from a severe infection. In patients with recalcitrant immune diseases, anakinra should be added with care, particularly in the setting of concomitant immunosuppressants.

### Resolution of therapy-resistant pyoderma gangrenosum with upadacitinib [^116uttQq]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, orally or topically administered, are a relatively new therapeutic option for several immune-driven dermatologic diseases (including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, alopecia areata, and vitiligo). In the future, we may be able to expand its indications with therapy-resistant pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Because PG is often challenging to treat because of therapy resistance, frequent relapses, and varying results of the sparse (and mostly off-label) treatment options, there is a clear need for additional therapeutic options.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum following gynaecological surgery [^114HU9i3]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare cutaneous disorder that is characterised by painful, rapidly progressing skin ulcers. The exact pathogenesis of PG is unclear but is believed to involve an autoimmune response triggered by trauma, infection or an underlying systemic disease. In fact, nearly half of the patients diagnosed with PG have an underlying systemic disease such as inflammatory bowel disease or a rheumatological disorder. Studies have suggested that dysregulated immune responses, specifically an enhanced IL-1 pathway, may play a role in the pathogenesis of PG. The prevalence of PG worldwide is estimated to be around 3–10 cases per million individuals. It can occur in individuals of any age but commonly affects women aged 20–50 years. Most notably, PG lesions demonstrate pathergy, a phenomenon where skin trauma triggers the development of new lesions at the site of injury. The complex interplay of immunological factors and the manifestation of pathergy contribute to the diagnostic challenges of PG.

Laboratory and histopathological findings of PG can vary widely, highlighting the need for clinicopathological correlation for accurate diagnosis. The classic clinical presentation of PG is a painful ulcer, commonly seen in the lower extremities. These painful, rapidly progressing ulcers often have undermined, violaceous borders. PG is categorised into four clinical variants: ulcerative, pustular, bullous and vegetative. Treatment options for PG include systemic steroids, which help reduce the formation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1α and IL-1β. Another therapeutic approach is the use of canakinumab, an anti-IL-1β antibody.

PG is a rare but serious postsurgical complication, and its diagnosis can be challenging as it often mimics conditions such as necrotising fasciitis. It is crucial to accurately identify the condition before initiating treatment with steroids, as misdiagnosis may worsen conditions such as necrotising fasciitis, making timely and precise diagnosis essential for appropriate management. We present a case of PG in a patient with a history of gynaecological surgery, highlighting the challenges in diagnosis and management of this rare condition.

### Efficacy of systemic dapsone treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum: a retrospective review [^113ovaPV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis commonly treated with steroid immunosuppression. The utility of dapsone as a non-immunosuppressive treatment for PG has been reported in case reports and series. We sought to evaluate the response and tolerability of concurrent systemic dapsone therapy for treating PG.

Methods

We reviewed PG patients treated with systemic dapsone at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2000–2015. A treatment episode was defined as a minimum of 4 weeks of dapsone therapy with a documented response of complete, partial, or no improvement in wound healing.

Results

27 patients treated with systemic dapsone met inclusion criteria. 15.6% of treatment episodes demonstrated a response of complete healing, 81.3% of treatment episodes demonstrated a response of partial improvement, and 1 patient (3.1%) demonstrated no response. 9 patients (33.3%) had documented side effects of varying severity, with one (3.7%) requiring cessation of dapsone therapy.

Discussion

Systemic dapsone therapy may represent an effective and tolerable non-immunosuppressive adjuvant treatment for PG wound healing. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(10):1058–1060.

### Neutrophilic dermatoses: a review of current treatment options [^1119Xueg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Sweet syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, and subcorneal pustular dermatosis are neutrophilic dermatoses - conditions that have an inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The neutrophils are usually located within the dermis in Sweet syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum; however, in subcorneal pustular dermatosis, they are found in the upper layers of the epidermis. Sweet syndrome, also referred to as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterized by pyrexia, elevated neutrophil count, painful erythematous cutaneous lesions that have an infiltrate of mature neutrophils typically located in the upper dermis, and prompt clinical improvement following the initiation of systemic corticosteroid therapy. Classical, malignancy-associated, and drug-induced variants of Sweet syndrome exist. Pyoderma gangrenosum is characterized by painful, enlarging necrotic ulcers with bluish undermined borders surrounded by advancing zones of erythema; its clinical variants include: ulcerative or classic, pustular, bullous or atypical, vegetative, peristomal, and drug-induced. Subcorneal pustular dermatosis is an uncommon relapsing symmetric pustular eruption that involves flexural and intertriginous areas; it can be idiopathic or associated with cancer, infections, medications, and systemic diseases. Since Sweet syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, and subcorneal pustular dermatosis share not only the same inflammatory cell but also similar associated systemic diseases, it is not surprising that the concurrent or sequential development of these neutrophilic dermatoses has been observed in the same individual. Also, it is not unexpected that several of the effective therapeutic interventions - including systemic drugs, topical agents, and other treatment modalities - for the management of these dermatoses are the same. The treatment of choice for Sweet syndrome and idiopathic pyoderma gangrenosum is systemic corticosteroids; however, for subcorneal pustular dermatosis, dapsone is the drug of choice. Yet, tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists are becoming the preferred choice when pyoderma gangrenosum is accompanied by inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis. Potassium iodide and colchicine are alternative first-line therapies for Sweet syndrome and indomethacin (indometacin), clofazimine, cyclosporine (ciclosporin), and dapsone are second-line treatments. Cyclosporine is effective in the acute management of pyoderma gangrenosum; however, when tapering the drug, additional systemic agents are necessary for maintaining the clinical response. In some patients with subcorneal pustular dermatosis, systemic corticosteroids may be effective; yet, systemic retinoids (such as etretinate and acitretin) have effectively been used for treating this neutrophilic dermatosis - either as monotherapy or in combination with dapsone or as a component of phototherapy with psoralen and UVA radiation. Topical agents can have an adjuvant role in the management of these neutrophilic dermatoses; however, high-potency topical corticosteroids may successfully treat localized manifestations of Sweet syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, and subcorneal pustular dermatosis. Intralesional corticosteroid therapy for patients with Sweet syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum, hyperbaric oxygen and plasmapheresis for patients with pyoderma grangrenosum, and phototherapy for patients with subcorneal pustular dermatosis are other modalities that have been used effectively for treating individuals with these neutrophilic dermatoses.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum in a battered child [^114umfyT]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncommon cutaneous ulceration, which continues to be a difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. A pediatric case of pyoderma gangrenosum with no associated systemic disorder is presented. The disease was precipitated by physical trauma. The disease was controlled with systemic corticosteroid therapy and then the wound was successfully covered with a split-thickness skin graft from the thigh without any healing problem at the donor site. Although pathergy is well described in the etiopathogenesis of the disease, this is the first case reported that was precipitated after physical assault.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum following gynaecological surgery [^112cg9Fp]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

PG is a rare and challenging condition that is rarely encountered in gynaecology. Prompt recognition, accurate diagnosis and early treatment are crucial to prevent poor outcomes. While PG commonly presents as a painful ulcer in the lower extremities, it can also manifest in surgical wounds, making it important to consider in the gynaecological setting.

There are relatively few published cases of PG in the gynaecological setting. However, when it does occur, it can present a diagnostic and management conundrum due to its rarity and complexity. Risk factors for PG include underlying autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and haematological malignancies. In our patient's case, the development of PG following gynaecological surgery, despite the absence of other risk factors, highlights the need for vigilance in recognising this condition. Imaging can be misleading as PG can mimic necrotising fasciitis on MRI and other modalities. Relying solely on imaging findings can render a delay in diagnosis; therefore, identifying the characteristic clinical and histological features of PG is very important. Early biopsy with interpretation by a dermatopathologist, if available, can be helpful.

Treatment of PG is vastly different from management of necrotising fasciitis. Incorrect therapy can worsen the disease state and delay in care can be life threatening. Wound debridement in our patient's case most likely worsened her condition due to pathergy, a phenomenon where trauma triggers an exaggerated inflammatory response. Approximately 20%–40% of PG cases occur following minor trauma or complications of surgery, most commonly breast and abdominal.

Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of PG often requires a multidisciplinary approach involving gynaecologists, dermatologists, wound care specialists and rheumatologists. Histopathological examination of PG lesions typically reveals a dense infiltrate of neutrophils. The infiltration of neutrophils into the dermis is the histological hallmark of PG. The exact mechanism of injury is not well understood, but it is believed that neutrophils play a significant role in tissue destruction. For example, neutrophils can lead to a sustained generation of reactive oxygen species, which may promote angiogenesis in ulcers. The ulcerative variant of PG, the most common variant, is consistent with our patient's presentation. In fact, of all the PG clinical variants, the ulcerative variant is more likely to be associated with a poorer prognosis. In addition, increasing age, the presence of systemic disease, high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and clinical signs of wound infection are also associated with poorer prognosis.

### A case of genital pyoderma gangrenosum successfully treated with cyclosporine without relapse of established follicular lymphoma [^1149uBXV]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Management of pyoderma gangrenosum in established malignancy is challenging. When vital structures are at risk from ulceration, aggressive management is required; however, immunosuppressive therapy may compromise the prognosis for an underlying malignancy. The optimal management of pyoderma gangrenosum in this setting is unclear. We report on a 64-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma in partial remission, who had severe genital pyoderma gangrenosum. After multidisciplinary evaluation, she was treated with corticosteroids and cyclosporine and healed fully with scarring over 7 weeks. She has required low-dose cyclosporine for 3 years to maintain remission of her genital ulceration; however, she remains well with no relapse of her lymphoma on serial imaging.

### Refractory postsurgical pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome: response to multimodal therapy [^1116KbCz]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that may be difficult to diagnose and treat. We presented a 41-year-old woman who required skin grafting following third-degree burns to her left breast. She suffered recurrent graft dehiscence and infections over many years, prompting elective bilateral reduction mammoplasty. She subsequently developed suture margin ulcerations unresponsive to topical therapies and antibiotics. Skin biopsies were non-specific, and a clinical diagnosis of PG was established. Although initially responsive to corticosteroids, wounds promptly recurred following steroid taper. She was treated unsuccessfully with various immunomodulatory agents and underwent elective bilateral mastectomy. Following a mastectomy, she developed progressive deep chest wall ulcerations. She failed numerous immunomodulatory treatments, surgical wound closure and negative pressure wound therapy. Ultimately, treatment with adalimumab, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone, in addition to hyperbaric oxygen therapy facilitated progressive healing. Our case highlights the role of collaborative multimodal therapy for the treatment of refractory PG.

### Management of facial pyoderma gangrenosum using platelet-rich fibrin: a technical report [^1118hsp2]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This report describes a case of local pyoderma gangrenosum that was treated with short-term immunosuppressive therapy and the topical application of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF). Medical treatment included oral corticosteroid therapy and topical treatment with PRF in solid and liquid form. This therapy initially led to the reduction of the ulcer's size and an improvement in symptoms, until the ulcer was completely healed after a few weeks. A relapse was treated with only the application of PRF to the affected tissue with excellent recovery. The efficacy of PRF as a guide for wound healing is a result of the continuous release of growth factors involved in tissue repair mechanisms. PRF has proved to be suitable for the management of facial pyoderma gangrenosum while allowing a reduction in systemic corticosteroid therapy. The ease of preparation, low cost, and outpatient use make PRF an optimal scaffold for tissue healing processes.

Figure 3
Pyoderma gangrenosum. Painful and irregularly shaped ulcers with violaceous edges

There are currently no standardized treatment guidelines for the management of PG. General supportive therapy and treatment of any concomitant disease have been the standard of care (Table 4).

Table 4
Treatments of pyoderma gangrenosum

Local care includes wet compresses with sterile saline solution or Ringer-lactate solution, diluted potassium permanganate solution (1:20000), silver sulphadiazine cream, topical antibacterial creams, and moist dressings (such as hydrocolloid, allograft, Vaseline gauze) to relieve pain, facilitate autolytic debridement, promote re-epithelialization, prevent infections and trauma, and minimize the resulting scar. Occlusive hydrocolloid dressings may also be helpful in superficial ulcers, but in case of purulent lesions, semiocclusive dressings are contraindicated.

Bioengineered skin dressings may be beneficial in covering ulcers and preventing the need for skin grafts.

Topical therapy is variable and includes intralesional corticosteroids, topical corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid, sodium cromoglycate, intralesional cyclosporine, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, benzoyl peroxide, nicotine patch, and nitrogen mustard. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF), human platelet-derived growth factor and perilesional use of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor have also been reported to be effective. Local irradiation of the lesions, electron beam therapy and hyperbaric oxygen, have also been employed. Topical therapy is most useful in early ulcers or if there are small isolated ulcers. It is usually ineffective as monotherapy, but it can support systemic medication.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: an updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^114eb8ne]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Classical Immunosuppressive and Immunomodulating Drugs

Systemic Corticosteroids (Level of Evidence 1B) [First-Line Treatment]

The anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids (CS) is attributed to their transcription-altering effects, and to NF-κB inhibition particularly, with subsequent downregulation of many proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules. The rapid onset of action has made systemic CS a first-line option in PG.

Treatment with systemic CS (dose 0.5–1 mg/kg/day) induces a clinical response in about 40–50% of cases, with widely variable complete response rates depending on associated systemic diseases and PG severity. Once healing has been reached, the CS dose can be tapered over a variable time period (4–6 weeks to 12–24 weeks), according to clinical course, comorbidities, and the risk of relapse. Pulse therapy with 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone for 3–5 consecutive days, followed by oral CS, may have a faster onset of action and may also help taper oral CS. As complete remission is achieved only in 40% and relapse prevention only in 20% of those with multi-lesional PG, it is recommended to combine systemic CS with immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory adjuvants in severe cases, with the most common agent being cyclosporine.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum induced by episiotomy [^111n15zB]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We present a patient who developed genital ulceration within hours following episiotomy procedure during a normal vaginal delivery. This was initially treated by the gynaecology and medical team as cellulitis with no improvement. A diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) was made by the dermatology team 12 days later. On further investigation, she was found to be hepatitis C positive. We report this case to highlight the phenomenon of pathergy and frequent misdiagnosis of PG by other medical teams. When a postsurgical wound is not healing despite relevant systemic treatment, the clinician should suspect PG as an early diagnosis and treatment is crucial.

### Case report: triple combination therapy for recalcitrant perineal pyoderma gangrenosum [^116bM3Lk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a destructive ulcerative process, which is usually idiopathic or associated with underlying systemic
disease. Its pathogenesis remains unknown. A 30-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease presented with an advanced perineal
and inguinal ulcer consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, which only partially responded to oral and intralesional corticosteroids and
adalimumab 80mg biweekly. The patient was started on adjunct combination cyclosporine and thalidomide, which resulted in prompt
relief and profound healing. Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum is often challenging with no standardized treatment protocols. Combination
therapy should be considered in patients with refractory disease, especially with failure of monotherapy.

### Guselkumab as a treatment option for recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum [^115aF8Yg]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PG should always be included in the differential diagnosis of a chronic ulcer that does not heal with conventional therapies. The Su et al criteria, The Delphi Consensus of International Experts, and PARACELSUS (Progressing disease, Assessment of relevant differential diagnoses, Reddish-violaceous wound border, Amelioration by immunosuppressant drugs, Characteristically irregular shape of ulceration, Extreme pain, Localization of lesion at the site of the trauma, Suppurative inflammation in histopathology, Undermined wound borders, and Systemic disease associated) score are helpful diagnostic tools. Criteria for diagnosis comprises the exclusion of other similar presenting disorders such as venous stasis ulcers, infectious processes, and malignancy. Additional diagnostic criteria includes a typical clinical presentation, histopathology findings, improvement with immunosuppressants, and a history of pathergy. The presence of an associated typical systemic disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, monoclonal gammopathy, or hematologic malignancy is helpful for diagnosis. Once a diagnosis is made, treatment presents a challenge because defined management is lacking in the literature.

Treatment modalities focus on local wound care, infection control, avoidance of pathergy, pain management, topical or intralesional steroids, oral immunosuppressants, and biologics. Case reports and expert opinions have mentioned prednisone, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and azathioprine as treatment options. Regarding biologic management, only one randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study has been performed, analyzing the efficacy of the biologic infliximab versus placebo, with support for the use of 5 mg/kg dosing regimen of infliximab.

More recently, the focus on PG treatment has been newer biologics. Genova et alevaluated a woman with PG on the lower extremity, which had failed topical therapy in addition to oral steroids. Upon evaluation of the tissue on biopsy, a marked increase in expression of IL23A was found when compared with healthy tissue. This prompted a trial of ustekinumab, which targets IL-12/23. Following 14 weeks of treatment, the lesion had healed completely. Since then, there have been other studies evaluating ustekinumab with promising results for the treatment of recalcitrant PG. In this case, the patient initially responded well to ustekinumab, but presumably developed neutralizing autoantibodies after 16 months of use. Fortunately, her PG responded to IL-23 blockade with guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-23 and currently indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum following breast reduction: treatment with topical tacrolimus and steroids [^114uvfjZ]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, noninfectious, inflammatory dermatosis usually associated with autoimmune disorders. Wounds may mimic a necrotizing infection, and the diagnosis is usually made after antibiotic therapy fails. Debridement may cause even larger wounds because of pathergy, so PG treatment consists of corticosteroids and local wound care. Pyoderma gangrenosum can be a devastating complication of breast and aesthetic surgery. We describe a case of PG following unilateral breast reduction that resulted in systemic inflammatory response; after treatment with prednisone and topical tacrolimus, the PG was resolved. The application of topical tacrolimus may reduce the need for prolonged corticosteroids.

### An unusual case of bilateral pyoderma gangrenosum with achilles tendon rupture [^117KHHms]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, noninfectious, inflammatory disease characterized by neutrophilic infiltration of the dermis and destruction of tissue. PG is a diagnostic challenge, which can lead to late diagnosis, delayed treatment and detrimental surgical interventions. We describe a presentation not previously reported, affecting deep muscle and tendon leading to tendon rupture. Furthermore, we show the multidisciplinary team approach to management of a patient with PG and the reconstructive surgical element. A 31-year-old woman presented with a rapid onset painful, tender, left calf and ankle, which was associated with a mild flare of ulcerative colitis. Investigations revealed a white cell count of 26 × 10⁹ cells L⁻¹, a C-reactive protein count of 226 mg L⁻¹, no deep vein thrombosis on ultrasound, no bone or joint involvement on X-ray and no organisms on joint aspirate. Debridement was undertaken after the left ankle developed a foul-smelling discharging wound. Repeat debridement led to worsening of the condition (pathergy). Intraoperative tissue cultures and microscopy showed no evidence of fungi, bacteria or mycobacteria. Histology showed granulation, inflammatory infiltrate, abscess formation and focal necrotizing vasculitis. Dermatology opinion confirmed PG. Awareness of the diagnosis of PG, and early involvement of dermatology, in a rapidly progressing wound is essential to avoid delayed treatment and prevent worsening through pathergy.

### Combination of mechanical debridement and interleukin 12 or interleukin 23 therapy for refractory facial pyoderma gangrenosum with NOD2 mutation [^114pZHTb]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that manifests as painful, nonhealing ulcers. The rarity of PG, combined with its variable clinical presentation, makes timely diagnosis challenging, and the lack of Food and Drug Administration approved therapies limits treatment options. The Th1/Th17, JAK/STAT, TNF-α, and interleukin (IL)12 or IL-23 pathways are implicated in PG pathogenesis and associated autoinflammatory comorbidities such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis and offer valuable insights into targeted PG treatment through off-label biologic therapy. Patient response to biological therapy remains variable, however, highlighting the crucial utility of genetic testing in both identifying genetic aspects of PG pathogenesis and guiding targeted PG treatment.

Introduction

The differential diagnosis of cutaneous ulcers is broad, including infection, neoplasm, vascular disease, trauma, and inflammatory processes such as pyoderma gangrenosum. Nodulo-ulcerative lesions on an extremity are a common presentation of sporotrichosis, an infection with a saprophytic dimorphic fungus. A high index of suspicion for infection is required when chronic ulcers do not respond to treatment.

### Recalcitrant cutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum with pulmonary involvement resolved with treatment of underlying plasma cell dyscrasia [^116EZrPP]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 51-year-old female presented with a history of three episodes of suspected PG over two years. She was initially evaluated at an emergency department in 2017 and was found to have rust-colored sputum and a presumed pneumonia. After she did not respond to antibiotics and her chest computed tomography images worsened, a transthoracic lung biopsy was performed revealing bronchocentric granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. Bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures were negative. She was noted to have a nasal septum perforation, which raised concern for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, but no vasculitis was seen on biopsy, and the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. The cutaneous site of her lung biopsy developed an ulcer that quickly expanded and was clinically diagnosed as PG (Fig 1). This required skin-grafting and pulse-dosed methylprednisolone before resolving. The pneumonitis also resolved with methylprednisolone. Months later, she again developed a progressive ulceration of her trunk (Fig 2). This ulcer again responded to pulse steroids and skin-grafting.

At presentation in our clinic, on her left anterior hip, she had a 1-cm erosion with yellowish exudate and granulation tissue with surrounding redness but no drainage or fluctuance (Fig 3). Intralesional triamcinolone 10 mg/cc was injected in the office along with a superficial bacterial culture which was negative for Staphylococcus aureus. Over several weeks, her ulcer grew, despite increasing doses of oral prednisone of up to 60 mg/day and cyclosporine 100 mg twice a day (Fig 4). Pulse IV methylprednisolone therapy was again required for control.

### Negative pressure dressing in the management of pyoderma gangrenosum ulcer… [^111pLiBb]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

No lymphadenopathy, fever, or other constitutional symptoms were observed. Partial response and intolerance to previous therapies including intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone, intralesional triamcinolone acetonide, intravenous immunoglobulin, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide was noted. Pyoderma gangrenosum ulcer at presentation, at first vacuum-assisted closure dressing change, and after 6 weeks of treatment with the VAC system. Therapeutic challenge Immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapy are the mainstay of management of PG ulcers. 1–5 The surgical management of active PG ulcers is discouraged owing to risk of pathergy-associated worsening. Unfortunately, some PG ulcers may take months or years to completely heal, even in patients with adequate medical therapy. Moreover, open wounds are more susceptible to infection, which can potentially act as a pathergy-triggering factor in PG ulcers.

Because of a history of partial response and intolerance and the potential risk of MRSA reinfection by immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents, a new rapidly acting therapeutic intervention to expedite healing was needed in our patient. Solution. Negative pressure dressing with the vacuum-assisted closure system was concurrently used with intravenous antibiotic therapy to accelerate healing of the ulcer. At the time of application of the VAC, the ulcer was completely filled with granulation tissue, there was no evidence of purulent drainage, and there was complete resolution of the erythematous-violaceous undermining borders. A polyurethane foam dressing was placed on the wound, followed by draping as per the manufacturer's instructions to create an airtight seal. Suction tubing was applied and connected to the therapy unit.

Intermittent therapy with 125 mm Hg of negative pressure was administered, with scheduled wound dressing changes every 48 hours. Comment The mainstay of therapy for PG is immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive medical therapy as well as management of possible underlying associated disease. 1–5 Surgical and other invasive modalities are contraindicated as the primary or sole treatment of active PG ulcers. However, some authors have described a role for adjunctive surgical management including skin grafts, muscle flaps, and cultured keratinocyte autografts concomitant with or preceding primary effective immunopharmacologic therapy in noninfected and controlled PG ulcers. 6–14.

202. doi: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2021.5001 A 24-year-old woman with Crohn disease developed painful ulcers with rapid deterioration on the left lower leg for 1 month along with intermittent fever and chills. She recalled a minor trauma on the left lower leg 1 month prior that occurred during a motor vehicle collision. It began as a painful coin-sized ulcerative wound and grew to have rapid clinical progression, expansion, and subsequent development of new lesions. Physical examination showed 2 large ulcerative plaques with ill-defined, violaceous, and undermined borders with cribriform scarring. Laboratory examination results showed mild leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein levels.

Antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels were within normal limits. Histopathological examination demonstrated a diffuse neutrophilic infiltrate accompanied by a few lymphocytes and eosinophils. There was no growth of bacteria, fungi, or mycobacteria from tissue cultures, leading to the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. The patient was treated with systemic prednisone, 20 mg, twice a day; azathioprine, 25 mg, daily; cyclosporine, 100 mg, daily; and mesalamine, 2000 mg, twice a day, for 3 months and experienced complete healing of skin lesions.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum, ectropion repair, and later lesion at graft site… [^113qS9sc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Report of a Case A woman in her 60s with no significant medical history presented with a nonhealing lesion on the left lower eyelid of more than 2 years' duration. The lesion began suddenly after the use of a concealer that caused burning on application. She had been treated initially by an oculoplastic surgeon with 3 30-day courses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Bacterial culture revealed Staphylococcus epidermidis, and fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative. The diagnosis of PG was favored. She was started on a dapsone regimen, 100 mg/d, but developed blue lips and jitteriness, and the dapsone treatment was stopped. She was then treated with oral prednisone taper over 4 weeks, starting at 40 mg and decreasing by 10 mg/wk, and topical tacrolimus, 0. 1%, ointment twice daily. After a month of this treatment, the lesion decreased in size, and treatment with methotrexate, 10 mg/wk, was started.

Over the subsequent month, the lesion healed leaving a residual scar with ectropion of the lower eyelid. Erythematous plaque with crust and rolled violaceous borders on initial presentation. She then underwent ectropion repair with grafting from the right clavicle. Immediately thereafter, she developed a painful ulceration at the graft site and was treated by the oculoplastic surgeon with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and topical erythromycin ointment. Examination 9 months later revealed superficial ulcerations with rolled violaceous borders at the site of the donor skin for the graft. Treatment with clobetasol, 0. 05%, topical ointment twice daily led to resolution of the ulceration within a month. Erythematous ulcerated plaques with violaceous rolled borders at ectropion repair graft site. Discussion. have been reported3, 5 and highlight the concern for formation of PG lesions at sites of surgical incisions, such as graft sites, coined postoperative PG.

6 Pathergy has been described in roughly 20% to 30% of patients with PG, 1 and given this risk, preoperative and postoperative immunosuppression with systemic corticosteroids has been recommended. Use of oral prednisone at the time of surgery might have prevented the development of the new ulceration in this patient.

### Present status of pyoderma gangrenosum… [^116ymDPJ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

This article summarizes the management of 22 cases of pyoderma gangrenosum over the past four years at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Eighteen patients with pyoderma gangrenosum were studied using the most sensitive routine laboratory method for detection of monoclonal immunoglobulins, immunofixation electrophoresis. Four cases of IgA gammopathy were detected, confirming previous reports of the incidence of monoclonal gammopathy in pyoderma gangrenosum. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy is an effective treatment for some severe, refractory cases of pyoderma gangrenosum. Eight patients were treated with pulse therapy. Six responded favorably, and none had serious complications. Prystowsky JH, Kahn SN, Lazarus GS. Present Status of Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Review of 21 Cases. Arch Dermatol. 1989; 125: 57–64.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum… [^111zcRWt]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with an acute exacerbation of his chronic ulcerative colitis is described. Attention is called to the dramatic response of the cutaneous ulcer to the use of intralesional steroid. Because of the infrequent occurrence of pyoderma gangrenosum, the lack of reports of the therapeutic efficacy of intralesional steroid, the dramatic result in the reported case, and the reported vasoconstrictive property of intralesional steroid, further use of this form of therapy is advocated to adequately establish its therapeutic value.
