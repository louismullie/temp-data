patello femoral syndrome

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about patellofemoral syndrome, specifically seeking a synthesis of its definition, diagnosis, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and risk factors. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and when to image. After that, I need to examine first-line management, especially exercise therapy and adjuncts. Finally, I will consider prognosis, special populations, and evidence gaps, and I will double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the condition. The preferred term is patellofemoral pain (PFP), historically called patellofemoral pain syndrome or "runner's knee", and it is defined by retropatellar or peripatellar pain aggravated by activities loading the patellofemoral joint in flexion, such as squatting, stairs, prolonged sitting, or running, with no structural cartilage defect on routine imaging, which distinguishes it from chondromalacia patellae [^130d4dc1] [^c081dddb] [^6dd237ea].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria before moving on. The clinical diagnosis rests on three pillars: pain around or behind the patella, reproduction of that pain with patellofemoral-loaded activities, and exclusion of other causes of anterior knee pain; the most sensitive physical exam maneuver is pain with squatting, and clinicians should also assess dynamic valgus and patellar mobility to contextualize management, while remembering that imaging is not required for diagnosis in typical cases [^130d4dc1] [^6b062f25] [^18bb9d5e].

> I need to check the pathophysiology and risk factors next. The dominant model is multifactorial, involving dynamic malalignment with excessive knee valgus, quadriceps imbalance, and hip abductor weakness, with contributions from foot mechanics and tissue-level nociception in the retinacula and Hoffa's fat pad; females are more often affected, likely due to higher prevalence of dynamic valgus, and symptoms can persist for years if not addressed, which underscores the need for targeted rehabilitation rather than passive modalities [^c081dddb] [^87491d8d] [^699d12a9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I should confirm when it is indicated. Routine imaging is not necessary for a classic, atraumatic presentation in patients under about 50 years; obtain radiographs if there was trauma, effusion, failure of conservative care, or suspicion of alternative pathology such as osteoarthritis, and reserve MRI for persistent symptoms with negative radiographs when internal derangement remains suspected or when surgical planning is needed [^a2341aef] [^3956e353] [^91552397].

> Next, I should review first-line management, and I need to ensure I anchor this to the highest-quality guidance. Exercise therapy is the cornerstone and should be prioritized over passive modalities; combined hip- and knee-targeted strengthening yields superior short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes compared with knee-only programs, with early emphasis on posterolateral hip musculature to address dynamic valgus and patellar maltracking, and progression should follow ACSM principles with individualized dosing and adherence support [^8d6e5e3d] [^c2ef8934] [^fed9e9df].

> Let me consider adjuncts carefully, because I should not overstate their benefit. Patellar taping can provide short-term pain relief and may enhance exercise adherence in the first 4 weeks, but it should not be used long term or as a stand-alone; prefabricated foot orthoses can reduce pain in the short term, particularly in patients with excessive pronation, and should be paired with exercise; knee braces and sleeves have not shown clinically meaningful benefit and are not routinely recommended; manual therapy in isolation should be avoided, though selective patellar mobilizations may be considered within a multimodal plan [^3ced20ab] [^12362482] [^071eea62] [^116c0804].

> I should double-check pharmacologic options and when they fit. Short courses of NSAIDs can be considered for pain relief, but they are adjuncts, not substitutes for exercise; evidence for NSAIDs is limited and mixed, so shared decision-making about risks and benefits is essential, and acetaminophen may be preferred when NSAIDs are contraindicated or not tolerated, acknowledging the lack of direct PFP-specific evidence for acetaminophen [^410af0a5] [^7ce9544b] [^1afe1727].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite structured rehabilitation? I need to ensure I outline escalation thoughtfully. If there is inadequate improvement after about 6 to 12 weeks of high-quality exercise therapy, consider adding taping or orthoses as a trial, reassess biomechanics and psychosocial drivers, and only consider surgical referral after at least 6 months of comprehensive conservative care; surgery is rarely indicated and should be reserved for identifiable structural pathology or refractory cases after shared decision-making, given variable outcomes and potential risks [^a8547560] [^bfb9345f] [^6b062f25].

> I will now examine prognosis and special populations, and I should verify the persistence data. Approximately 40% of patients still have symptoms at 2 years, and up to 90% may have symptoms at 4 years if not adequately managed, highlighting the importance of early, targeted rehabilitation and load management; adolescents and highly active individuals benefit from the same exercise-first approach, with attention to growth-related factors and sport-specific demands, and clinicians should screen for kinesiophobia and adherence barriers to optimize outcomes [^699d12a9] [^87491d8d] [^92230447].

> Let me reconsider the evidence quality so I don't overstate certainty. Much of the exercise literature is graded as low to very low quality due to heterogeneity and methodological limitations, yet multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on the same recommendation, and a living network meta-analysis suggests combined hip/knee exercise is among the most effective strategies despite low certainty; this means I should communicate benefits cautiously while emphasizing the strong consensus and the favorable risk–benefit profile of exercise compared with passive or invasive alternatives [^f3bd15fb] [^d2b19863] [^8d6e5e3d].

> Finally, I should confirm practical implementation details. Use validated patient-reported measures such as AKPS or KOOS-PF to track pain and function, classify patients into impairment-based categories to tailor exercise selection, and embed education on load management, activity modification, and adherence; reassess at 4 to 6 weeks to adjust the program and escalate only if goals are not being met, aligning with a patient-centered, shared decision-making approach [^b4062cf2] [^4d55d18e] [^ee33dc81].

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a clinical diagnosis [^130d4dc1] characterized by **anterior knee pain** aggravated by activities loading the patellofemoral joint (squatting, stairs, prolonged sitting) [^c5fbcfd1], with no structural cartilage damage on imaging [^c081dddb]. It is common in adolescents and young adults, especially females, and often reflects multifactorial biomechanical and neuromuscular contributors [^c081dddb]. Management is **conservative**, with exercise therapy — particularly combined hip and knee strengthening — as first-line [^8d6e5e3d] [^c2ef8934]; short-term NSAIDs, taping, or foot orthoses may be added if needed [^410af0a5] [^3ced20ab] [^12362482]. Imaging is not routine unless red flags or refractory cases arise [^a2341aef] [^3956e353]. Prognosis varies: many improve with therapy, but symptoms can persist or recur without adherence [^699d12a9] [^87491d8d].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

- **Pain location**: Retropatellar or peripatellar, worsened by squatting, stairs, prolonged sitting, or running [^130d4dc1] [^c5fbcfd1].
- **Physical exam**: Pain with squatting is ~91% sensitive and ~50% specific; assess patellar mobility, hip/knee strength, and dynamic valgus [^6b062f25] [^18bb9d5e].
- **Imaging**: Not required for diagnosis; consider radiographs if trauma, effusion, age > 50, or refractory symptoms [^a2341aef] [^3956e353].

---

## Pathophysiology and risk factors

PFPS is **multifactorial**, with contributions from:

- **Biomechanical factors**: Patellar maltracking, dynamic valgus, excessive Q-angle, foot pronation [^c081dddb] [^2060b5e8].
- **Neuromuscular factors**: Quadriceps imbalance, hip abductor weakness, poor neuromuscular control [^c081dddb] [^b330bb15].
- **Overuse**: Repetitive loading beyond tissue capacity, especially in runners and athletes [^c081dddb] [^d3ba3086].

---

## Management

### Conservative management (first-line)

- **Exercise therapy**: Combined hip and knee strengthening is superior to knee-only programs; prioritize hip abductor/external rotator and quadriceps strengthening [^8d6e5e3d] [^c2ef8934] [^10569abb].
- **Adjuncts**: Short-term NSAIDs, patellar taping, or foot orthoses may reduce pain and improve adherence to exercise [^410af0a5] [^3ced20ab] [^12362482].
- **Education**: Load management, activity modification, and adherence strategies are essential [^92230447] [^17ca8730].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is **reserved for refractory cases** after ≥ 6 months of conservative care and confirmed structural abnormalities; outcomes are variable and unpredictable [^bfb9345f] [^a2341aef].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **variable**: many patients improve with conservative therapy, but 40% have persistent symptoms at 2 years and 90% at 4 years if undertreated; recurrence is common without adherence [^699d12a9] [^87491d8d].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **addressing modifiable risk factors** through:

- **Neuromuscular training**: Emphasizing hip and core strengthening, and movement pattern retraining [^c2ef8934] [^4d55d18e].
- **Load management**: Gradual progression of activity and avoidance of sudden spikes in training volume [^92230447].
- **Footwear**: Appropriate shoes and, when indicated, orthoses to correct excessive pronation [^12362482].

---

PFPS is a common, multifactorial anterior knee pain syndrome with a **conservative-first approach** centered on combined hip and knee strengthening; most patients improve with adherence, but symptoms can persist without targeted rehabilitation.

Background

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common knee problem, which particularly affects adolescents and young adults. PFPS, which is characterised by retropatellar (behind the kneecap) or peripatellar (around the kneecap) pain, is often referred to as anterior knee pain. The pain mostly occurs when load is put on the knee extensor mechanism when climbing stairs, squatting, running, cycling or sitting with flexed knees. Exercise therapy is often prescribed for this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of exercise therapy aimed at reducing knee pain and improving knee function for people with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (May 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 Week 20), PEDro (to June 2014), CINAHL (1982 to May 2014) and AMED (1985 to May 2014), trial registers (to June 2014) and conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effect of exercise therapy on pain, function and recovery in adolescents and adults with patellofemoral pain syndrome. We included comparisons of exercise therapy versus control (e.g. no treatment) or versus another non-surgical therapy; or of different exercises or exercise programmes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials based on pre-defined inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where appropriate, we pooled data using either fixed-effect or random-effects methods. We selected the following seven outcomes for summarising the available evidence: pain during activity (short-term: ≤ 3 months); usual pain (short-term); pain during activity (long-term: > 3 months); usual pain (long-term); functional ability (short-term); functional ability (long-term); and recovery (long-term).

Main Results

In total, 31 heterogeneous trials including 1690 participants with patellofemoral pain are included in this review. There was considerable between-study variation in patient characteristics (e.g. activity level) and diagnostic criteria for study inclusion (e.g. minimum duration of symptoms) and exercise therapy. Eight trials, six of which were quasi-randomised, were at high risk of selection bias. We assessed most trials as being at high risk of performance bias and detection bias, which resulted from lack of blinding. The included studies, some of which contributed to more than one comparison, provided evidence for the following comparisons: exercise therapy versus control (10 trials); exercise therapy versus other conservative interventions (e.g. taping; eight trials evaluating different interventions); and different exercises or exercise programmes. The latter group comprised: supervised versus home exercises (two trials); closed kinetic chain (KC) versus open KC exercises (four trials); variants of closed KC exercises (two trials making different comparisons); other comparisons of other types of KC or miscellaneous exercises (five trials evaluating different interventions); hip and knee versus knee exercises (seven trials); hip versus knee exercises (two studies); and high- versus low-intensity exercises (one study). There were no trials testing exercise medium (land versus water) or duration of exercises. Where available, the evidence for each of seven main outcomes for all comparisons was of very low quality, generally due to serious flaws in design and small numbers of participants. This means that we are very unsure about the estimates. The evidence for the two largest comparisons is summarised here. Exercise versus control. Pooled data from five studies (375 participants) for pain during activity (short-term) favoured exercise therapy: mean difference (MD) -1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.39 to -0.54. The CI included the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 1.3 (scale 0 to 10), indicating the possibility of a clinically important reduction in pain. The same finding applied for usual pain (short-term; two studies, 41 participants), pain during activity (long-term; two studies, 180 participants) and usual pain (long-term; one study, 94 participants). Pooled data from seven studies (483 participants) for functional ability (short-term) also favoured exercise therapy; standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.10, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.63. Re-expressed in terms of the Anterior Knee Pain Score (AKPS; 0 to 100), this result (estimated MD 12.21 higher, 95% CI 6.44 to 18.09 higher) included the MCID of 10.0, indicating the possibility of a clinically important improvement in function. The same finding applied for functional ability (long-term; three studies, 274 participants). Pooled data (two studies, 166 participants) indicated that, based on the 'recovery' of 250 per 1000 in the control group, 88 more (95% CI 2 fewer to 210 more) participants per 1000 recovered in the long term (12 months) as a result of exercise therapy. Hip plus knee versus knee exercises. Pooled data from three studies (104 participants) for pain during activity (short-term) favoured hip and knee exercise: MD -2.20, 95% CI -3.80 to -0.60; the CI included a clinically important effect. The same applied for usual pain (short-term; two studies, 46 participants). One study (49 participants) found a clinically important reduction in pain during activity (long-term) for hip and knee exercise. Although tending to favour hip and knee exercises, the evidence for functional ability (short-term; four studies, 174 participants; and long-term; two studies, 78 participants) and recovery (one study, 29 participants) did not show that either approach was superior.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has found very low quality but consistent evidence that exercise therapy for PFPS may result in clinically important reduction in pain and improvement in functional ability, as well as enhancing long-term recovery. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine the best form of exercise therapy and it is unknown whether this result would apply to all people with PFPS. There is some very low quality evidence that hip plus knee exercises may be more effective in reducing pain than knee exercise alone. Further randomised trials are warranted but in order to optimise research effort and engender the large multicentre randomised trials that are required to inform practice, these should be preceded by research that aims to identify priority questions and attain agreement and, where practical, standardisation regarding diagnostic criteria and measurement of outcome.

### Patellofemoral pain syndrome… [^c081dddb]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Definition A 2016 consensus statement defines PFPS as pain occurring around or behind the patella that is aggravated by at least one activity that loads the patella during weight-bearing on a flexed knee. 4 Contributing activities include running, climbing stairs, jumping, and squatting. PFPS is also called runner's knee and anterior knee pain syndrome. 4 Although the term PFPS was formerly used interchangeably with chondromalacia patellae, the latter specifically refers to the finding of softened patellofemoral cartilage on plain radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or knee arthroscopy. 6 Conversely, structural defects are absent in PFPS, and imaging is not required for the diagnosis. Anatomy and Pathophysiology The patellofemoral joint consists of the patella and the trochlea of the femur and is important in knee extension and deceleration.
10. The Q angle is approximately 14 degrees in men and 17 degrees in women.

12 Because lateral forces on the patella are increased with higher Q angles, it has long been thought that a high Q angle increases the risk of PFPS; however, a higher Q angle has not been shown to be a clear contributing cause of PFPS in more recent research. 12–14. Patellar maltracking is believed to play a role in PFPS. Patellar maltracking, or lateral translation, increases with load-bearing positions, such as squatting, in patients with PFPS. Stimulation of nerve endings within the retinacula, Hoffa fat pad, and peripatellar synovium may also contribute to the development of PFPS.
15. |Quadriceps weakness| Dynamic valgus is another mechanism associated with PFPS. Dynamic valgus is a body position in which the knee collapses medially from excessive valgus, internal-external rotation, or both. 18 This increases the lateral force on the patella, contributing to maltracking.

Dynamic valgus is more common in female athletes, which may account for the higher incidence of PFPS in females. 19 Foot abnormalities, such as rearfoot eversion and pes pronatus, lead to internal rotation of the tibia, which can also contribute to dynamic valgus.
20. Treatment Treatment of PFPS should focus on early pain relief. 27 Relative rest, ice, and analgesics are recommended to reduce pain, but physical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment.

### Management of patellofemoral pain syndrome [^a2341aef]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common cause of knee pain in the outpatient setting. It is caused by imbalances in the forces controlling patellar tracking during knee flexion and extension, particularly with overloading of the joint. Risk factors include overuse, trauma, muscle dysfunction, tight lateral restraints, patellar hypermobility, and poor quadriceps flexibility. Typical symptoms include pain behind or around the patella that is increased with running and activities that involve knee flexion. Findings in patients with PFPS range from limited patellar mobility to a hypermobile patella. To confirm the diagnosis, an examination of the knee focusing on the patella and surrounding structures is essential. For many patients with the clinical diagnosis of PFPS, imaging studies are not necessary before beginning treatment. Radiography is recommended in patients with a history of trauma or surgery, those with an effusion, those older than 50 years (to rule out osteoarthritis), and those whose pain does not improve with treatment. Recent research has shown that physical therapy is effective in treating PFPS. There is little evidence to support the routine use of knee braces or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgery should be considered only after failure of a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Educating patients about modification of risk factors is important in preventing recurrence.

### Treatment… [^d3ba3086]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome can be defined as retropatellar or peripatellar pain resulting from physical and biochemical changes in the patellofemoral joint. It should be distinguished from chondromalacia, which is actual fraying and damage to the underlying patellar cartilage. Patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome have anterior knee pain that typically occurs with activity and often worsens when they are descending steps or hills. It can also be triggered by prolonged sitting. One or both knees can be affected. Consensus is lacking regarding the cause and treatment of the syndrome.

1. 2, 3 Repetitive contact at any of these areas, sometimes combined with maltracking of the patella that is often not detectable by the naked eye, is the likely mechanism of patellofemoral pain syndrome. The result is the classic presentation of retropatellar and peripatellar pain. This pain should not be confused with pain that occurs directly on the patellar tendon.

Many theories have been proposed to explain the etiology of patellofemoral pain. These include biomechanical, muscular and overuse theories. In general, the literature and clinical experience suggest that the etiology of patellofemoral pain syndrome is multifactorial. 4–8 However, a more appropriate term may be "overload, " because the syndrome can also affect inactive patients. Repeated weight-bearing impact may be a contributing factor, particularly in runners. 3 Steps, hills and uneven surfaces tend to exacerbate patellofemoral pain. Once the syndrome has developed, even prolonged sitting can be painful because of the extra pressure between the patella and the femur during knee flexion. SURGERY Surgery for patellofemoral pain syndrome is considered a last resort. True chondromalacia may be amenable to an arthroscopic surgical procedure to smooth out the undersurface of the patella.

35 Unfortunately, the chondromalacia may return. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS An initial conservative approach to patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome should include the following measures: relative rest with consideration of a temporary change to nonimpact aerobic activity; quadriceps strengthening; evaluation of footwear; and icing, especially after activity.

Regarding patient education for patellofemoral pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to general counseling, APTA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider providing specific patient education on load management, body-weight management when appropriate, the importance of adherence to active treatments like exercise therapy, biomechanics contributing to relative overload of the patellofemoral joint, the evidence for various treatment options, and kinesiophobia, to improve compliance and adherence to active management and self-management strategies.

### Patellofemoral pain [^4cee7efc]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain refers to pain behind or around the patella (also known as patellofemoral pain syndrome, anterior knee pain, runner's knee, and, formerly, chondromalacia patellae). Patellofemoral pain is common, accounting for 11–17% of all knee pain presentations to general practice.(1 2) While it typically occurs in physically active people aged < 40 years, it also affects people of all activity levels and ages.(1 2) Patellofemoral pain can be diagnosed in the clinic, and evidence based treatments can reduce pain and improve function, allowing patients to maintain a physically active lifestyle.

Discussion

The International Patellofemoral Research Retreat Consensus meeting resulted in six evidence-based recommendations. These recommendations will guide medical and health practitioners when they treat patients with patellofemoral pain. Recommendations may also be taken up by patients, other care providers, and government agencies and other organisations responsible for funding patellofemoral pain treatment. The recommendations are not intended to standardise patient care, but to be used in combination with individualised assessments of patient's needs, preferences and presentations, and clinical expertise to inform patient-centred management.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) — clinical signs, categorization, and psychosocial factors guide care, as "Clinical signs and symptoms have typically guided the clinical decision making of treatment interventions". These findings "guide the clinician to classify the patient with one of the proposed impairment-based categories of PFP". Given tissue stress tolerance, "clinicians should match the most appropriate intervention strategies to the irritability level of the patient's condition", and "clinicians should consider influences from psychosocial factors in patients with conditions in all stages of recovery".

Patellofemoral pain is characterized by insidious onset anterior knee pain that is exaggerated under conditions of increased patellofemoral joint stress. A variety of risk factors may contribute to the development of patellofemoral pain. It is critical that the history and physical examination elucidate those risk factors specific to an individual in order to prescribe an appropriate and customized treatment plan. This article aims to review the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of patellofemoral pain.

### Patellofemoral pain [^8d6e5e3d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for patellofemoral pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to physical therapy, APTA 2019 guidelines recommend to offer exercise therapy with combined hip-targeted (targeting posterolateral hip musculature) and knee-targeted exercises (either weight-bearing exercises, such as resisted squats, or non-weight-bearing exercises, such as resisted knee extension; as both exercise techniques target the knee musculature) to reduce pain and improve patient-reported outcomes and functional performance in the short, medium, and long term. Prefer a combination of hip- and knee-targeted exercises over solely knee-targeted exercises to optimize outcomes. Consider preferring hip-targeted exercise over knee-targeted exercise in the early stages of treatment.

### Supervised exercise therapy versus usual care for patellofemoral pain syndrome: an open label randomised controlled trial [^ac7d976c]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Patellofemoral pain syndrome can be defined as pain around the patella that occurs during or after high loaded flexion and extension of the knee. The main symptom is pain, and the condition generally progresses to impaired function. Physicians, especially general practitioners (GPs) and sport physicians, are frequently confronted with patients who have patellofemoral pain syndrome. Although there are no precise epidemiological data, an average GP practice in the Netherlands reports about five or six new cases a year. In sport medicine practices, patellofemoral pain syndrome comprises up to 25% of all new running injuries. Women are more likely to be affected than men. Pain usually starts during adolescence when participation in sporting activities is high, although symptoms can occur over a prolonged period of time. Extensive diagnostic investigations do not yield specific pathology.

There is no agreement concerning the aetiology of patellofemoral pain syndrome or the most appropriate treatment. There is, however, general consensus that the preferred treatment approach is non-surgical. Rest during periods of pain and refraining from pain provoking activities are advised; this "wait and see" approach is advocated in the Dutch national GP guidelines and is considered usual care.

An active approach to treating patellofemoral pain syndrome has been advocated since the 1990s. Strategies range from simple quadriceps strengthening to more complex exercise therapy including taping or bracing. According to a systematic review on the benefits of exercise therapy for patellofemoral pain syndrome, there is only limited evidence that exercise is more effective than no exercise with respect to pain reduction. Furthermore, the evidence as to whether exercise provides functional improvement is conflicting.

The objective of the present study was to investigate in the short term as well as in the long term the effects of exercise therapy compared with usual care in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

### Patellofemoral syndrome a paradigm for current surgical strategies [^1b151625]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The literature regarding suggested treatments for patellofemoral problems is often conflicting and confusing. In this discussion I present the approach I take in evaluating and considering surgery for patients with any of a wide variety of anterior knee pain problems. It has been useful to concentrate on the biomechanics — the mechanical consequence to each tissue affected by any surgical change. In the proposed paradigm, it is assumed that pain is the result of an abnormal load — related either to tension or compression — being applied to each tissue in question. The challenge is to understand how and why that abnormal load was generated. It is essential to make an independent assessment of the condition of the lower limb skeleton, the patellofemoral ligaments, and the trochlear and patellar articular cartilage in each patient. While only a long book can address this subject in detail, this discussion provides a guide for formulating an analysis of the key issues when planning the operative treatment of patellofemoral pain and dysfunction.

Kneecap pain, also known as anterior knee pain or patellofemoral pain, is the most common injury seen in sports medicine clinics. The goal of the clinical practice guidelines on patellofemoral pain, published in the September 2019 issue of the JOSPT, was to make recommendations based on best scientific evidence that help clinicians and patients make decisions about managing this pain. Clinicians can use these guidelines to combine the latest scientific evidence with their clinical expertise and the preferences of the patient to develop a tailored management plan.

### Pharmacotherapy for patellofemoral pain syndrome [^7ce9544b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is common among adolescents and young adults. It is characterised by pain behind or around the patella and crepitations, provoked by ascending or descending stairs, squatting, prolonged sitting with flexed knees, running and cycling. The symptoms impede function in daily activities or sports. Pharmacological treatments focus on reducing pain symptoms (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticosteroids), or restoring the assumed underlying pathology (compounds containing glucosamine to stimulate cartilage metabolism, anabolic steroids to increase bone density of the patella and build up supporting muscles). In studies, drugs are usually applied in addition to exercises aimed at building up supporting musculature.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the evidence of effectiveness of pharmacotherapy in reducing anterior knee pain and improving knee function in people with PFPS.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group and Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field trials registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2003), PEDro (up to January 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1988 to January 2004), and CINAHL (1982 to January 2004).

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials (randomised or not) comparing pharmacotherapy with placebo, different types of pharmacotherapy, or pharmacotherapy to other therapies for people with PFPS.

Data Collection and Analysis

The literature search yielded 780 publications. Eight trials were included, of which three were of high quality. Data were analysed qualitatively using best evidence synthesis, because meta-analysis was impeded by differences in route of administration of drugs, care programs and outcome measures.

Main Results

Four trials (163 participants) studied the effect of NSAIDs. Aspirin compared to placebo in a high quality trial produced no significant differences in clinical symptoms and signs. Naproxen produced significant short term pain reduction when compared to placebo, but not when compared to diflunisal. Laser therapy to stimulate blood flow in tender areas led to more satisfied participants than tenoxicam, though not significantly. Two high quality RCTs (84 participants) studied the effect of glycosaminoglycan polysulphate (GAGPS). Twelve intramuscular injections in six weeks led to significantly more participants with a good overall therapeutic effect after one year, and to significantly better pain reduction during one of two activities. Five weekly intra-articular injections of GAGPS and lidocaine were compared with intra-articular injections of saline and lidocaine or no injections, all with concurrent quadriceps training. Injected participants showed better function after six weeks, though only the difference between GAGPS injected participants and non-injected participants was significant. The differences had disappeared after one year. One trial (43 participants) found that intramuscular injections of the anabolic steroid nandrolone phenylpropionate significantly improved both pain and function compared to placebo injections.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is only limited evidence for the effectiveness of NSAIDs for short term pain reduction in PFPS. The evidence for the effect of glycosaminoglycan polysulphate is conflicting and merits further investigation. The anabolic steroid nandrolone may be effective, but is too controversial for treatment of PFPS.

### Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for patellofemoral pain syndrome [^3826b719]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain syndrome, now generally referred to as patellofemoral pain (PFP), is one of the most common orthopaedic disorders, characterised by pain in the anterior or retropatellar knee region. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been proposed generally as a complementary treatment, associated with other interventions such as exercise, or as a single treatment to increase muscle force, reduce knee pain, and improve function.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of neuromuscular electrical stimulation for people with patellofemoral pain.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, AMED, LILACS, trial registers, conference abstracts, and reference lists. We carried out the search in May 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled clinical trials that evaluated the use of NMES for people with PFP.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed the process of study selection, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment in duplicate. The primary outcomes were knee pain, knee function, and adverse events. The timing of outcome measurements was up to three months (short term), three to 12 months (medium term), and 12 months and above from trial entry (long term). We calculated risk ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences or standardised mean differences for continuous data. Where appropriate, we pooled data using the fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight randomised clinical trials, reporting results for 345 participants with PFP. The mean ages of trial populations ranged from 25 to 43 years, and the majority (53% to 100%) of participants were female. There was a wide duration of symptoms, with the minimum duration of symptoms for trial inclusion ranging from one to six months. In addition to the study inclusion criteria, studies varied widely in the characteristics of the NMES and its application, and associated co-interventions. We assessed all trials as at high risk of bias in at least one domain, particularly blinding and incomplete outcome data. The results of a laboratory-based trial reporting knee pain immediately after a single 15-minute session of NMES are not reported here as these are of questionable clinical relevance. The seven remaining trials provided evidence for three comparisons. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence, using GRADE, for all primary outcomes for all comparisons as very low, thus we are very unsure of the findings. Four studies compared NMES plus exercise versus exercise alone. Patellar taping was applied as well as exercise to all participants of one study, and patellar taping and ice were also applied in another study. Each trial tested a different multiple-session NMES programme. Pooled data from three studies (118 participants) provided very low-quality evidence that NMES is associated with reduced pain at the end of treatment (ranging from 3 to 12 weeks): mean difference -1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.23 to -1.02; visual analogue scale (VAS) 0 to 10; higher scores = worse pain. However, this result may not be clinically relevant since the minimal clinically important difference for VAS during activities (1.5 to 2.0, out of 10 points) lies within the 95% CI. We found very low-quality evidence from pooled data from two trials of little effect of NMES on knee function, as measured by two knee function rating systems. We found inconclusive and very low-quality evidence from one trial (29 participants) of little effect of NMES on pain and function at one-year follow-up. None of the four trials reported on adverse effects of treatment. One study (94 participants) compared NMES, applied four hours per day on a daily basis for four weeks, with two types of exercises (isometric and isokinetic). The study did not report on knee pain or adverse events. The study provided very low-quality evidence of no important difference between the two groups in knee function at the end of the four-week treatment. Of note is the potentially onerous NMES schedule in this study, which does not correspond to that typically used in clinical practice. Two studies compared different types of NMES. Simultaneously delivered high-low frequencies NMES was compared with sequentially delivered high-low frequencies NMES in one trial (14 participants) and with fixed frequency NMES in the second trial (64 participants). The studies provided very low-quality evidence of no important differences at the end of the six-week treatment programme between the simultaneous frequencies NMES and the two other NMES programmes in overall knee pain, knee function, or in quadriceps fatigue (an adverse event).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found insufficient and inconclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform on the role of NMES for treating people with PFP in current clinical practice. The very low-quality evidence available means that we are uncertain whether or not a multiple-session programme of NMES combined with exercise over several weeks versus exercise alone results in clinically important differences in knee pain and function at the end of the treatment period or at one year. There were no data on adverse effects such as muscle fatigue and discomfort. High-quality randomised clinical trials are needed to inform on the use of NMES for people with PFP. However, professional and stakeholder consensus is required on prioritisation of the research questions for interventions for treating people with PFP, including on the NMES treatment protocol for trials testing NMES.

### Patellofemoral pain [^fed9e9df]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) — limitations and future directions note research gaps and offer practice guidance. The guideline states, "More research is needed to determine whether any long-term differences in pain or PROMs occur in patients with PFP who receive either hip- or knee-targeted exercise therapy", and also that "a standardized approach is needed for future research when delineating either knee- or hip-targeted exercise". In current practice, "clinicians treating PFP are encouraged to use accepted exercise prescription principles, as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine, to guide exercise prescription targeting the hip and knee, based on individual deficits identified in each patient", and "the treating clinician should assess, consider, and address appropriate neuromotor control, along with muscular endurance, strength, and power". Although "there is little evidence for a validated approach", "the physical therapist is encouraged to use clinical reasoning to target interventions toward individuals when possible, and to use a shared decision-making process during plan-of-care development".

Methods

Literature review

CJB searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Current Contents for systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2010 and June 2015. To be eligible, publications were (i) the most current systematic reviews including meta-analyses and (ii) any RCTs published subsequent to the most recent systematic review.

Search terms used to search titles and abstracts of papers relating to patellofemoral pain in each database were (patella or patellofemoral) and (pain or syndrome or dysfunction). To narrow the search to identify systematic reviews, these diagnostic terms were combined with the keyword review.

To narrow the search to identify any contemporary randomised trials, diagnostic terms were combined with (controlled trial or clinical trial) and additional searching was completed in the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). Additionally, all authors on this consensus statement were consulted to identify any missing papers. To be included, randomised trials were required to evaluate one or more conservative intervention compared with a control or alternative conservative intervention, using an outcome measure related to pain (eg, pain visual analogue scale (VAS)) or patient-reported improvement, and using a randomised method for group allocation.

Data were extracted from each included paper. Where multiple systematic reviews were available for the same intervention from the same time period, findings from moderate–high quality reviews were used in preference to low-quality reviews. If no systematic reviews were available, all published RCTs related to the intervention were included. Findings from included reviews and trials were used to generate a summary table, which included study methodology, relevant outcomes and effect sizes.

The methodological quality of meta-analyses and systematic reviews was graded with the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool; and RCTs were graded with the PEDro rating scale. Rating was completed by two independent reviewers (CJB and MvM), and discrepancies resolved through a consensus meeting. A third reviewer (KMC) was available to settle any disagreement but was not required.

Quality of evidence

For systematic reviews, the following allocation was applied based on AMSTAR scores:
High quality (HQ): ≥ 7
Moderate quality (MQ): 4–6
Low quality (LQ): ≤ 3

For RCTs, the following allocation was applied based on PEDro scores:
High quality (HQ): ≥ 7
Moderate quality (MQ): 4–6
Low quality (LQ): ≤ 3

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^224858bf]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This guideline recommends starting with exercise therapy for PFP and PT. Additional conservative treatments are only indicated in the absence of clinically relevant changes and pain medications should be reserved for patients with severe pain. The additional value of imaging assessments for PT is limited. Open surgery may play a role in very specific cases. The recommendations in this guideline facilitate clinical decision‐making for healthcare providers in both primary and secondary care and thereby optimizing treatment and preventing unnecessary burdens, risks and costs to patients and society.

Strengths and weaknesses of this study

There was an overall lack of high-quality, large studies, with only one study including > 100 subjects per trial arm. Small trials with varying quality predominate in the field of musculoskeletal health. To ensure, we included credible research to inform the NMA we only included research where (1) patients had the condition for ≥ 6 weeks, and (2) studies included relevant patient-rated outcomes and follow-ups (≥ 6 weeks). As a result, we excluded 128 RCTs. While the comparisons in those studies could add value to the body of knowledge, these were not evaluated by the patient — which is considered the gold standard of outcome measurement by WHO, and 'essential' by Cochrane. Consensus on which outcomes to use in RCTs through the development of a core outcome set has the potential to move the field of PFP forward. In our study, patients were involved in prioritising our outcomes making our results relevant to patients and clinical practice. We performed a comprehensive search covering published and unpublished studies, state-of-the-art risk of bias and GRADE assessments. We synthesised evidence in Bayesian hierarchical NMAs to optimally use all evidence to determine which treatment is best for PFP.

Limitations in the conclusions drawn by the NMA are primarily caused by the original data. Overall evidence was graded as very low to low. There was no evidence of heterogeneity between studies with fixed effect models preferred over random effects models based on model fit; however, this may be due to the limited number of studies available per comparison. Consistency between direct and indirect evidence could not be checked for all comparisons in the NMAs. However, where this was possible, by comparing consistency models to models that relaxed the consistency assumption, we did not find evidence of inconsistency. Treatment outcomes may be different on the basis of some characteristics (ie, effect modification). Lankhorst et al suggested that sex and symptom duration may be effect modifiers in the relationship between exercise and function at 3 months, but no significant association was found. As there is no good evidence for any potential effect modifier, we did not include potential effect modifiers when planning the synthesis. This is a limitation that can be overcome in the future when new evidence for effect modifiers becomes available. Studies should break down their results on the basis of potential effect modifiers, such as sex and duration of symptoms, which would allow exploring modification effects in the future.

### Clinical classification of patellofemoral pain syndrome: guidelines for non-operative treatment [^af34e074]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2005). Low credibility.

The patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) remains a challenging musculoskeletal entity encountered by clinicians. Reviewing the literature, conflicting data seem to exist regarding the effect of non-operative treatment in PFPS patients. A possible explanation may be lack of a clear classification system of patients with PFPS. It is our opinion that the term PFPS still is a 'wastebasket', which probably comprises several different entities. Therefore, it seems important to subdivide this broad group of patients into different categories with a specific rehabilitation approach. In this study, we introduce a classification system, which reflects a consensus reached by the European Rehabilitation Panel. This classification system should help the clinicians to identify the cause(s) of patellofemoral pain, and consequently help to select the most appropriate non-operative treatment. The authors are aware that no rehabilitation protocol will work for all PFPS patients, since the underlying mosaic of pathophysiology and tissue-healing responses are unique. Therefore, the aim of this study with a classification system was to guide the clinician through clinical examination in order to develop a non-operative treatment protocol, specific for each individual with PFPS.

### Patellofemoral pain syndrome [^97d5190d]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is one of the most common causes of anterior knee pain encountered in the outpatient setting in adolescents and adults younger than 60 years. The incidence in the United States is between 3% and 6%. The cardinal feature of PFPS is pain in or around the anterior knee that intensifies when the knee is flexed during weight-bearing activities. The pain of PFPS often worsens with prolonged sitting or descending stairs. The most sensitive physical examination finding is pain with squatting. Examining a patient's gait, posture, and footwear can help identify contributing causes. Plain radiographs of the knee are not necessary for the diagnosis of PFPS but can exclude other diagnoses, such as osteoarthritis, patellar fracture, and osteochondritis. If conservative treatment measures are unsuccessful, plain radiography is recommended. Treatment of PFPS includes rest, a short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy directed at strengthening the hip flexor, trunk, and knee muscle groups. Patellar kinesiotaping may provide additional short-term pain relief; however, evidence is insufficient to support its routine use. Surgery is considered a last resort.

### Knee orthoses for treating patellofemoral pain syndrome [^0e42fbe6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a painful musculoskeletal condition, which is characterised by knee pain located in the anterior aspect (front) and retropatellar region (behind) of the knee joint. Various non-operative interventions are suggested for the treatment of this condition. Knee orthoses (knee braces, sleeves, straps or bandages) are worn over the knee and are thought to help reduce knee pain. They can be used in isolation or in addition to other treatments such as exercise or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of knee orthoses (knee braces, sleeves, straps or bandages) for treating PFPS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (11 May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015 Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 8 May 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 2015 Week 18), SPORTDiscus (1985 to 11 May 2015), AMED (1985 to 8 May 2015), CINAHL (1937 to 11 May 2015), PEDro (1929 to June 2015), trial registries and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating knee orthoses for treating people with PFPS. Our primary outcomes were pain and function.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, assessed study risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated mean differences (MD) or, where pooling data from different scales, standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs for binary outcomes. We pooled data using the fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included five trials (one of which was quasi-randomised) that reported results for 368 people who had PFPS. Participants were recruited from health clinics in three trials and were military recruits undergoing training in the other two trials. Although no trials recruited participants who were categorised as elite or professional athletes, military training does comprise intensive exercise regimens. All five trials were at high risk of bias, including performance bias reflecting the logistical problems in these trials of blinding of participants and care providers. As assessed using the GRADE approach, the available evidence for all reported outcomes is 'very low' quality. This means that we are very uncertain about the results. The trials covered three different types of comparison: knee orthosis and exercises versus exercises alone; one type of orthosis versus another; and knee orthosis versus exercises. No trials assessed the mode of knee orthosis use, such as whether the orthosis was worn all day or only during physical activity. Two trials had two groups; two trials had three groups; and one trial had four groups. All five trials compared a knee orthosis (knee sleeve, knee brace, or patellar strap) versus a 'no treatment' control group, with all participants receiving exercises, either through a military training programme or a home-based exercise programme. There is very low quality evidence of no clinically important differences between the two groups in short-term (2 to 12 weeks follow-up) knee pain based on the visual analogue scale (0 to 10 points; higher scores mean worse pain): MD -0.46 favouring knee orthoses, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.24; P = 0.19; 234 participants, 3 trials). A similar lack of clinically important difference was found for knee function (183 participants, 2 trials). None of the trials reported on quality of life measures, resource use or participant satisfaction. Although two trials reported on the impact on sporting or occupational participation, one trial (35 participants) did not provide data split by treatment group on the resumption of sport activity and the other reported only on abandonment of military training due to knee pain (both cases were allocated a knee orthosis). One trial (59 participants, 84 affected knees) recording only adverse events in the two knee orthoses (both were knee sleeves) groups, reported 16 knees (36% of 44 knees) had discomfort or skin abrasion. Three trials provided very low quality evidence on single comparisons of different types of knee orthoses: a knee brace versus a knee sleeve (63 participants), a patella strap with a knee sleeve (31 participants), and a knee sleeve with a patellar ring versus a knee sleeve only (44 knees). None of three trials found an important difference between the two types of knee orthosis in pain. One trial found no clinically important difference in function between a knee brace and a knee sleeve. None of the three trials reported on quality of life, resource use or participant satisfaction. One trial comparing a patella strap with a knee sleeve reported that both participants quitting military training due to knee pain were allocated a knee sleeve. One poorly reported trial found three times as many knees with adverse effects (discomfort or skin abrasion) in those given knee sleeves with a patella ring than those given knee sleeves only. One trial compared a knee orthosis (knee brace) with exercise (66 participants). It found very low quality evidence of no clinically important difference between the two intervention groups in pain or knee function. The trial did not report on quality of life, impact on sporting or occupational participation, resource use, participant satisfaction or complications.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, this review has found a lack of evidence to inform on the use of knee orthoses for treating PFPS. There is, however, very low quality evidence from clinically heterogeneous trials using different types of knee orthoses (knee brace, sleeve and strap) that using a knee orthosis did not reduce knee pain or improve knee function in the short term (under three months) in adults who were also undergoing an exercise programme for treating PFPS. This points to the need for good-quality clinically-relevant research to inform on the use of commonly-available knee orthoses for treating PFPS.

We searched conventional databases, grey literature databases and trial registers. The following sources were searched from their date of inception up till 4 June 2019: Embase, PubMed (including MEDLINE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus. OpenGrey.eu and WorldCat.org were searched for unpublished studies and conference proceedings were identified from all Patellofemoral Research Retreats (2009, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017). For unpublished or ongoing studies, we searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Clinical Trials.gov, The European Union Clinical Trials Register and the ISRCTN registry. Finally, we screened reference lists of all Cochrane reviews (N = 6) on PFP and the reports included in this review for possible relevant studies that were not identified by our search.

Study selection

Two researchers (MW and CBL) screened titles and abstracts independently after duplicate removal. Consensus was sought in cases of initial disagreement. If consensus could not be reached, the report was included for full-text evaluation. Both investigators independently applied our inclusion and exclusion criteria to the full-text reports. In case of disagreement, consensus was sought; however, if disagreement persisted a third author (MSR or AW) arbitrated the decision.

We used Covidence (Melbourne, Australia) for independent study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment.

### Are there three main subgroups within the patellofemoral pain population? A detailed characterisation study of 127 patients to help develop targeted intervention (TIPPs) [^87491d8d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Non-specific patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a musculoskeletal disorder of the knee joint that causes significant pain and dysfunction around the patella leading to limitations in physical activities. The condition is not self-limiting, 90% of patients with PFP still have symptoms 4 years after diagnosis, and only 6% are symptom free at 16 years follow-up.

PFP may be a risk factor for developing patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA).PFP has recently emerged as the third highest ranked topic out of 185 in the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (UK) Musculoskeletal Research Priority Project. Expert consensus statements published following three International Patellofemoral Pain Research Retreats (IPFPRR) propose biomechanical risk factors for developing PFP described by anatomical location relative to the knee. These factors are: Proximal — upper femur, hip and trunk; Local — in and around the patella and the patellofemoral joint; Distal — lower leg foot and ankle. These risk factors may guide in developing clinical subgroups.

### Patellofemoral instability part I: evaluation and nonsurgical treatment [^2cf530f4]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Patellofemoral instability (PFI) is a prevalent cause of knee pain and disability. It affects mostly young females with an incidence reported as high as 1 in 1,000. Risk factors for instability include trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, increased tibial tubercle-to-trochlear groove distance, abnormal patella lateral tilt, and coronal and torsional malalignment. Nonsurgical and surgical options for PFI can treat the underlying causes with varied success rates. The goal of this review series was to synthesize the current best practices into a concise, algorithmic approach. This article is the first in a two-part review on PFI, which focuses on the clinical and radiological evaluation, followed by nonsurgical management. The orthopaedic surgeon should be aware of the latest diagnostic protocol for PFI and its nonsurgical treatment options, their indications, and outcomes.

### Comparative effectiveness of treatments for patellofemoral pain: a living systematic review with network meta-analysis [^1b9b0288]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and statistical methods

We constructed network plots using Stata software (StataCorp. V.2017. Stata Statistical Software:118 Release 15. College Station, Texas: StataCorp LLC) to visualise all head-to-head comparisons for all outcomes. Networks of treatment comparisons were constructed for the primary and secondary outcome separately. Three authors (MW, SH, MSR) appraised the clinical homogeneity before the start of the analysis, by tabulating study and population characteristics and inspecting them for differences in potential effect modifiers. This informed assessment of the assumption of exchangeability required for NMA. Treatments were also assigned to categories (ie, classes) (table 1).

Table 1
Treatments and treatment categories (ie, classes) for the 'any improvement'

Our primary outcome measure, any improvement, was summarised using an OR for improvement versus non-improvement, with a 95% CrI. This was in line with our protocol, and done because various GROC Scales, with different number of response options and descriptors (eg, improvement vs recovery), did not allow for data to be analysed in a proportional odds regression model. We used a conservative intention-to-treat approach to the analyses where missing data in original studies was handled as a treatment failure.

### Patellofemoral pain syndrome: a review on the associated neuromuscular deficits and current treatment options [^b330bb15]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common clinical presentation. Various neuromuscular factors have been reported to contribute to its aetiology.

Study Design

Systematic review

Methods

A literature search was carried out from 1998 up to December 2007. Eligible studies were those that: (1) examined the effects of hip strengthening in subjects with PFPS; (2) examined the effects of physiotherapy treatment aimed at restoring muscle balance between the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) and vastus lateralis (VL) in subjects with PFPS; (3) examined the effect of taping on electromyogram (EMG) muscle amplitude in subjects with PFPS; and (4) compared the effects of open versus closed kinetic chain exercises in the treatment of subjects with PFPS.

Results and Conclusion

No randomised controlled trials exist to support the use of hip joint strengthening in subjects with PFPS. Physiotherapy treatment programmes appear to be an efficacious method of improving quadriceps muscle imbalances. Further studies are required to determine the true efficacy of therapeutic patellar taping. Both open and closed kinetic chain exercises are appropriate forms of treatment for subjects with PFPS.

### Evaluation and treatment of knee pain: a review [^6b062f25]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 5% of all primary care visits in adults are related to knee pain. Osteoarthritis (OA), patellofemoral pain, and meniscal tears are among the most common causes of knee pain.

Observations

Knee OA, affecting an estimated 654 million people worldwide, is the most likely diagnosis of knee pain in patients aged 45 years or older who present with activity-related knee joint pain with no or less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness (95% sensitivity; 69% specificity). Patellofemoral pain typically affects people younger than 40 years who are physically active and has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 25%. The presence of anterior knee pain during a squat is approximately 91% sensitive and 50% specific for patellofemoral pain. Meniscal tears affect an estimated 12% of the adult population and can occur following acute trauma (eg, twisting injury) in people younger than 40 years. Alternatively, a meniscal tear may be a degenerative condition present in patients with knee OA who are aged 40 years or older. The McMurray test, consisting of concurrent knee rotation (internal or external to test lateral or medial meniscus, respectively) and extension (61% sensitivity; 84% specificity), and joint line tenderness (83% sensitivity; 83% specificity) assist diagnosis of meniscal tears. Radiographic imaging of all patients with possible knee OA is not recommended. First-line management of OA comprises exercise therapy, weight loss (if overweight), education, and self-management programs to empower patients to better manage their condition. Surgical referral for knee joint replacement can be considered for patients with end-stage OA (ie, no or minimal joint space with inability to cope with pain) after using all appropriate conservative options. For patellofemoral pain, hip and knee strengthening exercises in combination with foot orthoses or patellar taping are recommended, with no indication for surgery. Conservative management (exercise therapy for 4–6 weeks) is also appropriate for most meniscal tears. For severe traumatic (eg, bucket-handle) tears, consisting of displaced meniscal tissue, surgery is likely required. For degenerative meniscal tears, exercise therapy is first-line treatment; surgery is not indicated even in the presence of mechanical symptoms (eg, locking, catching).

Conclusions and Relevance

Knee OA, patellofemoral pain, and meniscal tears are common causes of knee pain, can be diagnosed clinically, and can be associated with significant disability. First-line treatment for each condition consists of conservative management, with a focus on exercise, education, and self-management.

Secondary outcome measures

Pain intensity measured by 'worst pain in the past week' on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; 0–10/0–100) or Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRS; 0–10/0–100). The reliability is excellent, ICC = 0.76.

Patient-rated pain during specific activities of daily life and during sporting activities measuredon a VAS or NRS as outlined above. Reliability for pain during activity is excellent, ICC = 0.83.

Patient-reported outcome measures were not included as they have not been used for PFP until very recently. These may be included in future updates.

Research question

Based on the main purpose of the study and the input from our patient reference group, we formulated the following research question: Which treatment(s)/treatment category (class(es)) is most likely to be effective for PFP on any improvement and patient-rated pain?

Eligibility criteria

Type of studies

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including randomisation through minimisation, or clustering) were eligible for inclusion providing a full-text report was available.

Type of population

All patients with a clinical diagnosis of PFP were included. Studies were included if they used synonyms for PFP, but as minimum criterion, described patients with retropatellar or peripatellar pain, of at least 6-week duration, and a non-traumatic onset. The diagnostic criteria used in the original studies were followed, given that pain was described as being retropatellar or peripatellar pain. Studies examining other conditions were excluded (eg, patellar dislocations, patellofemoral osteoarthrosis, patellar tendinopathy, Osgood-Schlatter, iliotibial band syndrome, Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome). Trials that included participants diagnosed with PFP, but with concomitant pain around the patella caused by other conditions (eg, patellar tendinopathy), were eligible for inclusion. No age restrictions were imposed.

Type of treatments and control treatments

Any conservative or invasive treatment, control treatment, placebo, wait-and-see or no treatment group studied were eligible for inclusion.

Type of outcomes

Studies assessing the treatment effect after a minimum of 6 weeks were included. Studies assessing the primary and secondary outcomes above were included (GROC Scale, worst pain intensity during the previous week and pain during activities).

British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Terminology

Two terms were proposed for the condition: (1) PFP and (2) patellofemoral arthropathy. PFP has been used as the preferred term over recent years, however, it does not take into account how non-painful joint conditions could be a precursor to pain development, does not include symptoms such as crepitus, and may increase a focus on the 'pain' aspect of the condition. The alternative term, patellofemoral arthropathy, was proposed, as part of the increasing recognition that PFP may be a symptom of joint disease. Focusing on the disease process (arthropathy) might not be appropriate because: (A) the linkage between disease process and pain presentation is not clear, (B) pain is the predominant symptom, and (C) it could shift the focus to imaging, rather than clinical outcomes.

Statement 1. The term 'patellofemoral pain' is the preferred term, and is a synonym for other terms including: (1) PFP syndrome; (2) chondromalacia patella; (3) anterior knee pain and/or syndrome; and (4) runner's knee.

British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patient-reported outcome measures

PROMs are used by researchers and clinicians to follow the course of PFP and evaluate treatment outcomes. Typically administered as questionnaires, PROMs measure the patient's own perspective of their PFP and treatment, without interpretation of their response by another individual. This minimises observer bias, and captures aspects of PFP that are likely to be important to the patient.

Statement 13. Researchers should use a standard set of PROMs for PFP and OA to facilitate future comparisons and pooling of data.

These should encompass three core clinical constructs: pain, function and global assessment. Researchers may also choose to evaluate quality of life and physical activity (optional constructs). Specific PROMs for each construct will be recommended in an upcoming paper, based on a Delphi exercise.

It should be noted that few PROMs have been developed specifically for PFP, raising the possibility that PROMs commonly used in research to date may lack content validity for this patient population.

Abstract

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to develop a multidisciplinary guideline for patellofemoral pain (PFP) and patellar tendinopathy (PT) to facilitate clinical decision‐making in primary and secondary care.

Methods

A multidisciplinary expert panel identified questions in clinical decision‐making. Based on a systematic literature search, the strength of the scientific evidence was determined according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method and the weight assigned to the considerations by the expert panel together determined the strength of the recommendations.

Results

After confirming PFP or PT as a clinical diagnosis, patients should start with exercise therapy. Additional conservative treatments are indicated only when exercise therapy does not result in clinically relevant changes after six (PFP) or 12 (PT) weeks. Pain medications should be reserved for cases of severe pain. The additional value of imaging assessments for PT is limited. Open surgery is reserved for very specific cases of nonresponders to exercise therapy and those requiring additional conservative treatments. Although the certainty of evidence regarding exercise therapy for PFP and PT had to be downgraded ('very low GRADE' and 'low GRADE'), the expert panel advocates its use as the primary treatment strategy. The panel further formulated weaker recommendations regarding additional conservative treatments, pain medications, imaging assessments and open surgery ('very low GRADE' to 'low GRADE' assessment or absence of scientific evidence).

Conclusion

This guideline recommends starting with exercise therapy for PFP and PT. The recommendations facilitate clinical decision‐making, and thereby optimizing treatment and preventing unnecessary burdens, risks and costs to patients and society.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) medical screening and referral — Medical screening incorporates the findings of the history and physical examination to determine whether the patient's symptoms originate from a condition that requires referral to another health care provider, and prior to diagnosing a person with PFP, it is necessary to rule out all other possible medical conditions. Clinicians should recognize the key signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for the presence of these conditions throughout treatment, and immediately initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected, and medical conditions for which physical therapy is not indicated must be considered as possible etiologies of a patient's symptoms.

Selection process

We included 22 RCTs. figure 1 details the search and selection process. Online supplemental appendix 2 shows the studies excluded+the reasons for exclusion. Thirty-three trials were found through register searches; sixteen were completed, nine were ongoing and eight trials' status was unknown (online supplemental appendices 3 and 4).

Figure 1
Flow diagram, search on 4 June 2019. PFP, patellofemoral pain; RCTs, randomised controlled trials.

Characteristics of the studies included

Twenty-one treatments were investigated in twenty-two trials. Forty-eight treatment arms were investigated, with sample sizes from 10 to 109 per treatment arm. Thirty-six (75%) of arms included exercise. Other common intervention categories included patient education, orthotics and wait and see (or a combination). For full details see table 1 and online supplemental appendix 5. Eleven RCTs used a GROC Scale to measure patient-reported outcomes, and nineteen trials used a worst pain scale or measured pain during a specific activity. Cumulatively, 1472 patients with PFP were included. Online supplemental appendix 5 details all study and patient characteristics of the studies included.

Risk of bias and certainty of the evidence

The majority of outcomes were at high risk of bias (79%), with some concerns in 21% (online supplemental appendix 6, tables 1 and 2a, b). Outcome measurement (45%), deviations from the intended intervention (45%), missing outcome data (32%) and reporting (23%) were the most common sources of bias.

The certainty of evidence for all comparisons was low to very low, except for hip/knee exercises versus education+orthosis, for which there was moderate evidence (online supplemental appendix 7). Evidence for comparisons was rated down for risk of bias (n = 100, 100%; ie, 'serious' to 'very serious') and imprecision (n = 85, 85%).

Patellofemoral osteoarthritis

Prevalence and impact of patellofemoral OA

Statement 6. Patellofemoral OA is an under recognised yet important subgroup of knee OA.

Knee OA research has mainly focused on the tibiofemoral compartment, yet recent evidence suggests that the patellofemoral compartment is at least as commonly affected by OA. Depending on the source population and definition of OA (ie, radiographic or MRI) isolated patellofemoral OA is present in 11–24% of older individuals and occurs in combination with tibiofemoral OA in 4–40% of people. People with patellofemoral OA exhibit similar patterns of pain and functional limitation to those with PFP.

### The 'best practice guide to conservative management of patellofemoral pain': incorporating level 1 evidence with expert clinical reasoning [^17ca8730]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Importance

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is both chronic and prevalent; it has complex aetiology and many conservative treatment options.

Objective

Develop a comprehensive contemporary guide to conservative management of PFP outlining key considerations for clinicians to follow.

Design

Mixed methods.

Methods

We synthesised the findings from six high-quality systematic reviews to September 2013 with the opinions of 17 experts obtained via semistructured interviews. Experts had at least 5years clinical experience with PFP as a specialist focus, were actively involved in PFP research and contributed to specialist international meetings. The interviews covered clinical reasoning, perception of current evidence and research priorities.

Results

Multimodal intervention including exercise to strengthen the gluteal and quadriceps musculature, manual therapy and taping possessed the strongest evidence. Evidence also supports use of foot orthoses and acupuncture. Interview transcript analysis identified 23 themes and 58 subthemes. Four key over-arching principles to ensure effective management included-(1) PFP is a multifactorial condition requiring an individually tailored multimodal approach. (2) Immediate pain relief should be a priority to gain patient trust. (3) Patient empowerment by emphasising active over passive interventions is important. (4) Good patient education and activity modification is essential. Future research priorities include identifying risk factors, testing effective prevention, developing education strategies, evaluating the influence of psychosocial factors on treatment outcomes and how to address them, evaluating the efficacy of movement pattern retraining and improving clinicians' assessment skills to facilitate optimal individual prescription.

Conclusions and Relevance

Effective management of PFP requires consideration of a number of proven conservative interventions. An individually tailored multimodal intervention programme including gluteal and quadriceps strengthening, patellar taping and an emphasis on education and activity modification should be prescribed for patients with PFP. We provide a 'Best Practice Guide to Conservative Management of Patellofemoral Pain' outlining key considerations.

### Consensus methods in patellofemoral pain: how rigorous are they? A scoping review [^4beaeca5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Clinicians and researchers have sought consensus with increasing frequency on topics related to PFP. However, consensus statements on PFP have often failed to rigorously develop consensus recommendations with respect to the four questions we outlined in this review. The lack of systematic searching to identify potential evidence gaps may have resulted in statements focusing on areas with well-established research evidence, or missing important topics where no information exists. Given the potential for consensus to direct whole bodies of research, it is perhaps most concerning that the patient voice has been almost totally absent.

Future consensus statements that are rigorous, representative (of all interested or impacted parties) and clearly report their development processes could be seen as more credible.

### Evaluation of the scope and quality of systematic reviews on nonpharmacological conservative treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome [^44f6b20e]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic literature review.

Objective

To evaluate the quality and scope of recently published systematic reviews on the topic of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) and to provide an overview of their findings.

Background

PFPS is a commonly treated condition. There is a large body of literature on conservative nonpharmacological interventions for PFPS, including multiple systematic reviews, which require critiquing and summarizing.

Methods and Measures

A systematic review of systematic reviews on conservative nonpharmacological treatment strategies for PFPS was performed. Published systematic reviews were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDISCUS, Current Contents, The Cochrane Library, and PEDro electronic databases from the year 2000 until May 2007. Cited reference searches of each author in the Web of Science complemented this search. Review quality was evaluated by a specifically designed scale and only high-quality reviews were retained to validate and summarize reported findings.

Results

Ten reviews met the inclusion criteria. Among them, only 3 were considered to be high quality, covering exercise, foot and knee orthoses, and ultrasound intervention for PFPS. None of the 3 reviews included literature published after the year 2001. Some limited evidence for the use of exercise, exercise combined with taping, and exercise combined with the use of a Protonics brace was found for treatment of individuals with PFPS.

Conclusion

Published systematic reviews and clinical trials need to be conducted with more rigorous methodological design. There are no up-to-date, high-quality systematic reviews covering conservative nonpharmacological treatments for individuals with PFPS, which indicates that updates in all areas are needed.

### 2016 patellofemoral pain consensus statement from the 4th international patellofemoral pain research retreat, manchester. part 2: recommended physical interventions (exercise, taping, bracing, foot orthoses and combined interventions) [^29acfdd0]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations

Our consensus on physical and exercise treatments for patellofemoral pain was limited to the treatments with evidence regarding their usefulness. The inclusion of evidence stemming from moderate-quality and high-quality systematic reviews means that not all potentially valuable interventions were covered. For example, while gait retraining shows emerging evidence supporting its use in patellofemoral pain, more rigorous research is required before it can be considered as a recommended intervention.

Our expert panel self-selected participants who attended the International Patellofemoral Pain Research Retreat. While all participants were active in patellofemoral research and most of the productive researchers worldwide were in attendance, the panel was not specifically chosen, based on their expertise. The inclusion of researchers and clinicians is a strength (ensuring expertise with research methodology and respect for scientific rigour) as well as a limitation (some members have no experience in patient management). Furthermore, there was no patient input into the voting on our recommendations, and we recommend that their values and preferences be considered when applying recommendations clinically.

### Patellofemoral pain syndrome [^2060b5e8]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions and future strategies

The patellofemoral pain syndrome is a clinical entity which leads to anterior knee pain in patients without any pathological changes at the cartilage of the patellofemoral joint. Patellar maltracking due to a functional malalignment or dynamic valgus may be an underlying cause for this clinical entity. Possible causes for the dynamic valgus may be decreased strength of the hip abductors or a pes pronatus valgus. The functional malalignment is associated with quadriceps dysbalance, hamstring tightness or iliotibial tract tightness. The clinical usefulness of these findings is that a physician may tailor an individual treatment plan for each patient according to the underlying pathology. However, there is a clear need for further research to distinguish between cause and effect.

The literature provides evidence for a multimodal non-operative therapy concept with short-term use of NSAIDs, short-term use of a medially directed tape and complex exercise programmes with the inclusion of the lower extremity, and hip and trunk muscles. There is also evidence for the use of patellar braces and foot orthosis. There is need for further studies about braces and foot orthosis.

### Patellar taping for patellofemoral pain syndrome in adults [^028cad59]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain syndrome refers to the clinical presentation of knee pain related to changes in the patellofemoral joint. Patellofemoral pain syndrome usually has a gradual onset of pain with none of the features associated with other knee diseases or trauma. It is often treated by physiotherapists, who use a variety of techniques including patellar taping. This involves the application of adhesive sports medical tape applied directly to the skin over the patella on the front of the knee. Patients often report an instantaneous improvement in pain and function after the tape is applied, but its longer term effects are uncertain.

Objectives

The objective was to assess the effects, primarily on pain and function, of patellar taping for treating patellofemoral pain syndrome in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, AMED, reference lists of articles, trial registers and conference proceedings. All were searched to August 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials testing the effects of patellar taping on clinically relevant outcomes, pain and function, in adults with patellofemoral pain syndrome. We excluded studies testing only the immediate effects of tape application.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Trialists were contacted for more information. Data were pooled where possible.

Main Results

Five small heterogeneous randomised controlled trials, all at high risk of performance bias and most at risk of at least one other type of bias, were included. These involved approximately 200 participants with a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome. All compared taping versus control (no or placebo taping) and all included one or more co-interventions given to both taping and control group participants; this was prescribed exercise in four trials. The intensity and length of treatment was very varied: for example, length of treatment ranged from one week in one trial to three months in another. A meta-analysis of the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain data (scale 0 to 10: worst pain), measured in different ways, from four trials (data from 161 knees), found no statistically or clinically significant difference between taping and non taping in pain at the end of the treatment programmes (mean difference (MD) -0.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.15 to 0.85; random-effects model used given the significant heterogeneity (P < 0.0001)). Data for other outcomes measuring function and activities of daily living were from single trials only and gave contradictory results.

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence from trials reporting clinically relevant outcomes is low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of taping, whether used on its own or as part of a treatment programme. Further research involving large, preferably multi-centre, good quality and well reported randomised controlled trials that measure clinically important outcomes and long-term results is warranted. Before this, consensus is required on the diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, the standardisation of outcome measurement and an acceptable approach for patellar taping.

Module 2: 'Additional conservative treatments for PFP'

Scoping question: What is the value of additional conservative treatments (tapes, braces and foot orthoses) for patients with PFP?

Background: Various conservative treatments are commonly used in the management of PFP. Usually, these treatments are adjuncts to exercise therapy (multimodal treatment). However, their additional benefits remain unclear. The three most commonly used additional conservative treatments in the Netherlands are tapes, braces and foot orthoses.

Evidence review: Three systematic reviews (including six RCTs) and eight additional RCTs were included ('very low GRADE').

Rationale: Evidence supporting the regular application of tapes, braces and foot orthoses is lacking or conflicting. Therefore, the expert panel advocates for the application of these treatments only in specific cases.

Recommendations:

Initially, PFP should be treated using exercise therapy for 6 to 12 weeks (Module 1: 'Exercise therapy for PFP').
Tapes, braces, or foot orthoses should be considered as additional conservative treatments in combination with exercise therapy if no clinically relevant changes occur after 6 to 12 weeks of exercise therapy (Module 1: 'Exercise therapy for PFP').
The patient should be informed of the lack of evidence regarding these additional conservative treatments and should be involved in decision‐making regarding the choice of additional treatments.

Module 8: 'Open surgery for PFP and PT'

Scoping question: What is the value of open surgery for patients with PFP and PT?

Background: When PFP and PT are unresponsive to conservative treatments, patients are sometimes referred to an orthopaedic surgeon for evaluation, confirmation of diagnosis, potential supplementary diagnostics and appraisal of indications for surgical treatment. The Dutch Guideline on Knee Arthroscopy recommends not performing arthroscopy for PFP and exercising caution in performing arthroscopy for PT. However, the role of open surgery in the surgical treatment of PFP and PT remains unclear.

Evidence review: No studies have been conducted on open surgery for PFP. One systematic review of open surgery for PT was included ('low GRADE').

Rationale: Recommendations of the expert panel were based solely on clinical expertise. Imaging assessments (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography) are obligatory and should be evaluated for post‐traumatic, degenerative, or congenital morphological causes of PFP. When open surgery for PT is indicated, the expert panel recommends magnetic resonance imaging assessment to confirm the exact location and degree of patellar tendon abnormalities before surgery.

Recommendations:

Initially, PFP and PT should only be treated with non‐operative treatments for at least 6 months (see Module 2: 'Exercise therapy for PFP', Module 3: 'Additional conservative treatments for PFP', Module 5: 'Exercise for PT' and Module 6: 'Additional conservative treatments for PT').
Surgery should only be considered when conservative treatment fails; the variable and unpredictable outcomes and potential risks of open surgery for PFP and PT should be discussed, and shared decision‐making should be employed when choosing the treatment.
Open surgery should be considered only when, following at least 6 months of non‐operative treatments, including exercise therapy, the patient continues to experience persistent and disabling symptoms and functional limitations, and o Anatomical morphology is determined to be the cause of persistent PFP confirmed by imaging assessments or o PT is confirmed by imaging assessments.

### Comparative effectiveness of treatments for patellofemoral pain: a living systematic review with network meta-analysis [^699d12a9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Musculoskeletal disorders are one of the largest global contributors to years lived with disability, and costly to society. Patellofemoral Pain (PFP) is one of the most common knee complaints in individuals between 10 and 50 years of age.PFP impacts function, ability to participate in leisure time activities, work, sport and reduces quality of life. It is a clinical diagnosis made when patients present with pain around or behind the patella during daily activities such as stair walking, squatting or running. Similar to low back pain, PFP is characterised by a high degree of persistency and recurrence of symptoms. Nearly 40% of those with PFP continue to experience symptoms after 2 years, which is associated with frequent use of pain killers, lowering of physical activity levels and low quality of life.

Many different treatments are used in clinical practice to help patients with PFP. While there are several systematic reviews evaluating treatments for PFP, the comparative effectiveness of all available treatments has never been examined. This makes deciding on the most appropriate treatment challenging and may explain the variation in clinical practice. In this study, we use network meta-analysis (NMA), a technique which allows the simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions in a single coherent analysis. Traditional systematic review quickly become outdated. Living systematic reviews are continuously updated and incorporate new evidence when available. A living systemic review with NMA would enable clinicians to consult a contemporary, comprehensive overview of the comparative effectiveness of treatments for a given condition. This living systematic review with NMA evaluates the comparative effectiveness of all available treatments for patients with PFP, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of evidence-based treatments.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) — exercise therapy: Clinicians should include exercise therapy with combined hip- and knee-targeted exercises in the treatment of individuals with PFP to reduce pain and improve patient-reported outcomes and functional performance in the short, medium, and long term. Hip-targeted exercise therapy should target the posterolateral hip musculature, and knee-targeted exercise therapy includes either weight-bearing (resisted squats) or non-weight-bearing (resisted knee extension) exercise, as both techniques target the knee musculature. Preference to hip-targeted exercise over knee-targeted exercise may be given in the early stages of treatment of PFP, and overall, the combination of hip- and knee-targeted exercise is preferred over solely knee-targeted exercises to optimize outcomes in patients with PFP.

Patellofemoral pain — classification considerations explain heterogeneity and limits of existing schemes. Multiple biomechanical and neuromusculoskeletal factors related to the knee, hip, ankle, and trunk/pelvis have been reported to be associated with PFP. Similar to low back pain, clinicians recognize that PFP is not a homogeneous condition, and response to intervention varies. As a result, several classification systems with subcategories of PFP have been proposed for nonsurgical management of patients. Many of these classification systems are based on proposed pathoanatomical diagnoses, which rely on diagnostic imaging or surgical findings. These classification systems are of limited utility for physical therapists because they do not include clear diagnostic criteria for each subcategory, or they rely on imaging or surgical findings that may not always be available by the physical therapist at the initial encounter.

Patellofemoral pain — gaps in knowledge on exercise therapy dosage: Although exercise therapy is recommended for PFP to reduce pain in the short, medium, and long term, and to improve function in the medium and long term, optimal dosage is currently unclear, in part due to inadequate exercise reporting in the literature. Further research is needed to understand which dosage parameters (eg, session duration and frequency, exercise intensity, etc) are associated with better pain, function, and quality-of-life outcomes.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for patellofemoral pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to classification, APTA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider using the proposed impairment/function-based PFPS classification system to guide management:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Overuse/overload without other impairment|- Patients presenting with a history suggesting an increase in magnitude and/or frequency of patellofemoral joint loading at a rate surpassing the ability of patellofemoral joint tissues to recovery|
|Muscle performance deficits|- Patients presenting with lower extremity muscle performance deficits in the hip and quadriceps < br > - Patients may respond favorably to hip and knee resistance exercises|
|Movement coordination deficits|- Patients presenting with excessive or poorly controlled knee valgus during a dynamic task, but not necessarily due to weakness of the lower extremity musculature < br > - Patients may respond favorably to gait retraining and movement re-education interventions leading to improvements in lower extremity kinematics and pain, suggesting the importance of assessing dynamic knee valgus during movement|
|Mobility impairments|- Patients presenting with higher than normal foot mobility and/or flexibility deficits of ≥ 1 of the following structures|

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^1afe1727]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The expert panel advocates for the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) as the first choice of pain medication in select cases of patients with PFP and PT; however, no evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of this specific drug and no evidence for the use of this drug during training is available. Although the expert panel currently sees no role for injection therapy, including cell therapies, in the management of patients with PT, available evidence suggests that this perspective may change in the future with the emergence of RCTs featuring larger sample sizes and long‐term follow‐ups.

Patients with PFP or PT also reported receiving a whole range of conservative treatments (additional to exercise therapy or as stand‐alone treatments), while our literature research regarding these treatments concluded that scientific evidence for these additional treatments is either absent or had a 'very low GRADE' to 'low GRADE' (online Supporting Information modules 'Additional conservative treatments' and 'Pain medications' for PFP and PT). Therefore, the expert panel formulated weaker recommendations regarding these interventions. Despite the absence of scientific evidence for open surgery, the expert panel felt an urgent need to formulate a cautious but decisive recommendation for an orthopaedic assessment to ascertain the indication for open surgery. This is reserved for nonresponders to diligent exercise therapy or exercise therapy plus additional conservative treatments for at least six months. In cases of distinct anatomical pathology, such as central patellar tendon necrosis, more prompt surgical intervention may be warranted.

### Systematic review of the quality of randomized controlled trials for patellofemoral pain syndrome [^a658e5ec]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review of the literature.

Objectives

To develop a grading scale to judge the quality of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and conduct a systematic review of the published RCTs that assess nonoperative treatments for patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS).

Background

Systematic reviews of the quality and usefulness of clinical trials allow for efficient synthesis and dissemination of the literature, which should facilitate clinicians' efforts to incorporate principles of evidence-based practice in the clinical decision-making process.

Methods and Measures

Using a scale based on criteria in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, we sought to critically appraise the methodology used in RCTs related to the nonoperative management of PFPS, synthesize and interpret our results, and report our findings in a user-friendly fashion. A scale to assess the methodological quality of trials was designed and pilot tested for its content and reliability. Published RCTs identified during a literature search were then selected and rated by 6 raters. We used predefined cutoff scores to identify specific weaknesses in the clinical research process that need to be improved in future clinical trials.

Results

The quality scale we developed was demonstrated to be sufficiently reliable to warrant interpretation of the reviewers' findings. The percentage of trials that met a minimum level of quality for each specific criterion ranged from a low of 25% for the adequacy of the description of the randomization procedure to a high of 95% for the description and standardization of the intervention.

Conclusions

Based on the results of trials exhibiting a sufficient level of quality, treatments that were effective in decreasing pain and improving function in patients with PFPS were acupuncture, quadriceps strengthening, the use of a resistive brace, and the combination of exercises with patellar taping and biofeedback. The use of soft foot orthotics in patients with excessive foot pronation appeared useful in decreasing pain. In addition, at a short-term follow-up, patients who received exercise programs were discharged earlier from physical therapy. Unfortunately, most RCTs reviewed contained qualitative flaws that bring the validity of the results into question, thus diminishing the ability to generalize the results to clinical practice. These flaws were primarily in the areas of randomization procedures, duration of follow-up, control of cointerventions, assurance of blinding, accountability and proper analysis of dropouts, number of subjects, and the relevance of outcomes. Also, given the limited number of high-quality clinical trials, recommendations about supporting or refuting specific treatment approaches may be premature and can only be made with caution.
