Stroke management

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute ischemic stroke management, preserving natural self-verification and any initial missteps with corrections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about prehospital recognition and time-critical transport. Then, I should verify emergency department assessment priorities and NIHSS scoring. Next, I will review imaging pathways and eligibility for reperfusion. After that, I need to check IV thrombolysis indications, dosing, and post-tPA blood pressure targets. Then, I will examine mechanical thrombectomy criteria and timing. I will now examine supportive care including blood pressure, glucose, temperature, and oxygenation. Next, I should review secondary prevention with antiplatelets, statins, and atrial fibrillation anticoagulation timing. I will then consider stroke unit care, early rehabilitation, and complications. Finally, I need to ensure systems of care, quality improvement, equity, and special populations are addressed with appropriate citations throughout [^11543jnT] [^116kekVW].

> Let me first confirm the prehospital priorities: rapid recognition using validated stroke scales, immediate EMS activation, and transport to a certified stroke center are foundational, and I should double-check that public education and telestroke are emphasized to mitigate delays and access barriers; yes, AHA/ASA supports telestroke for 24/7 coverage and public education to call 911 urgently, and the 8 Ds framework operationalizes the early steps from detection through disposition, which helps standardize performance and equity metrics [^114MuVEM] [^111Yq9Qm] [^116kekVW].

> Wait, let me verify the ED assessment sequence: activate the stroke team early, obtain a precise last known normal, perform a rapid NIHSS to quantify severity and guide eligibility, establish IV access, and draw time-sensitive labs including CBC, metabolic panel, PT/INR, and troponin; I should confirm that troponin is justified given the high rate of cardiac complications after ischemic stroke, and yes, arrhythmias and MI are common, supporting early cardiac biomarker assessment and ECG [^116s8xcb] [^111YQYFo].

> I need to check the imaging pathway next: noncontrast CT head is mandatory to exclude hemorrhage and may reveal early ischemic signs, but I should not jump to conclusions about treatment eligibility without vascular imaging; CTA of the head and neck identifies large vessel occlusion and informs thrombectomy candidacy, while advanced imaging such as CT perfusion or MRI can select patients for extended-window reperfusion when core/penumbra mismatch is present, so I should confirm that guidelines endorse these strategies in appropriate patients [^111UqQPL] [^117Loq9q] [^114rx166].

> Hold on, I should verify IV alteplase eligibility and dosing: standard dose is 0.9 mg/kg with 10% bolus and remainder over 60 minutes, with a 0.6 mg/kg regimen not shown noninferior and therefore not recommended; treatment within 0–3 hours is strongly supported, 3–4.5 hours is reasonable with additional exclusion criteria, and for very severe strokes in the 3–4.5 hour window the benefit is uncertain; importantly, aspirin is not a substitute for reperfusion therapy, and I need to ensure blood pressure is under 185/110 mmHg before and under 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after alteplase [^114AwBmu] [^114HrErs] [^116k7ksE] [^114riAF2] [^116Hcn7S].

> Let me consider mechanical thrombectomy next: for anterior circulation LVO within 6 hours, thrombectomy is strongly recommended, and for 6–24 hours, it is reasonable in selected patients with favorable imaging profiles demonstrating salvageable tissue; I should confirm that stent retrievers are preferred over intra-arterial fibrinolysis and that preprocedural blood pressure should be kept at or below 185/110 mmHg if no IV lytics were given; bridge therapy with IV alteplase followed by thrombectomy remains standard in eligible patients, and I should double-check that recent policy statements continue to support this approach [^114cFDvk] [^116gf8Mt].

> I will now examine supportive medical management: maintain normoglycemia, treat fever, and ensure adequate oxygenation with airway protection when indicated; for blood pressure, I initially thought to keep SBP under 140 mmHg in all patients, but wait, I should verify the nuance — before reperfusion, permissive hypertension may be reasonable to preserve penumbral perfusion, whereas after IV alteplase I must strictly maintain BP under 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours, and once neurologically stable, initiating or restarting antihypertensives for persistent BP above 140/90 mmHg is reasonable; I should also confirm that induced hypertension is not routinely recommended outside trials [^111kMQaX] [^116Hcn7S] [^113mtGZj] [^114tKHap].

> Next, I should review secondary prevention: aspirin should be started within 24–48 hours after stroke onset, delayed to 24 hours if alteplase was given unless compelling indications exist; for high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke, short-course dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21–30 days reduces early recurrence; I need to ensure statin therapy is high-intensity per ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines and that anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation is typically initiated 4–14 days after onset to balance embolic risk against hemorrhagic transformation; triple antiplatelet therapy is harmful and should be avoided [^1118kyvh] [^1112eFFw] [^116iyueR] [^113d5fob].

> Let me think about stroke unit care and early rehabilitation: admission to a comprehensive stroke unit with multidisciplinary teams reduces mortality and disability, and I should confirm that early rehabilitation assessment and therapy at an intensity commensurate with tolerance are recommended; standardized order sets and protocols improve reliability, and a formal functional assessment before discharge supports safe transitions and care planning [^115wnxv2] [^1179jac1] [^115vpTxv] [^114mU7Qm].

> I should double-check complication management: for cerebral edema, avoid corticosteroids and escalate monitoring with early neurosurgical consultation for malignant swelling; for hemorrhagic transformation, decisions to continue or initiate antithrombotics should be individualized; for dysphagia, screen before feeding to prevent aspiration; and I need to ensure palliative care resources are offered early for severe strokes with poor prognosis to support goals-of-care discussions [^117UuGZA] [^114jfVCc] [^1174rfZW] [^117TrMhv].

> But wait, what about systems of care and equity: stroke systems should minimize onset-to-treatment times with tiered stroke centers, telestroke, and continuous quality improvement; I should confirm that reimbursement policies aligned with the complexity of stroke care can sustain these systems; disparities in access and outcomes persist by race, ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic status, and implementation science with the 8 Ds framework can guide targeted interventions to close the evidence-to-practice gap [^114MshkU] [^116UsXpC] [^116kekVW] [^114bwrhR].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed: in resource-limited settings without neuroimaging, conservative blood pressure management and empiric antiplatelet therapy may be necessary; in patients already on aspirin who have a noncardioembolic stroke, evidence is insufficient to support dose escalation or switching; and for patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease, aggressive risk factor control and lifestyle modification are emphasized to reduce recurrence risk [^111jxsf4] [^1151QBwL] [^112yfWYF].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure internal consistency: rapid recognition and transport, ED assessment with NIHSS and early imaging, reperfusion with IV alteplase and/or thrombectomy when indicated, meticulous supportive care, stroke unit admission with early rehab, and guideline-concordant secondary prevention together constitute the backbone of modern AIS care; I should confirm that each step aligns with AHA/ASA guidance and contemporary evidence, and that quality metrics and equity considerations are embedded throughout [^113YXFtV] [^111UqQPL].

Stroke management centers on **rapid recognition and time-sensitive reperfusion** [^111UqQPL] to reduce disability and mortality [^1149eLzQ]. The key steps are: activate EMS, perform rapid imaging (noncontrast CT/CTA) [^113peFVH], give IV alteplase within 4.5 hours [^114mTS7e] if eligible, and proceed to mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion up to 24 hours in selected patients [^114MshkU]. Blood pressure must be **strictly controlled** [^111kMQaX] (pre-thrombolysis < 185/110 mmHg; post-thrombolysis < 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours) [^114riAF2], and patients should be managed in a stroke unit with early rehabilitation and secondary prevention (antiplatelet therapy, high-intensity statin, risk factor control) [^115wnxv2] [^1118kyvh] [^1112eFFw]. Early mobilization, dysphagia screening, and complication prevention are essential [^notfound]; avoid corticosteroids for edema [^117UuGZA] and use telemedicine to expand access [^114MuVEM].

---

## Prehospital care and recognition

- **Public education**: Programs to recognize stroke and call 911 immediately [^111Yq9Qm] improve outcomes [^notfound].

- **EMS protocols**: Use stroke scales (e.g. FAST, NIHSS) [^116s8xcb] and transport to stroke centers [^111zTSix].

- **Telemedicine**: Enables rapid remote assessment and triage [^117ASMvm], especially in rural areas [^117ASMvm].

---

## Emergency department evaluation

- **Rapid assessment**: Immediate neurologic exam, NIHSS [^116s8xcb], and vital signs [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Noncontrast CT within 25 minutes [^notfound]; CTA/CTP or MRI if available to identify LVO and penumbra [^117Loq9q].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, metabolic panel, PT/INR, aPTT, troponin, and glucose [^notfound].

---

## Acute treatment

### Intravenous thrombolysis

- **Alteplase (tPA)**: Within 4.5 hours of onset [^114mTS7e]; standard dose 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) [^notfound].

- **Blood pressure control**: Pre-tPA < 185/110 mmHg; post-tPA < 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours [^114riAF2].

- **Exclusions**: Major exclusions include intracranial hemorrhage, recent surgery, or bleeding [^notfound].

---

### Mechanical thrombectomy

Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for **large-vessel occlusion** (internal carotid, MCA, anterior cerebral, or basilar arteries) [^notfound]. The time window is within 6 hours for all patients and 6–24 hours for selected patients with favorable imaging profiles [^114MshkU]. Pre-procedural blood pressure should be **≤ 185/110 mmHg** [^116gf8Mt].

---

## Supportive care and complications

- **Stroke unit care**: Reduces mortality and disability [^114RScJT]; use standardized order sets [^114gHyYD].

- **Blood pressure management**: Individualize based on reperfusion status and comorbidities [^114riAF2] [^11352Jg6].

- **Glucose control**: Treat hyperglycemia (> 180 mg/dL) to reduce infarct growth [^notfound].

- **Temperature control**: Treat fever (> 38°C) to improve outcomes [^notfound].

- **Dysphagia screening**: Before oral intake to prevent aspiration [^notfound].

- **Complications**: Manage cerebral edema, seizures, and hemorrhagic transformation [^114jfVCc] [^1174rfZW].

---

## Secondary prevention

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin within 24–48 hours [^1118kyvh] unless contraindicated.

- **Statins**: High-intensity statins (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg) for all ischemic stroke patients [^115QnnHk] [^113bqLVU].

- **Risk factor management**: Control hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation [^116iyueR] [^113R99Dr].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and alcohol moderation [^112yfWYF].

---

## Rehabilitation and long-term care

Early rehabilitation should begin **within 24–48 hours** with multidisciplinary involvement [^111oLpCg]. Functional assessment should be performed before discharge to guide ongoing care [^114mU7Qm]. Patient and family education should cover stroke signs, medication adherence, and lifestyle changes [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Mild stroke**: IV alteplase not recommended for mild, nondisabling strokes (NIHSS 0–5) [^1129gsaw].

- **Posterior circulation**: Thrombectomy is effective for basilar artery occlusion [^notfound].

- **Resource-limited settings**: Adapt protocols when imaging is unavailable [^111jxsf4].

---

Stroke management requires **coordinated, time-sensitive care** [^111UqQPL] spanning prehospital recognition, rapid imaging, reperfusion, supportive care, and secondary prevention, with stroke units and rehabilitation improving outcomes [^114RScJT].

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^1149eLzQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Concise "synthetic" review of the state of the art of management of acute ischemic stroke.

Data Sources:

Available literature on PubMed.

Study Selection:

We selected landmark studies, recent clinical trials, observational studies, and professional guidelines on the management of stroke including the last 10 years.

Data Extraction:

Eligible studies were identified and results leading to guideline recommendations were summarized.

Data Synthesis:

Stroke mortality has been declining over the past 6 decades, and as a result, stroke has fallen from the second to the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. This trend may follow recent advances in the management of stroke, which highlight the importance of early recognition and early revascularization. Recent studies have shown that early recognition, emergency interventional treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and treatment in dedicated stroke centers can significantly reduce stroke-related morbidity and mortality. However, stroke remains the second leading cause of death worldwide and the number one cause for acquired long-term disability, resulting in a global annual economic burden.

Conclusions:

Appropriate treatment of ischemic stroke is essential in the reduction of mortality and morbidity. Management of stroke involves a multidisciplinary approach that starts and extends beyond hospital admission.

### Blood pressure goals in acute stroke [^111kMQaX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In the acute phase of a stroke, blood pressure management is apparently much more complex than for primary prevention of stroke in patients with hypertension or for secondary prevention in patients with a stabilized stroke. A key question is at what level of blood pressure do we need to initiate antihypertensive treatment and how low may we reduce blood pressure. A similarly important but even more difficult question is at what time after a stroke do we need to initiate antihypertensive treatment. In the past 2 decades, a number of observational studies and randomized clinical trials addressed these questions in patients with various subtypes of stroke. In the present review article, we first summarize the current guideline recommendations in this particular regard, and then the recent observational and clinical trial evidence on the blood pressure goals in acute stroke.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^111UqQPL]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability in developed countries and one of the top causes of mortality worldwide. The past decade has seen substantial advances in the diagnostic and treatment options available to minimize the impact of acute ischemic stroke. The key first step in stroke care is early identification of patients with stroke and triage to centers capable of delivering the appropriate treatment, as fast as possible. Here, we review the data supporting pre-hospital and emergency stroke care, including use of emergency medical services protocols for identification of patients with stroke, intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke including updates to recommended patient eligibility criteria and treatment time windows, and advanced imaging techniques with automated interpretation to identify patients with large areas of brain at risk but without large completed infarcts who are likely to benefit from endovascular thrombectomy in extended time windows from symptom onset. We also review protocols for management of patient physiologic parameters to minimize infarct volumes and recent updates in secondary prevention recommendations including short term use of dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent stroke in the high risk period immediately after stroke. Finally, we discuss emerging therapies and questions for future research.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1142XJfD]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

American Heart Association (AHA) acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guideline update — scope, population, and methods are summarized as follows: The guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks, and provide general recommendations to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. Recommendations are restricted to adults and to secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks, and recommendations for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are not included. The guideline uses the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/AHA Class of Recommendations (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE) format, with new or revised recommendations accompanied by 250-word knowledge bytes and data supplement tables in Data Supplement 1 and Data Supplement 2. Development and review steps included peer review of the draft 2018 guidelines by 4 expert peer reviewers; approvals on November 29, 2017 and December 11, 2017; online publication January 24, 2018; an April 18, 2018 revision deleting 7 specific recommendations and all of Section 6; submission in June 2018 with inclusion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with > 100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS; and subsequent review by 14 peer reviewers, with additional RCTs addressing AIS published between November 2018 and April 2019 reviewed.

### Management of acute ischaemic stroke: new guidelines from the American stroke association and European stroke initiative [^113E4PTs]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Background

Ischaemic stroke is an important cause of death and dependency in industrialised countries; it has a high incidence (affecting up to 0.2% of the population each year) and is commonly lethal or disabling. One in six patients die in the first month after ischaemic stroke, and half of survivors are permanently disabled despite best efforts to rehabilitate them and to prevent complications, recurrent stroke, and other serious vascular events. Optimisation of the early, and ongoing, management of patients with acute ischaemic stroke is pivotal to the reduction of both case fatality and long-term disability.

Recent Developments

Guidelines for the early management of patients with ischaemic stroke have recently been published by the Stroke Council of the American Stroke Association (ASA; Adams and co-workers, Stroke 2003; 34: 1056–83) and the European Stroke Initiative (EUSI; European Stroke Initiative Executive Committee and Writing Committee, Cerebrovasc Dis 2003; 16: 311–38). Although transatlantic differences might create different interpretations, priorities, and views, the guidelines are remarkably similar, even regarding controversial issues. We believe this is not only because both groups have had the opportunity to discuss many of the controversial issues at international meetings, but also because both groups have endorsed the concept of evidence-based medicine and have based their recommendations on similar classifications of the levels of evidence for the effectiveness of interventions. This is a triumph for evidence-based medicine and a major step towards unification of acute stroke management worldwide. WHERE NEXT? There are three main challenges in stroke management. To increase the body of reliable evidence from large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the safety, effectiveness, and cost of promising treatments (eg, thrombolysis, antithrombotic therapy, neuroprotection, and interventional recanalisation, alone and in combination) in a wide range of patients around the world. To facilitate the widespread development of stroke units, delivery of organised stroke care, and emergency transport of patients with stroke to appropriate stroke centres. And finally, to improve the uptake of effective therapies into clinical practice (eg, by widely disseminating the ASA and EUSI guidelines).

### Addressing disparities in acute stroke management and prognosis [^116kekVW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

There are now abundant data demonstrating disparities in acute stroke management and prognosis; however, interventions to reduce these disparities remain limited. Additionally, implementation of the evidence‐based recommendations that do exist remains challenging, with scarce data on the comparative effectiveness of strategies to address disparities. The 8 Ds of stroke care (detection, dispatch, delivery, door, data, decision, drug, and disposition) can be a framework for approaching the initial steps of acute stroke care during which there is a complex interplay between the individual, organization, and other structures driving disparities (Figure). Breaking down this complex relationship into its components, identifying appropriate metrics of success, and having robust data collections systems that are routinely interrogated to drive iterative change is essential to monitor and achieve equity.

Figure.
The 8 Ds of stroke care.

During the 2023 Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem‐Solving (HEADS‐UP) Pre‐Symposium to the American Heart Association International Stroke Conference, researchers came together to discuss how to most effectively use implementation science to advance stroke equity. Implementation science is the scientific study of methods for the successful uptake of evidence‐based practices into health care policy and clinical care. This review aims to extend that conversation by providing critical review of the current landscape of disparities in acute stroke care and highlighting opportunities to use implementation science to reduce disparities throughout the early care continuum. Although this review will largely focus on racial or ethnic inequities as that is where the preponderance of research exists, it is important to acknowledge that members of other historically oppressed communities, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning+ people, disabled people, or those who live in rural communities, also experience disparities in stroke. These communities comprise a diverse range of people with a variety of personal and social identities that interconnect to create differing experiences of discrimination and privilege within society. The role of intersectionality in stroke equity, therefore, is also essential to acknowledge and incorporate into interventions. We hope that through this critical discussion of evidence‐based stroke care across the acute stroke care continuum, from prehospital management to the hospital course, we can advance the conversation of how to move the field from describing disparities to working to abolish them.

### The heart brain team and patient-centered management of ischemic stroke [^111YQYFo]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of acute ischemic stroke

Medical treatment

Patients admitted with ischemic stroke typically have an enormous burden of cardiovascular comorbidities that confer a higher risk of in-hospital adverse events. In addition, stroke is associated with major alterations in ANS and hemodynamics that may provoke atrioventricular block, AF, ventricular tachycardia, and acute myocardial infarction. Studies have shown that serious cardiac arrythmia and myocardial infarction complicate 25% and 2% of ischemic strokes, respectively. This perplexes the acute management of stroke and emphasizes the need for an integrated team approach to address these challenges (Table 2).

Table 2
The Role of the Heart Brain Team in the Medical Management of Acute Ischemic Stroke

Mechanical thrombectomy

Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has established its position as a key element of stroke care in contemporary practice. However, whether to leverage the technical skills and the existing extensive catheterization laboratory infrastructure to facilitate timely provision of MT to all potential candidates remains an area of ongoing debate. Implementation of the "interventional" heart-brain team is evidently more complicated than a "noninterventional" heart-brain team, and requires deliberate assessment of the following key questions:

Are the current systems and processes for acute stroke care adequate to accommodate the growing needs for endovascular interventions both in developed and in developing countries? If not, will there be a need for incorporating interventional cardiologists and established primary PCI centers in the stroke workforce? Will it increase patient access and improve overall outcomes, and what training, credentialing, and quality metric issues need to be considered? Are MT outcomes already optimized, or is there room for improvement? Can the blending of the immense and diverse experiences that exist in each specialty lead to breakthrough innovations that would further revolutionize the management of stroke?

Open discourse to address these questions is important to identify opportunities for further improvement in acute stroke both in research and in clinical care.

### Stroke [^114WQcP1]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is a major public-health burden worldwide. Prevention programmes are essential to reduce the incidence of stroke and to prevent the all but inevitable stroke epidemic, which will hit less developed countries particularly hard as their populations age and adopt lifestyles of the more developed countries. Efficient, effective, and rapid diagnosis of stroke and transient ischaemic attack is crucial. The diagnosis of the exact type and cause of stroke, which requires brain imaging as well as traditional clinical skills, is also important when it will influence management. The treatment of acute stroke, the prevention and management of the many complications of stroke, and the prevention of recurrent stroke and other serious vascular events are all improving rapidly. However, stroke management will only be most effective when delivered in the context of an organised, expert, educated, and enthusiastic stroke service that can react quickly to the needs of patients at all stages from onset to recovery.

### Chinese stroke association guidelines for clinical management of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases: executive summary and 2023 update [^1136uUnM]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

China is one of the countries with the highest burden of stroke. Implementing multidimensional management guidelines will help clinicians practise evidence-based care, improve patient outcomes and alleviate societal burdens. This update of the 2019 edition will provide the latest comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search on MEDLINE (via PubMed) up to 31 August 2023. The writing team established the recommendations through multiple rounds of online and offline discussions. Each recommendation was graded using the evidence grading algorithm developed by the Chinese Stroke Association (CSA). The draft was reviewed and finalised by the CSA Stroke Guidelines Writing Committee.

Results

This update included revisions of 15 existing recommendations and 136 new recommendations in the following areas of stroke care: emergency assessment and diagnosis of ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, acute-phase reperfusion therapy, evaluation of underlying mechanisms, antithrombotic therapy, prevention and treatment of complications, and risk factor management.

Conclusions

This guideline updated the recommendations for the clinical management of ischaemic cerebrovascular disease from 2019.

### Insights into a personalized management of blood pressure in acute stroke [^11352Jg6]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Blood pressure management in acute stroke has long been a matter of debate. Epidemiological data show that high blood pressure is associated with death, disability and early stroke recurrence, whereas the pathophysiological rationale for ensuring elevated blood pressure in order maintain adequate cerebral perfusion remains a pertinent argument, especially in ischaemic stroke.

Recent Findings

The European Stroke Organisation Guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage provide recommendations for the appropriate management of blood pressure in various clinical acute stroke settings.

Summary

In this narrative review, we provide specific updates on blood pressure management in ICH, blood pressure management in the setting of reperfusion therapies for ischaemic stroke, and the evidence for the use of induced hypertension in patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the light of the recent guidelines.

Table 1
Key Components for Implementation in Each Type of Service Recommended by the World Stroke Organization Roadmap for Quality Stroke Services

A stroke unit is the cornerstone of stroke care. It is a dedicated section within the stroke center where beds are explicitly allocated for stroke patients. The unit is staffed by a well‐trained multidisciplinary team, including physicians, nurses, and therapists. At a minimum, this team should include physiotherapists and speech therapists, but ideally, it would also encompass occupational therapists, social workers, psychologists, nutritionists, pharmacists, and other specialists. The team operates according to standardized protocols.

Stroke units are an effective strategy for managing acute stroke, facilitating the timely delivery of reperfusion therapies such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy, as well as early rehabilitation. Randomized controlled trials have shown that care in a stroke unit is associated with significantly reduced odds of poor outcomes (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.69–0.87]), mortality (OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.66–0.88]), and death or dependency (OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.66–0.85]), compared with treatment in general wards. Observational studies have demonstrated the benefits of a Minimal Stroke Unit (without reperfusion therapy), as evidenced by the experience in Guinea. In this setting, a stroke unit was established with 3 beds and equipment to monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, although it did not provide reperfusion therapy. This initiative led to significantly lower in‐hospital mortality (7% versus 22%; P < 0.0001) and a reduction in complications (4% versus 28%; P < 0.001) compared with the period before the unit's establishment. Stroke units can be categorized into acute, rehabilitation, or comprehensive types. The Acute Stroke Unit is equipped with monitored beds for acute care, typically accommodating patients up to 72 hours from the onset of the symptoms. It offers the capability to administer intravenous thrombolytic treatment. This unit may be a dedicated section within the emergency department. It can either be exclusively for stroke patients or share space with a neurology or vascular unit, handling cases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and other acute conditions. The Rehabilitation Stroke Unit is staffed with a complete rehabilitation team, commencing treatment after the patient's stabilization, usually 48 to 72 hours after stroke onset. The typical duration of a patient's stay in a rehabilitation stroke unit can vary considerably, from 8 to 70 days, with a median of 15 days, depending on several factors, such as the severity of the stroke, the patient's functional status at admission, and regional practices. A Comprehensive Stroke Unit combines acute and rehabilitation care within the same facility.

### Addressing disparities in acute stroke management and prognosis [^111gMJFq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Impact of Disparities in Acute Stroke Care

The long‐term impact of disparities in acute stroke care cannot be underestimated. Pooled patient‐level data from 7 endovascular thrombectomy trials by the HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices) collaboration demonstrated that every 10 minutes of earlier treatment resulted in a median of 39 additional days of disability‐free life and 106 additional days of life in functional independence. The consistent trend of longer time to treatment for Black and Hispanic people experiencing stroke, therefore, has direct implications for long‐term disability and independence after stroke. There are also economic consequences in the form of costs associated with prolonged care and rehabilitation for those not receiving timely treatment. The impact is not merely on the patient and their family but on the entire community. Disparities in poststroke mortality have consistently been found across racial and ethnic identities and geographic location. Moreover, the public health burden of stroke, as measured by disability‐adjusted life years ranks higher in Black people than Hispanic and White people. Person‐centered outcomes, and specifically health‐related quality of life, are increasingly recognized as key components of understanding the public health impact of stroke and other diseases on communities. Racial and ethnic disparities have been reported in health‐related quality of life among survivors with stroke, with lower health utility scores among Black and Hispanic people with stroke as compared with White people.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with a disproportionate burden on low- and middle-income countries. Critical elements of guideline-based stroke care developed in high-income countries are not applicable to resource-limited settings, where lack of access to neuroimaging prevents clinicians from distinguishing between ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, requiring challenging clinical decision-making, particularly in the acute setting. We discuss strategies for acute inpatient management of stroke of unknown type with a focus on blood pressure management and antiplatelet therapy when neuroimaging is unavailable, and review some of the challenges and strategies for successfully implementing stroke unit care in resource-limited health care settings.

### Crisis resource management and high-performing teams in hyperacute stroke care [^113sDjU1]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Management of stroke patients in the acute setting is a high-stakes task with several challenges including the need for rapid assessment and treatment, maintenance of high-performing team dynamics, management of cognitive load affecting providers, and factors impacting team communication. Crisis resource management (CRM) provides a framework to tackle these challenges and is well established in other resuscitative disciplines. The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed a potential quality gap in emergency preparedness and the ability to adapt to emergency scenarios in real time.

Methods

Available resources in the literature in other disciplines and expert consensus were used to identify key elements of CRM as they apply to acute stroke management.

Results

We outline essential ingredients of CRM as a means to mitigate nontechnical challenges providers face during acute stroke care. These strategies include situational awareness, triage and prioritization, mitigation of cognitive load, team member role clarity, communication, and debriefing. Incorporation of CRM along with simulation is an established tool in other resuscitative disciplines and can be incorporated into acute stroke care.

Conclusions

As stroke care processes evolve during these trying times, the importance of consistent, safe, and efficacious care facilitated by CRM principles offers a unique avenue to alleviate human factors and support high-performing teams.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^11543jnT]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with > 100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format. Results- These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings. Conclusions- These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Hospital stroke systems — It is recommended that stroke systems of care be developed so that fibrinolytic‑eligible patients and mechanical thrombectomy–eligible patients receive treatment in the fastest achievable onset‑to‑treatment time. Supporting data note IV tissue‑type plasminogen activator may be given up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset, and in alteplase‑treated cohorts, treatment started more rapidly was associated with reduced in‑hospital mortality, reduced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, increased independent ambulation at discharge, and increased discharge to home. For endovascular therapy, pooled trials found the odds of improved disability outcomes declined with longer time from symptom onset to arterial puncture, and to ensure access for those presenting in the 6‑ to 24‑hour window, evaluation and treatment should be as rapid as possible.

### Acute ischaemic stroke: challenges for the intensivist [^112vgdnk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide an update about the rapidly developing changes in the critical care management of acute ischaemic stroke patients.

Methods

A narrative review was conducted in five general areas of acute ischaemic stroke management: reperfusion strategies, anesthesia for endovascular thrombectomy, intensive care unit management, intracranial complications, and ethical considerations.

Results

The introduction of effective reperfusion strategies, including IV thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, has revolutionized the management of acute ischaemic stroke and transformed outcomes for patients. Acute therapeutic efforts are targeted to restoring blood flow to the ischaemic penumbra before irreversible tissue injury has occurred. To optimize patient outcomes, secondary insults, such as hypotension, hyperthermia, or hyperglycaemia, that can extend the penumbral area must also be prevented or corrected. The ICU management of acute ischaemic stroke patients, therefore, focuses on the optimization of systemic physiological homeostasis, management of intracranial complications, and neurological and haemodynamic monitoring after reperfusion therapies. Meticulous blood pressure management is of central importance in improving outcomes, particularly in patients that have undergone reperfusion therapies.

Conclusions

While consensus guidelines are available to guide clinical decision making after acute ischaemic stroke, there is limited high-quality evidence for many of the recommended interventions. However, a bundle of medical, endovascular, and surgical strategies, when applied in a timely and consistent manner, can improve long-term stroke outcomes.

### Self-management: a systematic review of outcome measures adopted in self-management interventions for stroke [^111iVD1c]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is a major cause of death and disability world-wide. By 2020 stroke, together with coronary-artery disease, are predicted to be the leading causes of global lost healthy life-years. Stroke represents an often devastating disruption to life, the majority of survivors experiencing some degree of impairment requiring additional care or support 1 year post-stroke.

Stroke is an acute event, but may result in significant long-term impact for the individual, such as social isolation, mood disturbance, communication difficulties and reduction in mobility and life roles. Recovery following stroke is complex and multidimensional, encompassing bio-medical, psychological and sociological elements. Engagement in self-management practices by individuals with long-term conditions has been suggested as key to promoting recovery and is cited as a means of empowerment and facilitator of improved health outcomes.

Self-management is a prominent issue in UK health policy and has been identified as a key priority for health by organisations independent of the UK government. Self-management can be defined as the "active management by individuals of their treatment, symptoms, lifestyle, physical and psychological consequences inherent with living with a chronic condition". Self-management is an attractive initiative in managing the increasing burden on health and social care resources and reducing associated costs; the assumption being that effective self-management by an individual reduces their healthcare utilisation. Healthcare professionals are well placed to promote the effective self-management of stroke.

Self-management interventions (SMIs) are designed to enable people to manage their health more effectively. Evaluation therefore must consider two key areas; firstly whether people develop the skills to manage their own health and secondly, if this consequently results in better health. SMIs operate over multiple dimensions and within different contexts. As such evaluation is complex, not least due to variation in delivery, culture of the sponsoring healthcare organisation and anticipated goals and outcomes.

### Keynote address [^117ASMvm]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

"Acute strokes are here to stay": this could be the sad conclusion after decades of stroke research. Generalized prevention of ischemic stroke is not fully successful. After the decline in stroke incidence observed by 1970, partly related to better management of vascular risk factors, there has again been an increase in stroke frequency all around the world. This phenomenon may be explained by the lack of educational modalities for modification of lifestyle behavior, the small impact of high-risk individual prevention strategy, and the lack of rationale and guidelines for multiple approaches. In the meantime, the benefits of acute intensive management of stroke have been demonstrated. There is now considerable evidence that careful monitoring and management of general and cerebral functions in a dedicated stroke unit or by a specialized stroke team are superior to management in a neurologic or general ward. Currently, one way of optimizing limited personnel resources is to connect the stroke unit of a main hospital with peripheral hospitals via a computer network. Experts in the central stroke unit can then make on-line evaluations of CT and ultrasound examinations performed in the local hospital and recommend the best course of patient management. This new approach of treating stroke as an emergency will also require educational programs directed at the general public, general practitioners, and primary and emergency department physicians, to teach the recognition of stroke symptoms and the importance of treating stroke with the same urgency as for myocardial infarction (MI).

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to management of cerebral edema (general principles), AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that patients with large territorial cerebral and cerebellar infarctions are at high risk for developing brain swelling and herniation. Discuss care options and possible outcomes quickly with patients (if possible) and family or next of kin. Ensure that medical professionals and caregivers ascertain and include patient-centered preferences in shared decision-making, especially during prognosis formation and when considering interventions or limitations in care.

Strategies to Improve Implementation of Stroke Care Interventions

A potential strategy for integrating these varied components is through a stroke learning health system. A learning health system is an evolution in the quality improvement process where there is routine evaluation of data collected within a health care system that then informs clinical decision‐making through interdisciplinary expertise in consultation with patients, families, and community stakeholders. It is unique in its adaptability and lack of a time‐limited focus, which is typically characteristic of quality improvement initiatives. In stroke, the scope of a learning health system could encompass prevention, acute treatment, or even a holistic approach to improve the experience and outcomes from symptom onset to the patient's return to the community. One example comes from the Implementation of Best Practices for Acute Stroke Care‐Developing and Optimizing Regional Systems of Stroke Care (IMPROVE) stroke care project, which sought to increase the use of thrombolysis and reduce door‐to‐needle times in 9 hub hospitals and their spoke sites across 4 US states. This group engaged the public, EMS, and acute stroke hospitals to create a living document version of the manual of operations that could be updated with new knowledge from published evidence or the consortium itself in concert with up‐to‐date data to evaluate program effectiveness. In another example, the Chinese Stroke Center Alliance arose from the recognition of the need to improve access to high‐quality stroke care broadly and to monitor performance in an iterative fashion to identify interventions that performed best for particular subgroups of people.

### Imaging of acute ischemic stroke [^117Loq9q]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

For decades, imaging has been a critical component of the diagnostic evaluation and management of patients suspected of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). With each new advance in the treatment of AIS, the role of imaging has expanded in scope, sophistication, and importance in selecting patients who stand to benefit from potential therapies. Although the field of stroke imaging has been evolving for many years, there have been several major recent changes. Most notably, in late 2017, the window for treatment expanded to 24 h from onset of stroke symptoms in selected patients. Furthermore, for those patients in expanded time windows, guidelines issued in early 2018 now recommend the use of "advanced" imaging techniques in the acute setting, including CT perfusion and MRI, to guide therapeutic decision-making. With these and other changes, the emergency radiologist must be prepared to handle a growing volume and complexity of AIS imaging. This article reviews the various imaging modalities and techniques employed in the imaging of AIS patients, with an emphasis on recommendations from recent randomized controlled trials and national consensus guidelines.

Expert Guidance for Implementation

The WSO's Implementation Task Force has actively promoted stroke care development across 30 countries. Key focus areas include stroke surveillance, prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation, with more than 150 global specialists involved in all continents. For acute care, the task force advises the professionals on developing new stroke services and networks and how to qualify them, as well as implementing protocols for acute treatment, including general management, thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy. A strong educational program is an essential part of the implementation. As part of its capacity‐building efforts, the WSO Future Stroke Leaders program has, over the past 4 years, trained 57 professionals from more than 40 countries. These participants come from various fields, including medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. This 2‐year diverse training ensures that the next generation of stroke care leaders is well‐equipped to meet global needs. The Future Leaders play a crucial role in the implementation task force.

Certification of Stroke Centers

The Certification of Stroke Services is an effective approach to guaranteeing the implementation of evidence‐based strategies within stroke centers. It guides hospitals to enhance their quality of care, ultimately reducing mortality and disability among stroke patients. Generally, an on‐site audit conducted for certification programs is a powerful tool for driving changes in processes and practices and motivating hospital managers to adopt critical, evidence‐based components of stroke care.

The WSO Certification program, developed in collaboration with the Iberoamerican Stroke Organization, was launched in March 2021. Its goal is to continuously improve services and comprehensive care within the region, with stroke centers committed as key organizers and trainers of the local network. The program aims to increase the quality of stroke care and improve patient outcomes. The certification is crucial in guiding national stroke care through evidence‐based pathways that address the full spectrum of care.

### 2018 guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^117Wx1oY]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke in a single document. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 guidelines and subsequent updates.

Methods

Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Strict adherence to the American Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. The members of the writing group unanimously approved all recommendations except when relations with industry precluded members voting. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 4 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2015 Class of Recommendations and Levels of Evidence and the new American Heart Association guidelines format.

Results

These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings.

Conclusions

These guidelines are based on the best evidence currently available. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Evidence in Action: Closing the Gap Between Research and Implementation

Achieving successful knowledge translation and implementation of evidence‐based interventions in clinical practice is often difficult. The evidence translation gap is highlighted by the estimated 17 years it takes for 14% of original research to be implemented into clinical practice. The stroke discipline is not immune to the evidence translation gap despite advancements in acute stroke therapies. Implementation research has been identified as a solution to closing this gap as it improves access, reorganizes and coordinates systems of care, assists clinicians and patients to change behaviors, provides reminders and point‐of‐care decision support tools, and strengthens the patient–clinician relationship. Importantly, implementation research within neurology has the potential to increase uptake of evidence‐based interventions into practice by focusing on the clinicians using the research, the context in which implementation occurs, and the factors influencing implementation. Implementation research can also generate new knowledge about barriers to uptake of proven interventions into routine clinical care, and what strategies are effective in overcoming those barriers. However, implementation of evidence‐based interventions into practice is a complex process with estimated failure rates of between 30% and 90%. Based on prior studies, a number of pragmatic strategies have been shown to improve implementation research success at the local level (Box 1).

### Chinese stroke association guidelines for clinical management of cerebrovascular disorders: executive summary and 2019 update of clinical management of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases [^112ibhq1]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is characterised by high disability, fatality and recurrence rate, and brings a huge burden to family and society. Although the incidence and prevalence of stroke have declined worldwide, there are 250 million new cases of a stroke every year in China, and this number is still growing. The ischaemic cerebrovascular disease accounts for 60%–80% of stroke, including ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). There are many classification methodologies of ischaemic stroke. Using the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria, ischaemic stroke can be divided into large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small artery occlusion, stroke of other determined aetiology and stroke of undetermined aetiology.

It is of vital significance to identify and diagnose ischaemic stroke as early as possible. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that thrombolysis and endovascular therapy remarkably improve the prognosis of patients with acute ischaemic stroke. In addition, timely starting appropriate antithrombotic treatment in patient with minor stroke and high-risk TIA can reduce stroke recurrence rate without increasing the rate of haemorrhage and mortality (the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Non-Disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE), the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trials, etc). In addition, the survival rate and prognosis of patients can be improved with timely intensive care, rehabilitation, preventing and treating complications. Stroke is related to hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, smoking, drinking and other correctable risk factors, improving living style consciously and monitoring chronic diseases regularly also help patients avoid recurrent stroke and long-term survival.

The method of literature review, evaluation of level of evidence and grade of recommendation have all been published previously. This guideline is one of the seven guidelines organised by the Chinese Stroke Association on the recommendation of diagnosing and managing ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases. It contains nine sections: definitions, emergency assessment and diagnosis, reperfusion therapy, antiplatelet therapy, other treatment in the acute phase, general supportive care, complication management, early evaluation and diagnosis of aetiology and pathogenesis of ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, intervention on aetiology and pathogenesis, management of risk factors and long-term prevention. The full text of this guideline is available in the online supplementary material.

### Stroke systems of care framework… [^114gm5sN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The Framework highlights the four key components of stroke systems of care that effectively treat patients from the time they have a stroke. Overview Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the United States. State health departments and other organizations can help reduce the number of premature deaths and disabilities from stroke by applying the strategies outlined in the Stroke Systems of Care Framework. The Framework highlights the four key components of stroke systems of care: 1) Pre-hospital 2) EMS 3) Acute Stroke Treatment and 4) Stroke Rehabilitation. These components effectively treat patients from the time they have a stroke, through emergency medical services transport to the hospital and in-hospital care, and through their discharge from the hospital and to outpatient care.

The Framework provides links to a wide range of tools and resources, developed by the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program grantees, that can help health departments establish or enhance support for integrated stroke systems of care in their state or community. Explore these resources and adapt the strategies to support your program's stroke activities.
