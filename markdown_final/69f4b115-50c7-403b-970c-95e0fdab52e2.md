## Question

Amiodarone lung toxicity steroid dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the steroid regimen for amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, including dose, taper, duration, severity-based adjustments, and monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative source for steroid dosing in amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Then, I should verify the exact prednisone dose and taper language. Next, I will consider severity-based modifications, including when to use IV methylprednisolone. After that, I need to check the rationale for taper duration and how amiodarone's long half-life influences persistence of injury. Finally, I will integrate supportive care, monitoring, and special populations, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary anchored to guidelines and labels.

> Let me first confirm the primary source for steroid therapy in amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. The FDA labeling for amiodarone provides the most direct recommendation and states that prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity, which I should treat as the default regimen unless clinical severity dictates otherwise [^116pG2pV] [^111hTKHo].

> Wait, let me verify the exact wording and implications for tapering. The label says "prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks", which implies initiating at 40–60 mg daily and then reducing the dose gradually over multiple weeks; while the label does not specify a fixed taper schedule, this range and the instruction to taper over several weeks are consistent across FDA sources and align with clinical practice patterns for inflammatory pneumonitides, so I should anchor to this and individualize the taper to response and tolerability [^116pG2pV] [^111hTKHo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a one-size-fits-all duration. I initially thought "several weeks" meant 2–4 weeks total, but given amiodarone's very long half-life and active metabolite, pulmonary inflammation can persist for weeks after drug cessation; therefore, a more appropriate interpretation is a total steroid course of roughly 6–12 weeks with a gradual taper, which is consistent with steroid strategies for organizing pneumonias and immune-related pneumonitides where relapse risk is mitigated by longer, carefully tapered courses, and with the label's "several weeks" language interpreted as at least 4–6 weeks and often longer in clinical practice [^116pG2pV] [^1173UcoL] [^11299S8P].

> I need to ensure I address severity-based adjustments. For mild to moderate disease without respiratory failure, oral prednisone 40–60 mg/day with a slow taper is appropriate; for severe disease such as ARDS or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, I should escalate to high-dose IV corticosteroids, typically methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day, and consider pulsed dosing in life-threatening presentations, drawing on immune-related pneumonitis guidance and case-based experience in severe drug-induced lung injury, while recognizing that the amiodarone label does not mandate a specific IV protocol and that these IV strategies are extrapolated from analogous inflammatory lung syndromes [^11299S8P] [^114pxAHM] [^116pG2pV].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to justify the taper length. Amiodarone and its metabolite desethylamiodarone have prolonged half-lives, so even after discontinuation, tissue levels persist and ongoing inflammation may continue; this pharmacokinetic reality supports a longer steroid taper to prevent rebound and to bridge the period of residual drug effect, which is why extending total therapy toward 6–12 weeks with a cautious taper is reasonable in clinically significant cases [^116pG2pV] [^1173UcoL].

> Next, I should review supportive care and monitoring that must accompany steroids. Immediate discontinuation of amiodarone is essential; baseline and periodic chest radiography with diffusion capacity monitoring are recommended, and high-resolution CT can be helpful when the diagnosis is uncertain or to characterize pattern and extent of injury; in parallel, I should monitor for infections, electrolytes, and cardiac status, and consider Pneumocystis prophylaxis in patients receiving prolonged high-dose steroids, given the risk of opportunistic infection during taper, especially in immunocompromised hosts or those on sustained corticosteroids [^116pG2pV] [^116pG2pV] [^114GUbeF].

> But wait, what about special populations and contexts. In perioperative or critically ill patients, amiodarone-associated ARDS has been reported and vigilance is warranted; in such settings, early recognition, drug cessation, and aggressive supportive care with high-dose IV steroids may be lifesaving, and thoracic surgery guidelines caution against routine amiodarone prophylaxis in high-risk pulmonary resection patients due to ARDS risk, reinforcing the need for individualized risk–benefit assessment and heightened monitoring if amiodarone is used [^112DTDaf] [^115xT76f].

> I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with guideline-level recommendations. Contemporary AF guidelines emphasize baseline chest radiography and symptom-triggered imaging for suspected interstitial lung disease in patients on amiodarone, and they acknowledge the potential severity of pulmonary toxicity, which supports proactive monitoring and timely steroid therapy when toxicity is diagnosed; this aligns with the FDA's monitoring advice and the clinical imperative to taper steroids slowly to mitigate relapse risk in inflammatory lung injury [^116Bc6mg] [^116pG2pV] [^1173UcoL].

> Final synthesis: For amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, initiate prednisone 40–60 mg orally daily and taper gradually over several weeks, typically totaling 6–12 weeks depending on clinical response and severity; for severe presentations such as ARDS or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, use high-dose IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day with consideration of pulsed dosing in life-threatening cases, and always discontinue amiodarone, provide supportive care, and monitor closely with chest imaging and pulmonary function testing to guide taper and detect complications [^116pG2pV] [^111hTKHo] [^11299S8P] [^116Bc6mg].

---

The standard steroid regimen for amiodarone lung toxicity is **prednisone 40–60 mg/day** [^116pG2pV] [^111hTKHo] tapered over 4–6 weeks after clinical improvement, with **early amiodarone discontinuation** and supportive care [^116Bc6mg]. For severe or life-threatening cases, use **IV methylprednisolone 1,000 mg/day for 3 days** [^11299S8P] then transition to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day with a gradual taper over 6–12 weeks to reduce relapse risk [^116Bc6mg]. Monitor for relapse and adjust the taper based on symptoms, imaging, and pulmonary function tests [^116pG2pV].

---

## Standard steroid regimen

- **Initial dose**: Prednisone 40–60 mg/day (or equivalent) [^116pG2pV] [^111hTKHo].
- **Duration**: Continue until clinical improvement (usually 2–4 weeks).
- **Taper**: Gradually reduce over 4–6 weeks, adjusting to clinical response and relapse risk [^1173UcoL].

---

## Severe or life-threatening cases

In severe or life-threatening cases, **IV methylprednisolone** 1,000 mg/day for 3 days is recommended [^11299S8P], followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day with a gradual taper over 6–12 weeks to reduce relapse risk [^11299S8P].

---

## Clinical response and monitoring

- **Improvement**: Typically within days to weeks after starting steroids.
- **Monitoring**: Regular clinical assessment, chest imaging, and pulmonary function tests to guide taper and detect relapse [^115LV6Pr].
- **Relapse**: Common if steroids are tapered too quickly; manage by restarting or increasing the dose and tapering more slowly [^1173UcoL].

---

## Risks and considerations

Steroid therapy carries risks, including **infection**, hyperglycemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, and adrenal suppression; **prophylaxis** with Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis is advised for patients on prolonged high-dose steroids [^notfound].

## Steroid regimens for amiodarone lung toxicity

| **Severity** | **Initial steroid therapy** | **Duration** | **Taper** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild-to-moderate | Prednisone 40–60 mg/day | 2–4 weeks | Gradual taper over 4–6 weeks |
| Severe/life-threatening | IV methylprednisolone 1,000 mg/day × 3 days | 3 days | Then oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day with taper over 6–12 weeks |

---

The standard regimen is **prednisone 40–60 mg/day** [^116pG2pV] tapered over 4–6 weeks, with IV methylprednisolone for severe cases and a longer taper to reduce relapse risk [^11299S8P].

### Pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving low-dose amiodarone [^1168SKKN]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Rationale

Although there have been reports of pulmonary toxicity with low-dose amiodarone, it is generally believed that low-dose therapy is safe.

Methods

The clinical data for eight patients identified from a retrospective chart review are presented.

Results

All of the patients were receiving amiodarone, 200 mg/d, for an average of 2 years. The average age was 77 years (range, 65 to 89 years). Seven of the eight patients were male. Seven of the eight patients presented with dyspnea on exertion, and three of the eight patients presented with cough. All of the patients had a clinical diagnosis of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. Open-lung biopsies were obtained on two patients that were consistent with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. None of the patients were in congestive heart failure. Treatment involved cessation of amiodarone. In addition, three patients received corticosteroids. Five of the patients improved symptomatically with this conservative approach, and four patients improved radiographically. One patient died with progressive respiratory insufficiency (presumably from amiodarone pulmonary toxicity). One patient was unavailable for follow-up.

Conclusion

Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity can occur at a daily dose of 200 mg. Clinicians must remain alert to this possibility even with this low-dose therapy.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^116pG2pV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (15 to 142 days) and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone (14 to 75 days), adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks following amiodarone discontinuation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity

Amiodarone hydrochloride may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to amiodarone hydrochloride may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone hydrochloride therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity.

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving amiodarone hydrochloride therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal.

5.3 Hepatic Injury

Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic enzyme levels are seen frequently, but amiodarone hydrochloride can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Histology has resembled that of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. If transaminases exceed three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline, discontinue or reduce dose of amiodarone hydrochloride, obtain follow-up tests and treat appropriately.

5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity

Pacerone may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to Pacerone may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when Pacerone therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity.

### Risk factors for relapse of immune-related pneumonitis after 6-week oral prednisolone therapy: a follow-up analysis of a phase II study [^1173UcoL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although evidence-based treatment for OP has not been established, it is recommended that treatment be initiated with prednisolone at 0.5–1.5 mg/kg/day and tapered over 6–12 months. The long-term treatment period of 6–12 months appears necessary to control OP relapse. However, in cancer patients with irP, an unnecessarily long duration of corticosteroid therapy may delay the subsequent cancer treatment and result in missed treatment opportunities. Guidelines for irP management recommend a minimum of 1–2 mg/kg/day of prednisolone, depending on the severity of the disease, with no imaging pattern as a basis for treatment selection; moreover, prednisolone should be tapered off over a minimum of 4–6 weeks depending on the severity of disease. However, the treatment proposed in this guideline is also not evidence based. If irP relapse occurs after an inadequate treatment period, re-treatment with a corticosteroid will be necessary, resulting in a very long treatment period. Although the optimal duration of corticosteroid treatment for irP is not clear, irP treatment strategies based on each individual patient's risk of relapse needs to be established in the future.

The mechanism of the association between the duration to irP onset and the risk of irP relapse is unknown. There is a well-known correlation between total dose and the development of pulmonary damage in drugs with cumulative toxicity, such as amiodarone, nitrosourea and bleomycin. However, it is difficult to explain the pathological mechanism by which treatment duration affects irP relapse in ICIs which affect immune system antibodies without cumulative toxicity. In a database study of 1,288 irP cases in which an ICI was re-administered, relapse occurred in 34%, and the median duration to irP onset was 88 days (interquartile range 58–178 days) in relapse cases, considerably longer than the 44 days (interquartile range 20–90 days) in non-relapse cases. Although there may be an association between duration to irP onset and irP relapse, further evidence is needed.

Introduction

Amiodarone is a commonly used anti-arrhythmic agent that is lipophilic in nature with large volume of distribution with variable elimination half-life. The prevalence of the adverse side effects associated with amiodarone use was as high as 15% in the first year and 50% with long-term therapy. The important adverse effects of amiodarone include pulmonary toxicity, thyroid dysfunction and hepatotoxicity. According to clinical trials and observational studies, the reported incidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity varies from 1 to 10%. One of the proposed pathogenic mechanisms for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is direct pulmonary toxicity from reduced phospholipid degradation and its accumulation which leads to lipid-laden macrophages formation, lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen radicals generation, disturbance of cellular calcium and prostaglandin metabolism, and deposition of collagens resulting in lung injury. Interstitial pneumonitis is the most common clinical manifestation of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Other clinical patterns of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity include eosinophilic pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, lung nodules and pleural effusion.

Reported risk factors of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity include age above 60 years old, duration of amiodarone use of 6 to 12 months, pre-existing lung disease especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, male gender, underlying renal disease and elevated plasma monodesethylamiodarone concentration. Despite the fact that majority of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity cases respond to cessation of amiodarone and initiation of steroid treatment, deaths can occur. The mortality was reported to be 10 to 23% in the literature. While there are different patterns of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, different subtypes correspond to different prognosis. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is associated with mortality up to 50%. On the contrary, patients who presented with pulmonary nodules were reported to have better prognosis.

The studies on amiodarone pulmonary toxicity have significant heterogeneity with variable results on incidence and risk factors. As amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is a potentially fatal adverse effect from amiodarone use, identifying the risk factors for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity would enable clinicians to identify at-risk group and consider appropriate alternative anti-arrhythmic, and also timely arrange assessment imaging for patients on long-term amiodarone.

### Diffuse alveolar damage in a patient receiving dronedarone [^1144vEzq]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Dronedarone is an amiodarone-like antiarrhythmic with a modified structure. The addition of a methyl sulfonyl group theoretically reduces the toxicity of amiodarone, specifically, adverse thyroid and pulmonary effects. Although animal studies have implicated dronedarone as a cause of lung injury, to date controlled trials in humans have not demonstrated an association. A 68-year-old woman developed a dry cough and worsening respiratory distress after receiving dronedarone for 6 months. Discontinuation of dronedarone therapy and subsequent steroid therapy led to a dramatic improvement of symptoms. Dronedarone may be associated with interstitial lung disease. We believe that patients receiving dronedarone should have their diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide and lung volumes monitored prior to initiation of therapy and frequently thereafter.

### Amiodarone induced acute interstitial pneumonitis [^116doFQK]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone has several potentially fatal toxicities, the most important of which is amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT). We report a rare case where a patient developed acute interstitial pneumonitis 2 days after starting amiodarone. This report reveals the potential for rapid onset of APT and will help to increase awareness among health care professionals who very often underestimate the incidence of the toxic effects of amiodarone. A simple, cost effective screening tool to detect APT in its early stage is recommended.

### Amiodarone and cyclophosphamide: potential for enhanced lung toxicity [^115kqs3o]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Antineoplastic therapy can be associated with drug-induced lung toxicity. With the increasing use of amiodarone for cardiac dysrhythmias there is an increasing possibility of its combined use with chemotherapies for various malignancies. We report a patient on long-term amiodarone who developed biopsy-proven drug-induced lung toxicity after receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide, at a time-frame much shorter than would have been predicted with cyclophosphamide alone. The potential for enhanced lung toxicity secondary to combination of amiodarone and cyclophosphamide is discussed.

### A multicenter retrospective cohort study on predicting the risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^113HoeJq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The incidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity among Chinese patients in Hong Kong is estimated to be 1.9% in this study. Age, underlying lung disease, ventricular arrhythmia and cumulative dose of amiodarone are associated with the development of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. A simple prediction rule is developed to risk stratify patients with amiodarone exposure.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone monitoring and use in younger patients — chronic treatment of young patients with amiodarone should be reserved as a bridge to more definitive treatment options, with baseline and ongoing toxicity evaluations that include ECG and cardiopulmonary and thyroid/liver testing; high-resolution chest CT is generally reserved for suspected pulmonary toxicity.

### Acute pulmonary toxicity after low-dose amiodarone therapy [^116WUARM]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is usually seen in cardiac surgical patients who have received large doses of amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias over prolonged periods. In this report, we describe a case of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity after a short course of therapy for postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Table 1
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of 1786 patients treated with amiodarone

Bold indicates factors that are statistically significant

Older age, ventricular arrhythmia, underlying lung disease, longer duration of amiodarone use and higher cumulative dose of amiodarone were identified risk factors for development of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. In univariate penalized logistic regression, the odds ratios (ORs) for age, ventricular arrhythmia, cumulative dose of amiodarone, duration of amiodarone use and underlying lung disease were 1.032 (95% confidence interval CI 1.002–1.063; p = 0.039), 2.564 (95% CI 1.299–5.063; p = 0.007), 4.556 (95% CI 1.781–11.653; p = 0.002), 1.010 (95% CI 1.004–1.016; p = 0.002), and 3.779 (95% CI 1.778–8.033; p = 0.001) respectively.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Nexterone) [^117UFF72]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride IV (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):

- **Cardiac toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3–6 months.

### Is amiodarone an underrecognized cause of acute respiratory failure in the ICU? [^113k7EEv]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a commonly used anti-arrhythmic agent, with well-recognized chronic toxicity. Less well known is amiodarone's potential to cause acute lung damage, which can be severe or, occasionally, life-threatening. Lungs that have already been exposed to physical insults, such as the lungs of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, are particularly susceptible to acute pulmonary toxicity (APT). Unfortunately, cardiac surgery is one of the clinical scenarios in which amiodarone is most commonly used. After reviewing the data, and even in the context of difficulties and discrepancies in the existing literature, we contend that there is sufficient evidence of amiodarone's potentially serious side-effect profile in surgical ICU patients to advise continued caution in its use with this severely ill patient group. We suggest that amiodarone has a potentially important, though underrecognized, role in inducing an APT/ARDS in some patients, such as those undergoing cardiac surgery. We also provide a hypothesis to explain the mechanism by which amiodarone causes lung damage.

### Amiodarone-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome masquerading as acute heart failure [^114GaF3o]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Amiodarone use has been rarely associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), usually in association with surgery or pulmonary angiography. In patients with preexisting left ventricular dysfunction, the diagnosis may be overlooked.

Case Report

A 92-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation who was on low-dose amiodarone presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of shortness of breath. The patient was started on treatment for acute heart failure based on the physical examination and the elevated brain natriuretic peptide level. Despite adequate diuresis, the patient showed no improvement. A chest computed tomography scan revealed acute interstitial pneumonitis. The patient received corticosteroids due to suspected amiodarone-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis resulting in ARDS. She returned to her baseline activity within 2 weeks of the therapy.

Conclusion

Although rare, clinicians should be vigilant for amiodarone-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis resulting in ARDS, as delay in treatment may result in a high risk of mortality. In addition, the development of ARDS occurred in our patient in the absence of precipitating factors such as surgery or pulmonary angiography.

### Amiodarone-induced diffuse alveolar haemorrhage: a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of a commonly prescribed medication [^114pxAHM]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that is used commonly in clinical practice. It is associated with many side effects, the most common being pulmonary manifestations. Interstitial pneumonitis is one of the most common complications, however rarely amiodarone can cause diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) too. We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath and haemoptysis 4 days after starting amiodarone. She was diagnosed with amiodarone-induced DAH based on imaging and bronchoalveolar lavage. She was treated with intravenous and then oral steroids, and amiodarone was discontinued. The patient made a significant clinical and radiological recovery. She was discharged 10 days after her presentation. This case highlights a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of a commonly used medication.

### Diagnosis of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity with high-resolution computerized tomographic scan [^117EwCpK]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is a serious adverse effect that can be fatal. The diagnosis is difficult due to the nonspecificity of symptoms, clinical findings, and test results. Because of its high iodine content, amiodarone deposition can be detected by sensitive high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) scan techniques. We hypothesized that pulmonary toxicity can be diagnosed more readily when these scans indicate the presence of increased attenuation of either pleural or pulmonary densities representing high iodine amiodarone deposits.

Methods and Results

This case control study included 16 patients taking chronic amiodarone. Eight cases presented with severe respiratory and other symptoms and were matched with 8 controls, 4 with mild or chronic respiratory symptoms. All patients underwent high-resolution CT of the chest. All cases had positive CT scan results demonstrating bilateral air-space disease, parenchymal bands, and thickened septal and bronchiolitis obliterans. All minimally or asymptomatic patients had negative scans with no area of high attenuation. All cases had ≥ 1 lesion with high-attenuation density. The cases were treated successfully by supportive care, discontinuation of amiodarone, and, rarely, corticosteroid therapy. Two cases had delayed diagnosis of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and were managed successfully only after CT.

Conclusion

High-resolution CT may be a valuable noninvasive test to aid in the diagnosis of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in symptomatic patients.

### A multicenter retrospective cohort study on predicting the risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^114ts6u6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The issue on dose of amiodarone and its toxicity has been assessed in prior studies. Cumulative dose of amiodarone has been shown to be associated with toxicity and this is again demonstrated in the current study. The development of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity long after exposure (months to years) is also consistent with cumulative toxic effects. In our study, lower dose amiodarone (less than 200 mg daily) can also lead to amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, suggesting that the cumulative effect with prolonged exposure is the key risk factor.

Underlying lung disease has been reported to be associated with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and is also shown in the current study, though there is conflicting evidence in the literature. In the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) study, preexisting pulmonary disease was shown to be associated with a higher risk of diagnosed amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Nonetheless, use of amiodarone in the presence of preexisting pulmonary disease did not increase pulmonary death and all-cause mortality rate. On the contrary, the Congestive Heart Failure-Survival Trial of Antiarrhythmic Therapy (CHF-STAT) study demonstrated no accelerated loss of diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) among patients with COPD who received amiodarone, compared with those who received placebo. However the CHF-STAT study only had 519 subjects and 269 of them were taking amiodarone. With the low incidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (as low as 1% in some studies), the relatively small sample size in the CHF-STAT study did not provide sufficient statistical power in identifying this association. There is also some criticism that patients with limited pulmonary reserve become symptomatic earlier in their course than other individuals, which makes underlying lung disease apparently a risk factor of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons practice guideline on the prophylaxis and management of atrial fibrillation associated with general thoracic surgery: executive summary [^112DTDaf]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone prophylaxis — perioperative pulmonary toxicity signals and cautions are described as follows: Among pneumonectomy patients, the ARDS rate was 27%. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity appears to occur not only after chronic administration, but also occasionally after brief periods of IV administration or on the order of days, and acute pulmonary toxicity related to amiodarone appears most common perioperatively. Reported series include 3 of 8 patients with ARDS after cardiac surgery who received high-dose IV amiodarone therapy (1,200 mg for 7 days), with ARDS in 6 of 11 on long-term therapy, and another series with 4 of 33 after prolonged preoperative amiodarone. In contrast, trials using lower doses observed no increased pulmonary toxicity; the pulmonary resection series included 65 patients in the experimental arm, 25% of whom underwent pneumonectomy. The text advises that it should likely be avoided for patients with significant preexisting lung disease, those intubated or requiring high inspired oxygen concentrations, and those who have undergone pneumonectomy; it should also likely not be started preoperatively, and it is prudent, outside of studies, to limit the use of amiodarone for pulmonary resection patients to those in whom the risk is tolerable.

### Population-level incidence and risk factors for pulmonary toxicity associated with amiodarone [^115Lu7cT]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Estimates from clinical trials and small observational studies of the incidence of pulmonary toxicity (PT) associated with amiodarone range from 1% to 10%. We report a unique study of the population-based incidence and potential predictors of PT in a real-world atrial fibrillation (AF) population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients ≥ 65 years old discharged with AF using linked administrative databases from Quebec, Canada from 1999 to 2007. "Users" and "nonusers" of amiodarone were identified by prescriptions dispensed within 7 days after hospital discharge. PT was defined through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision codes for pulmonary fibrosis, alveolar/interstitial lung disease, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Potential risk factors for PT were identified using multivariable Cox regression. PT occurred in 250 of 6,460 amiodarone users (3.87%) and 676 of 50,993 nonusers (1.33%). Age-standardized PT incidences were 28.30 and 16.02 per 1,000 person-years in men and women users, respectively, and 14.05 and 8.82 per 1,000 person-years in nonusers, respectively. It was associated with amiodarone exposure at all doses (≤ 200 mg/day, hazard ratio 1.62, 1.35 to 1.96; > 200 mg/day, 1.46, 1.22 to 1.75). Other predictors of PT included increasing age (1.01 per year, 1.00 to 1.02), male gender (1.37, 1.19 to 1.57), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.53, 2.21 to 2.89), and renal disease (1.26, 1.06 to 1.50). In conclusion, the population-based incidence of amiodarone PT is in the lower range of what has been previously reported. However, patients with AF who use amiodarone have an approximately 50% higher risk of PT than nonusers. Clinicians may be able to use the present results to identify patients at higher risk for PT and implement strategies to increase monitoring or select alternative therapy.

### Acute amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^115xT76f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic that frequently is used during the perioperative period. Amiodarone possesses a significant adverse reaction profile. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) is among the most serious adverse effects and is a leading cause of death associated with its use. Despite significant advances in the understanding of AIPT, its etiology and pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. The diagnosis of AIPT is one of exclusion. The clinical manifestations of AIPT are categorized broadly as acute, subacute, and chronic. Acute AIPT is a rarer and more aggressive form of the disease, most often encountered in cardiothoracic surgery. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the predominating pattern of amiodarone's acute pulmonary toxicity. The incidence, risk factors, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of acute AIPT are speculative. Early cardiothoracic literature investigating AIPT often attributed amiodarone to the development of postoperative ARDS. Subsequent studies have found no association between amiodarone and acute AIPT and ARDS development. As a drug that is frequently prescribed to a patient population deemed most at risk for this fatal disease, the conflicting evidence on acute AIPT needs further investigation and clarification.

Atrial fibrillation rhythm control — amiodarone dosing, cautions, and adverse-effect monitoring: Amiodarone is dosed as 3 x 200 mg daily over 4 weeks, 2 x 200 mg another 4 weeks, then 200 mg daily, and should be discontinued in case of excessive QT prolongation (> 500 ms). Concomitant drug cautions include concomitant use with VKAs or digitalis (their dose should be reduced) and increased risk of myopathy when used with statins. The drug requires regular surveillance for liver, lung and thyroid toxicity, has AV nodal slowing properties, but should not be used as monotherapy for rate control, and QT prolongation is common, but very rarely associated with TdP (< 0.5%).

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC and CARDIAC TOXICITY

Amiodarone hydrochloride is intended for use only in patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause pulmonary toxicity (hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis) that has resulted in clinically manifest disease at rates as high as 17% in some series of patients. Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone hydrochloride therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause hepatoxicity, which can be fatal. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases and discontinue or reduce dose if the increase exceeds three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue amiodarone hydrochloride if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can exacerbate arrhythmias. Initiate amiodarone hydrochloride in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC, and CARDIAC TOXICITY

Amiodarone is commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient and outpatient settings. Over- and under-use of amiodarone is common, and data regarding patterns of use are sparse and largely anecdotal. Because of adverse drug reactions, proper use is essential to deriving optimal benefits from the drug with the least risk. This guide updates an earlier version published in 2000, reviews indications for use of amiodarone and recommends strategies to minimize adverse effects. The recommendations included herein are based on the best available data and the collective experience of the member of the writing committee.

### A multicenter retrospective cohort study on predicting the risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^111VtYgY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Demographic data (age, gender, smoking status), relevant respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, shortness of breath) and clinical data/investigations (underlying cardiac diagnosis, underlying arrhythmia, comorbidities, duration of amiodarone treatment, dose of amiodarone, complications during amiodarone treatment, blood tests for organ functions) were collected through clinical record review. The relevant chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) films were reviewed to confirm the radiological findings and diagnosis. Ever-smoker was defined as one who had smoked at least one cigarette a day, pipe, water pipes, cigars, and hand rolled cigarettes, for one year or more. For patients who had received amiodarone treatment, the cumulative dose and duration of exposure were retrieved from review of clinical records. The renal function was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster and Kowloon Central/East Cluster (HKU/HA HKW IRB approval no.: UW16–353, UW17–450; KCC/ KCC/KEC IRB approval no.: REC (KC/KE)-17–0237/ER-1).

The primary outcome was the development of amiodarone lung toxicity. The diagnosis of amiodarone lung toxicity was based upon all of the following criteria including new onset of pulmonary symptoms and/or new chest radiographic abnormalities without evidence supporting congestive heart failure, infectious processes or malignancy. All cases of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity were reviewed by investigators (WC Kwok and JCM Ho) to confirm the diagnosis. The final categorization of patients exposed to amiodarone into those with or without amiodarone pulmonary toxicity was determined by a consensus meeting of two investigators (WC Kwok and JCM Ho). In the consensus meeting, the patient's clinical history, relevant imaging, laboratory test results and any treatment of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity were reviewed. Those who fulfilled the aforementioned criteria were classified to have amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.

*Factors that are statistically significant after adjustment for age, gender and smoking history

Further work was done to categorize patients into risk groups, based on their risk of developing amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Covariates with p < 0.05 (age with cut-off at 65 and 75, underlying arrhythmia, underlying lung disease and cumulative dose of amiodarone at cut-off at 1000 g) were included in the multivariate model to build the scoring system. One or two points were assigned to each risk factor and a five-point risk factor score is developed. Patients with 3 points or more were at increased risk of developing amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. At receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, this score that defined high-risk group had area under the curve (AUC) of 0.733 (95% CI 0.652–0.813, p value < 0.001) (Fig. 1). The final prognostic score was the sum of individual scores, which were assigned with reference to the regression coefficients of the model. The scoring system is listed in Tables 3 and 4. The Kaplan-Meier curves for the four risk factors were shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5.

### A multicenter retrospective cohort study on predicting the risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^113XC3it]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

There are also discrepancies from the literature regarding other risk factors of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. In this study, gender was not found to be significantly associated with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Jackevicius et al. reported that male gender was associated with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. But male patients are more likely to have underlying COPD and the relationship between gender and amiodarone pulmonary toxicity may partly be explained and confounded by underlying COPD in the male patients. Male patients may also have ischemic heart disease with subsequent ventricular arrhythmia. The association between amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and gender may be medicated by the co-morbidities instead of gender itself. Regarding the association between underlying renal disease and amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, it was shown to have a hazard ratio of 1.26 according to Jackevicius's study. But it is known that amiodarone is metabolized by the liver and excreted via hepatobiliary route. There is minimal elimination of both amiodarone and monodesethylamiodarone by the kidneys due to large volume of distribution and extensive protein binding. Thus dose adjustment is not necessary for patients with renal function impairment or even those receiving renal replacement therapy. Theoretically, underlying renal impairment does not affect the serum level of both amiodarone and monodesethylamiodarone, hence minimal impact on risk of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. This is in line with the finding from the current study.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons practice guideline on the prophylaxis and management of atrial fibrillation associated with general thoracic surgery: executive summary [^115QjfTJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

General thoracic surgery (GTS) postoperative atrial fibrillation — amiodarone prophylaxis dosing and cautions: Class IIa recommendation: Amiodarone prophylaxis is reasonable to reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation after GTS, based on the results in patients undergoing lobectomy or esophagectomy. For patients undergoing lobectomy, the recommended dose is 1,050 mg by continuous infusion over the first 24 hours after surgery (43.75 mg/h), followed by 400 mg orally twice daily for 6 days. For patients undergoing esophagectomy, the recommended dose is continuous intravenous (IV) infusion at a rate of 43.75 mg/h (1,050 mg daily) for 4 days (Level of evidence B). Prophylactic amiodarone is a reasonable alternative to diltiazem, but it should be used in limited doses and should likely be avoided for certain patients; among lung resection patients the incidence of AF fell from 21.9% to 3.1% in one study and from 32.3% to 13.8% in another versus placebo, although the higher-dose study was terminated early due to an ARDS incidence of 9.4% in those receiving amiodarone. Class III recommendation: Amiodarone is not recommended, outside of clinical studies, for patients undergoing pneumonectomy, until additional data addressing its potential toxicity in this setting are available (Level of evidence B).

Amiodarone — thyroid, hepatic, pulmonary, ocular, neurologic, and proarrhythmic safety are characterized as follows: Amiodarone contains 37% iodine by weight and is associated with thyroid abnormalities in 2% to 24% of patients, with median time to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism of 183 days and hyperthyroidism of 720 days. Amiodarone may cause pulmonary toxicity, most commonly interstitial lung disease or hypersensitivity syndrome, in 1% to 2% of patients and is fatal in approximately 10% of cases; a chest x-ray is recommended at baseline and when there is clinical suspicion for pulmonary toxicity, and a chest CT scan can be helpful for diagnosis in patients with unexplained cough and dyspnea. Corneal microdeposits are common but visual abnormalities and light sensitivity are rare, and an ophthalmologic examination is reasonable only if visual abnormalities develop. Amiodarone has been associated with neurological toxicity, particularly peripheral neuropathy, and oral amiodarone may cause torsades de pointes with one analysis estimating the incidence to be 0.7%.

### Successful treatment of severe amiodarone pulmonary toxicity with polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion [^113XKyek]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) is the most serious side effect of amiodarone. Although severe APT, such as ARDS, is rare, mortality of severe APT is high. Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) is a medical device that reduces blood endotoxin levels in sepsis. Recent reports have shown that PMX-DHP improves oxygenation in patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and drug-induced severe interstitial pneumonia. Here, we present a case study of a patient with severe APT treated with PMX-DHP with complete recovery. The patient rapidly developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. Despite corticosteroid pulse therapy, no clinical improvement was noted. PMX-DHP was then started, and severe respiratory failure improved with reduction of serum levels of amiodarone and its metabolite monodesethylamiodarone. The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and has done well without recurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PMX-DHP therapy for severe APT. We speculate that PMX-DHP could be a new treatment strategy for severe APT.

Discussion

To our best knowledge, the current study is one of the largest scale studies on amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in an Asian population. A total of 34 cases with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity were identified among 1786 patients taking amiodarone from 2005 to 2015, accounting for an estimated incidence of 1.9%. The following factors were also identified to be significantly associated with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, namely age, ventricular arrhythmia, cumulative dose of amiodarone and underlying lung disease. Apart from identifying the risk factors of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, we also developed a five-point prediction rule based on the findings from multivariable penalized logistic regression. From the prediction rule, patients with 3 or more points are at increased risk of developing amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Those with 3 and 4 points had 5.0% and 6.3% risk of developing amiodarone pulmonary toxicity respectively. This easy to use prediction rule may help clinicians to identify patients at risk of developing amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and consider early switch to an alternative anti-arrhythmic when appropriate.

Age has been shown to be associated with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in the literature, with hazard ratio of 1.01 per year for patients above the age of 60 years. Elderly patients are likely to have more co-morbidities and lower pulmonary reserve, which predispose them to the development of clinically evident amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. The relationship between underlying arrhythmia and amiodarone pulmonary toxicity can be related to the indication of amiodarone. In this study, ventricular arrhythmia is found to be significantly associated with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, which is still valid in multivariable penalized logistic regression after adjusting for age, gender and smoking history. Ventricular arrhythmia is in general more dangerous than supraventricular arrhythmia with limited choice of anti-arrhythmic. We examined the characteristics of patients with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmia. The age, daily amiodarone dose, duration of amiodarone and cumulative amiodarone dose were similar in both groups. This suggests that the observed association cannot be explained by the dose or duration of amiodarone exposure. The exact reason for this observation remains elusive.

Patient-centered outcomes for patients with COPD with cardiovascular disease — For pharmacologic management, β-Blockers should not be used to prevent COPD exacerbations in patients who do not have cardiac indications. There were fewer cardiovascular events in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute myocardial infarction if treated with P2Y12 receptor antagonists vs. thienopyridine. Amiodarone causes direct lung toxicity, which can manifest as interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and diffuse alveolar damage. Certain treatments (e.g., sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors [SGLT2i]) might have a larger benefit in the COPD subgroup with heart failure, though further research is needed to assess if there is truly heterogeneity of treatment effect.

Pulmonary Disorders

Early-onset Pulmonary Toxicity

There have been postmarketing reports of acute-onset (days to weeks) pulmonary injury in patients treated with intravenous amiodarone. Findings have included pulmonary infiltrates and/or mass on X-ray, bronchospasm, wheezing, fever, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Some cases have progressed to respiratory failure and/or death.

ARDS

Two percent (2%) of patients were reported to have adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during clinical studies involving 48 hours of therapy. ARDS is a disorder characterized by bilateral, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates with pulmonary edema and varying degrees of respiratory insufficiency. The clinical and radiographic picture can arise after a variety of lung injuries, such as those resulting from trauma, shock, prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and aspiration pneumonia, conditions present in many of the patients enrolled in the clinical studies. There have been postmarketing reports of ARDS in intravenous amiodarone patients. Intravenous amiodarone may play a role in causing or exacerbating pulmonary disorders in those patients.

### A multicenter retrospective cohort study on predicting the risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^116MsYZX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Amiodarone is one of the most commonly used anti-arrhythmic agents. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is a potentially fatal adverse effect associated with amiodarone use. Previous studies on the epidemiology and risk factors for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity showed diverse results.

Methods

A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify clinic-epidemiologic markers associated with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity for development of a prediction rule. Patients taking amiodarone who were managed in 3 centres in Hong Kong from 2005 to 2015 were included in this study. Penalized logistic regression was used to model the outcome as it is rare.

Results

A total of 34 cases with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity were identified among 1786 patients taking amiodarone for at least 90 days from 2005 to 2015. The incidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity was estimated to be 1.9%. The risk factors for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity included advanced age (OR 1.047, 95% CI 1.010–1.085, p = 0.013), ventricular arrhythmia (OR 2.703, 95% CI 1.053–6.935, p = 0.039), underlying lung disease (OR 2.511, 95% CI 1.146–5.501, p = 0.021) and cumulative dose of amiodarone (OR 4.762, 95% CI 1.310–17.309 p = 0.018).

Conclusions

The incidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in Chinese patients in Hong Kong is estimated to be 1.9% in this study. Age, underlying lung disease, ventricular arrhythmia and cumulative dose of amiodarone are associated with the development of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. A prediction rule was developed to inform the risk of developing amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.

A middle-aged man presented with new-onset cough, fever, hypoxia and tachypnoea. He was on a tapering course of dexamethasone for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. He developed worsening airspace disease necessitating mechanical ventilation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was positive for P. jirovecii and he was managed with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, but succumbed to cardiorespiratory arrest. One-third of PJP cases occur in non-HIV patients, and have a higher morbidity and mortality. Most immunocompromised patients typically exhibit PJP during a corticosteroid taper. The accurate dose, duration or frequency of steroid use in not well established. Diagnosis of PJP in this population is more challenging due to lower BAL yield with alternate modalities such as serum/BAL β-d-glucan and PCR enhancing the yield. Further studies are needed to highlight PJP prophylaxis in patients with steroid use.

Re-challenge of drug therapy in suspected cases of ILD

In the management of patients with NSCLC, it is often necessary to treat patients with an agent that has been previously associated with ILD. In this scenario, it is important to consider the patient's previous response to that therapy, the severity of the lung damage and the respiratory distress, the presence of fibrosis and the previous response to corticosteroid therapy. For some patients, the benefits may outweigh the risks and therapy may be re-instituted with concomitant low-dose prednisone (10–20 mg day⁻¹); however, for some patients and/or agents the potential for causing further lung damage may be too great.

### A multicenter retrospective cohort study on predicting the risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^112RJjzw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 1786 patients on amiodarone from 2005 to 2015 that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were included in the study, with 8 patients with underlying interstitial lung diseases being excluded. Among the 1786 patients included, with 62.0% being male, mean age of 73.6 ± 14.0 years, and 28.8% current or ex-smokers. Ischaemic heart disease was the most common (40.7%) underlying cardiac diagnosis, while supraventricular arrhythmia, especially atrial fibrillation, was the most common (71.3%) indication for amiodarone. For those with underlying lung diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the most common, occurring in 112 patients (6.27% of the whole study population). There were 34 patients who had amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, accounting for an incidence of 1.90%, while 267 (14.9%) had amiodarone related thyroid dysfunction.

Among the 34 patients with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, the mean age was 78.6 years, 22 (64.7%) were males and 15 (44.1%) were current or ex-smokers. Equal number of patients was taking amiodarone for supraventricular arrhythmia and ventricular arrhythmias. For the underling cardiac diagnosis, 7 (20.6%) patients had atrial fibrillation/supraventricular tachycardia alone, while 17 (50.0%), 1 (2.9%), and 6 (17.7%) had ischemic heart disease, chronic rheumatic heart disease and cardiomyopathy respectively. Eight (23.5%) patients had underlying lung diseases, including 1 (2.9%), 1 (2.9%), and 6 (17.6%) with asthma, bronchiectasis and COPD respectively. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 60.8 ml/min/1.73 m² by the MDRD Study equation. Seven patients (20%) had amiodarone related thyroid dysfunction, with 2 (5.9%) thyrotoxicosis and 5 (14.7%) hypothyroidism. The demographics of the included patients are summarized in Table 1. The median time to develop amiodarone pulmonary toxicity was 66.8 months (Interquartile range = 74.5).

### Management of acute respiratory failure in interstitial lung diseases: overview and clinical insights [^116UoJWJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In 10–15% of cases, COP may present with a rapidly progressive course, mimicking ARDS. The diagnosis is made by ruling out infectious causes of pneumonia and documenting typical pathological changes in tissue obtained by lung biopsies demonstrating fibroblastic polyps, sometimes associated with endoalveolar fibrin deposits, the so-called acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia (AFOP). The majority of patients recovers completely with corticosteroid therapy but relapses are common.

AEP occurs in previously healthy individuals and is characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia (more than 25% eosinophils on BAL differential cell count) or eosinophilic pneumonia on lung biopsy with or without peripheral eosinophilia.

Many chemotherapeutic (e.g. bleomycin and busulfan) and non-chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. amiodarone, nitrofurantoin, and statins) may cause lung toxicity manifesting with ARF. The diagnosis of a drug-induced acute ILD is challenging, and it is supported by the temporal relationship between the first use of the medication and symptoms onset, spontaneous clinical improvement after the discontinuation of the drug and recurrence of symptoms on re-challenge.

Although acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis is most commonly self-limited, it can also present with ARF. It should be suspected when there is a temporal association with the exposure to an inhaled antigen known to trigger hypersensitivity reactions, and in the presence of an upper-lobe predominant process accompanied by lymphocytic alveolitis.

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage presents with three possible histopathologic patterns: pulmonary capillaritis, most frequently encountered in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, bland pulmonary haemorrhage and DAD due to drugs or inhalation of toxic chemicals.

Possible diagnostic work-up for this presentation of ILDs is summarised in Fig. 3.

### Effectiveness of amiodarone versus bepridil in achieving conversion to sinus rhythm in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation: a randomised trial [^115EfnZJ]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm is generally difficult to achieve, particularly in long-lasting persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two agents, amiodarone and bepridil, in achieving conversion to sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF.

Methods and Results

Amiodarone (A) or bepridil (B) was administered to 40 consecutive patients (36 male subjects, age 61 years) with persistent AF in a prospective, randomised, open label fashion. The pharmacological effects in bringing about conversion to sinus rhythm and subsequently maintaining sinus rhythm were evaluated. If sinus rhythm was not restored within 3 months, direct current (DC) cardioversion was performed. The incidence of adverse effects was also evaluated. Sinus rhythm was restored in seven (35%) of 20 patients in group A (average follow-up of 3.2 months) and in 17 (85%) of 20 in group B (average follow-up of 2.3 months) (p < 0.05). After pharmacological or DC cardioversion, sinus rhythm could be maintained in 10 (50%) of 20 patients in group A (average follow-up of 14.7 months) and 15 (75%) of 20 patients in group B (average follow-up of 15.6 months). QT interval and QTc were significantly prolonged compare with the baseline values in group B, but no torsade de pointes was recognised in any of the patients. One patient in the group B developed interstitial pneumonia, but steroid therapy cured the condition.

Conclusions

Bepridil was superior to amiodarone in achieving sinus conversion and in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion in patients with persistent AF. Even so, we must be watchful for potentially serious adverse complications when administering bepridil.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^116T4p63]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Primary prevention and antiarrhythmic drug therapy in low ejection fraction (EF) heart failure — risk, drug effects, and amiodarone use — are summarized as follows: Patients with low EF without prior history of cardiac arrest, spontaneous VT, or inducible VT have a risk of sudden death that remains significant, and approximately 50% to 70% of patients with low EF and symptomatic HF have episodes of nonsustained VT on routine ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Antiarrhythmic drugs to suppress premature ventricular depolarizations and nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias have not improved survival, and most antiarrhythmic drugs have negative inotropic effects and can increase the risk of serious arrhythmia, particularly in patients with low EF. This risk is especially high with the use of Class IA agents (quinidine and procainamide), Class IC agents (flecainide and encainide), and some Class III agents (D-sotalol), which have increased mortality in post-MI trials. Amiodarone has been associated with overall neutral effects on survival in patients with low EF and HF and has been shown in some trials to increase LVEF and decrease the incidence of worsening HF, but side effects include thyroid abnormalities, pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, insomnia, and numerous other reactions. Therefore, amiodarone should not be considered as part of the routine treatment of patients with HF, although it remains the agent most likely to be safe and effective when antiarrhythmic therapy is necessary to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation or symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. Other pharmacological antiarrhythmic therapies, apart from beta-blockers, are rarely indicated in HF but may occasionally be used to suppress recurrent ICD shocks when amiodarone has been ineffective or discontinued owing to toxicity.

Diagnosis is often difficult and is usually based on a history of drug therapy and exclusion of infection, radiation pneumonitis, and recurrence of the underlying disease. Although HRCT findings are frequently nonspecific, diagnosis can be facilitated by an understanding of the most common histopathologic and radiologic manifestations of drug-induced lung injury and knowledge of the drugs usually involved.

### A multicenter retrospective cohort study on predicting the risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^114SKJX5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although amiodarone is well-known to cause pulmonary toxicity and thyroid dysfunction, it remains one of the most commonly used anti-arrhythmics as it is available in both oral and parenteral route, with a wide range of indications. Other pharmacological and interventional treatment options are also available for supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmia, with different risks of adverse events.

There are several limitations of this study. First of all, only 34 patients with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity can be identified. The relatively small number of cases with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity limits the statistical analysis on potential risk factors, especially in performing subgroup analysis with even smaller sample size. Penalized logistic regression was therefore used to correct the bias of estimation due to rare occurrence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Nonetheless, our study is one of the largest scale in Asia, which included 1786 patients with amiodarone exposure. A population-based study with much bigger sample size is needed to confirm our findings and validate the prediction rule for development of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. The prediction rule that we developed may have the problem of overfitting as cross-validation was not conducted. While a prediction rule was developed, ideally using an independent cohort to validate the results could help to assess the performance of the rule. Internal validation techniques could be applied to correct for overfitting and optimism but the accuracy would still be substantially lower than using an independent cohort. It was proposed that when overfitting could not be adequately prevented or adjusted during development of the rule, all regression coefficients could be adjusted with a single correction factor estimated from the data of new patients in the validation set. Recruiting an independent cohort to validate the prediction rule that we proposed would solve this problem. As a study that aim to examine the risks development of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, the patients were identified by their record of amiodarone prescription. Patients taking some other drugs that can potentially cause pulmonary toxicity together with amiodarone were excluded in this study in order to avoid diagnostic uncertainty in these cases Serum monodesethylamiodarone level was not measured in this study given the retrospective design. The test is unavailable as a standard routine in the biochemistry laboratory in Hong Kong. Serum monodesethylamiodarone level has been shown to be associated with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and is worth assessing in a prospective study setting. The cumulative dose of amiodarone which has been investigated in this study may serve as a surrogate when the serum monodesethylamiodarone level is not available, though the serum monodesethylamiodarone level can be affected by liver function impairment and CYP3A4 genetic polymorphism apart from the cumulative dose of amiodarone.

Purpose

This case demonstrates the use of Tc-99m HMPAO scintigraphy in amiodarone (AD)-induced lung toxicity. The aim of this presentation is also to discuss different scintigraphic modalities in the diagnosis and follow up in AD-induced lung toxicity.

Materials and Methods

A 77-year-old man, with a suspicious AD-induced acute lung toxicity, underwent Tc-99m DTPA aerosol inhalation scintigraphy and Tc-99m HMPAO scintigraphy.

Results

Rapid alveolar clearance of Tc-99m DTPA was found during AD therapy and increased lung uptake of Tc-99m HMPAO was also demonstrated. These findings supported the diagnosis AD lung toxicity. After cessation of therapy, Tc-99m DTPA alveolar clearance was decreased. Although there was some decrease in L/H and L/B ratios of Tc-99m HMPAO after 3 weeks of stopping therapy, Tc-99m HMPAO uptake in the lungs was still continued. This finding may be the result of ongoing pulmonary inflammation as a result of the long half-life of AD.

Conclusion

Compared with Tc-99m DTPA aerosol inhalation scintigraphy, Tc-99m HMPAO scintigraphy may have a role in the diagnosis of AD lung toxicity. Nevertheless, there is a need for longitudinal studies investigating patients under AD therapy using follow-up Tc-9m HMPAO scintigraphy.

### May toxicity of amiodarone be prevented by antioxidants? A cell-culture study [^1116x72G]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Innumerous studies have been published enclosing treatment and prophylaxis of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). Amiodarone is a type 3 anti-arrhythmic agent frequently used for medical cardioversion with varying protocols. It has potential serious side effects in a wide spectrum including photosensitivity, pulmonary toxicity, polyneuropathy, gastrointestinal upset, bradycardia, torsades de pointes (rare), hepatic toxicity, thyroid dysfunction and ocular complications.

Currently, there are no clinical agents available for prevention of amiodarone induced toxicity. The aim of this study is to underline the toxic effects of amiodarone in cell culture media and propose potential antioxidant agents for clinical use in terms of preventing amiodarone induced toxicity.

### Reversible amiodarone-induced lung disease: HRCT findings [^111p4K81]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings of reversible amiodarone-induced lung disease (AILD). The thoracic HRCT of 20 symptomatic patients who were considered as having reversible AILD by the medical staff of our institution were retrospectively reviewed. The patient-selection criteria used were the development of new respiratory symptoms while receiving amiodarone, the exclusion of other respiratory and cardiac diseases, and the decrease of both respiratory symptoms and radiological abnormalities after cessation of amiodarone and corticotherapy. The CT data recorded were those usually sought infiltrative lung diseases. The radiological findings using chest film (n = 20) and HRCT (n = 4) follow-up was noted. All patients had ground-glass opacities, associated with consolidations (n = 4), thin intralobular reticulations (n = 5), or both (n = 11), with a subpleural (n = 18) or central (n = 2) location. Eight patients had high-density areas and 13 had pleural thickening (n = 13). Bronchial abnormalities included dilation (n = 16) and wall thickening (n = 19). After therapeutic management, the radiological follow-up showed complete (n = 17) or incomplete (n = 3) improvement. Ground-glass opacities associated with thin intralobular reticulations and/or subpleural consolidations and bronchial abnormalities are common HRCT findings in reversible AILD.

Primary outcome

Etiological diagnoses of ILD associated with an immune alveolitis profile are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2. The most common diagnosis was Pneumocystis pneumonia in 59 patients (24%), followed by drug-induced lung disease (DILD) in 49 patients (20%), everolimus being the most frequently involved drug (n = 11 patients), followed by nivolumab (n = 5) and methotrexate (n = 5). Amiodarone was associated with DILD in only 3 patients (6%). Thirty-four patients (14% of the global population) had viral pneumonia with viral identification in half of cases, respiratory syncitial virus, coronavirus and rhinovirus being the most frequently identified viruses (Additional file 2).

Ten percent of patients were diagnosed with HP (n = 25), granulomatosis (n = 25), or had uncertain diagnosis despite assessment by the adjudication committee (n = 26) (Table 2).

Immunocompromised subpopulations

Among the 163 immunocompromised patients, the main diagnosis was Pneumocystis pneumonia (n = 59 patients, 36%). All patients with a final diagnosis of PCP were immunocompromised compared to 8% of patients with HP.

Twenty-six percent of the immunocompromised patients received PCP prophylaxis and 13 patients were diagnosed with PCP despite such prophylaxis. Four of them were taking cotrimoxazole with uncertain compliance while the 9 others received nebulized pentamidine or atovaquone. In immunocompromised patients, the second most common diagnosis was DILD (46 patients, 28%). Viral pneumonia was diagnosed in 27 patients (16%). The distribution of diagnoses was similar for patients receiving corticosteroids (75 patients, 30% of the global population). Among them, 31% had a daily dose > 15 mg equivalent prednisone and 26 patients received PCP prophylaxis (35%). No patient taking corticosteroids was diagnosed with HP.

Amiodarone causes thyroid dysfunction in some patients, which may lead to potentially fatal breakthrough or exacerbated arrhythmias.

5.5 Pulmonary Injury

Early-onset Pulmonary Toxicity

There have been postmarketing reports of acute-onset (days to weeks) pulmonary injury in patients treated with intravenous amiodarone. Findings have included pulmonary infiltrates and masses on X-ray, bronchospasm, wheezing, fever, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Some cases have progressed to respiratory failure or death.

ARDS

Two percent (2%) of patients were reported to have adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during clinical studies involving 48 hours of therapy.

Pulmonary Fibrosis

There have been reports of early development of pulmonary fibrosis (within 1 to 3 months) following initiation of amiodarone treatment. Only 1 of more than 1000 patients treated with intravenous amiodarone in clinical studies developed pulmonary fibrosis. In that patient, the condition was diagnosed 3 months after treatment with intravenous amiodarone, during which time the patient received oral amiodarone. Pulmonary toxicity is a well-recognized complication of long-term amiodarone use (see package insert for oral amiodarone).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 chronic heart failure guideline — digoxin adverse effects, toxicity thresholds, and drug interactions: When administered with attention to dose and to factors that alter its disposition, digoxin is well tolerated by most patients with HF, but principal adverse reactions occur primarily with large doses, and the major side effects include cardiac arrhythmias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurological complaints. Overt digitalis toxicity is commonly associated with serum digoxin levels greater than 2 ng per mL, though toxicity may occur with lower levels, especially if hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypothyroidism coexists. The concomitant use of clarithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone, itraconazole, cyclosporine, verapamil, or quinidine can increase serum digoxin concentrations and may increase the likelihood of digitalis toxicity, and the dose of digoxin should be reduced if treatment with these drugs is initiated. Spironolactone does not inhibit the disposition of digoxin; cross‑reactivity of some digoxin antibody assays with spironolactone confounded earlier attempts to assess the effect of spironolactone on digoxin clearance. In addition, a low lean body mass and impaired renal function can elevate serum digoxin levels, and one analysis suggested that women may not benefit from digoxin therapy and may be at increased risk for death with such therapy.

### Stepwise diagnostic algorithm for high-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities on CT [^112awn8N]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Category 7: Consolidation pattern

Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and metastatic calcification may show high-attenuation consolidation. However, metastatic calcification is found predominantly in the upper lungs and is therefore described in Category 4.

Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity

Amiodarone, an anti-arrhythmic agent for refractory tachyarrhythmias, contains 37.3% iodine by weight. This high iodine content makes possible the detection of amiodarone deposits in the lung by CT. The risk is highest in the first 6 to 12 months of treatment, and the frequency of onset increases as the cumulative dose increases from 101 to 150 g. Amiodarone and its metabolites accumulate in macrophages and type II pneumocytes in the lungs. Due to the very long half-life of amiodarone, the CT attenuation value increases. In roughly 90% of cases, elevated liver and spleen concentrations are also found, which can be identified through the lung bases on chest CT.

The HRCT findings of amiodarone lung include ground-glass opacities, focal or diffuse areas of consolidation, and reticular opacities. However, the unique feature of amiodarone-related lung toxicity is the presence of foci of attenuation greater than that of the soft tissue due to tissue accumulation of this iodinated compound (Fig. 17).

Fig. 17
Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in an 85-year-old woman. a CT image shows an extensive area of consolidation in the left upper lobe. b Mediastinal window image shows consolidation with high attenuation. c The liver shows increased attenuation, which is compatible with amiodarone deposition

Category 8: Nodular pattern

As the Nomenclature Committee of the Fleischner Society has recommended that the term micronodule should be used to refer to nodules of less than 3 mm in diameter, we use the term "nodular pattern" to apply to cases that often show high-attenuation nodules of 3 mm or larger. Nodular pattern occurs in three distinct diseases: granulomatous infection, broncholithiasis, and hematoma. However, there may be overlaps between micronodular patterns, especially with granulomatous infection. The absorption process of a hematoma due to pulmonary laceration may also fit this pattern, although the finding may change and eventually resolve.

Interstitial pneumonitis is the most common presentation of amiodarone-induced pulmonary disease, especially in patients for whom the dose of amiodarone exceeds 400 mg/d. The underlying mechanisms in amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonitis include a secondary to direct toxic injury to lung cells and an indirect immunologic reaction. Amiodarone is frequently coprescribed with NOACs for rhythm or rate control in patients with AF. Concurrent use of amiodarone and NOACs has been associated with increased risk of major bleeding compared with NOACs alone, which is possibly mediated by an increase of plasma NOAC levels with pharmacokinetic interaction (P-glycoprotein [P-gp] inhibition) with amiodarone. The present study found that the use of amiodarone was associated with a higher risk of incident ILD in patients treated with either FXa inhibitor, dabigatran, or warfarin. Patients who were treated with both amiodarone and FXa inhibitors had the highest risk of incident ILD. In addition, FXa inhibitors (especially rivaroxaban and apixaban) are metabolized mainly by the liver, mediated mainly via the cytochrome P (CYP) 3A4-type CYP450-dependent elimination.CYP3A4 inhibition or induction of a specific drug may affect plasma concentrations of NOACs and the concomitant drug itself. However, it is unclear whether coprescribing of an FXa inhibitor with amiodarone and other specific drugs (eg, several cardiovascular, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, biological, or antitumor agents, which may induce ILD) was associated with increased plasma levels of FXa inhibitor, amiodarone, and other specific drugs, leading to the vulnerability in the development of ILD during the long-term follow-up period. The possible modifying factor or pharmacokinetic interaction of NOAC in these drugs requires elucidation.

### Chest CT diagnosis and clinical management of drug-related pneumonitis in patients receiving molecular targeting agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors: a position paper from the Fleischner society [^116sSaqc]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Clinical features of drug-related pneumonitis (DRP) — Incidence was estimated at 1.2 per 100,000 per year with a prevalence of 2.6 per 100,000, and DRP accounts for 2.5% to 5% of prevalent cases of interstitial lung disease; cancer drugs (eg, bleomycin) are the most common cause, followed by drugs for autoimmune diseases (eg, methotrexate), amiodarone, and antibiotics (eg, nitrofurantoin). The onset may be acute, insidious, and sometimes delayed with a long latent period (eg, beyond 10 years in some cases of carmustine-induced pulmonary fibrosis) following completion of drug treatment, and symptoms are generally nonspecific, including dyspnea, cough, malaise, and low-grade fever, though some patients may be asymptomatic even in the presence of diffuse pulmonary opacities and lung auscultation often reveals crackles but may be normal. It is difficult to clinically distinguish DRP from infections, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, radiation-induced pneumonitis, and metastases, and evaluation for cardiovascular etiologies including heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary venoclusive disease, and other forms of pulmonary hypertension needs to be considered. The clinical suspicion for DRP arises from the temporal relationship between drug exposure and the onset of clinical presentation, and in most patients the diagnosis is unlikely to be made with certainty even after extensive clinical evaluation, including lung biopsy. The increasing use of molecular targeting agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has broadened the spectrum of lung toxicity encountered clinically, exemplified by immune-related adverse effects in patients treated with ICIs that include pneumonitis and are thought to result from general immunologic activation, including autoimmune response.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone's conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

### Application of dual energy CT in the diagnosis of amiodarone lung toxicity as a cause of lung mass [^111F3g48]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of amiodarone lung toxicity on computerized tomography (CT) can be challenging especially in the presence of mass-like consolidation. Additional causes of mass-like consolidation including malignancy and pneumonia should be excluded, sometimes requiring tissue sampling.

Case

Here we present a case of amiodarone lung toxicity, with diagnosis suspected based on patient's history of chronic cardiac disease, amiodarone treatment, and imaging characteristics. Evaluation with dual energy CT demonstrated high iodine content in the mass-like consolidation further supporting the diagnosis. Biopsy of the mass-like consolidation confirmed amiodarone toxicity.

Conclusion

Dual energy CT has potential utility in differentiating mass-like consolidation from other etiologies such as malignancy or pneumonia.

### Management of phosgene-induced acute lung injury [^114WXt7z]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Phosgene is a substance of immense importance in the chemical industry. Because of its widespread industrial use, there is potential for small-scale exposures within the workplace, large-scale accidental release, or even deliberate release into a built-up area.

Objective

This review aims to examine all published studies concerning potential treatments for phosgene-induced acute lung injury and incorporate them into up-to-date clinical guidance. In addition, it aims to contrast the approaches when dealing with small numbers of patients known to be exposed (possibly with dose information) with the presentation of a large and heterogeneous population of casualties following a significant industrial accident or deliberate release; no published guidelines have specifically addressed this second problem.

Methods

PubMed and Embase were searched for all available years till April 2010 and 584 papers were identified and considered.

Experimental Studies

Because of the nature of the injury, there have been no human trials of patients exposed to phosgene. Multiple small and large animal studies have been performed to examine potential treatments of phosgene-induced acute lung injury, but many of these used isolated organ models, pretreatment regimens, or clinically improbable doses. Recent studies in large animals using both realistic time frames and dosing regimens have improved our knowledge, but clinical guidance remains based on incomplete data. Management of a small-scale, confirmed exposure. In the circumstance of a small-scale, confirmed industrial release where a few individuals are exposed and present rapidly, an intravenous bolus of high-dose corticosteroid (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g) should be considered, although there are no experimental data to support this recommendation. The evidence is that there is no benefit from nebulized steroid even when administered 1 h after exposure, or methylprednisolone if administered intravenously ≥ 6 h after exposure. Consideration should also be given to administration of nebulized acetylcysteine 1–2 g, though there is no substantive evidence of benefit outside a small animal, isolated lung model and there is a possibility of adverse effects. If the oxygen saturation falls below 94%, patients should receive the lowest concentration of supplemental oxygen to maintain their SaO₂ in the normal range. Once patients require oxygen, nebulized β-agonists [e.g., salbutamol (albuterol) 5 mg by nebulizer every 4 h] may reduce lung inflammation if administered within 1 h of exposure. Elective intubation should be considered early using an ARDSnet protective ventilation strategy. Management of a large-scale, non-confirmed exposure. In the circumstances of a large-scale industrial or urban release, not all patients presenting will have been exposed and health services are likely to be highly stretched. In this situation, patients should not be treated immediately as there is no evidence that delaying therapy causes harm, rather they should be rested and observed with regular physical examination and measurement of peripheral oxygen saturations. Once a patient's oxygen saturation falls below 94%, treatment with the lowest concentration of oxygen required to maintain their oxygen saturations in the normal range should be started. Once oxygen has been started, nebulized β-agonists [e.g., salbutamol (albuterol) 5 mg by nebulizer every 4 h] may reduce lung inflammation if administered within 1 h of exposure, though delayed administration which is likely following a large-scale release has not been tested formally. There is no benefit from nebulized steroid even when administered 1 h after exposure, or high-dose corticosteroid if administered intravenously ≥ 6 h after exposure. Although there are no experimental data to support this recommendation, an intravenous bolus of high-dose corticosteroid (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g) may be considered if presentation is < 6 h and resources allow. Depending on the numbers of casualties presenting, invasive ventilation should be initiated either electively once symptoms present (especially where there is a short latent period, indicating likelihood of more significant injury), or delayed until required. Ventilation should be with high positive end expiratory pressure, ARDSnet recommended ventilation.

Conclusions

The mechanisms underlying the phosgene-induced acute lung injury are not well understood. Future experimental work should ensure that potential treatments are tested in a large animal model using realistic dosing regimens and clinically relevant timings, such as those that might be found in a mass casualty situation.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) — type-specific medical therapy includes MMI 40 mg daily for type 1 AIT, with rare addition of potassium perchlorate 250 mg four times daily, and prednisone 40 mg daily for type 2 AIT with improvement occasionally as early as 1 week. In one study of 20 AIT patients treated with perchlorate for 1 month, euthyroidism occurred in 12 patients (7 with type 1 AIT and 5 with type 2 AIT), and the eight nonresponders achieved euthyroidism after corticosteroids after an average of approximately 6 weeks. When type cannot be clearly distinguished, a combination of prednisone and methimazole should be used until stabilization, after which drugs may be individually tapered. Technical dosing remarks specify MMI 40 mg once daily until euthyroid (generally 3–6 months) and corticosteroids equivalent to prednisone 40 mg once daily for 2–4 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–3 months.

### Monitoring amiodarone's toxicities: recommendations, evidence, and clinical practice [^111pMmxn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to develop an explicit evidence-based model of medication monitoring and to evaluate monitoring practices and adverse drug events in patients taking amiodarone at one institution.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966 through 2000) for English-language publications providing specific monitoring recommendations for amiodarone. A cross-sectional retrospective chart review of 99 outpatients receiving amiodarone therapy between Jan 1, 2000, and Jan 1, 2001, at a large tertiary-care hospital was performed to assess monitoring practices. Adverse drug events were identified by use of structured implicit reviews. The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients receiving the monitoring recommended in the literature and having amiodarone-related adverse drug events.

Results

Forty-three articles were identified that provided specific monitoring recommendations, although no studies were found that compared the outcomes of patients managed with different monitoring regimens. Overall, 70% of the recommended monitoring criteria were satisfied, although only 9 patients (9%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3%-15%) received all of the recommended monitoring. Variability in monitoring practices was identified at all stages of the monitoring model. Of the patients, 52 (52%; 95% CI, 42%-62%) received minimum baseline evaluations, 22 (22%; 95% CI, 14%-31%) underwent ongoing surveillance, 75 (75%; 95% CI, 61%-89%) had appropriate responses to abnormal surveillance results, and 71 (71%; 95% CI, 62%-80%) had timely follow-up visits. Of the patients, 8 (8%; 95% CI, 3%-13%) had 9 amiodarone-related adverse drug events, of which 3 were judged to be preventable. Interrater agreement for monitoring processes (kappa = 0.83) and adverse drug events (kappa = 0.67) was good.

Conclusions

Current standards for amiodarone toxicity monitoring are based on expert opinion with limited evidence to support most recommendations. Monitoring practices appear to vary significantly, with few patients receiving all of the recommended monitoring. Some amiodarone-related adverse drug events may be preventable and patient safety might be improved with a better understanding of monitoring processes.

### Pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone… [^114WMBm5]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — The Editorial by Estes1 on the role of amiodarone for the management of atrial fibrillation describes several amiodarone dose-related adverse effects. However, we were surprised that there was no mention of pulmonary toxic effects, which are the most serious side effects, and which have an incidence estimated from 0. 5% to 10% and a mortality of 1% to 33%. 2 Although an immunologic mechanism may contribute, some findings argue for a toxic dose-dependent mechanism. 3Unfortunately, routine pulmonary function tests have not been useful to predict pulmonary side effects of amiodarone. 4 These effects have most frequently included diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, but cases presenting with segmental pulmonary consolidation, fatal respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis, and pleural effussion have also been described.

These kinds of clinical presentation might lead to a wrong diagnosis of. Martínez E, Domingo P. Pulmonary Toxicity of Amiodarone. JAMA. 1992; 268: 3432–3433.

### Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity… [^115JwxyC]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- We have studied 15 patients with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and compared them with five amiodarone patients without evidence of toxic effect. Six of 15 patients who had toxic reactions presented with an acute illness that resembled an infectious disease. While diffuse interstitial disease was frequent on chest roentgenogram, seven of 15 had airspace opacities, and five had well-localized infiltrates. Physiologic changes were not uniformly found. An interstitial pneumonia with foamy alveolar macrophages was the most common pathologic finding. Foamy macrophages were also present in three of five nontoxic patients. Three of three patients who had toxic reactions, and two of five patients without toxic reactions had lamellated inclusion bodies by electron microscopy. We conclude that all features of amiodarone toxicity are protean, and it may mimic infectious diseases.

While pathologic changes are often characteristic, neither foamy alveolar macrophages nor lamellated cytoplasmic inclusions reliably distinguish toxic from nontoxic patients.
