## Question

What does infiltrate means on chest X-ray

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "infiltrate" means on a chest X-ray and how to interpret its significance both clinically and radiologically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core radiologic definition and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the main morphologic patterns seen on CXR and what they imply. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis across infectious and noninfectious causes. After that, I need to check the diagnostic performance and limitations of CXR, including sensitivity and interobserver variability. Then, I will consider special populations and contexts where interpretation is tricky. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach to management and follow-up, anchoring on guideline-based principles and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the core definition. On chest radiography, a pulmonary infiltrate is an area of increased soft-tissue density reflecting replacement of air in the alveolar spaces or interstitium by fluid, inflammatory exudate, or cells, which manifests as an opacity on the image; this is the standard definition used in contemporary cardiovascular data standards and aligns with classic radiologic teaching [^1177uUQn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — infiltrates are not a single entity. I need to categorize the radiographic patterns because they carry different implications. Consolidation (alveolar infiltrate) typically shows dense opacities with ill-defined borders, air bronchograms, and silhouette sign, indicating alveolar filling; interstitial infiltrates appear as reticular or reticulonodular opacities and peribronchial cuffing, suggesting interstitial inflammation or edema; ground-glass opacities are hazy increased attenuation that preserves vascular margins and often represent partial alveolar filling or interstitial thickening; nodular or patchy opacities can reflect bronchopneumonia or granulomatous disease; and pleural-based opacities may reflect effusion or atelectasis masquerading as infiltrate, so I should double-check for layering or blunting at the costophrenic angles to avoid misclassification [^113jAnfD] [^115wJc8R] [^113bhh8u].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis systematically. Infectious causes include bacterial pneumonia (often lobar consolidation), atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma or Legionella (often interstitial or patchy), viral pneumonias including RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (interstitial or mixed patterns), and opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts such as Pneumocystis jirovecii (diffuse ground-glass) and tuberculosis (upper lobe infiltrates with cavitation in immunocompetent hosts, atypical patterns in HIV). Noninfectious mimics include heart failure with interstitial or alveolar edema, ARDS with bilateral infiltrates, pulmonary hemorrhage, drug-induced pneumonitis, malignancy, and aspiration, so I need to ensure the clinical context is integrated before labeling an infiltrate as pneumonia [^111TS1VV] [^113AHhyj] [^115TEYff] [^1112GDfv].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance of CXR itself, because relying on it uncritically can mislead. CXR has only moderate sensitivity for pneumonia compared with CT, with studies showing that roughly one-quarter to one-third of CT-proven pneumonias are missed on CXR; sensitivity can be as low as about 43–50% in some ED cohorts, whereas specificity is higher, around 90–93%, meaning a positive CXR is reasonably specific but a negative CXR does not exclude disease; interobserver agreement for "other infiltrates" is poor to fair (kappa ~0.14–0.32), whereas consolidation shows better reliability (kappa ~0.5–0.7), so I should be cautious interpreting subtle interstitial changes [^116YYobL] [^114mst2E] [^116SJwU1] [^116c95SP].

> I need to ensure I consider special populations where CXR interpretation is particularly treacherous. In immunocompromised hosts, infiltrates may be subtle or invisible on CXR and CT is often required to detect disease. In pediatrics, viral features such as peribronchial cuffing and interstitial infiltrates are common and can be misread as bacterial pneumonia, and routine CXR is not recommended for uncomplicated bronchiolitis. In heart failure, cardiogenic edema can mimic pneumonia. In ARDS, bilateral infiltrates are part of the definition but inter-rater reliability is limited, so I should confirm with clinical and physiologic data. In lung transplant recipients, unilateral infiltrates after bilateral transplant are not equivalent to bilateral infiltrates for grading primary graft dysfunction, which I should remember when interpreting early postoperative films [^1112GDfv] [^111J59pv] [^111TS1VV] [^115rbopW] [^112gFCkF].

> Let me think about the clinical implications of different infiltrate patterns, because this guides urgency and therapy. Consolidation on CXR correlates with bacterial pneumonia and is associated with higher severity and mortality in children, whereas isolated interstitial infiltrates are more often viral and carry lower short-term risk; in ventilator-associated pneumonia, a new infiltrate plus two clinical features increases the likelihood, but absence of a new infiltrate lowers it substantially, so I should avoid overcalling VAP on radiography alone; in COVID-19, ground-glass opacities predominate and quantitative CXR scoring correlates with inflammatory markers and hypoxemia, which can aid triage and monitoring [^116LYmSu] [^111rAtYN] [^114qHMdh].

> I should double-check the role of CT and ultrasound when CXR is equivocal or suspicion remains high. Early CT in suspected CAP can reclassify a substantial fraction of patients and align management with adjudicated diagnoses; point-of-care lung ultrasound can detect effusions and consolidation with greater sensitivity than CXR in some settings and helps identify empyema requiring drainage; in nonresolving pneumonia, CT can uncover alternative diagnoses such as empyema, obstructing lesions, or organizing pneumonia, guiding source control or alternative therapies [^113ixUEo] [^116mGrfY].

> But wait, what if the infiltrate is actually atelectasis or a mimic? I need to check for volume loss, air bronchograms, and silhouette signs to distinguish consolidation from atelectasis, and I should correlate with clinical evolution. In children, atelectasis is common and can be mistaken for pneumonia, and in adults with COPD or heart failure, chronic changes and edema can confound interpretation, so serial imaging and clinical reassessment are prudent when the diagnosis is uncertain [^113jAnfD] [^115wJc8R] [^116mGrfY] [^113p3gVT].

> Next, I should review a practical, evidence-based approach. Start with clinical pretest probability and obtain a CXR when results will change management. In children with bronchiolitis, avoid routine CXR unless severe or deteriorating. In suspected CAP, confirm with CXR when feasible, recognizing that a negative film does not exclude pneumonia in high-risk patients. In immunocompromised hosts or severe disease, escalate to CT early. Document the pattern and distribution of infiltrates to refine the differential. And if the patient fails to improve, repeat imaging to assess complications or alternative diagnoses rather than assuming treatment failure from a static film [^111J59pv] [^116N8vas] [^1112GDfv] [^116mGrfY].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up expectations and counseling. Radiographic resolution commonly lags clinical improvement by days to weeks, and in older adults or those with comorbidities, complete clearing can take up to 6–10 weeks. Therefore, routine repeat CXR is not needed in clinically improving patients, but persistent or worsening symptoms should prompt repeat imaging and reconsideration of the diagnosis and source control [^116mGrfY].

On a chest X-ray, an "infiltrate" is an **area of increased lung opacity** [^1177uUQn] that reflects fluid, pus, blood, or cells replacing air in the alveoli or interstitium [^notfound]. It is a **nonspecific finding** [^113emMxa] with a broad differential, including pneumonia, edema, hemorrhage, malignancy, or interstitial disease [^116W5QfY]. Diagnosis requires **clinical correlation** [^116N8vas] and, when needed, **CT** [^113ixUEo] or other tests to distinguish these entities and guide management [^111rAtYN].

---

## Radiographic appearance

Infiltrates appear as **localized or diffuse opacities** [^113jAnfD] that obscure vascular markings and may show air bronchograms [^11784USS]. Patterns include:

- **Consolidation**: Alveolar filling (air bronchograms, silhouette sign) [^115wJc8R].
- **Interstitial infiltrates**: Reticular or nodular opacities (e.g. interstitial edema, viral pneumonia) [^116XH2Lj].
- **Ground-glass opacities**: Hazy increased attenuation with preserved vessels (e.g. early pneumonia, edema, hemorrhage) [^116XH2Lj].

---

## Clinical significance

Infiltrates are **nonspecific** [^116K5XcC] and require clinical context to determine etiology and management [^113p3gVT]. Common causes include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Pneumonia (bacterial, viral, fungal) [^116N8vas] <br/> - Tuberculosis [^113AHhyj] <br/> - Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [^113jAnfD] |
| Non-infectious | - Pulmonary edema (cardiogenic, non-cardiogenic) [^111TS1VV] <br/> - Pulmonary hemorrhage <br/> - Malignancy <br/> - Interstitial lung disease [^115n1VzF] <br/> - Aspiration [^112LY36q] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is essential:

- **Clinical correlation**: History, exam, and labs guide the differential [^11556vYZ].
- **Imaging**: CXR is first-line [^113jAnfD]; CT is used for equivocal cases or to define pattern/etiology [^113jAnfD].
- **Microbiology**: Sputum, blood, or bronchoscopy when infection is suspected [^113emMxa].
- **Follow-up**: Serial imaging can clarify evolution and response [^116mGrfY].

---

## Limitations and pitfalls

CXR has **limited sensitivity/specificity** [^113ixUEo]; interobserver variability is common [^116SJwU1], especially for interstitial disease [^116SJwU1]. CT improves diagnostic accuracy [^113ixUEo] but adds radiation and cost; clinical judgment remains essential [^11556vYZ].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Management depends on **etiology**: antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia [^notfound], diuretics and vasodilators for edema [^notfound], immunosuppression for inflammatory disease, and oncologic therapy for malignancy. Early, accurate diagnosis improves outcomes and reduces complications [^1159JQG8].

---

An infiltrate on chest X-ray is a **nonspecific opacity** [^1177uUQn] indicating replacement of air with fluid, pus, blood, or cells; it requires clinical correlation and, when needed, advanced imaging [^113ixUEo] to determine cause and guide therapy [^113ixUEo].

An updated set of reference training chest radiographs is being developed under the World Health Organization CRES project. Prior to the June 2016 meeting, the World Health Organization Technical Working Group applied the proposed clarifications to the World Health Organization definitions by interpreting a set of 400 chest radiographs that were not part of the original World Health Organization reference training set (50 from the Gambia Pneumococcal Surveillance Study and 350 from the Pneumonia Etiology in Childhood Research study) and 50 chest radiographs from the original World Health Organization reference training set. These 450 chest radiographs were read by the World Health Organization Technical Working Group members and assigned to one of the three conclusions. Thirteen readers from the World Health Organization Technical Working Group completed all 450 chest radiographs at the time of a data freeze on 20 June 2016. Detailed analysis of these readings showed good correlation between the final reading using the original World Health Organization definitions and those of the new readers using the clarified criteria. As described in the literature using World Health Organization defined standardized chest radiograph definitions, the inter-reader agreement for primary endpoint pneumonia is better than the inter-reader agreement for other infiltrates. Using the clarifications to the World Health Organization standardized chest radiograph interpretation, the inter-reader agreement for the 13 readers was best for primary endpoint pneumonia (Cohen kappa = 0.55), which is moderate agreement. A full analysis of these readings for individual chest radiograph findings will be presented in a later publication.

### Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia: controversies and working toward a gold standard [^113emMxa]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to discuss the clinical, microbiologic, and radiological criteria used in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), distinguish between ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and VAP, and reconcile the proposed Centers for Disease Control surveillance criteria with clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Numerous ventilator-associated complications (VACs), including VAP and VAT, may occur in critically ill, intubated patients. A variety of definitions for identifying VAP have been proposed, but there is no diagnostic gold standard. The proposed surveillance definition will identify infectious and noninfectious VAC, including VAP and VAT, but this definition may be inadequate for clinical practice.

Summary

The clinical characteristics of VAP and VAT are similar and include fever, leukocytosis, and purulent sputum. An infiltrate on chest radiograph is consistent with VAP but lacks diagnostic precision, so it is not a criterion in the proposed surveillance definition and should be interpreted cautiously by clinicians. Microbiologically, quantitative and semiquantitative endotracheal aspirate cultures may be employed to diagnose VAP and VAT. Positive bronchoalveolar lavage and protected specimen brush cultures are useful only for the diagnosis of VAP. Experts should collaborate to develop consensus definitions for VAP and VAT that can be applied in practice.

### Chest radiograph findings in childhood pneumonia cases from the multisite PERCH study [^112u1Hfx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A CXR was obtained from each case as soon as possible after clinical evaluation and study enrollment. All sites underwent a prestudy assessment of radiography facilities and procedures to review quality and safety and to standardize the collection of CXRs. Most sites used digital CXR imaging equipment, except Zambia and Matlab where analog techniques were used; analog images were scanned into digital format and all files managed according to a standardized operating procedure. Standardized methods for the collection and interpretation of chest radiographs are detailed elsewhere. Each CXR was randomly assigned to be assessed by 2 members of a reading panel, comprised of 14 radiologists and pediatricians from study sites trained in the WHO methodology for the standardized interpretation of pediatric CXRs. Two randomly selected members of a 4-person arbitration panel, consisting of experienced radiologists, resolved discordant interpretations by further blinded interpretations and a final consensus discussion if needed. Readers and arbitrators were unaware of the clinical and demographic information associated with each CXR, and readers did not interpret CXRs from their own site. Conclusions for CXRs were (1) consolidation (ie, alveolar consolidation, including pleural effusion if present) only; (2) other infiltrate only; (3) both consolidation and other infiltrate; (4) normal (no consolidation or infiltrate); and (5) uninterpretable for consolidation and/or other infiltrate. Additional conclusions derived from these 5 categories were (a) abnormal (1, 2, or 3), (b) any consolidation (1 or 3), and (c) any other infiltrate (2 or 3). For cases with multiple CXRs, the conclusion of the first interpretable CXR was used. CXR conclusions were excluded if the CXR was taken more than 72 hours after admission to avoid bias from possible nosocomial complications.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease is caused by thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature. The diagnostic criteria include the presence of pulmonary infiltrate(s) on chest x-ray. This case report suggests that a V/Q scan may play a diagnostic role in sickle cell patients with symptoms of ACS and a negative chest x-ray.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline — chest x-ray in suspected heart failure: The chest x-ray is a useful initial diagnostic test for the evaluation of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of HF, but cardiomegaly may be absent in acute HF and findings such as cephalization, interstitial edema, and alveolar edema are relatively insensitive; considering the limited sensitivity and specificity, the chest x-ray should not be used as the only determinant of the specific cause or presence of HF.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115T7z2g]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Consensus statement — immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) diagnosis requires clinical suspicion of a lung infection, with or without compatible clinical signs and symptoms, and with radiographic evidence of a new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate; the panel determined that the formal diagnostic criteria for ICHP would be best presented as an algorithm, with an approach for hosts with a known immune defect determined by compatible clinical presentation, possible pathogen identification, and exclusion of competing causes of the clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic manifestations, and an alternate algorithm for patients without previously known immune defects who present with evidence of pneumonia caused by an unusual opportunistic pathogen; additionally, clarifying statement 1 notes that clinical presentations of pneumonia are often atypical in immunocompromised hosts, therefore signs and symptoms of pneumonia are not required.

### Pneumonias in the compromised host [^116W5QfY]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The choice of diagnostic modality depends on the patient's status, the expertise of the operator and pathologic resources of the hospital, and is a decision that should be guided by the infectious disease consultant and the clinicians involved in the care of the patient. Although the diagnosis must be tissue based, every attempt must be made to arrive at a tissue diagnosis as soon as possible in order to start specific therapy as soon as possible. It is as important to determine that the cause of the patient's pulmonary infiltrate is noninfectious versus infectious. Pulmonary embolic disease, CHF, ARDS, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pulmonary drug reactions may be reversible and require nonantimicrobially based therapies to treat the patient. Often clinicians are overwhelmed by differential diagnostic possibilities of exotic infectious disease pathogens and overlook easily treatable noninfectious disease mimics of pneumonia. Although differential diagnostic possibilities are great in the compromised host, clinicians should not be overwhelmed by diagnostic possibilities. Instead, clinicians should try to approach the patient syndromically, taking into account the degree and type of immunosuppression, the appearance and behavior of the infiltrates on the chest radiograph and the nature of the host defense defects and time relationships that will limit the differential diagnosis to relatively few diagnostic possibilities. The clinician can then treat empirically patients with presumed bacterial pneumonias and devise a diagnostic plan designed to arrive at a specific tissue diagnosis as soon as possible in patients who are likely to have nonbacterial infection of the lungs.

### Chest radiograph findings in childhood pneumonia cases from the multisite PERCH study [^111rEDVU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 3973/4232 (94%) cases had a CXR conclusion and of these 386 (10%) were uninterpretable (range, 4% in Gambia and Thailand to 20% in Zambia), leaving 3587 cases for analyses (Figure 1). Overall, 54% of interpretable CXRs were abnormal (site range from 35% in Matlab to 64% in HIV-negative cases from South Africa; Figure 2 and Table 1). Of these, 50% had consolidation (either alone or with other infiltrate) and 50% had other infiltrate only. Those with abnormal CXRs were more likely to be HIV infected (19% vs 5%) and aged < 24 months (88% vs 83%; Table 1). However, the relationship between age and CXR outcome differed by severity strata. Among severe pneumonia cases, the youngest children (aged 1–5 months) were less likely to have an abnormal CXR compared to those in older age categories, and among very severe pneumonia cases, the youngest children were more likely to have an abnormal CXR (Supplemental Table 1).

Radiologic Changes

We saw a variety of chest x-ray changes in these patients (Tables 3 and 4). The primary abnormalities were patchy unilateral or bilateral consolidation. Opacities were predominantly in the lower lung zones in most patients. Three patients had upper lobe infiltrates. However, five of the patients were admitted to the hospital with normal chest x-ray results.

### Predictors of airspace disease on chest X-ray in emergency department patients with clinical bronchiolitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111J59pv]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

An abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) inconsistent with simple bronchiolitis is found in 7%-23% of cases. Despite national guidelines stating "current evidence does not support routine radiography in children with bronchiolitis"; the use of CXR in these patients remains high. Inappropriate use of CXR not only exposes children to excess radiation, but also increases medical costs. The majority of the time, CXRs are obtained to diagnose or rule out pneumonia. We aim to provide an evidence-based approach defining the utility of CXR in bronchiolitis for the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial pneumonia.

Objectives

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe potential predictors of a CXR with airspace disease in patients with bronchiolitis.

Methods

We searched the medical literature from 1965 to June 2015 in PubMed/EMBASE using the following PICO formulation of our clinical question, "What characteristic(s) of history/physical examination (H&P) and vital signs (VS) in a child with bronchiolitis should prompt the physician to order a CXR?": Patients-pediatric emergency department (ED) patients (< 2 years) with clinical bronchiolitis; Intervention-H&P and VS; Comparator-a CXR positive for airspace disease (+CXR), defined as atelectasis versus infiltrate or infiltrate/consolidation; and Outcome-operating characteristics of H&P and VS predicting an +CXR were calculated: sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR+ or LR-). The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed using the quality assessment of studies of diagnostic accuracy tool (QUADAS-2). We created a test-treatment threshold model based on the operating characteristics of the CXR to accurately identify a child with bronchiolitis and a superimposed bacterial pneumonia while accounting for the risks of a CXR and risks of treating patients with and without a bacterial infection.

Results

We found five studies including 1,139 patients meeting our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Prevalence of a +CXR ranged from 7% to 23%. An oxygen saturation < 95% was the predictor with highest LR+ of 2.3 (95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 3.07) to predict a +CXR. None of the H&P and VS variables were found to have sufficiently low LR- to significantly decrease the pretest probability of finding a +CXR. Our test-treatment threshold model showed that hypoxia (O 2 Sat < 95%) alone complicating bronchiolitis did not show a benefit to obtaining a CXR. Our model only suggested that a CXR maybe indicated for a child with hypoxia (O 2 Sat < 95%) and respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support.

Conclusion

No single predictor of a +CXR was of sufficient accuracy to either support or refute ordering a CXR in a child with clinical bronchiolitis. We provide a decision threshold model to estimate a test threshold for obtaining a CXR and a treatment threshold for administering antibiotics. Application of this model requires the clinician to approximate the empiric benefit of antibiotics based on the clinical situation, highlighting the importance of clinical assessment.

### Standardized interpretation of chest radiographs in cases of pediatric pneumonia from the PERCH study [^116c95SP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background.

Chest radiographs (CXRs) are a valuable diagnostic tool in epidemiologic studies of pneumonia. The World Health Organization (WHO) methodology for the interpretation of pediatric CXRs has not been evaluated beyond its intended application as an endpoint measure for bacterial vaccine trials.

Methods.

The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study enrolled children aged 1–59 months hospitalized with WHO-defined severe and very severe pneumonia from 7 low- and middle-income countries. An interpretation process categorized each CXR into 1 of 5 conclusions: consolidation, other infiltrate, both consolidation and other infiltrate, normal, or uninterpretable. Two members of a 14-person reading panel, who had undertaken training and standardization in CXR interpretation, interpreted each CXR. Two members of an arbitration panel provided additional independent reviews of CXRs with discordant interpretations at the primary reading, blinded to previous reports. Further discordance was resolved with consensus discussion.

Results.

A total of 4172 CXRs were obtained from 4232 cases. Observed agreement for detecting consolidation (with or without other infiltrate) between primary readers was 78% (κ = 0.50) and between arbitrators was 84% (κ = 0.61); agreement for primary readers and arbitrators across 5 conclusion categories was 43.5% (κ = 0.25) and 48.5% (κ = 0.32), respectively. Disagreement was most frequent between conclusions of other infiltrate and normal for both the reading panel and the arbitration panel (32% and 30% of discordant CXRs, respectively).

Conclusions.

Agreement was similar to that of previous evaluations using the WHO methodology for detecting consolidation, but poor for other infiltrates despite attempts at a rigorous standardization process.

### The inter-observer variation of chest radiograph reading in acute lower respiratory tract infection among children [^112RL8pV]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2013). Low credibility.

This study assessed the inter-observer agreement in the interpretation of several radiographic features in the chest radiographs (CXR) of 803 children aged 2–59 months with non-severe acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI). Inclusion criteria comprised: report of respiratory complaints, detection of lower respiratory findings, and presence of pulmonary infiltrate on the CXR taken on admission and read by the pediatrician on duty. Data on demographic and clinical findings on admission were collected from children included in a clinical trial on the use of amoxicillin (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01200706). CXR was later read by two independent pediatric radiologists blinded to clinical information and pneumonia was finally diagnosed if there was agreement on the presence of pulmonary infiltrate or pleural effusion. The kappa index (κ) of agreement was calculated. The radiologists agreed that 774 (96.4%) and 3 (0.4%) CXR were appropriate or inappropriate for reading, respectively, and that 222 (28.7%) and 459 (59.3%) CXR presented or did not present pneumonia. In intent to treat analysis, that is, considering the 803 enrolled patients, κ for the presence of pneumonia was 0.725 (95% CI: 0.675–0.775). The overall agreement was 78.7% (normal CXR [n = 385, 60.9%], pneumonia [n = 222, 35.1%], other radiological diagnosis [n = 22, 3.5%], inappropriate for reading [n = 3, 0.5%]). The most frequent radiological findings were alveolar infiltrate (33.2%) and consolidation (32.9%) by radiologist 1 and consolidation (28.3%) and alveolar infiltrate (19.3%) by radiologist 2. Concordance for consolidation was 86.7% (k = 0.683, 95%CI: 0.631–0.741). Agreement was good between two pediatric radiologists when diagnosis of pneumonia among children with non-severe ALRI was compared.

### Outbreak of electronic-cigarette-associated acute lipoid pneumonia… [^114CZawi]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

1). During July and August 2019, five patients were identified at two hospitals in North Carolina with acute lung injury potentially associated with e-cigarette use. Patients were adults aged 18–35 years and all experienced several days of worsening dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and fever. All patients demonstrated tachypnea with increased work of breathing on examination, hypoxemia, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest x-ray. Mycoplasma, and Legionella also were negative. Computed tomography of the chest revealed diffuse basilar-predominant infiltrates with a range of "ground glass" opacities and nodular or "tree-in-bud" infiltrates in all patients. Three patients underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage on hospital days 3–5, yielding a combination of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and vacuole-laden macrophages, but without evidence for alveolar hemorrhage or eosinophilia.

No bronchoscopic lung biopsies were performed. Lavage cytology was stained with oil red O, which confirmed extensive lipid within alveolar macrophages. Based on clinical history, radiography, and laboratory and bronchoscopic diagnostics, a diagnosis of acute exogenous lipoid pneumonia was made for all five patients. 2–6). Symptoms of lipoid pneumonia are often nonspecific with variable chest imaging, which can lead to delayed or missed diagnosis. FIGURE 1.

### Advances in the support of respiratory failure: putting all the evidence together [^114tD6Ps]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Debate regarding the concept that a unifying entity of ARDS even exists was conducted throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. During that latter decade, suspicion grew that the therapy we applied for life support in an attempt to improve oxygenation could itself cause damage to the lung or retard its healing (VILI). Moreover, those years saw the rise of evidence-based medicine (EBM) and of the perceived need for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to provide a convincing and reliable basis for making care decisions. Motivated by those developments, the American-European Consensus Committee (AECC) formulated a definition of ARDS in 1994, and this standard served as the qualifying definition for numerous trials of respiratory support, most of which proved inconclusive. That AECC definition did not include specific criteria relating to respiratory mechanics or stipulate precise radiographic criteria. The gradually recognized need for improved discriminating criteria resulted in the Berlin-modified version of the AECC definition, published in 2012. Although clearly an improvement over the AECC definition, the need to interface with data from prior clinical trials resulted in shared features that continue to be overly broad and inexact (Figure 1). No mechanics criteria were included, no standard ventilatory settings were specified, radiographic criteria remain imprecise, no requirement was made for confirming the durability of the syndrome over time, and there was no accounting for nonpulmonary contributors to hypoxemia (e.g. excessive oxygen extraction) that might be unrelated to inflammatory conditions within the lung itself. Functional tests are lacking in the current Berlin definition. At the bedside, one might wonder whether clinicians are really sure what the Berlin-defined term "ARDS" now refers to. When comparing Petty's original definition with the current one, we note that "abrupt" onset has become "acute" onset whose putative cause might have originated as long as 1 week earlier. Some terminology of the initial 1967 definition has been relaxed in other ways: "refractory" hypoxemia has become "severe" hypoxemia, "diffuse" infiltrates have become "bilateral multi-lobar" infiltrates, and "stiff lungs" are now "reduced respiratory system compliance" — a term that includes the chest wall.

### Feasibility, reproducibility, and clinical validity of a quantitative chest X-ray assessment for COVID-19 [^114qHMdh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Chest X-ray (CXR) is an essential first-line tool in COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis and management. Our study aimed at assessing 1) CXR manifestations, frequency, and distribution; 2) the feasibility and repeatability of a CXR severity score; and 3) the correlation between the CXR severity score and clinical and laboratory parameters. We reviewed baseline CXRs and clinical data of consecutive patients who presented to our emergency department and resulted positive at SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-PCR oropharyngeal swab test from March 1, 2020 to April 6, 2020. Lung abnormalities and their distribution were analyzed. A score of CXR severity was assigned by two radiologists, independently, according to the extent of lung involvement, with a maximum score of 8 for CXR. Correlations between the CXR score and the clinical data were assessed. One hundred fifty-five patients were included; 143/155 (92%) were positive at baseline CXR. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (141/143, 99%). Involvement was mainly bilateral (96/143, 67%), with peripheral distribution (79/143, 55%). The mean CXR severity score was 3.3 (± 2); interobserver agreement was excellent, with a Cohen's K correlation coefficient of 0.901. The CXR score showed a significant positive correlation with C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and fever duration, and a negative correlation with oxygen saturation. Chest X-ray findings are in line with those reported by computed tomography studies. The use of a visual CXR score, easy to assess and highly reproducible, can reflect the clinical severity and help the patients' management.

### Association between emphysema and other pulmonary computed tomography patterns in COVID-19 pneumonia [^114y87ek]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrary to the conventional X‐ray methods, CT scans of chest can show us more detailed view of blood vessels, lungs and soft tissue. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) is needed to learn CT imaging models in depth. Increasingly, AI methods have been developed and then used to sense infected patients.,

Moreover, to our knowledge, only a few studies have so far analyzed the relationship between pulmonary infiltrates and emphysema in chest CT. Our study aimed to describe the relationship between pulmonary infiltrates and emphysema by means of a CT model in patients of COVID‐19.

The degree of pulmonary infiltrations and the presence of areas such as emphysema or bullae are usually analyzed visually on CT scans. Abnormalities cannot be quantified in numbers or milliliters, making it difficult to compare results objectively. This is particularly critical in the current COVID‐19 pandemic situation, where there are many cases of patients with severe pulmonary infiltrates. Lung CT Analyzer (LTCA) enables three‐dimensional segmentation of lung CT data and calculation of individual volumes of pulmonary infiltrates and emphysema. In our study, we applied it to model the lungs and lesions of COVID‐19 patients for competitive analysis.

### Development of image-based decision support systems utilizing information extracted from radiological free-text report databases with text-based transformers [^111zp3Gf]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dataset

With institutional review board approval (AZ 411/21), written informed consent was waived. Approved data processing took place based on the health data protection act North Rhine-Westphalia (GDSG NW) §6 (2) state law NRW. The initial cohort includes 93,368 chest X-ray examinations with reports in German language of 20,913 ICU patients of the University Hospital Bonn from December 2015 to July 2021. The chest X-ray examinations were requested from various ICUs of our clinic (24% from anesthesiological, 24% from cardio-surgical, 20% from surgical, 11% from cardiological, 8% from neurological, 7% from internal medicine, 3% from oncological, and 3% from pediatric ICUs). In a previous study, two trained medical research assistants manually annotated the content of 18,000 chest X-ray reports under the supervision of a radiology resident with a mean annotation time of 39.4 s per report. In these manually assessed reports, common indications were "position of medical devices" (45%) or presence of "pleural infiltrates" (39%), "pneumothorax" (38%), "pleural effusion" (30%), and "congestion" (22%). Additional 500 reports were annotated by the radiology resident and independently by the trained medical research assistants to assess inter-reader variability (mean accuracy of agreement: 97.4% and 97.3%, mean Cohen's kappa: 0.92 and 0.91). These manually generated annotations are referred to as "gold labels". This gold-labeled data set was randomly split into 14,580 training (A Report), 1620 validation (B Report), and 2300 hold-out test reports (C Report). The test set includes the 500 annotations from the radiology resident. For 200 reports of the test set that were annotated by the medical research assistants, the radiology resident reinterpreted imaging to assess overall label quality and to serve as an additional image labeled test set (D Report). In addition to these gold-labeled reports, automatically generated "silver labels" (S Report) were created by text-based transformer models (see Fig. 1). Detailed information about the annotation process can be found in supplement S5 and details on the development of the employed NLP algorithms can be found in the previous open-access study.

### Preliminary report from the world health organisation chest radiography in epidemiological studies project [^115DKmb6]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The new set of World Health Organization training chest radiographs are being prepared, emphasizing the need for inclusion of chest radiographs with a high World Health Organization CRES committee reader agreement. The chest radiographs will have comments and annotations added by a subgroup of the World Health Organization CRES project in order to improve their value as a teaching tool. Guidelines for the training and assessment of chest radiograph readers and support for studies in the form of a centralized arbitration process for discordant chest radiograph interpretations are also under development.

The original World Health Organization Radiology Working Group provided standardized definitions on chest radiograph quality. An adequate chest radiograph allows for confident interpretation for primary endpoint pneumonia and other infiltrates. Suboptimal chest radiograph allows for the interpretation of primary endpoint pneumonia but not for other infiltrates. Uninterpretable chest radiograph is not interpretable with respect to the presence or absence of primary endpoint pneumonia or other infiltrates (Table 1). The current World Health Organization CRES project also encompasses the need to optimize both chest radiograph quality and radiation safety for patients and staff. A proposed chest radiograph quality criteria framework is being developed into a set of guidelines for investigators and potential sites with the main objectives being to ensure that chest radiographs are acquired and archived to a specific standard, and that consideration of radiation safety is paramount during the image acquisition process. A checklist with supporting material is under development, which will identify issues to be addressed before, during and after a study involving chest radiographs.

### Diagnostic accuracy of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in suspected community-acquired pneumonia adults visiting emergency department and having a systematic thoracic CT scan [^11159f5D]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequently seen disease, with high morbidity and mortality, accounting for 600,000 hospitalizations each year. It represents the seventh leading cause of death in the USA. CAP prognosis depends on the rapidity of specific treatment, which should ideally be initiated within four hours and no later than eight hours after diagnosis. CAP diagnosis is based on the clustering of non-specific pulmonary and general symptoms, an increase in biomarkers reflecting systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and the presence of new parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray. However, CAP diagnosis remains uncertain in many cases with alternative diagnoses, such as cardiac failure, acute bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, pulmonary embolism, neoplasia, and sepsis.

Part of the uncertainty of CAP diagnosis may be due to the high rate of chest X-ray misdiagnosis; over diagnosis of CAP is frequent when infiltrates of non-infectious origin coexist with pulmonary or general symptoms, and the diagnosis of CAP is often ignored when the lung infiltrates are at the limit of visibility or are hidden due to superposition. We recently published a study in which thoracic CT scan was systematically performed in a population of clinically suspected CAP patients visiting the emergency department for CAP (the ESCAPED study). We showed that CAP diagnosis based on chest X-ray led to a false CAP diagnosis in many patients: among CAP suspected patients with radiological pulmonary infiltrate, CAP diagnosis was excluded in around 30% of patients based on CT scan results; on the contrary, among patients without radiological pulmonary infiltrate, one-third had a pulmonary infiltrate on thoracic CT-scan. We also reported the isolation of viruses in one-third of patients.

Several attempts have been made to improve CAP diagnosis based on biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT); however, there are conflicting data on their reliability. This could be due to the consideration of CAP diagnosis based on chest X-ray as establishing pulmonary infection. In the present study, we aimed to analyze CRP and PCT values in the population of the ESCAPED study reported above for whom CAP diagnosis was established by an adjudication committee which founded its judgment on all usual available data, systematic multidetector thoracic CT scan performed at inclusion, and results from a day-28 follow-up. We also analyzed whether the viral etiology of definite CAP based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex naso-pharyngeal swab interfered with the accuracy of the biomarkers.

### Impact of chest X-ray before discharge in asymptomatic children after cardiac surgery – prospective evaluation [^113fzaDh]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

In many paediatric cardiac units chest radiographs are performed routinely before discharge after cardiac surgery. These radiographs contribute to radiation exposure. To evaluate the diagnostic impact of routine chest X-rays before discharge in children undergoing open heart surgery and to analyze certain risk factors predicting pathologic findings. This was a prospective (6 months) single-centre observational clinical study. One hundred twenty-eight consecutive children undergoing heart surgery underwent biplane chest X-ray at a mean of 13 days after surgery. Pathologic findings on chest X-rays were defined as infiltrate, atelectasis, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or signs of fluid overload. One hundred nine asymptomatic children were included in the final analysis. Risk factors, such as age, corrective versus palliative surgery, reoperation, sternotomy versus lateral thoracotomy, and relevant pulmonary events during postoperative paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay, were analysed. In only 5.5% (6 of 109) of these asymptomatic patients were pathologic findings on routine chest X-ray before discharge found. In only three of these cases (50%), subsequent noninvasive medical intervention (increasing diuretics) was needed. All six patients had relevant pulmonary events during their PICU stay. Risk factor analysis showed only pulmonary complications during PICU stay to be significantly associated (p = 0.005) with pathologic X-ray findings. Routine chest radiographs before discharge after cardiac surgery can be omitted in asymptomatic children with an uneventful and straightforward perioperative course. Chest radiographs before discharge are warrantable if pulmonary complications did occur during their PICU stay, as this is a risk factor for pathologic findings in chest X-rays before discharge.

### Report of the ISHLT working group on primary lung graft dysfunction, part I: definition and grading – A 2016 consensus group statement of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^1144cCAt]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation primary lung graft dysfunction — definition and grading describe primary graft dysfunction (PGD) as the syndrome of acute lung injury early after lung transplantation, and the ISHLT Working Group proposed a consensus-based standardized definition and grading system to characterize it. PGD is characterized clinically by diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray imaging, with the degree of associated hypoxemia determining its severity, and in its "purest" form has no proven, singular etiology, representing the result of mechanical, immune, inflammatory, possible microbial, and other contributors associated with LTx. The original description was inclusive and allowed characterization of any LTx recipient while allowing for exclusion or sub-group analyses of specific contributing etiologies, such as infection or cardiogenic edema, for particular study purposes.

### Chest radiograph vs. computed tomography scan in the evaluation for pneumonia [^116YYobL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

To determine, in an Emergency Department (ED) population, the incidence of pneumonia diagnosed on thoracic computed tomography (CT) in the setting of negative or non-diagnostic chest radiographs (CXR). This is a retrospective chart review of all ED visits of adult patients ultimately diagnosed with "pneumonia" in whom both CXR and CT were obtained. We note cases in which the CXR was either negative or non-diagnostic for pneumonia and the CT noted a definitive infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Of the 1,057 patients diagnosed with pneumonia, both CXR and CT were performed in 97 cases. Of this group, there were 26 patients (27%), in whom the CXR was either negative or non-diagnostic, but the CT noted an infiltrate/consolidation consistent with pneumonia. In our retrospective review of ED patients, we find that in 27% of cases in which both a CXR and a CT scan were performed in the work-up of varied chief complaints, pneumonia was demonstrated on CT in the face of a negative or non-diagnostic CXR. This analysis demonstrates the need for further studies regarding the appropriate radiographic evaluation of pneumonia, particularly in high-risk patients.

### The idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: understanding key radiological features [^116TU57T]. Clinical Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Many radiologists find it challenging to distinguish between the different interstitial idiopathic pneumonias (IIPs). The British Thoracic Society guidelines on interstitial lung disease (2008) recommend the formation of multidisciplinary meetings, with diagnoses made by combined radiological, pathological, and clinical findings. This review focuses on understanding typical and atypical radiological features on high-resolution computed tomography between the different IIPs, to help the radiologist determine when a confident diagnosis can be made and how to deal with uncertainty.

### Imaging the injured lung: mechanisms of action and clinical use [^115TEYff]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) consists of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure characterized by massive and heterogeneously distributed loss of lung aeration caused by diffuse inflammation and edema present in interstitial and alveolar spaces. It is defined by consensus criteria, which include diffuse infiltrates on chest imaging-either plain radiography or computed tomography. This review will summarize how imaging sciences can inform modern respiratory management of ARDS and continue to increase the understanding of the acutely injured lung. This review also describes newer imaging methodologies that are likely to inform future clinical decision-making and potentially improve outcome. For each imaging modality, this review systematically describes the underlying principles, technology involved, measurements obtained, insights gained by the technique, emerging approaches, limitations, and future developments. Finally, integrated approaches are considered whereby multimodal imaging may impact management of ARDS.

### Standardized interpretation of chest radiographs in cases of pediatric pneumonia from the PERCH study [^114Y6D1H]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The WHO methodology was designed to optimize the detection of any consolidation (termed primary endpoint pneumonia for the vaccine trials), and this conclusion had the highest level of agreement in our study, similar to other pneumonia studies and evaluations of the WHO methodology. Interobserver agreement for any consolidation in both the Californian and Gambian pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) trials was κ = 0.58 (data was not reported for other trials). Similarly, a Mozambique pneumonia incidence study had an agreement of 77% (κ = 0.52) for any consolidation. In an antibiotic treatment study in Brazil, agreement for the detection of any consolidation or other infiltrate was 87% (κ = 0.68). This higher κ likely reflects a case mix with a higher prevalence of consolidation because of an enrollment criterion requiring the presence of CXR infiltrates.

Relying solely on consolidation may underestimate burden of disease, as suggested by estimates from the South African PCV trial where only 38% of children with pneumococcal pneumonia were thought to have CXR consolidation. While study methods and case selection criteria can influence prevalence estimates of consolidation, PERCH used a rigorously standardized study protocol and demonstrated a varied prevalence between sites. Other radiographic appearances also capture cases of true pneumonia, pneumococcal or otherwise. Unfortunately, agreement on the presence of other infiltrates is more difficult to achieve; our results show lowest agreement for a finding of other infiltrate (Table 2) and that discordance is most common between interpretations of normal and other infiltrate (Table 3). The limitation of the WHO methodology in identifying nonconsolidation findings is particularly important in contexts where the prevalence of consolidation is low and milder radiographic changes predominate, such as areas with access to early antibiotic therapy or widespread use of pneumococcal and Hib conjugate vaccines.

### Potential interstitial lung abnormalities on chest X-rays prior to symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112X5r8e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The fact that a significant proportion of patients in whom either a chest X-ray or a CT-scan had been done for some other reason, prior to the start of symptoms related to IPF, is of interest. Interstitial lung abnormalities are found on CT-scans of 2–9% of older adults. When followed up, interstitial lung abnormalities are oftentimes progressive, and they associate with respiratory symptoms and increased mortality. However, as far as we are aware, it is not known what proportion of patients with IPF had potential interstitial lung abnormalities on previous imaging. The proportion of 58% that we found on chest X-rays is very high. Furthermore, these chest X-rays were done a median of 44.5 months prior to the start of symptoms, which indicates that subclinical disease can be present for a long time in many patients. This would indicate that screening of certain populations at high risk for IPF might be worthwhile, as there would be ample time for intervention an halting disease progression. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is presently unknown whether treatment with antifibrotic medication can prevent progression of interstitial lung abnormalities. Furthermore, it is not known whether the abnormalities seen on the chest X-rays represent the same clinical entity as interstitial lung abnormalities seen on chest CT-scans. The latter are often subtle changes that are not visible on chest X-rays, and might represent a much earlier stage of fibrosis.

We were not able to explore precisely how the radiology reports that mentioned potential interstitial lung abnormalities were interpreted by the requesting physician at the time that the imaging was done. In any case, the absence of (persisting) respiratory symptoms might have caused the physician at that time to refrain from further investigations or follow-up. Unfortunately, in these cases, this has meant that a rather easy opportunity for earlier diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung abnormalities was missed. A potential solution to be considered is that the radiologist report specifically advises to perform a chest CT-scan in case of potential interstitial lung abnormalities on a chest X-ray. Considering that 23% of this cohort had a chest X-ray done and 58% of chest X-rays showed abnormalities in this cohort, this would facilitate earlier diagnosis in at least one in eight patients with IPF. However, this might cause unnecessary CT-scans to be performed, and it is not known if this would lead to more timely diagnosis or recognition of patients with interstitial lung abnormalities that are a precursor to IPF.

### High discordance of chest X-ray and computed tomography for detection of pulmonary opacities in ED patients: implications for diagnosing pneumonia [^114mst2E]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest x-ray (CXR) compared to computed tomography (CT) for detection of pulmonary opacities in adult emergency department (ED) patients.

Methods

We conducted an observational cross-sectional study of adult patients presenting to 12 EDs in the United States from July 1, 2003, through November 30, 2006, who underwent both CXR and chest CT for routine clinical care. CXRs and CT scans performed on the same patient were matched. CXRs and CT scans were interpreted by attending radiologists and classified as containing pulmonary opacities if the final radiologist report noted opacity, infiltrate, consolidation, pneumonia, or bronchopneumonia. Using CT as a criterion standard, the diagnostic test characteristics of CXR to detect pulmonary opacities were calculated.

Results

The study cohort included 3423 patients. Shortness of breath, chest pain and cough were the most common complaints, with 96.1% of subjects reporting at least one of these symptoms. Pulmonary opacities were visualized on 309 (9.0%) CXRs and 191 (5.6%) CT scans. CXR test characteristics for detection of pulmonary opacities included: sensitivity 43.5% (95% CI, 36.4%-50.8%); specificity 93.0% (95% CI, 92.1%-93.9%); positive predictive value 26.9% (95% CI, 22.1%-32.2%); and negative predictive value 96.5% (95% CI, 95.8%-97.1%).

Conclusion

In this multicenter cohort of adult ED patients with acute cardiopulmonary symptoms, CXR demonstrated poor sensitivity and positive predictive value for detecting pulmonary opacities. Reliance on CXR to identify pneumonia may lead to significant rates of misdiagnosis.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117MgdF1]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — suggestive features distinguishing COPD from common mimics are listed as follows. COPD presents with symptoms slowly progressive and a history of tobacco smoking or other risk factors. Asthma shows variable airflow obstruction with symptoms that vary widely from day to day, symptoms worse at night/early morning, allergy, rhinitis, and/or eczema also present, often occurs in children, and family history of asthma. Congestive heart failure is suggested by chest X-ray showing a dilated heart and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary function tests indicating volume restriction, not airflow obstruction. Bronchiectasis features large volumes of purulent sputum, is commonly associated with bacterial infection, and chest X-ray/HRCT shows bronchial dilation. Tuberculosis can have onset at all ages, chest X-ray shows lung infiltrate, microbiological confirmation, and high local prevalence of tuberculosis. Obliterative bronchiolitis can occur in children, is seen after lung or bone marrow transplantation, and HRCT on expiration shows hypodense areas. Diffuse panbronchiolitis is predominantly seen in patients of Asian descent; most patients are male and nonsmokers; almost all have chronic sinusitis; and chest X-ray & HRCT show diffuse small centrilobular nodular opacities & hyperinflation. These features are characteristic but not mandatory; for example, a person who has never smoked may develop COPD, especially in LMICs where other risk factors may be more important than cigarette smoking.

### Health-related quality of life and radiological and functional lung changes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia 3 and 10 months after discharge [^113bhh8u]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Imaging analysis and score index in chest RX

All chest radiographs (X-ray) were analyzed by two radiologists specialized, blind to the clinical information, except knowing that all were confirmed cases by positive SARS-COV2-test.

The affectation is defined as:

- Interstitial involvement: reticular interstitial pattern and small ill-defined opacities.
- Faint opacities: areas of condensation in ground glass / discrete density, which do not erase vascular structures.
- Alveolar infiltrates: alveolar condensation with imprecise borders.
The modified quantitative radiological scoring system for radiological lung involvement includes two steps in image analysis:

1) The first step consists of dividing the lungs into 6 zones on the chest X-ray:
Upper areas (A and D): above the lower border of the aortic arch.
Middle areas (B and E): between the inferior border of the aortic arch and the inferior border of the right inferior pulmonary vein (that is to say, comprising the region of the pulmonary hila).
Inferior zones (C and F): between the lower border of the right inferior pulmonary vein and the diaphragm (that is, the pulmonary bases).

2) The second step consists of assigning a score (from 0 to 3) to each of these areas, based on the existing pulmonary abnormalities on the chest X-ray, as follows:
Score 0: no pulmonary abnormalities
Score 1: interstitial involvement
Score 2: faint opacities (equivalent to "ground glass" on CT)
Score 3: alveolar infiltrates

Scores for the 6 lung zones are added together to obtain an overall "CXR SCORE" (ranging from 0 to 18).

This score system was carried out both for the evaluation of the findings of COVID-19 infection in the chest X-ray at acute phase and for the control chest X-ray in the first and second follow-up.

Pulmonary function tests

Pulmonary function tests were done according to American Thoracic Society (ATS)–and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines. The following parameters were measured: spirometry; diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO).

### Legionnaire's pneumonia: is there really an interstitial disease? [^112b53dx]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Legionella pneumonia is usually classified as "atypical pneumonia", which suggests a predominance of interstitial patterns in chest X-rays. Based on a selection of recent clinical cases and a brief review of the literature, the aim of the study is to clarify, how far the actual radiological findings would be consistent with these expectations.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective analysis of 18 epidemic personal cases and a review of the literature data were performed to describe the chest X-ray findings of Legionella pneumophila (LP) community acquired pneumonia. X-ray review was performed simultaneously and in consensus by two radiologists (J.P.T. E.C.) and a physician (C.G.).

Results

From our series, 17 patients had an abnormal chest X-ray on admission. Among these pathological X-ray cases, infiltrates were more often confluent (n = 16), or patchy (n = 7), rather than interstitial (n = 1). Fifteen patients had infiltrates involving the lower lung fields. Bilateral distribution of abnormalities and pleural effusion were each observed in three cases. Radiological findings deteriorated between the second and seventh days following admission, particularly in the form of patchy infiltrates with pleural effusion. The review of the literature is consistent with these findings, by reporting prevalent confluent or patchy infiltrates.

Conclusions

These findings are consistent with the physiopathological particularity of this affection and incite us to avoid the classification "atypical pneumonia" in radiologic terminology. This term is more appropriate for clinical and microbiological use.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1112GDfv]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — diagnostic criteria and imaging: Clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, and hypoxemia should prompt evaluation with chest imaging, but these signs are not always present in immunocompromised hosts. Radiographic abnormalities are required for a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, and given multiple nonpulmonary causes in this population, findings consistent with an infection on imaging must be present for ICHP diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, lung infiltrates may not be evident by chest X-ray and may require a computed tomography scan for detection, and noninfectious pulmonary conditions must be distinguished from infection; immunocompromised hosts may have concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies of lung infiltrates.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^112Sdr5r]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the prognostic importance, imaging and pathology criteria for ILD in the context of ILAs focus on the presence of definite fibrosis; however, there are many other clinically relevant fibrotic and nonfibrotic ILDs. The committee noted that these patients typically have significant symptoms at presentation and would frequently meet the symptom and/or physiology criteria. There are additional interstitial patterns present on chest imaging and/or histopathology that would be considered to represent ILD even in the absence of symptoms or abnormal physiology (e.g. diffuse ground-glass abnormalities indicating cellular NSIP, centrilobular nodularity indicating nonfibrotic HP, features of sarcoidosis or organizing pneumonia). Integration of multiple domains is typically required to support a specific diagnosis in these scenarios.

### Predictors of a normal chest X-ray in respiratory syncytial virus infection [^1136hUtV]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for the majority of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in infants and young children. A chest x-ray is frequently performed in infants with LRTI caused by RSV. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prediction model to estimate the probability for a normal chest x-ray in children with RSV infection. For this purpose, easy obtainable diagnostic parameters were used. This prediction model may be applied to decide which patients do not require a chest x-ray. The data of 287 children admitted with RSV infection or diagnosed as such in the outpatient department of the Sophia Children's Hospital between 1992–1996 were studied. The derivation set comprised 232 patients (1992–1995), and the validation set contained 55 patients (1995–1996). A chest x-ray was designated as normal when atelectasis, hyperinflation, or pulmonary infiltrates were absent. In order to develop a prediction model, patient history and clinical and laboratory variables were consecutively entered into a logistic regression model according to the diagnostic workup that was practiced at the time. Variables with P ≤ 0.10 were retained in the model. The predictive accuracy of the multivariable models was examined using the area under receiver operating curve (ROC-area). In 202 (87%) patients from the derivation set, a chest x-ray was performed. A normal chest x-ray could be predicted by increasing age, increasing birth weight, presence of rhinitis, absence of retractions, and increasing arterial oxygen saturation. The ROC-area was 0.80 in the derivation and validation sets. This prediction model was transformed into a score chart. In conclusion, a normal chest x-ray can accurately be predicted, using a model including easily obtainable patient characteristics, and clinical and laboratory variables. This model may be a useful tool in deciding whether or not to perform a chest x-ray in patients with RSV infections.

### Recurrent flu-like illness with migrating pulmonary infiltrates of unknown aetiology [^116cZF1i]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Migrating pulmonary infiltrates present a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We report on eight patients (mean age 51 years, range 32–78 years, with a prolonged history of migrating pulmonary infiltrates of unknown aetiology despite a very elaborate search for infectious causes, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or inhalation fever due to occupational or domestic exposure to fungi, or to other environmental causes, and for humoral or cellular immunological incompetence. These patients (one male, seven females) presented with recurrent episodes (mean 6, range 2–13) of a flu-like illness, often with cough, wheezing and pleuritic chest pain, but without systemic involvement. Previous medical histories were unremarkable. There was no relation with smoking habits, occupation, drug use or other possible exposures. Biochemical data were non-specific. There was no peripheral nor pulmonary eosinophilia; total IgE was normal, with negative RASTs and precipitins to a variety of antigens. Cultures and serological tests for bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc were non-contributory. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral migratory pulmonary infiltrates, with a predilection for the middle and lower lung zones, often with a minor-to-moderate pleural effusion. Lung function tests were usually normal; at the most a slight decrease in diffusing capacity was noted in some patients. There was no or only a slight response to antimicrobials; systemic corticosteroids were not given. Further evolution was benign with patients being asymptomatic between the episodes. Despite elaborate investigations, the cause of these 'pneumonias' remains frustratingly unknown.

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^11556vYZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conversely, some experts question the usefulness of demonstrating the presence of a pneumonic infiltrate on CT-scan in a patient without pneumonia on CXR but with a high burden of suggestive symptoms, arguing that in this scenario, antibiotic treatment should not be withhold. This opinion is comforted by a study suggesting that hospitalized patients without demonstrable infiltrate on CXR but with signs and symptoms of pneumonia had the same rate of pathogens identification in sputum and blood cultures and the same prognosis that those with a confirmed infiltrate on CXR. The patients without CXR infiltrate were older, and had a high prevalence of CXR modifications other than pneumonia (mainly lung emphysema, heart failure and atelectasis). Only 7% of them developed a pneumonic infiltrate on follow-up CXR realized 24–72 h later. However, pathogens identified in the blood cultures of the latter were mostly gram-negative aerobic bacilli or nonpneumoniae streptococci, compared with a majority of S. pneumoniae in patients with an infiltrate on CXR. This suggests that patients without radiologic infiltrate had other sources of infection and of respiratory symptoms.

Finally, even with CT-scan data, the presence of pneumonia cannot be unambiguously determined in some situations. Examples are patients with heart failure and pleural effusion, who frequently have basal atelectasis that cannot be distinguished from parenchymal infection; or patients with an acute infiltrate superimposed on a chronic interstitial pneumonia (Figs. 3 and 4). Hence, a diagnosis of pneumonia will still need a careful integration of clinical, biological and radiological findings.

### Variability in the interpretation of chest radiographs for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children [^116SJwU1]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although chest radiography is commonly used to establish the diagnosis of pneumonia in children, the reliability of radiographic findings among radiologists is not well described.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of radiographic features commonly described by radiologists in childhood pneumonia.

Methods

Prospective case-based study. One hundred and ten radiographs of children evaluated in a pediatric emergency department for suspicion of pneumonia were interpreted by six radiologists at two academic children's hospitals. Radiologists were blinded to the clinical history. Reliability of standardized radiographic features was evaluated using the kappa statistic.

Results

The radiographic finding of an alveolar infiltrate demonstrated substantial reliability among radiologists (κ = 0.69). The presence of 'any infiltrate' and pleural effusion demonstrated moderate reliability (κ = 0.47 and k = 0.45, respectively). Other radiographic features were less reliable: air bronchograms (κ = 0.32), hilar adenopathy (κ = 0.21), and interstitial infiltrate (κ = 0.14). Similarly, the finding of alveolar infiltrate demonstrated substantial intra-rater reliability upon review of ten duplicate radiographs, whereas interstitial infiltrate was less reliable.

Conclusion

The radiographic finding of an alveolar infiltrate is very reliable among pediatric radiologists, whereas the finding of an interstitial infiltrate is less reliable.

### Standardized interpretation of chest radiographs in cases of pediatric pneumonia from the PERCH study [^112Qin6P]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background.

Chest radiographs (CXRs) are a valuable diagnostic tool in epidemiologic studies of pneumonia. The World Health Organization (WHO) methodology for the interpretation of pediatric CXRs has not been evaluated beyond its intended application as an endpoint measure for bacterial vaccine trials.

Methods.

The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study enrolled children aged 1–59 months hospitalized with WHO-defined severe and very severe pneumonia from 7 low- and middle-income countries. An interpretation process categorized each CXR into 1 of 5 conclusions: consolidation, other infiltrate, both consolidation and other infiltrate, normal, or uninterpretable. Two members of a 14-person reading panel, who had undertaken training and standardization in CXR interpretation, interpreted each CXR. Two members of an arbitration panel provided additional independent reviews of CXRs with discordant interpretations at the primary reading, blinded to previous reports. Further discordance was resolved with consensus discussion.

Results.

A total of 4172 CXRs were obtained from 4232 cases. Observed agreement for detecting consolidation (with or without other infiltrate) between primary readers was 78% (κ = 0.50) and between arbitrators was 84% (κ = 0.61); agreement for primary readers and arbitrators across 5 conclusion categories was 43.5% (κ = 0.25) and 48.5% (κ = 0.32), respectively. Disagreement was most frequent between conclusions of other infiltrate and normal for both the reading panel and the arbitration panel (32% and 30% of discordant CXRs, respectively).

Conclusions.

Agreement was similar to that of previous evaluations using the WHO methodology for detecting consolidation, but poor for other infiltrates despite attempts at a rigorous standardization process.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) thin-section computed tomography (CT) quantification — thin-section CT is the standard method for imaging ILD subtypes, severity of infiltrates, inflammation, injury, or fibrosis and monitoring progression and therapy, and subtle parenchymal changes in subclinical or regional ILD can be quantified from whole-lung attenuation histograms. Architectural distortion and regional heterogeneity in reticular infiltration, ground-glass opacity, or consolidation may be captured using texture-based metrics, and common metrics include the fractional volume of high attenuation and reticular/honeycomb abnormalities.

Clinical manifestations of influenza in children with HIV — symptoms, radiographic patterns, and outcomes are described as follows: Signs and symptoms are similar in children with and without HIV and include fever, cough, and rhinorrhea in most patients, though loss of appetite was more common in patients with HIV in one study. In a prospective South African cohort from 1997 to 1999 before cART, radiographic evidence of alveolar consolidation was more frequent in children with HIV than in those without HIV, while clinical outcomes including duration of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality were similar. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, chest radiography patterns differed by HIV status with interstitial infiltrates more likely in children with HIV and consolidative infiltrates more likely in those without HIV, and children with HIV were also more likely to have leukopenia associated with their influenza diagnosis.

### Impact of viral radiographic features on antibiotic treatment for pediatric pneumonia [^113ykPSB]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Chest radiograph (CXR) is routinely performed among children with suspected pneumonia, though it is not clear how specific radiographic findings impact antibiotic treatment for pneumonia. We evaluated the impact of viral radiographic features on antibiotic treatment among children undergoing pneumonia evaluation in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Children presenting to a pediatric ED who underwent a CXR for pneumonia evaluation were prospectively enrolled. Prior to CXR performance, physicians indicated their level of suspicion for pneumonia. The CXR report was reviewed to assess for the presence of viral features (peribronchial cuffing, perihilar markings, and interstitial infiltrate) as well as radiographic features suggestive of pneumonia (consolidation, infiltrate, and opacity). The relationship between viral radiographic features and antibiotic treatment was assessed based on the level of clinical suspicion for pneumonia prior to CXR.

Results

Patients with normal CXRs (n = 400) and viral features alone (n = 370) were managed similarly, with 8.0% and 8.6% of patients receiving antibiotic treatment, respectively (P = .75). Compared with children with radiographic pneumonia (n = 174), patients with concurrent viral features and radiographic pneumonia (n = 177) were treated with antibiotics less frequently (86.2% vs 54.3%, P < .001). Among children with isolated viral features on CXR, antibiotic treatment rates were correlated with pre-CXR level of suspicion for pneumonia.

Conclusions

Among children with suspected pneumonia, the presence of viral features alone on CXR is not associated with increased rates of antibiotic use. Among children with radiographic pneumonia, the addition of viral features on CXR is associated with lower rates of antibiotic use, as compared to children with radiographic pneumonia alone.

### Study syllabus for classification of radiographs of pneumoconioses… [^1133dbdC]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Syllabus for Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses Clinical Overview Major Occupational Lung Diseases. Granulomatous Diseases Chronic Beryllium Disease Chronic beryllium disease is an immune-mediated granulomatous lung disease resembling sarcoidosis that is caused by exposure to the lightweight metal beryllium. Exposure can occur in a number of industries including aerospace, defense, metal machining, electronics manufacture and recycling, and dental alloy/appliance production. Diagnosis requires a history of beryllium exposure; a positive blood or bronchoalveolar lavage beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test; and noncaseating granulomas and/or mononuclear cell infiltrates on lung biopsy. A patient is considered beryllium sensitized when they have a positive blood BeLPT but no abnormal lung pathology. In early disease, the chest radiograph may be normal or show hilar adenopathy or parenchymal abnormalities.

Parenchymal abnormalities include nodules, ground glass, linear or alveolar opacities. The parenchymal abnormalities may be diffuse or upper lobe predominant. HRCT is more sensitive than chest x-ray in diagnosing CBD, however, HRCT is normal in up to 25% of patients with biopsy-proven CBD. HRCT findings of CBD include parenchymal nodules of varying size, thickened septal lines, ground glass opacities, cystic cavitation, bronchial wall thickening, and hilar/mediastinal adenopathy. The lack of effective treatment, the progressive nature of the disease with on-going exposure, and the severity of fixed obstruction often seen in affected workers underscore the need for early recognition and control of causal exposures. Chest radiographs are generally normal in early disease stages, but may show hyperinflation.

Characteristic findings on HRCT include segmental or lobular areas of hypo-attenuation associated with narrowing of pulmonary vessels, usually accentuated on expiratory images. HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS Page 6 of 6 DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING.

### Chest radiograph findings in childhood pneumonia cases from the multisite PERCH study [^116osNRA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

We identified substantial differences between sites in the distribution of CXR findings (Table 1 and Figure 2). Between 4% and 20% of CXRs from each site were uninterpretable, and although we used a more stringent definition of "uninterpretable for other infiltrate and/or consolidation" compared to the "uninterpretable for consolidation only" definition in most applications of the WHO methodology, high proportions of uninterpretable images highlight the challenges of achieving adequate radiographic images in resource-poor settings. The proportion of PERCH cases with a finding of consolidation (with or without other infiltrate) ranged, by site, from 11% to 37% in HIV-negative cases. Such differences are consistent with findings of consolidation in previous studies of pneumonia. In the Gambian pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial, 17% of hospitalized pneumonia cases in the control arm had consolidation in the presence of Hib vaccine, while in the Bangladesh Hib vaccine case-control study, 26% of all hospitalized pneumonia cases, vaccinated and nonvaccinated combined, had consolidation. The proportion of abnormal CXRs (consolidation or other infiltrate) among HIV-negative cases also varied by site from 35% to 64% (and thus a range of normal CXRs from 36% to 65%), while 88% of HIV-positive cases had an abnormal CXR in both South Africa and Zambia. The commonly held understanding is that etiology, severity, duration of infection, and host immune reaction are major predictors of CXR findings. If this is true, observed differences in the distributions of CXR findings between sites likely reflect determinants of those CXR predictors, such as healthcare-seeking behaviors, availability of antibiotics, and environmental and living conditions. Epidemiologic studies that use CXR case definitions should recognize that differences between studies could reflect not only differences in pneumonia etiology but also variables that alter the timing of care seeking or host response to infection.

### Unilateral radiographic abnormalities after bilateral lung transplantation: exclusion from the definition of primary graft dysfunction? [^112gFCkF]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Unilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray films are occasionally seen after bilateral lung transplantation. In the primary graft dysfunction grading system, the presence or absence of a radiographic abnormality is crucial in determining the incidence and severity of primary graft dysfunction. However, no consideration is given as to whether unilateral infiltrates have the same impact and relevance as bilateral infiltrates. This study aims to describe the incidence, features, and outcomes of posttransplant unilateral infiltrates and their effect on the novel primary graft dysfunction grading system.

Methods

Depending on posttransplant radiographic appearance, 144 patients who underwent bilateral lung transplantation were divided into 3 groups: no infiltrates (clear), unilateral infiltrates (unilateral), or bilateral infiltrates (bilateral).

Results

Radiographic abnormalities were seen in 43% of donors and 61% of posttransplant recipients (sensitivity = 76%, specificity = 50%). The percentage of recipients in the unilateral, clear, and bilateral groups was 26%, 39%, and 35%, respectively. Lower posttransplant oxygenation (P < .05), longer intubation hours, and more intensive care unit days (P < .0001) were seen in the bilateral compared with the unilateral and the clear groups. A significant difference in the prevalence of primary graft dysfunction (P < .0001) was seen, depending on whether unilateral infiltrates were included or excluded from the primary graft dysfunction grading.

Conclusions

The incidence of unilateral infiltrates is relatively high after bilateral lung transplantation. The early posttransplant outcome of the unilateral infiltrates is similar to that in the group having a clear chest x-ray film and significantly better than that in those with bilateral infiltrates. In bilateral lung transplantation, only bilateral infiltrates should be used as part of the definition of primary graft dysfunction.

### Suspected community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting (CAPA): a French prospective observational cohort study in general practice [^116FYnW1]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Contribution of chest radiography and co-morbidity

Our investigators were allowed to pragmatically manage their patients in accordance with the European guidelines in which an X-ray is not systematically included in the management of patients with suspected CAP. However, using an X-ray remains the cornerstone of the diagnosis according to French guidelines, which include an infiltrate on X-ray in the definition of CAP. It is probably the reason why GPs, among whom 89% were medical trainers, used X-rays in most patients (80%) and probably not in selected patients with uncertain diagnosis or progressive disease or at risk for underlying lung pathology.

Dyspnoea, described elsewhere as a predictor of pulmonary infiltrate in patients with lower respiratory tract infection, was less frequently observed in patients with positive radiography than in patients with negative radiography (44 vs. 56%, P = 0.04; Table 2). Similar results were observed for unilateral chest pain and for sputum or phlegm (33 vs. 47%, P < 0.01, and 51 vs. 68%, P < 0.01).

Our inclusion critera could have led GPs to include more patients with dyspnoea, unilateral chest pain and sputum among patients with negative radiography as patients with atypical symptoms (without crackles) had to have a mandatory positive radiography to be included. However, results for sputum are consistent with those of Hopstaken et al. who have identified dry cough as an independent and significant predictor of pulmonary infiltrate. Wheezing, a common symptom of COPD known to interfere with the clinical features of pneumonia, was also less frequently observed in patients with positive radiography (17 vs. 30%, P < 0.01). Similarly, there were fewer patients older than 65 years and with chronic respiratory disease among those with positive radiography than among those with negative radiography (respectively, 27 vs. 36%, P = 0.02, and 10 vs. 15%, P < 0.01). However, there were close but low proportions of patients without 'vital signs' of the Gennis' scoreamong those with either positive or negative radiography or without X-rays (Table 2). These results suggest that X-rays have limited value in ruling out pneumonia, especially in patients with chronic respiratory disease and in elderly patients.

Annual Rate of Decline in FVC

A statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of decline of FVC (in mL) was demonstrated in patients receiving OFEV compared to patients receiving placebo based on the random coefficient regression model, adjusted for gender, height, and age. The treatment effect on FVC was consistent in all 3 studies. See Table 3 for individual study results.

Figure 1 displays the change from baseline over time in both treatment groups for Study 2. When the mean observed FVC change from baseline was plotted over time, the curves diverged at all timepoints through Week 52. Similar plots were seen for Study 1 and Study 3.

Figure 2 presents the cumulative distribution for all cut-offs for the change from baseline in FVC percent predicted at Week 52 for Study 2. For all categorical declines in lung function, the proportion of patients declining was lower on OFEV than on placebo. Study 3 showed similar results.

Time to First Acute IPF Exacerbation

Acute IPF exacerbation was defined as unexplained worsening or development of dyspnea within 30 days, new diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, and/or new high-resolution CT parenchymal abnormalities with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion, and exclusion of alternative causes. Acute IPF exacerbation was adjudicated in Study 2 and Study 3. In Study 1 (investigator-reported) and Study 3 (adjudicated), the risk of first acute IPF exacerbation over 52 weeks was significantly reduced in patients receiving OFEV compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.71) and (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.56), respectively. In Study 2 (adjudicated), there was no difference between the treatment groups (HR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.20, 1.54).

### Training physicians in India to interpret pediatric chest radiographs according to World Health Organization research methodology [^112b6EeT]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to reporting training effectiveness on endpoint consolidation, silhouette sign, pleural effusion and other infiltrate, we also stratified the performances by pediatrician and radiologist cadres. The WHO Chest Radiography in Epidemiological Studies group refined the original WHO definitions to increase the objectiveness of the endpoint consolidation and the silhouette sign features by adding measurable size dimensions. Our results show that after training, the performances of pediatricians and radiologists were no different in the classification of primary endpoint pneumonia. In addition, our analyses indicate that the training taught participants to effectively apply the refined endpoint consolidation and silhouette sign definitions. Specifically, both pediatricians and radiologists improved their application of the endpoint consolidation criteria, and pediatricians — more than radiologists — improved classifying images for silhouette sign. While classification of pleural effusion improved among radiologists, performance was high at baseline. On the other hand, the training did not change the overall low performance of participants, regardless of cadre, of classifying other infiltrate. In sum, these results show that not only can the revised WHO Chest Radiography in Epidemiological Studies endpoint consolidation and silhouette sign criteria be successfully applied, but that with sufficient training, pediatricians who are unlikely to interpret chest radiographs as frequently as radiologists can learn to apply these methods as effectively as radiologists. We believe that these refined, more objective definitions for endpoint consolidation and silhouette sign will be key for improving the validity and reproducibility of research applying this methodology. These results support more objective measurement criteria for these features. Depending upon availability, future panels may be as effective when composed of non-radiologists. Future trainings may decide to place more emphasis on different radiographic features depending on the composition of their participants.

### Comparative study of patients with and without SARS who fulfilled the WHO SARS case definition [^115qYJMX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To differentiate severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from non-SARS illness, we retrospectively compared 53 patients with probable SARS and 31 patients with non-SARS who were admitted to Mackay Memorial Hospital from April 27 to June 16, 2003. Fever (> 38 degrees C) was the earliest symptom (50/53 SARS vs. 5/31 non-SARS, p < 0.0001), preceding cough by a mean of 4.5 days. The initial chest X-ray study was normal in 22/53 SARS cases versus 5/31 non-SARS cases. SARS patients with an initially normal chest X-ray study developed infiltrates at a mean of 5 ± 3.44 days after onset of fever (21/22 SARS vs. 0/5 non-SARS). Rapid radiographic progression of unifocal involvement to multifocal infiltrates was seen in 22 of 24 SARS vs. 0 of 26 non-SARS patients (p < 0.0001). Pleural effusion was not present in any SARS patients but was seen in 6 of 26 non-SARS cases (p < 0.0001). Initial lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were all more common in SARS than non-SARS (p < 0.0001). They may help differentiate SARS from non-SARS if a reliable and rapid diagnostic test is not available.

### Early chest computed tomography scan to assist diagnosis and guide treatment decision for suspected community-acquired pneumonia [^113ixUEo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale

Clinical decision making relative to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnosis is difficult. Chest radiograph is key in establishing parenchymal lung involvement. However, radiologic performance may lead to misdiagnosis, rendering questionable the use of chest computed tomography (CT) scan in patients with clinically suspected CAP.

Objectives

To assess whether early multidetector chest CT scan affects diagnosis and management of patients visiting the emergency department with suspected CAP.

Methods

A total of 319 prospectively enrolled patients with clinically suspected CAP underwent multidetector chest CT scan within 4 hours. CAP diagnosis probability (definite, probable, possible, or excluded) and therapeutic plans (antibiotic initiation/discontinuation, hospitalization/discharge) were established by emergency physicians before and after CT scan results. The adjudication committee established the final CAP classification on Day 28.

Measurements and Main Results

Chest radiograph revealed a parenchymal infiltrate in 188 patients. CAP was initially classified as definite in 143 patients (44.8%), probable or possible in 172 (53.8%), and excluded in 4 (1.2%). CT scan revealed a parenchymal infiltrate in 40 (33%) of the patients without infiltrate on chest radiograph and excluded CAP in 56 (29.8%) of the 188 with parenchymal infiltrate on radiograph. CT scan modified classification in 187 (58.6%; 95% confidence interval, 53.2–64.0), leading to 50.8% definite CAP and 28.8% excluded CAP, and 80% of modifications were in accordance with adjudication committee classification. Because of CT scan, antibiotics were initiated in 51 (16%) and discontinued in 29 (9%), and hospitalization was decided in 22 and discharge in 23.

Conclusions

In CAP-suspected patients visiting the emergency unit, early CT scan findings complementary to chest radiograph markedly affect both diagnosis and clinical management. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01574066).

### ARDS: hidden perils of an overburdened diagnosis [^116poFmN]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

I recently pointed out that a fetish fixation on the Berlin definition of ARDS may have contributed to patient mortality at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some members of the Berlin Task Force took umbrage at this inference. The Task Force, however, could not have foreseen how their definition was to be employed during a subsequent pandemic. The WHO guidelines on COVID-19 made a clear link between the diagnosis of ARDS (their citation #17 specifies the Berlin definition) and encouraging early endotracheal intubation, which was subsequently shown to contribute to increased Covid mortality. WHO stated explicitly that "Hypoxemic respiratory failure in ARDS… usually requires mechanical ventilation" (context conveyed the invasive form). This is not true. Many patients with ARDS are sustained with noninvasive ventilation or supplemental oxygen. A PubMed search will reveal numerous authors forging links between making a diagnosis of ARDS in Covid patients and early intubation; see, for example, the report by Ziehr et al. (their citation #7 specifies the Berlin definition), upon which Yaroshetskiy et al. subsequently commented.

The definition put forward by Ashbaugh and colleagues consisted of simple qualitative descriptors (severe dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxemia, decreased lung compliance, alveolar infiltrates). Authors of subsequent definitions have acted as if they subscribed to Lord Kelvin's dictum on numerical precision. 1 In reality, it is the numerical encasing of the three pillars (of the Berlin definition) that render them very rickety (Fig. 1). The criteria for radiographic infiltrates achieve dismal interrater agreement, with a kappa score of 0.296.

The Berlin criteria for the definition of ARDS consist of three pillars, each of which is flimsy. Chest X-ray (CXR) infiltrates have a kappa interrater agreement score of 0.296.

We assessed the relationship between CXR findings and mortality (Figure 1 and Table 3). Those who died and had an interpretable CXR were twice as likely to have findings of consolidation (50% vs 24%) and less likely to have other infiltrates only (18% vs 28%) compared to those who survived. Of 3208 cases with an interpretable CXR and documented 30-day survival status, 837 (26%) had a CXR finding of any consolidation of which 113 died (case fatality ratio [CFR], 13.5%) compared to 874 cases with other infiltrate only among whom there were 41 deaths (CFR, 4.7%) and 1497 cases that were CXR-normal among whom there were 73 deaths (CFR, 4.9%; Table 3). These trends were similar when stratified by age (< 12 months and ≥ 12 months; data not shown).

### Does this patient have ventilator-associated pneumonia? [^111rAtYN]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common and serious nosocomial infection. Accurate, timely diagnosis enables affected patients to receive appropriate therapy and avoids mistreatment of patients having other conditions.

Objective

To review the published medical literature describing the precision and accuracy of clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data to diagnose bacterial VAP relative to a histological gold standard.

Data Sources

English-language articles identified by a structured search strategy using MEDLINE (January 1966-October 31, 2006) and Google Scholar. Additional articles were identified through the reference lists of studies and review papers identified by the search strategy.

Study Selection

Included studies described clinical findings associated with VAP in 25 or more patients receiving mechanical ventilation who subsequently underwent pulmonary biopsy or autopsy. Fourteen studies describing clinical findings in 655 patients met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted onto a structured form, allowing calculation of the likelihood ratios (LRs) for each sign or combination of findings.

Data Synthesis

The presence or absence of fever, abnormal white blood cell count, or purulent pulmonary secretions do not substantively alter the probability of VAP. However, the combination of a new radiographic infiltrate with at least 2 of fever, leukocytosis, or purulent sputum increases the likelihood of VAP (summary LR, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.97–7.9). The absence of a new infiltrate on a plain chest radiograph lowers the likelihood of VAP (summary LR, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.87). Fewer than 50% neutrophils on cell count analysis of lower pulmonary secretions makes VAP unlikely (LR range, 0.05–0.10).

Conclusions

Routine bedside evaluation coupled with radiographic information provides suggestive but not definitive evidence that VAP is present or absent. Given the severity of VAP and the frequency of serious conditions that can mimic VAP, clinicians should be ready to consider additional tests that provide further evidence for VAP or that establish another diagnosis.

### Preliminary report from the world health organisation chest radiography in epidemiological studies project [^117SeqbL]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

World Health Organization standardized chest radiograph interpretation

It is recognized that the chest radiograph has a number of limitations compared to imaging modalities like ultrasound (US) and computerized tomography (CT) of the chest in the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia. However, the chest radiograph remains the most readily available and most common imaging modality to assess childhood pneumonia. Due to the limited number of radiologists in low-income countries, clinicians often interpret chest radiographs. In 1997, the World Health Organization Radiology Working Group was established to provide a consensus method to standardize definitions for the interpretation of pediatric frontal chest radiographs only, for use in bacterial vaccine efficacy trials in children. The working group definition was optimized for use as an endpoint in bacterial Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines vaccine trials (the so-called "primary endpoint" pneumonia definition), and for determining this spectrum of disease burden from epidemiological studies. The definitions were not designed for use in individual patient clinical management because of their emphasis on specificity at the expense of sensitivity.

In bacterial vaccine trials, specificity for measurement of vaccine efficacy is emphasized, with the aim to establish whether the vaccine has activity to prevent pneumococcal or Haemophilus influenzae type b pneumonia. If the endpoint lacks specificity, the number of false-positives increases, which reduces the power and precision of the bacterial vaccine trial. Therefore, the World Health Organization standardized chest radiograph definition of primary endpoint pneumonia, which is used as the endpoint in bacterial vaccine trials, compromises on sensitivity, recognizing that certain cases will be missed, but that this does not greatly affect the precision of the vaccine efficacy outcome. The World Health Organization standardized definition of other infiltrates is not used as an endpoint in bacterial vaccine trials.

These World Health Organization standardized definitions and endpoint conclusions were published in 2001, and an analysis of observer variation for these conclusions using a reference library of chest radiographs was published in 2005. The reference chest radiograph library subsequently became a training tool for researchers choosing to use this methodology. During this period, the World Health Organization provided technical support to countries and studies including a centralized arbitration process to resolve discordant interpretations and technical support for sites on chest radiograph methods and equipment.

### Pulmonary complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: diagnostic approaches [^116deZor]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary complications are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Pulmonary infiltrates in such patients pose a major challenge for clinicians because of the wide differential diagnosis of infectious and noninfectious conditions. It is rare for the diagnosis to be made by chest radiograph, and commonly these patients will need further invasive and noninvasive studies to confirm the etiology of the pulmonary infiltrates. This review describes the role of the different diagnostic tools available to reach a diagnosis in a timely manner in this patient population.

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^113p3gVT]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA

An ideal reference diagnosis for pneumonia should be based upon the detection of pathogenic agents in lung parenchyma, along with suggestive clinical findings. However, this cannot be carried out in routine clinical practice for evident practical reasons. Hence, pneumonia is usually suspected in the presence of respiratory and infectious signs and symptoms, and confirmed by the demonstration of a new lung infiltrate on a radiologic examination. Unfortunately, signs and symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific, leading to a poor predictive value of clinical data for the diagnosis of chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT)-proven pneumonia.

The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia is even more difficult in elderly patients, because symptoms are less specific, and decompensated comorbidities (e.g. heart failure and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) can further blur the clinical picture. The prevalence of most symptoms, including fever and shivers, is reduced with increasing age. Elderly patients tend to report symptoms less accurately because of memory disorders or delirium. Finally, the incidence of alternative diagnoses to pneumonia (e.g. pulmonary embolism, lung cancer, nonrespiratory sepsis and so on), and the prevalence of chronic respiratory conditions (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease) is also increased in elderly patients (Figs. 1–4).

### Impact of clinical history on chest radiograph interpretation [^11784USS]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The inclusion of clinical information may have unrecognized influence in the interpretation of diagnostic testing.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine the impact of clinical history on chest radiograph interpretation in the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Design

Prospective case-based study.

Methods

Radiologists interpreted 110 radiographs of children evaluated for suspicion of pneumonia. Clinical information was withheld during the first interpretation. After 6 months the radiographs were reviewed with clinical information. Radiologists reported on pneumonia indicators described by the World Health Organization (ie, any infiltrate, alveolar infiltrate, interstitial infiltrate, air bronchograms, hilar adenopathy, pleural effusion).

Setting

Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Boston Children's Hospital.

Participants

Six board-certified radiologists.

Outcome Measures

Inter- and inter-rater reliability were assessed using the kappa statistic.

Results

The addition of clinical history did not have a substantial impact on the inter-rater reliability in the identification of any infiltrate, alveolar infiltrate, interstitial infiltrate, pleural effusion, or hilar adenopathy. Inter-rater reliability in the identification of air bronchograms improved from fair (k = 0.32) to moderate (k = 0.53). Intra-rater reliability for the identification of alveolar infiltrate remained substantial to almost perfect for all 6 raters with and without clinical information. One rater had a decrease in inter-rater reliability from almost perfect (k = 1.0) to fair (k = 0.21) in the identification of interstitial infiltrate with the addition of clinical history.

Conclusions

Alveolar infiltrate and pleural effusion are findings with high intra- and inter-rater reliability in the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. The addition of clinical information did not have a substantial impact on the reliability of these findings.

### TB 101–4. chest X-ray… [^112dWfRE]. CDC (1999). Low credibility.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1600 Clifton Rd. Atlanta, GA 30329, USA 800-INFO TTY: 232–6348 The fourth component of a complete TB medical evaluation is a chest x-ray. A patient should have a chest x-ray if he or she has a positive blood test or skin test, or has signs and symptoms of TB disease, or been exposed to someone with TB disease. The chest x-ray is useful for diagnosing TB disease because TB disease in the lungs, also known as pulmonary TB, is the most common form of TB disease. For adults without HIV infection, the chest x-ray will usually appear abnormal when a patient has TB disease in the lungs. It may show infiltrates or cavities. In persons with HIV infection and in children, the chest x-ray of someone with pulmonary TB can look normal or have very subtle changes. Consultation with an experienced TB clinician is recommended. Chest x-ray results alone cannot confirm that a person has TB disease.

A variety of illnesses may produce abnormalities whose appearance on a chest x-ray resembles TB. Although an abnormality on a chest x-ray may lead a clinician to suspect TB, further tests are needed to confirm that a person has TB disease.

Conclusion

Despite the remarkable advances in understanding this radiological entity, several issues are still debated. Undoubtedly, the Position Paper recently released by the Fleischner Society has addressed some of the open questions, giving a major contribution on definition and terminology, easing the important task of reporting these often subtle interstitial abnormalities. Future studies on general population, however, are fostered to investigate ILAs risk factors, whereas a multidisciplinary approach seems to be the right answer to the optimal management.

Time to First Acute ILD Exacerbation

Acute ILD exacerbation was defined as unexplained worsening or development of dyspnea within 30 days, new diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, and/or new HRCT parenchymal abnormalities with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion, and exclusion of alternative causes. Acute ILD exacerbations were not adjudicated.

The risk of first acute ILD exacerbation did not show a statistically significant difference between the OFEV group compared to placebo (52 week treatment period: HR 0.72, (95% CI: 0.38, 1.37); whole trial: HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.07)).

Survival

Survival was evaluated for OFEV compared to placebo in Study 5 to support the primary endpoint (FVC). All-cause mortality was assessed over the study duration and available follow-up period, irrespective of cause of death and whether patients continued treatment. All-cause mortality did not show a statistically significant difference (52 week treatment period: HR 0.94 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.86); whole trial: HR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.21)).

### Potential refinements of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation primary graft dysfunction grading system [^111fyznQ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation and The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Working Group on PGD has recently reported standardized consensus criteria, based on the recipient arterial blood-gas analysis and chest X-ray findings, to define PGD and determine its severity (grade range, 0–3). The grading system has been shown to predict post-transplant outcomes; however, further evaluation and refinement of the validity of the grading system is an important next step to enhance its utility. In this review, we describe advantage and disadvantages of the current PGD grading system based on series of analyses we have conducted and possible options for its potential refinement. The suggested revisions are (1) additional assessment time points at 6 and 12 hours should be included, (2) only bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray (not unilateral infiltrates) should be considered as an infiltrate in bilateral lung transplants, (3) information from the chest X-ray is useful within 6 hours of final lung reperfusion (T0) but is not necessary to classify grade 3 at 12 to 72 hours, (4) apply PGD grade to single and bilateral lung transplant separately, (5) all extubated patients should be considered as grade 0 to 1, (6) note if PGD grade is being defined by specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, including extubation, with clear chest X-ray, on nitric oxide or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Although, further evaluations of the PGD definition and grading system are needed, the suggested refinements in this review may further enhance the reliability and validity of the PGD grading system as an important new lung transplant study instrument.

### Computer-aided diagnosis in chest radiography: beyond nodules [^111cf6Ab]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Chest radiographs are the most common exam in radiology. They are essential for the management of various diseases associated with high mortality and morbidity and display a wide range of findings, many of them subtle. In this survey we identify a number of areas beyond pulmonary nodules that could benefit from computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) in chest radiography. These include interstitial infiltrates, catheter tip detection, size measurements, detection of pneumothorax and detection and quantification of emphysema. Recent work in these areas is surveyed, but we conclude that the amount of research devoted to these topics is modest. Reasons for the slow pace of CAD development in chest radiography beyond nodules are discussed.

### Assessment of mass classification from chest X-ray using double-transfer learning: a comparative study with diverse image selection for single-transfer learning [^111tj39p]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of double-transfer learning (double-TL) in enhancing the artificial intelligence (AI) model performance of mass image classification of chest X-Ray images.

Materials and Methods

Chest X-ray images of various diseases (infiltration, atelectasis, effusion, and nodule) were selected for the single-TL phase in double-TL process. Then four AI models (Infiltration-Mass, Atelectasis-Mass, Effusion-Mass, and Nodule-Mass) were trained using double-TL. For comparison, an AI model of Mass was trained using single-TL.

Results

The area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.795, 0.785, 0.785, and 0.783 for the Effusion-Mass, Infiltration-Mass, Atelectasis-Mass, and Nodule-Mass models, respectively, while the Mass model showed an AUC of 0.788. The Nodule-Mass model achieved the highest recall for disease (0.75) and precision for healthy (0.86). Overall, the double-TL models showed comparable or slightly improved performance over the Mass model.

Conclusion

Although double-TL showed marginal improvements in some models, such as higher sensitivity in the Nodule-Mass model, overall performance gains were limited. These findings highlight that double-TL may benefit specific tasks but did not consistently outperform single-TL. The performance of double-TL is highly contingent upon both the size and feature similarity of the selected images, indicating that appropriate image selection is crucial for maximising the efficacy of double-TL in healthcare applications.

Domain 1: ARDS definition

ARDS was first described in 1967 by Ashbaugh and colleagues in 12 patients with new onset hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and reduced respiratory system compliance. Inflammation, edema, and hyaline membranes were uniformly present in lungs of non-survivors. Subsequently, diagnosis of ARDS evolved from informal pattern recognition to formalized clinical definitions. The Lung Injury Score, proposed in 1988 was supplanted in 1994 by the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition, and further updated by an ESICM-sponsored process leading to the 2012 'Berlin Definition'. As part of these 2023 ESICM ARDS Treatment Guidelines, experts from the Definition Domain were charged with highlighting issues that should be addressed in subsequent revisions, based on knowledge accrued in the last decade which may be relevant to the current ARDS definition.

### Mimics in chest disease: interstitial opacities [^114ZRZAS]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Evaluation of interstitial lung diseases on HRCT is based on an HRCT-pattern approach to diagnosis, where there should be effort to assign the predominant HRCT pattern to each case. There are various mimics in each HRCT pattern and one entity may have many faces and therefore may mimic many patterns. There may also be possible overlap of HRCT patterns in one case. Moreover, we should keep in mind that no HRCT pattern provides a specific etiological diagnosis. In order to reach a correct and confident diagnosis, one should approach the predominant HRCT pattern by identifying any specific and distinctive imaging clues and try to narrow the differential diagnosis by integrating the HRCT findings with the clinical and laboratory findings.

A bedside diagnostic approach is needed for mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care who develop new pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray and have a differential diagnosis of pneumonia. These patients are regularly given broad-spectrum antibiotics before bacteria culture results are ready, which contributes to overtreatment and antibiotic resistance. In addition, commonly used sampling methods like bronchoalveolar lavage have low specificity and sensitivity. A new technique aims to visualize gram-negative bacteria in real time in the distal lung, along with other features of infection such as infiltrating inflammatory cells. Abbasi J.

### Early pneumonia and timing of antibiotic therapy in patients after nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^115GfPxJ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study has three main findings: 1) early pneumonia occurs frequently in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after OHCA, but is difficult to predict; 2) early pneumonia after OHCA may increase the rate of tracheotomy and extend the length of the ICU and hospital stay; and 3) a delayed initiation of antibiotic therapy after OHCA may increase the length of the ICU and hospital stay.

Incidence of early pneumonia

We found an incidence of 22.4% for confirmed pneumonia and 57.5% for confirmed or probable pneumonia within 7 days after hospital admission. In the literature, early pneumonia is reported to occur in 27.5–65% of patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after OHCA. The large heterogeneity across different studies might be caused by differences regarding the definition of early pneumonia. Moreover, diagnosis of pneumonia is challenging, since common criteria such as body temperature and leukocytosis may be affected by hypothermia and can therefore not be employed. Another challenging fact regarding the definition of pneumonia is that interobserver agreement in the interpretation of chest radiographs for pneumonia is reported to be moderate, indicating that confirmation of infiltrates may not always be definite. This limitation may be even worse in the setting of bedside radiography on the ICU. Therefore, in our study, only patients with a chest X-ray scan categorized "infiltrates definitely present" (as rated by an experienced radiologist) could have confirmed pneumonia. This may explain why only relatively few patients had confirmed pneumonia in our study, if compared with previous reports where no information considering the reliability of infiltrate detection on chest radiographies were given.

### Identifying clinical and research priorities in sickle cell lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^114a9MeV]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) definition and research priorities — ACS is a clinical syndrome consisting of chest pain, fever, tachypnea, wheezing, rales, or cough plus a new infiltrative finding at least one lung segment and is a leading acute cause of mortality in this population. Diagnosis relies on radiographic abnormalities that may precede or lag behind symptoms, and radiography may be unavailable in low-resource settings. Incentive spirometry during vaso-occlusive crisis decreases ACS risk, but additional preventive approaches are necessary. Priority areas for research include ACS severity and subtypes, primary and secondary prevention, and management in low-resource settings.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^116mGrfY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging modalities

Radiographic findings in pneumonia generally fall into three categories: 1) focal non-segmental or lobar pneumonia, 2) multifocal bronchopneumonia, and 3) focal or diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In patients who clinically improve, ATS/IDSA guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up chest imaging. However, in cases where clinical presentation is atypical despite radiographic evidence of pneumonia, repeat CXR is advised to rule out alternative diagnoses. Besides, repeat CXR can show progression of disease, but more importantly may reveal fluid collections (rarely abscess, more commonly pleural effusions) which could represent lack of source control (Fig. 2), like empyema requiring drainage. Radiographic resolution can lag days to weeks beyond clinical improvement. In patients under 50 and those with mild-to-moderate pneumonia, radiographic infiltrates typically resolve within four weeks. Conversely, resolution may take up to 10 weeks in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities and COPD, or severe pneumonia. Slow radiographic resolution alone is not an indicator of treatment failure.

Point-of-care LUS can also be beneficial as it is more sensitive than CXR for identifying pleural effusions and can identify fluid characteristics that suggest the presence of an empyema. While LUS avoids the cost and radiation of CT, it requires technical expertise and is less effective for assessing pathology deep to the lung pleura.

For non-resolving pneumonia or clinical deterioration, repeat imaging — especially chest CT scan — is strongly recommended. CT can help confirm or refute the diagnosis of pneumonia and identify alternative or concurrent conditions that may explain patients' delayed response rates, like pulmonary edema, embolism, pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or malignancy. High resolution chest CT reviewed by chest radiologists can be particularly helpful in differentiating infectious from non-infectious pathology. CT also offers better delineation of radiographic patterns (e.g. lobar, interstitial, nodular) and can identify complications such as cavitation, abscess, empyema, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, guiding further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions (Fig. 2).

### Feasibility, reproducibility, and clinical validity of a quantitative chest X-ray assessment for COVID-19 [^114L9nN4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

Chest X-ray (CXR) is an essential first-line tool in COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis and management. Our study aimed at assessing 1) CXR manifestations, frequency, and distribution; 2) the feasibility and repeatability of a CXR severity score; and 3) the correlation between the CXR severity score and clinical and laboratory parameters. We reviewed baseline CXRs and clinical data of consecutive patients who presented to our emergency department and resulted positive at SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase–PCR oropharyngeal swab test from March 1, 2020 to April 6, 2020. Lung abnormalities and their distribution were analyzed. A score of CXR severity was assigned by two radiologists, independently, according to the extent of lung involvement, with a maximum score of 8 for CXR. Correlations between the CXR score and the clinical data were assessed. One hundred fifty-five patients were included; 143/155 (92%) were positive at baseline CXR. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (141/143, 99%). Involvement was mainly bilateral (96/143, 67%), with peripheral distribution (79/143, 55%). The mean CXR severity score was 3.3 (± 2); interobserver agreement was excellent, with a Cohen's K correlation coefficient of 0.901. The CXR score showed a significant positive correlation with C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and fever duration, and a negative correlation with oxygen saturation. Chest X-ray findings are in line with those reported by computed tomography studies. The use of a visual CXR score, easy to assess and highly reproducible, can reflect the clinical severity and help the patients' management.

### CT andF-FDG PET abnormalities in contacts with recent tuberculosis infections but negative chest X-ray [^112fy2nS]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Close contacts of individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis are at risk for tuberculosis infection and the development of active tuberculosis. In current contact investigations, immunologic tests (the tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assay) and chest X-ray examinations are used to dichotomize contacts with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections into those with active (X-ray abnormalities) versus latent tuberculosis (normal radiographs). This article is a critical review of computed tomographic (CT) and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic (PET) findings of incipient tuberculosis without X-ray abnormalities based on a systematic literature review of twenty-five publications. The CT and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET studies revealed minimal pauci-nodular infiltrations in the lung parenchyma and mediastinal lymph nodes abnormalities with metabolic uptake in approximately one-third of asymptomatic close contacts with negative chest radiographic and bacteriological/molecular results for active tuberculosis. Tuberculosis with minimal changes challenge the validity of simply dichotomizing cases of recent M. tuberculosis infections in contacts depending on the presence of X-ray abnormalities as the recent infections may spontaneously regress, remain stagnant, or progress to active tuberculosis in human and nonhuman primate studies. Whether contacts with tuberculosis with minimal changes are interpreted as having active tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis has clinical implications in terms of specific benefits and harms under the current contact management. Advanced imaging tools may help further stratify contacts intensely exposed to M. tuberculosis on a continuous spectrum from latent tuberculosis to incipient, subclinical and active tuberculosis. Identifying incipient tuberculosis would provide an opportunity for earlier and tailored treatment before active tuberculosis is established.

### Does training improve diagnostic accuracy and inter-rater agreement in applying the Berlin radiographic definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome? A multicenter prospective study [^115rbopW]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) published in 1994 has been widely adopted. However, limitations of this definition have been recognized, such as poor inter-observer reliability in identifying bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema via chest X-rays. The updated Berlin definition modified the previous radiographic criterion to require not only bilateral infiltrates but also the exclusion of effusion, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules. It is unclear whether the modification has improved the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation. Recently, Bellan and colleagues reported in an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study that intensivists could only recognize 34.0% of ARDS at the time of fulfillment of ARDS criteria. Although the exact reasons for the high number of under-recognized cases of ARDS might be multifactorial, the inappropriate interpretation of chest X-rays should be a cause for concern.

In order to enhance inter-rater reliability, the ARDS Definition Task Force ("the panel") has developed a set of chest radiographs judged to be consistent, inconsistent, or equivocal for the diagnosis of ARDS. The question of whether these chest radiographs could improve the accuracy of ARDS diagnoses has not been resolved.

Therefore, we performed a prospective study to examine the effect of the training material developed by the panel on the accuracy and consistency of chest radiograph interpretation by intensivists for diagnosing ARDS in accordance with the Berlin definition.

### Pulmonary infiltrates in the non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patient: etiologies, diagnostic strategies, and outcomes [^1159JQG8]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary complications remain a major cause of both morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. When such individuals present with radiographic infiltrates, the clinician faces a diagnostic challenge. The differential diagnosis in this setting is broad and includes both infectious and noninfectious processes. Rarely are the radiographic findings classic for one disease, and most potential etiologies have overlapping clinical and radiographic appearances. In recent years, several themes have emerged in the literature on this topic. First, an aggressive approach to identifying a specific etiology is necessary; as a corollary, diagnostic delay increases the risk for mortality. Second, the evaluation of these infiltrates nearly always entails bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy allows identification of some etiologies with certainty, and often allows for the exclusion of infectious agents even if the procedure is otherwise unrevealing. Third, early use of CT scanning regularly demonstrates lesions missed by plain radiography. Despite these advances, initial therapeutic interventions include the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and other anti-infectives in order to ensure that the patients is receiving appropriate therapy. With the results of invasive testing, these treatments are then narrowed. Frustratingly, outcomes for immunocompromised patients with infiltrates remain poor.

### Chest radiograph findings in childhood pneumonia cases from the multisite PERCH study [^111hjBEG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background.

Chest radiographs (CXRs) are frequently used to assess pneumonia cases. Variations in CXR appearances between epidemiological settings and their correlation with clinical signs are not well documented.

Methods.

The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health project enrolled 4232 cases of hospitalized World Health Organization (WHO)-defined severe and very severe pneumonia from 9 sites in 7 countries (Bangladesh, the Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia). At admission, each case underwent a standardized assessment of clinical signs and pneumonia risk factors by trained health personnel, and a CXR was taken that was interpreted using the standardized WHO methodology. CXRs were categorized as abnormal (consolidation and/or other infiltrate), normal, or uninterpretable.

Results.

CXRs were interpretable in 3587 (85%) cases, of which 1935 (54%) were abnormal (site range, 35%-64%). Cases with abnormal CXRs were more likely than those with normal CXRs to have hypoxemia (45% vs 26%), crackles (69% vs 62%), tachypnea (85% vs 80%), or fever (20% vs 16%) and less likely to have wheeze (30% vs 38%; all P < .05). CXR consolidation was associated with a higher case fatality ratio at 30-day follow-up (13.5%) compared to other infiltrate (4.7%) or normal (4.9%) CXRs.

Conclusions.

Clinically diagnosed pneumonia cases with abnormal CXRs were more likely to have signs typically associated with pneumonia. However, CXR-normal cases were common, and clinical signs considered indicative of pneumonia were present in substantial proportions of these cases. CXR-consolidation cases represent a group with an increased likelihood of death at 30 days post-discharge.

### Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in adults. An official ATS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^114fEFMT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Chest HRCT scan features of the nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) pattern — The "typical HP" pattern is suggestive of HP and requires at least one parenchymal infiltration abnormality and at least one small airway disease abnormality in a diffuse distribution; parenchymal infiltration findings are ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and mosaic attenuation, small airway disease findings are ill-defined centrilobular nodules and air trapping, and distribution is diffuse craniocaudally (with or without some basal sparing) and axially. "Compatible-with-HP" patterns are nonspecific patterns described in HP; parenchymal abnormalities include uniform and subtle GGOs, airspace consolidation, and lung cysts with diffuse distribution craniocaudally (variant: lower lobe predominance) and axially (variant: peribronchovascular). Mosaic attenuation corresponding to parenchymal infiltration is created by GGOs adjacent to normal-appearing lung. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and HP abbreviations follow table definitions.

### Imaging of pneumonia: trends and algorithms [^113jAnfD]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the major infectious diseases responsible for significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Imaging plays a crucial role in the detection and management of patients with pneumonia. This review article discusses the different imaging methods used in the diagnosis and management of suspected pulmonary infections. The imaging examination should always begin with conventional radiography. When the results of routine radiography are inconclusive, computed tomography is mandatory. A combination of pattern recognition with knowledge of the clinical setting is the best approach to the pulmonary infectious processes. A specific pattern of involvement can suggest a likely diagnosis in many instances. In acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients, diffuse ground-glass and interstitial infiltrates are most commonly present in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia whereas in the nonimmunosuppressed patients, a segmental lobar infiltrate is suggestive of a bacterial pneumonia. Round pneumonia is most often encountered in children than adults and is most often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Different combinations of parenchymal and pleural abnormalities may be suggestive for additional diagnoses. When an infectious pulmonary process is suspected, knowledge of the varied radiographic manifestations will narrow the differential diagnosis, helping to direct additional diagnostic measures, and serving as an ideal tool for follow-up examinations.

### Chest radiograph findings in childhood pneumonia cases from the multisite PERCH study [^116LYmSu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Age has an important interaction with CXR results and severity, as expected (Supplemental Table 1). Danger signs, which are not specific for respiratory disease, were more indicative of an abnormal CXR in younger children; we observed that among very severe cases, the youngest children (aged 1–5 months) were more likely to have an abnormal CXR than older children. However, more specific pneumonia findings (such as lower chest wall indrawing) are less associated with pneumonia in younger children because the physiologic compliance of the lower chest makes this finding more common in a variety of illnesses. Thus, among severe cases, we observed that an abnormal CXR was less likely among the youngest children compared to those in other age groups. These findings suggest that danger signs may not be useful criteria for diagnosing pneumonia in children aged > 6 months, particularly in pneumonia studies where a low proportion of false positives is important. However, danger signs remain useful for bacterial treatment algorithms, since they will identify nonpneumonia cases that nevertheless require treatment.

We observed significant differences in case fatality ratios among HIV-negative cases depending on their CXR findings; those with consolidation on CXR were at significantly higher risk of death than those with a normal CXR or with other infiltrates only. The presence of other infiltrates did not alter the risk of death compared to a normal CXR appearance in children with severe or very severe pneumonia. This likely reflects the association between consolidation and bacterial pneumonia and the tendency for bacterial pneumonia to be more severe than viral pneumonia. An association between a CXR finding of "dense infiltrates" and mortality has also been documented in the Philippines; in Fiji, CXR consolidation had a case fatality ratio of 6.8% using the WHO methodology. Our findings are limited in that 100 cases who died were missing a CXR, the majority (92%) because death occurred before this could be obtained. If the distribution of CXR findings in these cases differed from the other cases who died, the difference in case fatality ratios may either be underestimated or overestimated. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that in order to further reduce the mortality burden of pneumonia, a focus on groups with a high prevalence of consolidation should be a priority.

### Utility of chest CT after a chest X-ray in patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic thoracic emergencies [^1159HDgR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chest radiography is the initial choice for thoracic imaging. However, the wide availability of computed tomography (CT) has led to a substantial increase in its use in the emergency department (ED). We evaluated the utility of chest CT after a chest X-ray in patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic thoracic emergencies, and determined if the diagnosis and management decision changed after CT.

Methods

The study enrolled 500 consecutive patients with both chest X-rays and CT who presented to the ED with non-traumatic complaints. Chest X-rays and CT images obtained within 12h before any definitive treatment were randomly evaluated in consensus by two radiologists blinded to the clinical information.

Results

The chest X-ray and CT image findings were concordant in 49.2% of the 500 patients and this concordance was negatively correlated with patient age. Leading diagnosis and management decisions based on the chest radiograph changed after CT in 35.4% of the study group and this finding was also correlated with age. In 55% of 205 patients, pneumonic infiltrations were undiagnosed with radiography. Pulmonary edema was the most specific (93.3%) and sensitive (85.4%) radiography finding. Posteroanterior chest radiographs taken in the upright position had higher concordance with CT than anteroposterior (AP) radiographs taken in the supine position.

Conclusions

Chest CT may be an appropriate imaging choice in patients presenting to the ED for non-traumatic reasons, particularly for elderly patients and when the radiograph is taken with the AP technique in a supine position.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^116K5XcC]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — definition and diagnostic criteria are explicitly stated: ICHP is defined as infectious pneumonia in individuals with a quantitative or functional host immune defense disorder, and diagnostic criteria include clinical suspicion of a lung infection, with or without compatible clinical signs and symptoms, together with radiographic evidence of a new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate. The page notes that an American Thoracic Society workshop was convened to define ICHP and develop diagnostic criteria for this entity.

### Impact of radiologically stratified exacerbations: insights into pneumonia aetiology in COPD [^111pmand]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective study of outpatients with moderate to very severe COPD, we show that exacerbations with new pneumonic infiltrates were associated with heightened levels of systemic inflammation, greater lung function deterioration and similar microbiological signatures, compared to exacerbations without. Importantly, more than 94% of exacerbations were managed as an outpatient, therefore providing a unique insight into the incidence and significance of pneumonic infiltrate in this clinical setting.

Recent interest has focused on understanding the heterogeneity of exacerbations. Although the use of CXR has been reported in hospitalised COPD patients, few prospective studies report on its use in such a well-characterised outpatient COPD cohort, and none addressing the microbiological and inflammatory complexities of exacerbations to the extent of the AERIS study. The only other large COPD study collecting radiological data at exacerbation, did not report on inflammatory or microbiological indices. Although having a similar patient demographic, the differing primary objectives and aims make direct comparisons to our study difficult.

Pneumonic infiltrates were a feature in approximately 20% of exacerbations. Furthermore, half of all infiltrate-associated exacerbations occurred during the winter, and proportionally were a feature in around a third of all exacerbations occurring during that period, therefore contributing considerably to the exacerbation-burden during this time of year. In multivariate analysis seasonality remained an important determinant, with greater odds of having an exacerbation with infiltrate in winter, compared to summer. The seasonal nature of exacerbations and of pneumonia in COPD has previously been described. Population behaviours, changes in temperature and humidity, as well as cyclical patterns of respiratory pathogens have all been proposed as key determinants. Understanding whether seasonality could direct exacerbation treatment approaches remains to be seen, but characterising exacerbations using methods such as CXR could guide this approach.

Exacerbations are typically inflammatory events. In this study, exacerbations with pneumonic infiltrate were associated with greater airway neutrophillic inflammation and showed more intense systemic inflammatory responses than exacerbations without. Additionally, significant decreases in FEV1 at exacerbation onset were seen in those with pneumonic infiltrate. This observed decline, provides a measure of exacerbation severity and may be directly associated with the greater inflammatory responses identified. Neutrophilic inflammation has previously been shown to correlate with greater decreases in lung function during exacerbation, but these studies did not utilise radiological stratification.

### Prognostic relevance and inter-observer reliability of chest-imaging in pediatric ARDS: a pediatric acute respiratory distress incidence and epidemiology (PARDIE) study [^115xAAvK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Definitions of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) include radiographic criteria, but there are concerns about reliability and prognostic relevance. This study aimed to evaluate the independent relationship between chest imaging and mortality and examine the inter-rater variability of interpretations of chest radiographs (CXR) in pediatric ARDS (PARDS).

Methods

Prospective, international observational study in children meeting Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) criteria for PARDS, which requires new infiltrate(s) consistent with pulmonary parenchymal disease, without mandating bilateral infiltrates. Mortality analysis focused on the entire cohort, whereas inter-observer variability used a subset of patients with blinded, simultaneous interpretation of CXRs by intensivists and radiologists.

Results

Bilateral infiltrates and four quadrants of alveolar consolidation were associated with mortality on a univariable basis, using CXRs from 708 patients with PARDS. For patients on either invasive (IMV) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with PaO 2 /FiO 2 (PF) ratios (or SpO 2 /FiO 2 (SF) ratio equivalent) > 100, neither bilateral infiltrates (OR 1.3 (95% CI 0.68, 2.5), p = 0.43), nor 4 quadrants of alveolar consolidation (OR 1.6 (0.85, 3), p = 0.14) were associated with mortality. For patients with PF ≤ 100, bilateral infiltrates (OR 3.6 (1.4, 9.4), p = 0.01) and four quadrants of consolidation (OR 2.0 (1.14, 3.5), p = 0.02) were associated with higher mortality. A subset of 702 CXRs from 233 patients had simultaneous interpretations. Interobserver agreement for bilateral infiltrates and quadrants was "slight" (kappa 0.31 and 0.33). Subgroup analysis showed agreement did not differ when stratified by PARDS severity but was slightly higher for children with chronic respiratory support (kappa 0.62), NIV at PARDS diagnosis (kappa 0.53), age > 10 years (kappa 0.43) and fluid balance > 40 ml/kg (kappa 0.48).

Conclusion

Bilateral infiltrates and quadrants of alveolar consolidation are associated with mortality only for those with PF ratio ≤ 100, although there is high- inter-rater variability in these chest-x ray parameters.

### Ground-glass opacities on computed tomography of the thorax to predict progression of emphysema: are we there yet? [^116XH2Lj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonologists and radiologists often come across ground-glass opacities (GGOs) when they read computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax. What are GGOs, and what is the clinical significance of having GGOs? Would GGOs be related to inflammation, and can their presence and extent predict the progression of emphysema in smokers?

GGO is defined as hazy, increased attenuation of the lung but with preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins on CT of the thorax. It is a nonspecific sign. Although it can sometimes be seen in normal lungs, it has a wide range of etiologies. Some common pathologic causes include infections, interstitial lung disease (ILD), acute alveolar disease, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and tumors. Histological analysis reveals it is usually caused by partial air cavity filling, pulmonary alveolitis, thickened alveolar walls, or a combination of these features.

GGO is one of the interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) found on CT of the thorax. ILAs are specific patterns of increased lung density on CT scans in subjects with no prior history of ILD, including GGOs, reticular abnormalities, diffuse centrilobular nodularity, nonemphysematous cysts, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis. ILAs are present in 4–9% and 2–7% of cigarette smokers and never-smokers, respectively, and are associated with respiratory symptoms, reduction in exercise capacity and lung function, and increasing mortality. In people with a history of cigarette smoking, ILAs are associated with respiratory exacerbations and mortality.

The relationship between individual components of ILAs and inflammation and progression of emphysema in smokers is understudied. The study by Fortis and colleagues (pp.) in this issue of the Journal provides some insights into how this specific ILA of GGO is related to inflammatory markers and progression of emphysema in a large cohort of subjects (1,680 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and 1,034 with normal spirometry) enrolled in the SPIROMICS study (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study), a prospective observational cohort study conducted at multiple clinical centers across the United States. The primary outcomes were the relationship between GGOs and peripheral blood white blood cells and neutrophil concentrations at visit 1 (baseline) and a change in percentage chest CT emphysema between visits 1 and 2. Secondary outcomes were the change in FEV 1 between visits 1 and 2, progression to COPD at visit 2, exacerbations, and all-cause mortality.

### Radiographic findings among children hospitalized with severe community-acquired pneumonia [^115JMorQ]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of childhood death. There are few published reports of radiographic findings among children with severe CAP.

Objective

To describe chest X-ray (CXR) findings and assess association between these radiographic findings and pneumococcal isolation in children with severe CAP.

Methods

A prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted in 12 centers in Argentina, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic. Children aged 3–59 months, hospitalized with severe pneumonia, were included. On admission, blood and pleural effusion cultures were performed. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified according to standard procedures in the respective national reference laboratory. Chest X-rays were taken on admission and read before the culture results were reported.

Results

Out of 2,536 enrolled patients, 283 (11.2%) had S. pneumoniae isolated, in 181 cases (7.1%) from blood. The follow radiographic patterns were observed: alveolar infiltrate (75.2%), pleural effusion (15.6%), and interstitial infiltrate (9.2%). Overall, pleural effusion was associated with pneumococcal isolation and pneumococcal bacteremia (P < 0.001). Infiltrates were unilateral (78.7%) or bilateral (21.3%), right-sided (76%) or left-sided (24%), in the lower lobe (53.6%) or the upper lobe (46.4%). Multivariate analysis including patients with affection of only one lobe showed that upper lobe affection and pleural effusion were associated with pneumococcal isolation (OR 1.8, 95% CI, 1.3–2.7; OR 11.0, 95% CI, 4.6–26.8, respectively) and with pneumococcal bacteremia (OR 1.7, 95% CI, 1.2–2.6; OR 3.1, 95% CI, 1.2–8.0, respectively).

Conclusions

Three-quarters of the patients studied had alveolar infiltrates. Upper lobe compromising and pleural effusion were associated with pneumococcal invasive disease.

Baseline chest imaging in people with HIV — routine baseline chest X ray is not required, but obtaining a baseline radiograph may be useful for future comparison, and people who inject drugs warrant careful clinical history and physical assessment because radiographic abnormalities may be mistaken for infiltrates.
