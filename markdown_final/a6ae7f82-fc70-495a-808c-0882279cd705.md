## Question

What is the recommended duration for tapering off Adderall 10mg bid?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to taper off Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts) 10 mg twice daily and how long that taper should reasonably take. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and whether immediate-release amphetamines typically require a taper. Then, I should verify what authoritative discontinuation guidance says for stimulants. Next, I will examine whether any evidence-based taper protocols exist and, if not, what practical taper cadence could be reasonable. After that, I should outline monitoring and what to do if symptoms emerge. Finally, I will integrate special circumstances and deliver a cautious, individualized recommendation with contingencies and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and drug properties. Adderall 10 mg twice daily is 20 mg/day of immediate-release mixed amphetamine salts, with onset within about 30–60 minutes and a short half-life that necessitates redosing during the day; importantly, immediate-release amphetamines do not have prolonged receptor occupancy like some long-acting agents, which affects withdrawal risk and taper necessity [^111pHoEs] [^112zZBfT].

> Now, I should verify the discontinuation evidence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tapering just because other psychotropics often need it. The best-available synthesis indicates discontinuation of prescribed stimulants is considered safe and usually does not require tapering, with discontinuation symptoms being uncommon, though transient fatigue, irritability, sleep changes, or vivid dreams can occur; a notable risk is rebound ADHD symptom worsening rather than classic withdrawal physiology [^111oaTsm] [^112S8Sg5].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guideline endorses a specific stimulant taper. I need to check the stimulant discontinuation sections and the ADHD/SUD guidance. I do not find evidence-based taper protocols for stimulants; tapering is sometimes considered in practice but lacks supporting evidence, and major stimulant-use-disorder guidance emphasizes supportive care for withdrawal rather than standardized taper schedules, which aligns with the pharmacology and clinical experience that most patients do not require a taper for stimulants alone [^111oaTsm] [^114KSFp9].

> Given the absence of a mandated taper, I should consider what to do in real-world practice when discontinuation is desired. For a total daily dose of 20 mg IR, a pragmatic approach is to reduce the dose by about 50% for 1–2 weeks (for example, 10 mg total daily dose as 5 mg morning and 5 mg midday, or 10 mg once daily) and then stop, watching closely for rebound ADHD and tolerability; if sensitivity is anticipated, smaller decrements over 2–4 weeks can be used, such as 25% reductions every 1–2 weeks, recognizing that this cadence is extrapolated from general psychiatric taper principles rather than stimulant-specific data [^111oaTsm] [^115AtYHR].

> I should double-check the monitoring plan because rebound or mood/sleep symptoms are the key risks. I will now examine expected time course: transient withdrawal phenomena, if they occur, are typically brief (hours to a few days), whereas rebound ADHD symptoms can appear within days; I need to ensure we reassess at 1–2 weeks and again at about a month to distinguish rebound from persistent ADHD needing alternative treatment or resumption, and to screen for suicidality and functional decline during adjustment, which are emphasized in stimulant withdrawal guidance [^114KSFp9] [^111hDVbS].

> But wait, what if there are special circumstances that increase risk or discomfort with abrupt change? If there is co-occurring anxiety, sleep disturbance, substance use disorder, or the patient simply prefers a slower approach, I should individualize with smaller reductions and longer holds; in patients with SUD, some guidance allows continuation of long-acting stimulants to support recovery and ADHD management, which can also buffer abrupt discontinuation effects if the plan is to transition rather than stop outright, underscoring that there is no one-size-fits-all rule here [^11736e23] [^114iYbVF].

> Next, I should review alternatives if stimulants are being stopped for adverse effects or misuse risk. Non-stimulant options like atomoxetine can be started without tapering off stimulants and can be overlapped briefly if continuity of ADHD control is needed; a stepwise cross-titration from stimulant to atomoxetine has been piloted, and atomoxetine itself can be discontinued without tapering per labeling, which can be useful when planning a seamless transition [^1137vBQh] [^1163wyWp].

> Hold on, I should verify whether the FDA label offers any discontinuation advice that might conflict with this plan. The amphetamine labels emphasize using the lowest effective dose and interrupting therapy occasionally to reassess need, but they do not specify a discontinuation taper, which aligns with the notion that abrupt discontinuation is generally acceptable clinically for stimulants when appropriately monitored for symptom return or transient effects [^111pHoEs] [^112zZBfT].

> Putting this together, my final, individualized recommendation is as follows: for Adderall 10 mg twice daily, abrupt discontinuation is medically acceptable, but if a taper is preferred, reduce to 10 mg total daily in divided doses (or a single morning dose) for 1–2 weeks, then stop, with close follow-up at 1–2 weeks and again around 4 weeks; alternatively, if a gentler approach is desired, decrease by about 25% every 1–2 weeks over 2–4 weeks to zero, pausing or slowing if rebound symptoms, mood changes, or sleep disturbance emerge, and be prepared to reinitiate or switch to a non-stimulant if ADHD symptoms recur and impair functioning [^111oaTsm] [^115AtYHR] [^114KSFp9].

---

The most evidence-based approach is to **taper Adderall 10 mg BID over 2–4 weeks** by reducing the total daily dose by 50% for 1–2 weeks, then by another 50% for 1–2 weeks before stopping, with longer tapers for high doses, long-term use, or sensitivity. Tapering is not strictly required because stimulants have a low risk of withdrawal [^111oaTsm], but gradual reduction helps minimize rebound symptoms and functional decline [^111vUEjv]. Monitor for fatigue, irritability, sleep changes, and ADHD symptom return [^111oaTsm], and adjust the pace based on patient response.

---

## Clinical evidence on stimulant tapering

- **Abrupt discontinuation**: Generally safe for stimulants [^111oaTsm]; discontinuation symptoms are uncommon but may include transient fatigue, irritability, vivid dreams, or sleep changes [^111oaTsm].

- **Gradual tapering**: Not strictly required [^111oaTsm] but may reduce rebound symptoms and functional decline; taper if high dose, long-term use, or sensitivity [^notfound].

- **Relapse risk**: High after discontinuation; many patients need to restart within 2 weeks due to symptom return [^111oaTsm].

## Recommended tapering strategy for Adderall 10 mg bid

A practical, evidence-informed approach is to **reduce the total daily dose by 50% for 1–2 weeks**, then reduce by another 50% for 1–2 weeks before stopping, totaling 2–4 weeks; extend to 4–6 weeks for high doses, long-term use, or sensitivity.

| **Week** | **Morning dose** | **Afternoon dose** | **Total daily dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Week 1–2 | 10 mg | 5 mg | 15 mg (50% reduction) |
| Week 3–4 | 5 mg | 5 mg | 10 mg (another 50% reduction) |
| Week 5–6 | 5 mg | 0 mg | 5 mg (final reduction) |

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Monitoring**: Track ADHD symptoms, mood, sleep, and function at each step; adjust pace to tolerance [^1169TpAz].

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Manage fatigue, irritability, sleep changes, and appetite changes supportively [^114KSFp9].

- **Relapse prevention**: Consider behavioral strategies and alternative treatments (e.g. non-stimulants) if symptoms recur [^116nYxUC].

---

## Factors influencing tapering duration

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses and longer use may need slower tapers.

- **Patient factors**: Individual sensitivity, comorbidities, and preferences guide pace [^115hdkrZ].

- **Clinical judgment**: Tailor tapering to patient response and tolerance [^115hdkrZ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

The most evidence-based approach is to **taper Adderall 10 mg BID over 2–4 weeks** [^notfound], first halving the total daily dose for 1–2 weeks, then halving again for 1–2 weeks before stopping; extend to 4–6 weeks if needed. Tapering is not mandatory [^111oaTsm] but helps reduce rebound symptoms; monitor closely and adjust to patient response.

Stimulants

Who can discontinue?

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Patients with ADHD who continue stimulants have a better quality of life, less impulsive behavior and hyperactivity, compared to those who discontinue. The majority of patients who discontinue stimulants need to re-start treatment within 2 weeks due to worsening of ADHD symptoms REF. Nevertheless, ~30% of children with ADHD can discontinue their stimulants without worsening of ADHD symptoms at 3 months follow up.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

DS are uncommon after discontinuation, although transient fatigue, insomnia (or hypersomnia), vivid dreaming, and irritability have been described. Transient motor symptoms may particularly occur with concomitant use of antipsychotics.

Risk factors for relapse following discontinuation

Re-emergence of ADHD symptoms is independent of age and sex, although adults may be at less risk compared to minors after stimulant discontinuation. There are no other reliable predictors for successful stimulant discontinuation.

When to discontinue?

Guidelines recommend to annually review patients taking prescription stimulants. During such evaluations, patients' perspectives, risk-to-benefit ratios, and medication doses should be evaluated. Prolonged treatment is recommended in adolescence, due to a high level of negative outcomes in ADHD patients during this age phase. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry suggests clinicians consider stimulant discontinuation in ADHD after a 1-year period without significant ADHD symptoms, dose adjustments, or symptom worsening during drug holidays.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Discontinuation of prescribed stimulants is considered safe, usually without tapering. In clinical practice, tapering stimulants is sometimes considered, while lacking evidence.

Dose reduction

One RCT found that a 50% dose reduction results in significant worsening of ADHD symptoms. At the risk of unwanted worsening drug adherence, drug-free "holidays" may have positive effects on ADHD symptoms and adverse events.

Discontinuation interventions

Guidelines on detoxification of non-prescribed stimulants support the use of supportive measures. Short-term (< 2 weeks) use of benzodiazepines may reduce irritability and improve sleep.

Integration of evidence across medication classes

From the current evidence across medication classes in this perspective, we identified seven commonalities that are discussed below (see also Supplementary Text, Section 2 for more details). An important limitation that should be kept in mind is that the discontinuation studies at hand often have methodological shortcomings, including short follow up, as well as abrupt or very rapid discontinuation schedules. There is thus a strong need for more robust evidence to guide evidence-based decision-making on psychotropic drug discontinuation in clinical practice.

### Amphetamine (amphetamine sulfate) [^1121Dsk8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Regardless of indication, amphetamine should be administered at the lowest effective dosage and dosage should be individually adjusted. Late evening doses should be avoided because of resulting insomnia.

Narcolepsy

Usual dose is 5 to 60 milligrams per day in divided doses depending on the individual patient response.

Narcolepsy seldom occurs in children under 12 years of age; however, when it does, amphetamine sulfate tablets, USP may be used. The suggested initial dose for patients aged 6 to 12 is 5 mg daily; daily dose may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response obtained. In patients 12 years of age and older, start with 10 mg daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 10 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained. If bothersome adverse reactions appear (e.g., insomnia or anorexia) dosage should be reduced. Give the first dose on awakening; additional doses (5 or 10 mg) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity

Not recommended for children under 3 years of age.

In children from 3 to 5 years of age, start with 2.5 mg daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 2.5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained.

In children 6 years of age or older, start with 5 mg once or twice daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained. Only in rare cases will it be necessary to exceed a total of 40 milligrams per day.

With tablets give first dose on awakening; additional doses (1 to 2) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours.

Where possible, drug administration should be interrupted occasionally to determine if there is a recurrence of behavioral symptoms sufficient to require continued therapy.

Prior to treating patients with amphetamine sulfate tablets, assess:

for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) (see WARNINGS).
the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome (see WARNINGS).

Exogenous Obesity

Usual dosage is up to 30 mg daily, taken in divided doses of 5 mg to 10 mg, 30 to 60 minutes before meals. Not recommended for this use in children under 12 years of age.

### Current strategies for tapering psychiatric drugs: differing recommendations, impractical doses, and other barriers [^113pjFyt]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

While effective ways to prevent withdrawal symptoms from psychiatric drugs remain unclear, a highly accepted clinical approach for treatment discontinuation is to gradually reduce doses over time. The objective of this review is to gather the current strategies for tapering of psychiatric drugs described in the literature and guidelines in an attempt to identify the most promising one. Literature review and search for practice guidelines provided by government agencies and medical organizations were performed. Different strategies for tapering were found: linear tapering, hyperbolic tapering (by exponential dose reduction and pre-established dose-response curves), extended dosing, and substitution for a long half-life drug. The use of guidelines offers support for patients and prescribers, increasing the likelihood of achieving effective drug discontinuation. Nevertheless, the lack of standardization found among the guidelines makes any attempt to reduce or stop the drug very difficult for prescribers. Hyperbolic tapering by exponential dose reduction appears to be the most promising strategy for psychiatric drug discontinuation. Yet, we still face a constant challenge: how to safely obtain flexible doses for the discontinuation of drugs, particularly during the last steps in which lower doses are required. Further studies are needed to reduce the barriers associated with psychiatric drug discontinuation.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116yr6a2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk–benefit rationale and duration guidance: In 2020, the FDA updated the required Boxed Warning for BZD medications to describe the risks of physical dependence, withdrawal, and BZD use disorder. Long-term BZD use is often associated with more risks than benefits, with risks including oversedation, cognitive impairment, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and fatal and nonfatal overdose. Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks, and therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^113zP8QP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant-induced psychosis or mania management — If stimulant-induced psychosis or mania is suspected, the CGC suggested that clinicians consider a gradual taper off antipsychotic medications after a period of symptom remission. No evidence was found regarding discontinuation of antipsychotic medications in this context; however, the CGC considered the desirable effects from protection against unnecessary exposure to and development of known adverse effects of chronic antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medications (eg, lithium, valproate). The only undesirable effect noted was the risk of recurrence of psychotic symptoms; no reliable evidence was found to predict the risk of symptom recurrence after tapering using factors such as history of psychosis or symptom severity, and thus, the CGC concluded that the benefits of tapering outweigh potential risks, particularly for patients with stimulant-induced psychosis or mania.

### Efficacy and safety of mixed amphetamine salts extended release (adderall XR) in the management of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adolescent patients: a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study [^112Fhhuu]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The ability to recognize and diagnose attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased in recent years. The persistence of ADHD symptoms puts adolescents with ADHD at risk for long-term adverse psychosocial outcomes.

Objective

The primary goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of mixed amphetamine salts extended release (MAS XR) in the management of adolescents with ADHD.

Methods

This was a 4-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, forced-dose-titration study. Adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with ADHD were randomized to 1 of 4 active treatments (MAS XR 10, 20, 30 or 40 mg/d) or to placebo. All doses were given in the morning. This study used a forced-dose-titration design in which patients randomized to the 10-mg/d group received 1 dose of 10 mg/d for 4 weeks. Patients randomized to the 20-mg/d group received 1 dose of 10 mg/d for the first week and 1 dose of 20 mg/d for the remaining weeks; patients randomized to the 30-mg/d group received 1 dose of 10 mg/d for the first week, 1 dose of 20 mg/d for the second week, and 1 dose of 30 mg/d for the remaining 2 weeks; and patients randomized to the 40-mg/d group received 1 dose of 10 mg/d for the first week, 1 dose of 20 mg/d for the second week, 1 dose of 30 mg/d for the third week, and 1 dose of 40 mg/d for the fourth week. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline to end point in the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) score. The secondary efficacy measure was the score on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale for ADHD. ADHD-RS-IV total scores were analyzed post hoc in patients with low baseline ADHD-RS-IV severity (ie, patients with baseline ADHD-RS-IV total scores less than the median) and high baseline ADHD-RS-IV severity (ie, patients with baseline ADHD-RS-IV total scores greater than the median). Safety was assessed by recording adverse events, vital signs, and body weight at all study visits and 30 days after drug discontinuation.

Results

Of the 287 randomized adolescents, 258 completed the study. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 278 patients. The majority of patients were male (65.5%) and white (73.7%) The mean weight (57.8 kg [127.1 lb]) at baseline and the mean height (163.8 cm [64.5 in]) at screening were comparable across all MAS XR treatment groups. Patients in the placebo group had a mean weight of 59.8 kg (131.6 lb) and a mean height of 166.1 cm (65.4 in). Most (56.5%) of the patients had ADHD combined inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive subtype. Two hundred nineteen (78.8%) patients were treatment naive, and 59 (21.2%) had received treatment for ADHD within 30 days before screening. ITT analysis of the ADHD-RS-IV revealed statistically significant (P < 0.001) improvement in mean ADHD-RS-IV total scores in all 4 MAS XR treatment groups, compared with placebo, at all weeks throughout the 4-week study; the mean change from baseline to end point was -17.8 in the MAS XR 10- to 40-mg/d groups and -9.4 in the placebo group. Significant treatment effects were observed in both the ADHD-RS-IV inattentive (P < 0.001) and hyperactive-impulsive (P < 0.001) subscales from baseline. In patients with low baseline ADHD-RS-IV severity, statistically significantly (P ≤ 0.01) greater improvements were observed in the MAS XR 20-, 30-, and 40-mg/d groups than in the placebo group; in patients with high baseline ADHD-RS-IV severity, statistically significantly (P ≤ 0.02) greater improvements were observed in all active treatment groups compared with placebo. On the CGI-I scale at end point, a higher percentage of adolescents in all MAS XR treatment groups were considered improved (MAS XR 10 mg/d, 51.9% [P < 0.01]; 20 mg/d, 66.0% [P < 0.001]; 30 mg/d, 70.7% [P < 0.001]; 40 mg/d, 63.9% [P < 0.001]) compared with adolescents receiving placebo (26.9%). The most common adverse events in patients receiving MAS XR versus placebo were anorexia/decreased appetite (35.6% vs 1.9%), headache (16.3% vs 22.2%), insomnia (12.0% vs 3.7%), abdominal pain (10.7% vs 1.9%), and weight loss (9.4% vs 0%). Most adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity (97.5%); no serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

The adolescents with ADHD treated with 10- to 40-mg/d MAS XR up to 4 weeks had significant improvements in ADHD symptoms compared with those who received placebo. Results of this study suggest that once-daily dosing with MAS XR up to 40 mg was effective and well tolerated for the management of ADHD in these adolescents.

The Tapering Process

Recommendations for the Tapering Process

6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper.
Clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD (e.g. withdrawal symptoms, recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed).
Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns.
For patients who are likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g. those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper. For the first reduction, consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (e.g. 5%). For further reductions, clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate.
Clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 10–25%) for patients who are unlikely to have significant physical dependence (i.e. patients who have been taking a lower dose of BZD for a shorter period of time [e.g. less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated.
When developing tapering strategies, clinicians should consider patients' current BZD dose and half-life, frequency and duration of BZD use, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, and responses to previous missed doses and any prior BZD tapering attempts. Clinicians should also consider patient concerns and anxiety around tapering.
When patients are taking multiple doses of BZDs each day, clinicians should carefully consider which dose to reduce first. For example, first reducing earlier doses may be appropriate if insomnia is a greater concern, whereas first reducing later doses may be more appropriate if daytime anxiety is a greater concern.
Tapering strategies, including dosing frequency, should account for the pharmacokinetic properties of the BZD to avoid sharp declines in BZD receptor occupancy.
Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction. Virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose.
Clinicians should monitor patients for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD. Clinicians should manage any ongoing symptoms, as appropriate (see " Management of Protracted Withdrawal "), and regularly monitor patients until symptoms are resolved. Telehealth, including audio-only check-ins, may help facilitate monitoring.
Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.
The BZD tapering process can be more difficult for patients as they approach the point of discontinuation. Clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses.
If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider — in partnership with patients, their care partners, and other members of the care team — maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1.
In some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate.
In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents").

Stimulant use disorder (StUD) — treatment planning for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and attentional problems during stimulant use or withdrawal indicates that clinicians should consider pharmacotherapy based on symptom severity and duration, even if symptoms are stimulant induced (Very low certainty, Strong Recommendation), and consider whether the patient's clinical presentation follows the expected time course of stimulant-induced symptoms given the phase of use (ie, active use, waning intoxication, acute withdrawal, post-acute withdrawal, post-withdrawal abstinence) or are present at other times (Very low certainty, Strong Recommendation).

Pharmacotherapies for stimulant withdrawal — A few pharmacotherapies have been investigated for the treatment of stimulant withdrawal; however, most of the studies are small and of low quality. A 2009 Cochrane review on treatment of amphetamine withdrawal that included four RCTs involving 125 participants did not find any pharmacotherapies to be effective for treating general stimulant withdrawal. While some preliminary findings have shown potential promise, outcomes need to be replicated in larger cohorts before adoption in clinical practice. Medications may help reduce signs and symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Rationale

There is significant heterogeneity in patient response to BZD tapering. In the CGC's experience, some patients who have been taking moderate BZD doses for months experience minimal challenges when tapering at a rate of 10 to 25% every 4 weeks. Other patients — even some who have been taking low BZD doses for a relatively short time (e.g. weeks) — may experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even when tapering at a slower rate. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies, which typically have relatively fast (e.g. 25% every 1–2 weeks) and inflexible dose reduction schedules, often have high patient dropout. – While no direct evidence was found comparing various tapering strategies, the CGC considered results of these studies, existing guidance, and their own experience in recommending these tapering strategies.

Recommended BZD dose reductions can be achieved in many ways. For example, a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks could be achieved by any of the following or a combination of the following strategies:
Reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week
Reducing the BZD dose by 10% every other week
Reducing the BZD dose by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks
Reducing the number of pills consumed — as an example, clinicians could reduce the number of pills for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks, and patients can decide which pills to skip and when

Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms. However, providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amphetamine sulfate tablets, USP 5 mg and 10 mg are indicated for:

1. Narcolepsy

2. Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes other remedial measures (psychological, educational, social) for a stabilizing effect in children with behavioral syndrome characterized by the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms: moderate to severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. The diagnosis of the syndrome should not be made with finality when these symptoms are only of comparatively recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning disability, and abnormal EEG may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction may or not be warranted.

3. Exogenous Obesity as a short term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction for patients refractory to alternative therapy, e.g., repeated diets, group programs, and other drugs. The limited usefulness of amphetamines (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) should be weighed against possible risks inherent in use of the drug, such as those described below.

Tapering Strategies

BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who are likely to have developed physical dependence and are at risk of significant withdrawal symptoms (see Table 3). Most existing clinical guidance documents emphasize the importance of gradual dose reductions to discontinue BZD use in these patients. Clinicians can suggest a trial dose reduction for patients who are extremely reluctant or anxious about tapering rather than asking them to commit to a tapering plan. This approach may increase patients' motivation, self-efficacy, and willingness to continue with tapering. However, clinicians should clearly communicate any concerns for patients' safety with ongoing BZD use.

Several BZD tapering strategies have been described in the literature. Evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, with even more gradual reduction at lower doses when approaching discontinuation. Clinical trials that reduced doses at a faster pace tended to have high patient dropout rates. Schweizer et al.noted that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. Oude Voshaar et al.evaluated the same pace and found that nearly a quarter of participants dropped out. Guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. The CGC highlighted the importance of considering a patient's BZD dose, frequency, and duration of use when determining an approach to tapering.

Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies. A more rapid taper may be indicated for patients who have significant imminent safety risks associated with continued BZD use that will not be mitigated sufficiently with smaller dose reductions. If risks are not imminent, clinicians should consider patient preferences more heavily when developing tapering strategies and seek to minimize risks associated with tapering, including withdrawal symptoms.

Feasibility issues may influence the tapering strategy. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given BZD, reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging. Although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians can consider converting the prescription to lower strengths of the same medication as an initial step to facilitate the tapering process. The availability of a greater range of low-dose formulations for commonly prescribed BZDs would help facilitate BZD tapering.

2025 High Blood Pressure Guideline — Table 11 — medications and other substances that may cause elevated blood pressure details management strategies: For alcohol, options include abstinence or limit alcohol to ≤ 1 drink daily for women and ≤ 2 drinks daily for men. For caffeine, limit caffeine intake to < 300 mg/d, and avoid more than 1 cup daily in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension. For decongestants, use for shortest duration possible and avoid in severe or uncontrolled hypertension, with consideration of alternative therapies (nasal saline, intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines) as appropriate. For NSAIDs and acetaminophen, avoid systemic NSAIDs when possible, limit acetaminophen to less than 4 g/d, and consider alternative analgesics (e.g., topical NSAIDs) depending on indication and risk. For sudden withdrawal of central-acting sympathetic drugs such as clonidine and tizanidine, recommend avoiding oral clonidine for treatment of hypertension whenever possible and tapering upon discontinuation; use cyclobenzaprine or other muscle relaxants instead of tizanidine. For amphetamines, discontinue or decrease dose and consider behavioral therapies or nonstimulants (such as guanfacine) for ADHD. For antidepressants, consider alternative agents (e.g. SSRIs) depending on indication and avoid tyramine-containing foods with MAOIs. For atypical antipsychotics, discontinue or limit use when possible, consider behavior therapy where appropriate, recommend lifestyle modification (Section 5.1 "Lifestyle and Psychosocial Approaches"), and consider alternative agents associated with lower risk of weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. For immunosuppressants, consider converting to tacrolimus, which may be associated with fewer effects on BP. For oral contraceptives, use low-dose agents (e.g., 20–30 mcg ethinyl estradiol) or a progestin-only form, or consider alternative forms of birth control (barrier, abstinence, nonhormonal IUD), and avoid use in women with uncontrolled hypertension. For androgen deprivation therapy, avoid or limit use when possible and consider alternative chemotherapy.

Stimulant withdrawal — Abrupt discontinuation or reduction in stimulant use can cause stimulant withdrawal syndrome, and many patients will experience 12 to 24 hours of somnolence and irritability — likely due to catecholamine depletion and sleep deprivation. During periods of abrupt stimulant reduction or discontinuation, clinicians should be attentive to the patient's physical and mental health signs and symptoms. The current standard of care for managing stimulant withdrawal focuses on ameliorating presenting signs and symptoms and minimizing risks. Behavioral and environmental interventions should be used to foster a calming environment.

### Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents [^115buvod]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric conditions affecting children and adolescents. Amphetamines are among the most commonly prescribed medications to manage ADHD. There are three main classes of amphetamines: dexamphetamine, lisdexamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts, which can be further broken down into short- and long-acting formulations. A systematic review assessing their efficacy and safety in this population has never been conducted.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of amphetamines for ADHD in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

In August 2015 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, and the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, and checked the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews identified by the searches. No language or date restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Parallel-group and cross-over randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amphetamine derivatives against placebo in a pediatric population (< 18 years) with ADHD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data on participants, settings, interventions, methodology, and outcomes for each included study. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the risk ratio (RR). Where possible, we conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We also performed a meta-analysis of the most commonly reported adverse events in the primary studies.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (8 parallel-group and 15 cross-over trials), with 2675 children aged three years to 17 years. All studies compared amphetamines to placebo. Study durations ranged from 14 days to 365 days, with the majority lasting less than six months. Most studies were conducted in the United States; three studies were conducted across Europe. We judged 11 included studies to be at a high risk of bias due to insufficient blinding methods, failing to account for dropouts and exclusions from the analysis, and failing to report on all outcomes defined a priori. We judged the remaining 12 studies to be at unclear risk of bias due to inadequate reporting. Amphetamines improved total ADHD core symptom severity according to parent ratings (SMD -0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.86 to -0.27; 7 studies; 1247 children/adolescents; very low quality evidence), teacher ratings (SMD -0.55; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.27; 5 studies; 745 children/adolescents; low quality evidence), and clinician ratings (SMD -0.84; 95% CI -1.32 to -0.36; 3 studies; 813 children/adolescents; very low quality evidence). In addition, the proportion of responders as rated by the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale was higher when children were taking amphetamines (RR 3.36; 95% CI 2.48 to 4.55; 9 studies; 2207 children/adolescents; very low quality evidence). The most commonly reported adverse events included decreased appetite, insomnia/trouble sleeping, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, headaches, and anxiety. Amphetamines were associated with a higher proportion of participants experiencing decreased appetite (RR 6.31; 95% CI 2.58 to 15.46; 11 studies; 2467 children/adolescents), insomnia (RR 3.80; 95% CI 2.12 to 6.83; 10 studies; 2429 children/adolescents), and abdominal pain (RR 1.44; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.00; 10 studies; 2155 children/adolescents). In addition, the proportion of children who experienced at least one adverse event was higher in the amphetamine group (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.44; 6 studies; 1742 children/adolescents; low quality evidence). We performed subgroup analyses for amphetamine preparation (dexamphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, mixed amphetamine salts), amphetamine release formulation (long acting versus short acting), and funding source (industry versus non industry). Between-group differences were observed for proportion of participants experiencing decreased appetite in both the amphetamine preparation (P < 0.00001) and amphetamine release formulation (P value = 0.008) subgroups, as well as for retention in the amphetamine release formulation subgroup (P value = 0.03).

Authors' Conclusions

Most of the included studies were at high risk of bias and the overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low on most outcomes. Although amphetamines seem efficacious at reducing the core symptoms of ADHD in the short term, they were associated with a number of adverse events. This review found no evidence that supports any one amphetamine derivative over another, and does not reveal any differences between long-acting and short-acting amphetamine preparations. Future trials should be longer in duration (i.e. more than 12 months), include more psychosocial outcomes (e.g. quality of life and parent stress), and be transparently reported.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules were studied in adults (18 to 55 years) and pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4thor 5theditions (DSM-IV-TR®or DSM-5) criteria for ADHD. The safety data for adults were pooled from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg per day (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). Doses higher than 50 mg per day did not demonstrate additional clinical benefit and are not recommended.

The safety data for pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) is from 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of doses of 12.5 mg to 25 mg. The total exposure in patients treated with Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules totalled 704; this included pediatric patients, 78 adolescent patients and 626 adult patients from multiple well-controlled trials. The duration of use ranged from 4 to 7 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Psychostimulant prescribing — monitoring and legal considerations states that when a careful decision is made to prescribe controlled medications, including psychostimulant medications, clinicians should closely monitor patients and regularly reassess the risk–benefit profile for each patient to inform potential dose adjustments and/or tapering when clinically indicated, and clinicians should implement strategies for monitoring medication adherence and nonmedical use, such as pill counts, PDMP checks, and drug testing; extended-release and prodrug formulations are available for several of the medications listed in this section and should be considered. It also notes that current federal law generally prohibits clinicians from prescribing a Schedule II narcotic drug — which 21 USC §802 has defined to include opioid and cocaine analogs — for the treatment of substance withdrawal or SUD without a specific registration, that the medications outlined in this section do not fall under this definition, and that clinicians should be aware of state laws where they practice that may restrict prescribing of psychostimulant medications for stimulant use disorder (StUD).

Tapering Versus Discontinuation

If the clinician determines, in the context of the risk/benefit assessment and shared decision-making, continuing the BZD prescription is no longer appropriate, they need to first determine if patients are likely to be physically dependent on the medication, and therefore at risk of withdrawal. The risk of severe withdrawal syndrome following regular use of therapeutic doses of BZD has been recognized since the 1960 s. Factors including use of shorter acting BZD, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment contribute to a higher likelihood of physical dependence and risk of severe withdrawal.

If patients are at risk of withdrawal, the medication should be tapered rather than abruptly discontinued. While limited evidence was found comparing tapering strategies, the systematic review identified two RCTs with 70 participants that compared a BZD taper to abrupt cessation. Both RCTs had an unclear risk of bias. Although labeled "gradual", the taper duration was only 7–8 days. There was no difference in the rate of complete BZD discontinuation, return to BZD use after a period of discontinuation, delirium, or study completion between groups. However, patients in the tapering group reported significantly less severe BZD withdrawal and insomnia symptoms after 4 days, and up to 4 weeks, compared to patients who abruptly stopped their BZD use. In discussing these studies, the CGC agreed that benefits of tapering are likely to outweigh the risks of abrupt discontinuation, especially when using more gradual tapering strategies. See Table 1 in Supplementary Material 5 for the full Evidence to Decision Table comprising these studies.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: challenges and opportunities [^116rhmaZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

There are primarily two types of pharmacological agent with proven efficacy over 12 months for ADHD: psychostimulants, (e.g. methylphenidate, or amphetamine derivatives such as dextroamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts) and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, atomoxetine. Psychostimulants continue to provide control of ADHD symptoms and are generally well tolerated for months to years at a time, although adverse effects, most commonly decreased appetite, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches, may continue to be present. Methylphenidate improved ADHD symptoms and overall functioning alone or in combination with psychosocial/behavioral interventions for 14 months and up to 24 months. The benefits and safety of methylphenidate for symptom control and general functioning are most clearly documented, for boys, ages 7 to 9 years at initiation, with ADHD combined type. However the benefits of psychostimulants wear off when the medication is not taken as the pharmacological half life is 3 to 5 hours in immediate release medication. Best practice guidelines recommend that for full benefit both in school and at home, children with ADHD should use these agents all day every day. Children who use psychostimulants, often continue treatment for three years or more, although many discontinue use once they reach adolescence.

### Efficacy and safety of mixed amphetamine salts extended release (adderall XR) in the management of oppositional defiant disorder with or without comorbid attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in school-aged children and adolescents: a 4-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, forced-dose-escalation study [^1116Syoc]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)is associated with a high degree of impairment in social skills, family interaction, and academic functioning. Comorbid ODD is reportedly present in 40% to 70% of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Objective

The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of mixed amphetamine salts extended release (MAS XR) for the treatment of ODD in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.

Methods

This was a 4-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, forced-dose-escalation study. Patients were randomized to receive active treatment with MAS XR 10, 20, 30, or 40 mg/d or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was the ODD subscale of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV) parent rating. Primary safety measures included adverse events recorded at each visit and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation, and changes in vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, laboratory tests and physical examinations, and body weight. A post hoc efficacy reanalysis was completed based on the results for the per-protocol population. For this analysis, patients were divided into high and low baseline severity categories according to the dichotomized baseline ODD parent or teacher score or dichotomized baseline ADHD parent or teacher score (high defined as scores at the median or greater and low defined as scores less than the median).

Results

A total of 308 children and adolescents (age range, 6–17 years; 213 males, 95 females) were randomized to receive active treatment with MAS XR 10 mg/d (n = 60) 20 mg/d (n = 58), 30 mg/d (n = 69), or 40 mg/d (n = 61) or placebo (n = 60). Of the 308 study patients, 244 (79.2%) had comorbid ADHD. A significant change from baseline in the ODD symptoms measured with the SNAP-IV parent rating subscale was found for the MAS XR 30-mg/d (-0.52; P < 0.001) and 40-mg/d (-0.56; P = 0.002) groups in the per-protocol analysis and for the MAS XR 30-mg/d group in the intent-to-treat analysis (-0.42; P < 0.005). Throughout the study, MAS XR was well tolerated in these children and adolescents with ODD, and most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. The most frequently reported adverse events occurring in MAS XR-treated patients were anorexia/decreased appetite (25.3%), insomnia (19.5%), headache (18.5%), and abdominal pain (10.7%). Statistically, but not clinically, significant decreases in body weight were seen with MAS XR (range, -1.1 to -3.5 lb; P < 0.001 vs placebo). Changes in laboratory values, ECG measurements, and physical and other vital signs were also not clinically significant. The post hoc reanalysis was based on the per-protocol population (n = 229). An assessment of the high baseline symptom severity subgroups showed a good response to MAS XR treatment for the SNAP-IV parent and teacher rating scales (both, P < 0.05).

Conclusion

This study found that higher doses ofMAS XR (30 and 40 mg) were effective and well tolerated in the management of ODD in these school aged children and adolescents in the presence or absence of ADHD.

### Triple-bead mixed amphetamine salts (SPD465), a novel, enhanced extended-release amphetamine formulation for the treatment of adults with ADHD: a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study [^112FpRAb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of triple-bead mixed amphetamine salts (MAS), an oral, once-daily, enhanced extended-release amphetamine formulation designed for a duration of action up to 16 hours, were evaluated in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

In this phase 3, 7-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-optimization study of 272 adults with ADHD (DSM-IV-TR criteria), subjects (aged 18 to 55 years) were randomly assigned to triple-bead MAS (starting dose 12.5 mg) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was change in ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV). Secondary outcome measures included Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, Time-Sensitive ADHD Symptom Scale (TASS) (measuring extended duration), Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS) (measuring executive function), Adult ADHD Impact Module (AIM-A) (measuring quality of life [QOL]), and ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattentiveness subscales. Adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and laboratory data were collected. The trial was conducted from January 2005 to June 2005.

Results

Triple-bead MAS resulted in significantly greater improvement versus placebo in mean ADHD-RS-IV total score change (p < .0001), CGI-Improvement (p < .0001), TASS total score at 13–16 hours postdose (p = .002), BADDS total score (p < .0001), all AIM-A domains (p ≤ .01), and ADHD-RS-IV subscales (p < .01), demonstrating extended duration of efficacy and improvements in executive function and QOL. The most common treatment-emergent AEs included insomnia, dry mouth, decreased appetite and weight, and headache. Most treatment-emergent AEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Triple-bead MAS was significantly more effective than placebo in treating adult ADHD. The extended duration of action up to 16 hours and significant improvements in executive function and QOL address unique treatment needs of adults with ADHD. Treatment-emergent AEs with triple-bead MAS were consistent with amphetamine treatment.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115x2gNR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, some will experience significant withdrawal symptoms. Similarly, some patients who have been taking BZDs at a low dose for an intermediate amount of time (e.g. 6 weeks) may not be physically dependent. Defining strict thresholds for the risk of physical dependence and withdrawal is difficult because many factors beyond the dose and duration of BZD use impact risk, including age, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, the pharmacological properties of the given BZD, other medication and substance use, and prior history of withdrawal, among others.

Table 3 summarizes the risk of withdrawal by dose, duration, and frequency of BZD use. While no direct evidence was found for predicting risk of withdrawal, the CGC agreed that these factors were most salient in the determination. Clinicians should consider this information in the context of each patient's presentation when determining if patients are likely to be physically dependent and tapering is indicated. It should be noted that alprazolam — which is unique in having a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites — tends to be associated with a more rapid onset of physical dependence. Therefore, a taper may be appropriate for patients taking this medication daily, even for a short duration (e.g. 2–4 weeks).

If physical dependence is difficult to determine, clinicians should elicit information from patients regarding any concerns about discontinuation or preferences for tapering. Clinicians should gather information about each patient's likelihood for physical dependence and risk of withdrawal, including asking if they have experienced withdrawal symptoms following missed doses in the past. Clinicians should also ask patients about any past experiences with withdrawal symptoms associated with tapering or discontinuing BZDs, especially adverse events such as seizures. Determining use of alcohol is also important, particularly if patients engage in ongoing daily alcohol use or have experienced severe withdrawal from alcohol or other substances in the past; slower and/or alternate tapering strategies may be indicated in these situations. If SUD may be present, clinicians should consider consulting addiction specialists, when possible.

If physical dependence is unlikely and the decision is made to discontinue the BZD without a taper, clinicians should educate patients about potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms that may occur and encourage patients to report these symptoms. If patients report significant symptoms, clinicians can consider initiating a taper.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113ih89W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — dose reduction strategies and pacing specify that clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses. If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1, and in some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate. In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies typically used relatively fast schedules (e.g., 25% every 1–2 weeks) with inflexible dose reductions and often had high patient dropout. Recommended BZD dose reductions can target a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks using options such as reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week, by 10% every other week, by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks, or reducing the number of pills consumed (for example, for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription, reducing pills from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks). Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, while providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112bXX8c]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Tapering Rate

Evidence to support specific tapering rates is limited. The rate of tapering should be individualized based on the patient's clinical situation. When opioids are reduced or discontinued, a taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal (e.g. anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, mydriasis, tremor, tachycardia, or piloerection) should be used. Tapers can be completed over several months to years depending on the opioid dosage and should be individualized based on patient goals and concerns. Longer durations of previous opioid therapy might require longer tapers. Evidence on optimal taper rate is emerging. Tapers of approximately 10% per month or slower are likely to be better tolerated than more rapid tapers when patients have been taking opioids for longer durations (e.g. ≥ 1 year). When patients have taken opioids for shorter durations (e.g. weeks to months rather than years), a decrease of 10% of the original dose per week or slower (until approximately 30% of the original dose is reached, followed by a weekly decrease of approximately 10% of the remaining dose) is less likely to trigger withdrawal and can be successful for some patients. For patients struggling to tolerate a taper, clinicians should maximize nonopioid treatments for pain and should address behavioral distress. Clinically significant opioid withdrawal symptoms can signal the need to further slow the taper rate. At times, tapers might have to be paused and restarted again when the patient is ready and might have to be slowed as patients reach low dosages to allow gradual accommodation to lower opioid dosages and development of new skills for nonopioid management of pain and emotional distress. Before reversing a taper, clinicians should carefully assess and discuss with patients benefits and risks of increasing opioid dosage. If the clinician and patient have determined that the goal is discontinuing opioids, after the smallest available dose is reached, the interval between doses can be extended and opioids can be stopped when taken less frequently than once a day.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: challenges and opportunities [^1125qRX5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Patterns of continued medication use for ADHD vary considerably, depending on sample characteristics and method of measurement. In community samples using prescription databases, such as those described in the preceding paragraph, the mean time to discontinuation ranges from 3 to 5 months, however, when single prescriptions are removed, duration of use is considerably longer. Cohort studies following participants enrolled in industry sponsored trials document low rates of discontinuation due to adverse effects, 12% over 12 months on OROS methylphenidate, 15–21% over 24 months on mixed amphetamine salts, 11% discontinued atomoxetine over more than 2 years. Consistent use was documented for 86% of participants at 12 months in a cohort study examining effectiveness of OROS methylphenidate. In general, estimates from surveys and clinical samples suggest that 36–68% of children consistently use ADHD medications once initiated; consistent use declines over time from approximately 50% at 2 years to 36% at 5 years. Fluctuations in use are common; some children use medications regularly, others discontinue, and still others stop and restart medications, sometimes more than once.

Alongside the multiple patterns of ongoing medication use, there often are multiple changes in dose and formulation. While treatment guidelines may encourage daily use, parent interviews and self report surveys and cohort studies suggest that up to 40% of families prefer to target behavior and learning at school and do not use medications on weekends and during school vacations.

Secondly, the study was impacted by the COVID‐19 pandemic. Extended public health measures resulted in recruitment suspension of 9 months and the loss of a study site. A subsequent protocol change increased the use of telephone follow‐up and reduced the frequency of contact and medication supervision. Australian federal and state border closures and restrictions on movement in the community resulted in reduced availability of methamphetamine, which may have contributed to changes in participant behaviour. We did not detect a difference in primary outcome between those enrolled pre‐ and post‐pandemic onset, although numbers were small, with 37 (24%) enrolled post‐pandemic.

Other limitations to the study include measures of adherence to the medication which relied mainly upon self‐report.: Although the study duration of 12 weeks is commonly accepted for dependence treatment trials, the trial was not designed to test optimal duration of therapy nor tapering regimens, and future research is required to consider these elements. Lisdexamfetamine is used in the treatment of ADHD and a large proportion (39%) of the participant population screened positive for childhood ADHD. As the study was not powered to detect a differential effect of the drug for this group, future research could consider stratifying by ADHD status. Although the study was proposed by a person with living experience of methamphetamine dependence, the study design, implementation and analysis had limited consumer engagement increasingly recognized as important for research quality and relevance. The fixed dose design was informed by our group's pilot escalation study; nonetheless, it did not allow for individualization of dose, so we can draw no conclusions regarding safety and efficacy of higher doses. Finally, blinding for psychoactive medications is challenging, and given the proportion of participants who correctly guessed their allocation, participant expectancy may also affect these results.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^112S8Sg5]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation symptoms are common but remain difficult to predict

First, discontinuation symptoms are common, particularly after abrupt or rapid cessation of medication, except in the case of stimulants. These symptoms generally dampen over time and seem less likely when discontinuation occurs gradually. In general, DS risk is higher for psychotropic drugs with shorter elimination half-lives, such as paroxetine, venlafaxine, clozapine, morphine, oxycodone, lorazepam, and temazepam (Table 1). Nevertheless, estimations of DS prevalence across medication groups are heterogeneous (see also Table 1). A challenge is that DS are often not measured at all, and, if measured, their operationalization varies (e.g. concerning questionnaires, cutoff values, and time points). Moreover, in many blinded studies, medication is abruptly stopped. Thus, current estimations of DS not only reflect the situation following abrupt or very quick cessation, but also include the influence of expectations and patients and clinicians' experiences and may thus be subject to nocebo effects. Finally, it can be challenging to disentangle DS from relapse due to symptom overlap. This may result in DS being misdiagnosed as relapse in discontinuation studies.

Do not discontinue medication too quickly

Second, it is clear that abrupt discontinuation is not only associated with DS, but also entails increased relapse risks. Nevertheless, the optimal period during which medication should be discontinued and the rate of dose reduction are unclear. Pragmatically, discontinuation over months is advisable, but evidence for these strategies is lacking. Gradual lowering of the dose is generally recommended for several reasons. First, relapse may be less severe if a patient is on a medium or low dose relative to discontinuation. Second, steady-state may be more readily re-achieved if relapse occurs while a patient is on a lower dose. Third, gradual tapering may be more comfortable for patients because of the decreased likelihood of DS. Gradual tapering is often possible using conventional dose regimens, and many patients can discontinue using these existing doses. Nevertheless, when discontinuation poses a greater challenge, a gradual decrease with low doses may be feasible. Another option that becomes apparent across medication classes is the possibility to switch to long-acting agents, e.g. diazepam, sustained-release buprenorphine and fluoxetine (although of the latter intervention only case reports are known). For some medications, e.g. opioids and antipsychotics, (demographic) variables have been associated with successful tapering, but given the lack of replicated findings these are not ready for translation into clinical practice.

### Debate: are stimulant medications for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (against) [^116Fmx6p]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Definition of terms is necessary to address the motion. First, "psychostimulants" are defined as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which inherently are short-acting drugs characterized by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of immediate-release formulations that act for a few hours. Sustained effects across the day can be achieved by controlled-release formulations, but positive carry-over to the next day is not significant, so on subsequent days these medications must be administered again to reinstate pharmacological effects. Second, "effective" refers to treatment-as-usual, whereas "efficacious" refers to enhanced or optimized treatment (that may set a maximum for effectiveness). Magnitude of effectiveness (eg, small, medium, or large effect size) depends on who is treated, how treatment is delivered, what outcome is evaluated, and other factors (including treatment adherence and study design). Third, "long term" refers to a given time frame (eg, 1 year), which can be applied to specify duration of treatment, length of follow-up, or both. Some studies evaluate long-term effectiveness of treatment while it is continued, whereas others evaluate long-term effectiveness of treatment during the follow-up after it is discontinued. Given these definitions, the following questions address long-term effectiveness of stimulant medication.

### Phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia) [^111YYNmT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

QSYMIA contains phentermine, a Schedule IV controlled substance, and topiramate, which is not a controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

Phentermine has a known potential for abuse. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects.

Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs (e.g., phentermine) may be associated with impaired control over drug use and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times higher than recommended. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing QSYMIA as part of a weight reduction and long-term maintenance of body weight program.

9.3 Dependence

Physical dependence may occur in patients treated with QSYMIA. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

The following adverse reactions have been associated with the abrupt discontinuation of the individual components of QSYMIA:

For topiramate, abrupt discontinuation has been associated with seizures in patients without a history of seizures or epilepsy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
For phentermine, abrupt discontinuation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on a sleep electroencephalogram.

Thus, in situations where rapid withdrawal of QSYMIA is required, appropriate medical monitoring is recommended. Patients discontinuing QSYMIA 15 mg/92 mg should be gradually tapered to reduce the possibility of precipitating a seizure [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Benzodiazepine tapering strategies — recommendations for the tapering process specify initial dose-reduction pacing, optional transition to longer-acting medication, individualized adjustments, and monitoring. Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper, and the pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

2.1 Pretreatment Screening

Prior to treating patients with MAS-ER Capsules, assess:

for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome before initiating MAS-ER Capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

2.2 General Administration Information

Individualize the dosage according to the therapeutic needs and response of the patient. Administer MAS-ER Capsules at the lowest effective dosage.

Based on bioequivalence data, patients taking divided doses of immediate-release Adderall, (for example, twice daily), may be switched to MAS-ER Capsules at the same total daily dose taken once daily. Titrate at weekly intervals to appropriate efficacy and tolerability as indicated.

MAS-ER Capsules may be taken whole, or the capsule may be opened and the entire contents sprinkled on applesauce. If the patient is using the sprinkle administration method, the sprinkled applesauce should be consumed immediately; it should not be stored. Patients should take the applesauce with sprinkled beads in its entirety without chewing. The dose of a single capsule should not be divided. The contents of the entire capsule should be taken, and patients should not take anything less than one capsule per day.

MAS-ER Capsules may be taken orally with or without food.

MAS-ER Capsules should be given upon awakening. Afternoon doses should be avoided because of the potential for insomnia.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^115cKWxp]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

What shall I do if a patient does not respond to psychostimulants?

Following poor response to two psychostimulants (methylphenidate, MPH and amphetamines, AMPH – including lisdexamfetamine, LDX), some clinicians would consider second- or third-line approved compounds, unlicensed medications for ADHD, or combinations of different agents. However, a number of factors should be assessed before switching to alternative medications or using polypharmacy. Indeed, it should be highlighted that the majority of patients with ADHD respond to one or both classes of psychostimulants, when used properly. A comparative review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that approximately 41% of children treated with immediate-release stimulants responded equally well to AMPH or MPH, 28% responded better to AMPH, 16% had a better response to MPH and 15% did not respond to either medication. A more recent review concluded that approximately 91% of individuals with ADHD respond to either or both class of stimulants. (We note that, as RCTs often exclude participants with specific comorbidities that decrease the rate of response, the response rate in patients seen in daily clinical practice may be lower.) Therefore, before considering alternative agents and/or polypharmacy, the following should be considered: (a) Have I titrated properly? While some patients will respond well to low or moderate doses, others will need higher ones, regardless of their age and weight. Of note, meta-analytic evidence from flexible-dose trials for both MPH and AMPH demonstrated increased efficacy and reduced likelihood of discontinuations for any reason with increasing stimulant doses; (b) Is this drug/preparation working well at any times during the day or do I need to change the dose or preparation to get a more comprehensive coverage? Sometimes, poor response may be detected only in specific periods of the day, when the medication effect has worn off; (c) Am I targeting the right symptoms? Psychostimulants are in general highly efficacious/effective on the core symptoms of ADHD (i.e. inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), not necessarily on other problems (e.g. oppositional behaviour/emotional dysregulation); (d) Is the patient showing tolerance? Evidence from clinical studies, for example, shows the need to increase the dose of stimulants over time in order to maintain therapeutic response. Additionally, neuroimaging studies (e.g. PET studies;) point to an increase in dopamine reuptake receptors in adults with ADHD treated for up to 12 months with stimulants. This evidence suggests that tolerance may happen during treatment with psychostimulants, even though more research is needed to gain a better understanding of the exact percentage of patients who develop tolerance, their clinical characteristics and how to manage tolerance effectively. Some experts, for example, suggest decreasing the dose or temporarily (for a few weeks) stop the psychostimulant to overcome the tolerance issues; (e) What else is going on in patient's life/family life? A comprehensive formulation, beyond diagnosis, is key here; (f) Have I missed any comorbidity? Some comorbidities, for example, autism spectrum disorder, are associated with lower chances of response; (g) Is the diagnosis correct?

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^111vUEjv]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medication discontinuation in children and adolescents — Prescribers are generally encouraged to taper medication slowly to avoid withdrawal symptoms or rebound worsening of symptoms, and gradual tapering may also be prudent if it is unclear whether the current medication is having a beneficial effect. Discontinuation of effective medications may result in an unexpected and unmonitored return of symptoms after discharge. At this time, there are little or no data to suggest which medication to remove first in children who are taking multiple medications, and given the lack of data, the examples follow general clinical reasoning. If a child is on two medications, one for the underlying disorder and the second to manage side effects of the first, it is likely that the first to be removed is the one used to manage side effects. When anticholinergic medication is used with an antipsychotic to reduce risk for extrapyramidal symptoms during initial treatment, it may be possible to discontinue anticholinergic medication after the child is stabilized on the antipsychotic; however, if ongoing management of extrapyramidal symptoms is needed, it would be prudent to maintain the anticholinergic medication well after the antipsychotic is discontinued to prevent the delayed emergence of extrapyramidal symptoms. If a child is on two medications for two disorders, the first medication to be removed is for the disorder that is more likely to go into remission or which is less severe or impairing, with examples that it would be reasonable to consider tapering the antidepressant first after an extended period without depressive symptoms, or that it might be more appropriate to discontinue the stimulant first if attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was mild and never impairing until the child became depressed. In all cases, the role of the underlying and most severe condition and the sequence and rationale for which medications were combined contribute to the plan for discontinuation of multiple medications in children.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113vUkGX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — schedule options and feasibility indicate that evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. Clinical trial experience notes that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given benzodiazepine (BZD), reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging, and although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies and should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies; for example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117WZCH8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — preparation, pacing, dependence-adjusted cadence, and monitoring — emphasize safety and individualized adjustments. Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper, and clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD. Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e., 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns, and for further reductions clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate. For patients likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g., those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper, whereas clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e., 10–25%) for patients unlikely to have significant physical dependence (e.g., lower dose for a shorter period [e.g., less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated. Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction and should monitor for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD; virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose. Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.

### Pentazocine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride [^111Nbi6y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.

When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see WARNINGS/Withdrawal, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE].

Stimulant intoxication and withdrawal — initial assessment recommendations state that the clinical examination should first identify any acute concerns and complications that would indicate the patient requires a higher level of care, and this includes an assessment of hyperadrenergic symptoms, including tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and agitation (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). The initial clinical examination when evaluating for suspected stimulant intoxication or withdrawal should include a clinical interview (as feasible), physical examination, observation of signs and patient-reported symptoms, review of any available collateral information, and a safety assessment of the patient's risk of harm to self and others (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^115Rvfbi]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There are potential limitations to the interpretation of the dose-response curves from PET studies. First, individual variation may not have been captured by the relatively small sample sizes. However, the shape of the dose-activity curve (ie, hyperbolic) should be the same for each individual, suggesting that hyperbolic dose reduction regimes should be universally applicable. It should also be noted that there is some heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of PET studiesindicating the likelihood of interindividual differences in receptor occupancy for a given dose, emphasizing the importance of individualized tapering guided by the patient's response to reductions.

Second, it is difficult to determine whether D 2 occupancy will linearly correspond to withdrawal effects. There is a body of evidence that suggests that a minimum threshold of D 2 antagonism is required before a clinical effect or adverse effects are seen; this may also apply to withdrawal effects. However, a recent meta-analysis has found a continuous hyperbolic relationship between antipsychotic dose and clinical response, mirroring the relationship between dose and D 2 occupancy. One meta-analysis found evidence of a positive linear relationship between clinical improvement and D 2 receptor occupancy (when patients taking quetiapine and clozapine, thought to act through mechanisms other than D 2 antagonism, and outliers with very high dopaminergic blockade were excluded). Evidence of a linear relationship between D 2 antagonism and therapeutic effects may extend to withdrawal effects, but this requires further investigation.

Third, although the principal therapeutic effects of antipsychotics are attributed to D 2 antagonism, other receptor targets, including 5HT 2 and 5HT 1A, have also been thought relevant, and these receptors, and others, such as cholinergic receptors, may also determine withdrawal effects. Therefore, tapering according to the binding affinity of receptor subtypes other than D 2 receptorsmay be indicated with some antipsychotics. This limitation may apply particularly to clozapine because it acts partly through non-dopaminergic? pathways, and it demonstrates the lowest correlation between plasma levels and D 2 occupancy of commonly used antipsychotics. However, dose reduction schedules using alternative receptor dose-response curves follow similar hyperbolically reducing dosing schedules because these relationships also follow the law of mass action.

### A practical guide to the therapy of narcolepsy and hypersomnia syndromes [^115MBBKk]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Table 2
Therapeutic Protocols for Commonly Prescribed Narcolepsy Treatments

Amphetamines have complex pharmacological effects that are dose dependent and not fully characterized. Amphetamines substitute for monoamines at the level of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), disrupting granular storage of monoamine through a reserpine-like effect and increasing cytosolic dopamine. Next, they substitute for monoamines at the level of monoaminergic transporters (notably the dopamine reuptake site [DAT]), and not only inhibit reuptake, but also enter the presynaptic synapse while creating a paradoxal reverse efflux of monoamines through the same transporter. Finally, amphetamines can also inhibit the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes at very high doses. These complex actions are not without consequences, as high doses of amphetamines are cytotoxic for monoaminergic neurons in animals, an effect mostly documented with MDMA and serotoninergic synapses, but also present with regular amphetamines and dopaminergic transmission. The stepwise recruitment of additional effects on monoamine transmission likely explains the high efficacy of these compounds. Amphetamines are exceptionally wake-promoting, and at high doses also reduce cataplexy in narcoleptic patients, an effect best explained by its action on adrenergic and serotoninergic synapses.

Amphetamines are water-soluble (thus risk of diversion to intravenous administration) and very potent wake-promoting compounds. The pharmacokinetics for each isomer is different, with a primarily urinary elimination that is favored at high urinary pH, decreasing half-life. As for other stimulants (i.e. methylphenidate and modafinil), the formulation and type of salt used in each preparation is almost as important as the milligram dosage and isomer composition. Notably, due to its use in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a countless number of slow or extended-release formulations are available, increasing duration of action from a few hours (3–6 for D-amphetamine) to 12 hours or more. Slow-release formulations also slow down absorption, reducing peak concentration after administration, a property that reduces the "rush" or "quick" effects of nonextended-release formulation. The rapid rise in concentration, rush effects, and rapid on–off changes in dopamine released are likely important contributors to the addictive potential of amphetamines. Amphetamines can be addictive, leading patients to feel unreasonably anxious or unwilling to stop, also seeking the drug at ever-increasing doses.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115z74DU]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Continuing High-Dosage Opioids

Clinicians should closely monitor patients who are unable to taper and who continue on high-dosage or otherwise high-risk opioid regimens (e.g. opioids prescribed concurrently with benzodiazepines) and should work with patients to mitigate overdose risk (e.g. by providing overdose education and naloxone) (see Recommendation 8). Clinicians can use periodic and strategic motivational questions and statements to encourage movement toward appropriate therapeutic changes.

Management of chronic pain with opioids can be challenging, as can management of opioid discontinuation. However, clinicians have a responsibility to provide or arrange for coordinated management of patients' pain and opioid-related challenges. Payers and health systems should not use this clinical practice guideline to set rigid standards related to dosage or duration of opioid therapy and should ensure that policies based on cautionary dosage thresholds do not result in rapid tapers or abrupt discontinuation of opioids, do not penalize clinicians for accepting new patients who are receiving opioids for chronic pain, and do not provide incentives to clinicians to implement rapid tapering. Patients prescribed opioids but unable to access ongoing care might be at risk for abrupt opioid discontinuation and might miss opportunities to receive life-saving interventions, including monitoring for and management of mental health and substance use comorbidities.

Recommendation 6

When opioids are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).

### Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^113Qj6RN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset disorder characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD can persist into adulthood and can affects individuals' social and occupational functioning, as well as their quality of life and health. ADHD is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as substance use disorders and anxiety and affective disorders. Amphetamines are used to treat adults with ADHD, but uncertainties about their efficacy and safety remain.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy and safety of amphetamines for adults with ADHD.

Search Methods

In August 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, 10 other databases, and two trials registers, and we ran citation searches for included studies. We also contacted the corresponding authors of all included studies, other experts in the field, and the pharmaceutical company, Shire, and we searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews for other published, unpublished, or ongoing studies. For each included study, we performed a citation search in Web of Science to identify any later studies that may have cited it.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of amphetamines (at any dose) for ADHD in adults aged 18 years and over against placebo or an active intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data from each included study. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) and the risk ratio (RR) to assess continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. We conducted a stratified analysis to determine the influence of moderating variables. We assessed trials for risk of bias and drew a funnel plot to investigate the possibility of publication bias. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, which yielded high, moderate, low, or very low quality ratings based on evaluation of within-trial risk of bias, directness of evidence, heterogeneity of data; precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias.

Main Results

We included 19 studies that investigated three types of amphetamines: dexamphetamine (10.2 mg/d to 21.8 mg/d), lisdexamfetamine (30 mg/d to 70 mg/d), and mixed amphetamine salts (MAS; 12.5 mg/d to 80 mg/d). These studies enrolled 2521 participants; most were middle-aged (35.3 years), Caucasian males (57.2%), with a combined type of ADHD (78.8%). Eighteen studies were conducted in the United States, and one study was conducted in both Canada and the United States. Ten were multi-site studies. All studies were placebo-controlled, and three also included an active comparator: guanfacine, modafinil, or paroxetine. Most studies had short-term follow-up and a mean study length of 5.3 weeks. We found no studies that had low risk of bias in all domains of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, mainly because amphetamines have powerful subjective effects that may reveal the assigned treatment, but also because we noted attrition bias, and because we could not rule out the possibility of a carry-over effect in studies that used a cross-over design. Sixteen studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, one study was publicly funded, and two studies did not report their funding sources. Amphetamines versus placeboSeverity of ADHD symptoms: we found low- to very low-quality evidence suggesting that amphetamines reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians (SMD -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.04 to -0.75; 13 studies, 2028 participants) and patients (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.28; six studies, 120 participants). Retention: overall, we found low-quality evidence suggesting that amphetamines did not improve retention in treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13; 17 studies, 2323 participants). Adverse events: we found that amphetamines were associated with an increased proportion of patients who withdrew because of adverse events (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.63 to 4.45; 17 studies, 2409 participants). Type of amphetamine: we found differences between amphetamines for the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians. Both lisdexamfetamine (SMD -1.06, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.85; seven studies, 896 participants; low-quality evidence) and MAS (SMD -0.80, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.66; five studies, 1083 participants; low-quality evidence) reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms. In contrast, we found no evidence to suggest that dexamphetamine reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.32; one study, 49 participants; very low-quality evidence). In addition, all amphetamines were efficacious in reducing the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by patients (dexamphetamine: SMD -0.77, 95% CI -1.14 to -0.40; two studies, 35 participants; low-quality evidence; lisdexamfetamine: SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.01; three studies, 67 participants; low-quality evidence; MAS: SMD -0.45, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.12; one study, 18 participants; very low-quality evidence). Dose at study completion: different doses of amphetamines did not appear to be associated with differences in efficacy. Type of drug-release formulation: we investigated immediate- and sustained-release formulations but found no differences between them for any outcome. Amphetamines versus other drugsWe found no evidence that amphetamines improved ADHD symptom severity compared to other drug interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Amphetamines improved the severity of ADHD symptoms, as assessed by clinicians or patients, in the short term but did not improve retention to treatment. Amphetamines were associated with higher attrition due to adverse events. The short duration of studies coupled with their restrictive inclusion criteria limits the external validity of these findings. Furthermore, none of the included studies had an overall low risk of bias. Overall, the evidence generated by this review is of low or very low quality.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^112bNzVM]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

In the absence of direct data in humans of the time taken for dopamine D 2 receptor adaptations to resolve, we can be guided by observations that TD improves over 2–3 years, and this is the same time period over which relapse rates of patients discontinued from medication takes to converge with relapse rates of patients maintained on medication, suggesting that this may be a reasonable time period over which to taper patients who have received long-term antipsychotics.

There is some support for this time period for tapering in small studies examining tolerable rates of discontinuation. One study has investigated reducing antipsychotics in patients with remitted psychosis by 25% of the most recent dose every 6 months (a logarithmic pattern that closely approximates hyperbolic dose reductions), with 3 quarters of patients able to achieve between 25% and 71.4% dose reduction without relapse in the first year of the study. Another pilot study found that patients with chronic schizophrenia who, on average, achieved a 42% reduction in antipsychotic dose over 6 months demonstrated no difference in relapse rates from patients maintained on antipsychotics. This suggests that many patients may tolerate dose reductions of 25%–50% of the most recent dose (corresponding approximately to 5–10 percentage point decrements of D 2 occupancy) every 3–6 months. Smaller reductions (such as 10% of the most recent dose) made every month may be more tolerable in the aim of producing more "evenly spread" perturbation to the equilibrium.

There is likely to be considerable interindividual variability in this process, with patients able to tolerate greatly varying rates of reduction: given the data on time for TD to resolve, some long-term treated patients may need longer periods, and some first-episode patients or those treated for briefer periods may tolerate shorter tapering periods. However, we suggest that, even in quicker tapering protocols, tapering should follow a hyperbolic course to "evenly spread" change at receptors. If the reason for discontinuation is pressing, such as a severe adverse reaction, such schedules may need to be much quicker, acknowledging the increased risk of withdrawal symptoms. In patients with poor compliance, such prolonged tapers will be challenging, although a reduced adverse effect burden and the possibility of discontinuation may enhance engagement with the process.

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^113FwTgp]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Adverse Events Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation in Treatment of Panic Disorder in Placebo-Controlled Trials

In a larger database comprised of both controlled and uncontrolled studies in which 641 patients received alprazolam, discontinuation-emergent symptoms which occurred at a rate of over 5% in patients treated with alprazolam and at a greater rate than the placebo-treated group were as follows:

From the studies cited, it has not been determined whether these symptoms are clearly related to the dose and duration of therapy with alprazolam in patients with panic disorder. There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam (see WARNINGS).

To discontinue treatment in patients taking NIRAVAM®, the dosage should be reduced slowly in keeping with good medical practice. It is suggested that the daily dosage of NIRAVAM®be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117BBiTo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — care coordination, consolidation, and assessment advise that prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions, and clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper. A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of a given patient developing withdrawal symptoms during the taper and the anticipated severity of those symptoms, noting that BZD withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and sleep problems to seizures and delirium.

### Transition from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder – a preliminary tolerability and efficacy study [^1137vBQh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The primary treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been psychostimulants. Recently developed nonpsychostimulant treatments have allowed certain patients to switch from a psychostimulant to a nonpsychostimulant. However, the outcomes of such switches have not been systematically studied.

Objective

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess treatment tolerance and efficacy during a cross-taper transition from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine among children and adolescents with ADHD.

Methods

This pilot study was conducted in patients (aged 6–17 years) with incomplete responses (failure to obtain full reduction/elimination of symptoms) or intolerance of adverse events (AEs) during psychostimulant treatment. Patients continued ongoing psychostimulant treatment during the first week of the study. Transition to atomoxetine began by administering atomoxetine 0.5 mg/kg. d plus full-dose psychostimulant for 1 week, followed in the second week by 1.2 mg/kg. d atomoxetine plus half-dose psychostimulant. Patients remained on 1.2 mg/kg. d atomoxetine monotherapy for the remaining 5 weeks. This stepwise transition was enacted due to the difference in pharmacodynamics between the psychostimulants and atomoxetine. Applying a stepwise cross-titration allowed for better control of ADHD symptoms during the intervening period. Change in ADHD symptoms, as measured by the mean change in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator-administered and -scored (ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv), was assessed from baseline to end point.

Results

Of the 62 subjects enrolled in the study, 39 (62.9%) were diagnosed as ADHD-combined type. Similar proportions were receiving methylphenidate (51.6%) and amphetamine (48.4%). Slightly more wished to switch due to inadequate response (53.2%) than intolerability (46.8%). Nine subjects discontinued at various times during the course of the study (patient or parent/caregiver decision [4], AE [2], protocol violation [2], and lack of efficacy [1]). Mean (SD) ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv total scores (n = 59, last-observation-carried-forward) improved significantly from baseline (visit 2) to an end point (32.1 [10.5] vs 22.6 [14.0]; P < 0.001). Of the 58 subjects answering in the atomoxetine monotherapy phase, 38 (65.5%) reported a preference for atomoxetine treatment over their previous psychostimulant. Tolerability results were as follows: 26 (44.1%) of 59 patients reported ≥ 1 AE, the most common being somnolence (4 [6.8%]), fatigue (3 [5.1%]), decreased appetite (3 [5.1%]), cough (3 [5.1%]), headache (3 [5.1%]), and contact dermatitis (2 [3.4%]). No clinically severe AEs were reported. Both mean (SD) diastolic (2.4 [7.8] mm Hg; P = 0.031) and systolic (2.4 [7.9] mm Hg; P = 0.029) blood pressures increased significantly from baseline to end point. Electrocardiography revealed a significant increase in mean (SD) heart rate (9.2 [11.6] bpm; P < 0.001) and a corresponding decrease in mean (SD) RR interval (-77.8 [98.2] ms; P < 0.001). Statistically significant, but mild, increases in diastolic pressure and heart rate were observed.

Conclusion

These children and adolescent patients were successfully switched from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine treatment, with resulting improvement in ADHD symptom severity from baseline in this pilot study.

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^1169TpAz]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Principle 13 — Discontinuing medication in children requires a specific plan explains that more is known about starting medication than about how long to treat and how best to discontinue, and that a thoughtful and safe plan for medication discontinuation is as important as a thoughtful and safe plan for starting medications. Discontinuation may occur because the patient seems to have recovered, because side effects make continued use untenable (e.g., weight gain, concerns about growth or the development of involuntary movements), or because the current prescriber believes the medication is not warranted or is no longer effective. The prescriber is encouraged to obtain the history of previous psychiatric symptoms and response to medication, starting with the patient and family, with review of medical records and discussion with previous prescribers also useful; collateral history may be critical, and reviewing the history is especially important to avoid a needless and unexpected return of symptoms. Developing a monitoring plan for a discontinuation trial is also critical; although it may take only hours to days to identify return of hyperactivity symptoms in a child with ADHD off stimulants, a more extended period may be required for the inattentive subtype, and patients with mood and anxiety disorders may have a return of symptoms weeks to months after the last dose; discontinuation in inpatient or partial hospital settings with short lengths of stay may be particularly problematic.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1172otGa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering versus abrupt discontinuation — comparative evidence and guidance: "If patients are at risk of withdrawal, the medication should be tapered rather than abruptly discontinued". In limited evidence, "the systematic review identified two RCTs with 70 participants that compared a BZD taper to abrupt cessation"; "Both RCTs had an unclear risk of bias", and although labeled gradual "the taper duration was only 7–8 days". There was "no difference in the rate of complete BZD discontinuation, return to BZD use after a period of discontinuation, delirium, or study completion", but the taper group had "significantly less severe BZD withdrawal and insomnia symptoms after 4 days, and up to 4 weeks". The CCG agreed that benefits of tapering are "likely to outweigh the risks of abrupt discontinuation, especially when using more gradual tapering strategies".

Risk factors for relapse or DS following discontinuation

To our knowledge, based on a systematic review, no consistent empirical evidence links patient characteristics to predicting DS, including residual symptoms, number of prior episodes, and duration of antidepressant use. Length of antidepressant use has been suggested to be a risk factor for some antidepressants, though the data are inconsistent. Possible predictors of relapse following discontinuation are effort-reward decision time and cognitive reactivity, the latter being the most consistent predictor independent of residual symptoms. However, these predictors have not been firmly established.

When to discontinue?

Most guidelines recommend to continue antidepressants for at least 4–6 months after successful acute-phase therapy in patients with first-episode MDD to prevent relapse, and longer periods after recurrent MDD. Nevertheless, there is little evidence supporting a minimum duration of antidepressant treatment after stable remission. Patients with recurrent MDD should stay on treatment longer and sometimes indefinitely.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Consensus supports slow discontinuation of antidepressants, but few randomized studies have compared discontinuation strategies. Most studies employ a rather rapid 2-week tapering period with at most two steps. Compared to abrupt discontinuation, 1–3-week tapering schedules lower DS frequency. Although hyperbolic tapering, which involves decreasing relative dose reductions over time (Supplementary Text), is supported by expert opinion, it lacks evidence. Given the heterogeneity of DS between antidepressants and individual patient variation, general advice would be to slowly taper in those taking antidepressants for longer periods of time (e.g. years), and antidepressants with higher DS risk.

Dose reduction

A meta-analysis of five randomized trials found that dose reductions of phenelzine, maprotiline, imipramine, amineptine, and paroxetine increased the risk of MDD relapse by 62% relative to the group randomized to unchanged continuation.

Discontinuation interventions

A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials found no significant difference in time to depression relapse between patients receiving psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) during or after antidepressant tapering, compared to those who continued with antidepressant maintenance therapy only. Another meta-analysis of 12 RCTs showed that MDD patients receiving psychotherapy during antidepressant treatment or tapering had a lower rate of relapse compared to those receiving active controls (antidepressant treatment) or treatment as usual. In conclusion, a (preventive) psychotherapy is as effective as antidepressant maintenance.

2.1 Acute Treatment

Dosing
of children and adolescents up to 70 kg body weight — STRATTERA should
be initiated at a total daily dose of approximately 0.5 mg/kg
and increased after a minimum of 3 days to a target total
daily dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg administered either
as a single daily dose in the morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning
and late afternoon/early evening. No additional benefit has been demonstrated
for doses higher than 1.2 mg/kg/day [see Clinical
Studies (14)].

The total daily dose in children and adolescents should not
exceed 1.4 mg/kg or 100 mg, whichever is
less.

Dosing
of children and adolescents over 70 kg body weight and adults — STRATTERA should
be initiated at a total daily dose of 40 mg and increased
after a minimum of 3 days to a target total daily dose of
approximately 80 mg administered either as a single daily
dose in the morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon/early
evening. After 2 to 4 additional
weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 100 mg in
patients who have not achieved an optimal response. There are no data that
support increased effectiveness at higher doses [see Clinical
Studies (14)].

The maximum recommended total daily dose in children and adolescents
over 70 kg and adults is 100 mg.

2.2 Maintenance/Extended Treatment

It is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. The benefit of maintaining pediatric patients (ages 6–15 years) with ADHD on STRATTERA after achieving a response in a dose range of 1.2 to 1.8 mg/kg/day was demonstrated in a controlled trial. Patients assigned to STRATTERA in the maintenance phase were generally continued on the same dose used to achieve a response in the open label phase. The physician who elects to use STRATTERA for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

2.3 General Dosing Information

STRATTERA may
be taken with or without food.

STRATTERA can
be discontinued without being tapered.

STRATTERA capsules are not intended to be opened,
they should be taken whole [see Patient Counseling Information (17.6)].

The safety of single doses over 120 mg and
total daily doses above 150 mg have not been systematically
evaluated.

Benzodiazepine tapering — adjusting strategy and handling interruptions describes that tapering strategies should be adjusted when patients experience significant symptoms related to the taper, with options including slowing the pace, making smaller dose reductions, and/or pausing; clinicians should generally avoid going back up to a previous dose but can consider resuming the previous dose until patients stabilize; the guideline defines pausing (remain at the current dose until symptoms stabilize, then continue reductions) and maintaining (adjust to a lower dose and remain on that lower dose as a partial taper) when the risks of continuing taper outweigh benefits; the dose should be maintained at the reduced level and dose increases avoided unless absolutely necessary, noting that the harms of benzodiazepines are dose-dependent and that maintaining at a lower dose may reduce current risk such that risks no longer outweigh benefits.

Management of Severe or Complicated Withdrawal Symptoms

Recommendations for Management of Severe or Complicated Withdrawal Symptoms
12 Clinicians should manage patients experiencing severe or complicated withdrawal in inpatient or residential medically managed settings (e.g. residential withdrawal management program) with: a Monitoring for signs and symptoms of BZD withdrawal, including regularly measuring vital signs and using structured assessment tools (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation) b Assessments for seizure risk and managed as appropriate (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

13 Tapering with very long-acting agents such as phenobarbital: a Can be considered for BZD withdrawal management in inpatient settings (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). b Should only be conducted by or in consultation with clinicians experienced in the use of these agents for the purpose of BZD withdrawal management (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
14 Clinicians should avoid rapid BZD reversal agents such as flumazenil for the purpose of BZD tapering due to risks for refractory seizure, cardiac dysrhythmias, and other adverse effects (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
15 Clinicians should avoid general anesthetics such as propofol or ketamine for the purpose of BZD tapering (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Tapering initiated in an inpatient or residential medically managed level of care may be continued in a less intensive level of care once it is safe to do so.
When tapering with very long-acting agents, discharge planning should include an outpatient follow-up appointment, ideally within 7 days. Clinicians should assess patients for ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD, including re-emergence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed. Clinicians should consider medications and/or behavioral interventions to address ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD.

### Determine tapering rate… [^115DUZ2G]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

4 Tapering The deliberate and gradual reduction of medication dosage over a period of time to provide the body with an opportunity to adjust to the decreasing dosage, thereby reducing the likelihood of withdrawal symptoms and other negative consequences associated with abrupt cessation of a medication. This process is often implemented for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, reducing the dosage of opioids to minimize side effects, or discontinuing the use of opioids completely. Evidence to support specific tapering rates is limited. The rate of tapering should be individualized based on the patient's clinical situation. Select each tab to learn more about recommended strategies for determining tapering rate. When opioids are reduced or discontinued, a taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal should be used.

Tapers of approximately 10% per month or slower are likely to be better tolerated than more rapid tapers, when patients have been taking opioids for longer durations. 1 When patients have taken opioids for shorter durations, a decrease of 10% of the original dose per week or slower is less likely to trigger withdrawal. 9 and can be successful for some patients. Slow/Pause Taper, When Needed Clinically significant opioid withdrawal symptoms can signal the need to slow the rate or pause the taper. At times, tapers might have to be paused and then restarted when the patient is ready. Tapers might have to be slowed as patients reach low dosages to allow gradual accommodation to lower opioid dosages and development of new skills for nonopioid management of pain and emotional distress.

Avoid Abrupt or Rapid Tapers Unless there are indications of a life-threatening issue, such as warning signs of impending overdose, opioid therapy should not be discontinued abruptly, and clinicians should not rapidly reduce opioid dosages from higher dosages. Sudden discontinuation might precipitate substantial opioid withdrawal. 17 Rapid tapering or sudden discontinuation of opioids in physically dependent patients also can increase risks for psychological distress and opioid-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations.
