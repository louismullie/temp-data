## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for malignant neoplasm of the rectum?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for malignant neoplasm of the rectum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10-CM category for rectal malignancies. Then, I should verify whether a specific subcode is required or if the parent code suffices. Next, I will cross-check multiple authoritative sources to confirm consistency. Finally, I will consider common pitfalls like rectosigmoid junction coding and ensure the answer is precise and clinically usable.

> Let me first confirm the parent code. Multiple high-quality sources consistently identify C20 as the ICD-10-CM code for malignant neoplasm of the rectum, including a recent multi-center cohort study using administrative claims and a Canadian registry analysis of rectal cancer incidence, which both explicitly code rectal cancer as C20 [^acd29d48] [^c8579e8a].

> Wait, let me verify whether a more specific subcode is needed. I initially thought C20.9 might be required, but hold on, I should verify the ICD-10-CM structure. In ICD-10-CM, C20 is the standalone code for malignant neoplasm of the rectum; there is no mandatory subcategory like C20.0 or C20.9 for rectum specifically, so C20 alone is correct and sufficient for billing and epidemiology in most contexts [^acd29d48] [^c8579e8a].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating rectum with rectosigmoid junction. The rectosigmoid junction is coded separately as C19, and several large studies distinguish C19 (rectosigmoid) from C20 (rectum), reinforcing that C20 applies strictly to the rectum and not the rectosigmoid junction [^c8579e8a] [^515a9224].

> Next, I should review corroborating sources to avoid a single-study bias. Population-based analyses and cohort studies repeatedly use C20 to define rectal cancer, including Danish registry work and German cohorts, which strengthens confidence that C20 is the standard code across systems and geographies [^560aa066] [^39ab4464].

> But wait, what if the documentation specifies laterality or subsite detail? ICD-10-CM does not require laterality for rectal cancer as it does for some other sites, so C20 remains appropriate even when detailed anatomic descriptors are recorded; if a study or registry prefers more granular ICD-O-3 topography, C20.9 may appear, yet for ICD-10-CM diagnosis coding, C20 is the correct and complete code [^acd29d48] [^e1299b10].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for malignant neoplasm of the rectum is C20 [^acd29d48] [^c8579e8a].

The ICD-10-CM code for malignant neoplasm of the rectum is **C20**. This code is used for primary rectal adenocarcinoma and other malignant rectal tumors, excluding the rectosigmoid junction (C19) and colon (C18). Accurate coding with **C20** is essential for billing, epidemiology, and clinical documentation [^acd29d48] [^c8579e8a].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for malignant neoplasm of rectum

The specific ICD-10-CM code for malignant neoplasm of the rectum is **C20**. This code encompasses primary malignant tumors originating in the rectum, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and other rare malignancies [^acd29d48].

---

## Clinical significance and usage

The **C20** code is widely used in clinical practice, research, and epidemiological studies to identify and track rectal cancer cases. It is essential for:

- **Billing and reimbursement**: Ensures accurate billing for rectal cancer diagnoses and treatments [^fb8d01f8].
- **Clinical documentation**: Facilitates clear communication among healthcare providers regarding the diagnosis and management of rectal cancer.
- **Epidemiological research**: Enables researchers to analyze incidence, prevalence, and outcomes of rectal cancer in populations [^c8579e8a].

---

## Differentiation from related ICD-10-CM codes

It is important to differentiate the **C20** code from related ICD-10-CM codes that denote malignancies in adjacent anatomical regions:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Anatomical location** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| C18 | Colon | Malignant neoplasm of colon |
| C19 | Rectosigmoid junction | Malignant neoplasm of rectosigmoid junction |
| C20 | Rectum | Malignant neoplasm of rectum |

---

Accurate coding is essential to distinguish rectal cancer (**C20**) from colon cancer (**C18**) and rectosigmoid junction cancer (**C19**), as these entities have different clinical implications, treatment strategies, and prognoses [^acd29d48].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis and coding for rectal cancer. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provide comprehensive guidelines on the management of rectal cancer, including diagnostic evaluation, staging, surgical management, and adjuvant therapies [^3bd748b3] [^e4c900f9]. Accurate coding with **C20** aligns with these guidelines and ensures appropriate patient care and follow-up.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for malignant neoplasm of the rectum is **C20**. This code is essential for accurate clinical documentation, billing, and epidemiological research. It distinguishes rectal cancer from colon and rectosigmoid junction cancers, thereby supporting appropriate clinical decision-making and patient management [^acd29d48] [^c8579e8a].

Study design

This retrospective, multi‐centre observational study utilised data from a hospital‐based administrative claims database. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD‐10‐CM) code C20 was used to identify cases of malignant neoplasm of the rectum. Tumour staging was based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer‐Union for International Cancer Control Tumour, Node, Metastasis (AJCC–UICC TNM) staging system (8th edition).

In cases where multiple tumours were diagnosed simultaneously, the tumour with the highest TNM stage was selected for analysis. Patients with incomplete medical records or those who underwent concurrent surgeries were excluded. The rectal resections analysed in this study were defined as low anterior resection (LAR) and abdominoperineal resection (APR), according to Japanese insurance criteria. RARR, laparoscopic rectal resection (LRR), and open rectal resection (ORR) were also identified using the 10th Revision (ICD‐10) code C20. If a laparoscopic or robot‐assisted procedure was converted to an open resection, the case was considered as having undergone open resection. The dataset did not include information on tumour location (measured in centimetres from the anal verge), extent of lymph node dissection or creation of diverting stomas. Only the first diagnosed tumour was included in the analysis of patients diagnosed with multiple primary colorectal tumours.

Data collected

The following data were collected and used as baseline characteristics for the analysis: sex, age, body mass index (BMI), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), clinical TNM stage, neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy status, type of surgery, hospital category, total hospitalisation cost and follow‐up duration. Post‐operative complications included anastomotic leakage, septic shock, peritonitis, intra‐abdominal bleeding, ileus, intestinal ischaemia, surgical site infection, dysuria, urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, venous thrombosis and cerebrovascular disease. These complications were identified using ICD‐10‐CM codes.

Study outcomes

The primary outcomes were 5‐year overall survival (OS) and 5‐year relapse‐free survival (RFS) among the three surgical approaches. The secondary outcomes were short‐term outcomes, including 30‐day complication rates, 30‐day re‐operation rates, 30‐day readmission rates, 30‐ and 90‐day mortality rates, total hospitalisation cost, peri‐operative outcomes and 5‐year local recurrence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Eligibility criteria

All patients with colon or rectal cancer (International Classification of Diseases (ICD) ninth edition codes 153 and 154, respectively) within 5 years of diagnosis were deemed eligible for the study. To ensure that data and samples were only collected from bona fide adenocarcinoma cases histological confirmation of disease was a prerequisite. The upper limit was initially 75 years at diagnosis, but this was subsequently reduced to 69 years in the light of excellent ascertainment to increase the proportion of younger patients whose cancers are more likely to be due to inherited susceptibility. Coupled with patient recruitment, spouses/partners who had no known past or current history of malignancy were invited to participate for the purposes of contributing to the generation of a control series. No age limit was imposed for these individuals.

### Survival from cancer of the rectum in england and wales up to 2001 [^515a9224]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Rectal cancer is the fifth most frequent cancer in both sexes combined in England and Wales. It is less common than colon cancer, but incidence trends during the 1990s were similar. Improvements in survival have been slower in the United Kingdom than elsewhere in western Europe. There was a substantial deprivation gradient in survival for patients diagnosed with rectal cancer in England and Wales up to 1990, with patients in the most affluent group having 1-year and 5-year relative survival 5–7% higher than those in the most deprived group, even after adjustment for differences and trends in background mortality between these socioeconomic groups.

Almost 156 000 patients were registered with cancer of the rectum (rectum (ICD-10 C20) and rectosigmoid junction (C19)) in England and Wales during the 14-year period 1986–1999, with a male–female sex ratio of 1.4 (range 1.3–1.6 between the eight English regions and Wales). Annual incidence rates in each deprivation category ranged from 16 to 20 per 100 000 during the 1990s, with no clear socioeconomic gradient. The proportion of rectal tumours recorded as adenocarcinoma increased from 65 to 75% by 1999, but a commensurate fall in the proportion of poorly specified carcinomas (from 25 to 15%) suggests that the quality of pathology data has improved, and the true proportion of adenocarcinoma was approximately 75% throughout the 1990s. Squamous carcinoma represented 4% of rectal tumours, unchanged since the late 1980s. Information on the stage of rectal cancer at diagnosis was not available in the national cancer registry before 1995, and stage-specific analyses for the period 1986–1999 were thus not possible. Approximately 7% of patients (regional range 2–12%) who were otherwise eligible for analysis were excluded because they were registered solely from a death certificate, so their duration of survival was unknown (zero recorded survival: date of diagnosis the same as the date of death). The proportion of cases with zero recorded survival was similar in all socioeconomic groups (5–6%, data not shown), however, so exclusions from analysis are unlikely to have had any impact on socioeconomic gradients in survival, or on changes in that gradient with time. The vital status of 2% of patients was unknown, and a further 3% were excluded because the rectal cancer was not their first primary malignancy. In all, 132 602 patients were included in the analyses (87.8% of those eligible).

Methods

Registries and Coding Classifications

Complete historical incidence data for colon cancer (codes C18.0, C18.2–18.9, and C26.0 from International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10]) and rectal cancer (codes C19 and C20 from ICD-10) were collected from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (1969–1992) and the Canadian Cancer Registry (1992–2015) in May 2018. The Canadian Cancer Registry maintains and collects data on cancer cases that are submitted by individual registries in Canadian provinces and territories. Reporting cancer cases is a legislated responsibility of the provinces and territories, which ensures high-quality reporting. This analysis was approved by the Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta, which did not require informed consent for the use of publicly available data. This study adheres to the reporting guidelines outlined in the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed from May 13, 2018 to May 16, 2018. Trends were examined among men and women and by age group (< 50 vs ≥ 50 years) for combined colon and rectal cancer incidence. Annualized percentage changes (APCs) in incidence rate were estimated using the Joinpoint Regression Program, version 4.5.0.1 (National Cancer Institute), as described in a previous publication. Briefly, Joinpoint regression models were fit to log-transformed incidence rates, and permutation analysis was used to select the best-fit model ranging from 0 to 4 Joinpoints. Birth cohort models were fit using the National Cancer Institute's web tool, which quantifies the association of age, period, and cohort using age-drifted–period–cohort models. Input data were cases and population for 14 five-year age groups and 8 five-year periods. Cohort effects are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 1936 as the reference birth cohort, with adjustments for age. The first cohort included in this analysis was born in 1886, and the most recent cohort was born in 1986. All statistical tests used a level of significance at 2-sided α = .05.

### Routine fecal occult blood screening and colorectal cancer mortality in Sweden [^e1aeb387]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis and Cause of Death

The Swedish national cancer register uses the International Classification of Diseases, Revision 7 (ICD-7) with CRC diagnosis code 153.X (malignant neoplasm of large intestine, except rectum) or 154.0 (malignant neoplasm of rectum) excluding the morphology (histology) codes C24; 091 (neuroendocrine tumor), 093 (lymphoma), 094 (adenoma), 144 (squamous cell carcinoma), or 793 (gastrointestinal stroma tumor). Death attributed to CRC as the underlying cause was determined using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), specifically coded as C18.X–C20.X (malignant tumor in colon or rectum), within the cause of death register.

Follow-Up

For the exposure group, the individual start of follow-up was defined as the date of the first invitation to the screening program, and for all individuals in the control group the start of follow-up was defined as January 1, 2008. All individuals were followed until possible emigration (the first emigration registered after start of follow-up), death, or December 31, 2021, whichever came first.

Data Cleaning Process

Individuals in the exposure group never invited or with first screening later than January 1, 2013 were excluded. Furthermore, individuals with CRC diagnosis before the start of follow-up were excluded, since they could not be affected by the screening program. There were 228 individuals with death certificate–only data, ie, individuals with CRC listed as the UCD, but they had no diagnosis of CRC in the national cancer register. They were excluded from the primary analysis but incorporated into a sensitivity analysis. More details of the data cleaning process are provided in Figure 1.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of rectal cancer [^3bd748b3]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

Rectal cancer epidemiology — United States incidence and trends notes that colorectal cancer is "the third most common cancer for both men and women, and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths", with projections that "145,600 new colorectal cancer cases will have been diagnosed and an estimated 51,020 deaths… will have occurred in 2019". Rectal cancer–specific statistics are difficult to isolate because reporting is often combined with colon cancer as "colorectal cancer". Although overall colorectal cancer incidence has declined, the "18- to 50-year age group" has increasing rectal cancer, with incidence that "increased by 1.8% annually in younger adults between 1990 and 2013". To support multidisciplinary care and quality, the ASCRS collaborated to develop the National Accreditation Program in Rectal Cancer with educational modules and clinical standards focusing on program management, clinical services, and quality improvement.

### Development and validation of a lifestyle-based model for colorectal cancer risk prediction: the LiFeCRC score [^adaff35b]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and data source

The lifestyle-based prediction model for colorectal cancer risk (LiFeCRC score) was developed using data collected within EPIC, a multicentre prospective cohort study comprising 521,324 participants aged 17 to 98 years at study baseline (predominantly 35 to 70 years) recruited between 1992 and 2000 across 23 centres in 10 European countries. Participants included blood donors, screening participants, health-conscious individuals and the general population. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before joining the EPIC study. Approval for the EPIC study was obtained from the ethical review boards of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and from all local institutions through which subjects were recruited for the EPIC study, as previously reported.

Case ascertainment

The primary outcome was incident colorectal cancer. Cancer cases were identified through population cancer registries in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK. In France, Germany and Greece, a combination of methods was used including health insurance records, cancer pathology registries and active follow-up of study participants. Follow-up began at the date of enrolment and ended at the date of diagnosis of colorectal cancer, death or last complete follow-up. The last update of endpoint information was done up to 31 September 2010. Colon and rectal cancers were defined according to the 10th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD-10), proximal colon tumours include tumours in the cecum, cecal appendix, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon and splenic flexure (ICD-10 codes C18.0–18.5); distal colon tumours include those in the descending colon (ICD-10 code C18.6) and sigmoid colon (ICD-10 code C18.7); and rectal tumours are those occurring at the rectosigmoid junction (ICD-10 code C19) or in the rectum (ICD-10 code C20). Only the first primary neoplasm was included in the analysis; non-melanoma skin cancer was excluded.

### Stage, grade and morphology of tumours of the colon and rectum recorded in the oxford cancer registry, 1995–2003 [^6ed34818]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Oxford Cancer Registry collects data on ∼1400 incident cases of colorectal cancer each year in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire (a population of ∼2.8 million). Since the early 1990s data have been obtained electronically directly from hospital pathology, oncology and patient administration records and from supplementary sources such as private hospitals and the Office for National Statistics. For invasive cancers of the colon (ICD10 C18) and of the rectum and related sites (ICD10 C19–21) registered in 1995–2003, the following variables were examined: year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis (in years), sex, Dukes stage (A, B, C, D or not staged/not stageable), grade (well, moderately, poorly or un-differentiated or not known) and morphology (using a histological classification based on that of WHO for tumours of the colon and rectum;). Age-standardised registration rates were calculated by direct standardisation using the population of the catchment area in 2000 as reference.

### Trends in colorectal cancer surgical resection rates during the screening era: a retrospective study in Italy [^c066e2d3]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Study design and study population

In this observational retrospective study, we used data from the Veneto Region's administrative Hospital Discharge Dataset. This dataset contains information on patient demographics, hospital admission and discharge dates, discharge diagnoses (primary and up to five secondary diagnoses) and procedures or interventions (up to six) coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).

The study included all patients residing in the Veneto region aged 40 years or older who underwent surgical resection for CRC in any Italian hospital between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2021. A case of CRC resection was defined based on a hospital admission that included both an ICD-9-CM primary diagnosis code for malignant neoplasm of the colon (153.x) or rectum (154.0, 154.1, 154.8) and a procedure code for colorectal resection (45.7x, 45.8, 48.35, 48.49, 48.5, 48.6x and 45.95). Only the first hospitalisation with these codes was considered for individuals with multiple admissions. Patients who had been admitted for CRC surgery before 1 January 2002 were excluded.

Based on the anatomic site where the primary tumour originated, CRC was categorised as proximal or right-sided colon cancer (caecum to transverse colon: codes 45.72–45.74), distal colon cancer (splenic flexure to sigmoid colon: codes 45.75, 45.76) and rectal cancer (rectum: codes 48.35–48.36, 48.49, 48.5–48.6). Distal colon cancer and rectal cancer were collectively referred to left-sided CRC. Note that surgeries performed after neoadjuvant therapy for rectal lesions were included in the study because the first admission with both CRC diagnosis codes and CRC resection intervention codes was considered. In case where the procedure lacked anatomic site specification, the primary discharge diagnosis (proximal colon 153.0–153.1, 153.4–153.6; distal colon 153.2–153.3, 153.7; rectum 154) was used for categorisation.

### Time to diagnosis and mortality in colorectal cancer: a cohort study in primary care [^560aa066]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

We conducted a cohort study with overall 3-year mortality as the primary outcome and the diagnostic interval as the exposure variable.

Setting

The cohort resided in the former Aarhus County, Denmark, which has 640 000 inhabitants and ∼400 new CRC cases per year. Denmark's publicly funded health-care system provides free access to general practice and hospital care. More than 98% of Danish citizens are registered with a GP whom they have to consult for medical advice. The GP acts as a gatekeeper to the rest of the health-care system, carrying out initial diagnostic investigations and referring patients to hospitals or outpatient clinics when necessary. Danish GPs are legally bound to keep detailed medical records of their patients.

Study population

Our study included all newly diagnosed CRC patients over the age of 17 during 1 year (1 September 2004 to 31 August 2005). Subsequently, the study population was restricted to the 89.8% of patients who had attended general practice before the cancer diagnosis (see flowchart, Figure 1).

Identification of patients and GPs

Register data for this study were linked by means of the civil registry number, a unique personal identifier assigned to all Danish citizens at birth. Patients were identified from the County Hospital Discharge Registry, a population-based medical database that records dates of all inpatient and outpatient visits and discharge diagnoses classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). We defined incident CRC patients as patients registered with a first-time discharge diagnosis of colon cancer (C18 and C19) or rectal cancer (C20) during the study period; and with no previous diagnosis of colon cancer, rectal cancer, or malignant neoplasm of ill-defined, secondary, and unspecified sites (C76-80).

In 2009, we verified all diagnoses by comparing the data with the Danish Cancer Registry, which records all incident cancer cases in Denmark and holds key information from the Danish National Pathology Registry. To identify the patients' GPs, the data were linked to the County Health Service Registry.

### Time trends in colorectal cancer incidence from 1992 to 2016 and colorectal cancer mortality from 1980 to 2018 by age group and geography in Canada [^463a521f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study design and population

We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study. Individuals diagnosed with CRC from 1992 to 2016 or who died of CRC from 1980 to 2018 in Canadian provinces and territories were included. Data from Québec were not available. CRC cases were determined using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) codes. The following ICD-O-3 codes were included: C18.0 (cecum), C18.2-C18.9 (ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, large intestine [not otherwise specified]), C19.9 (rectosigmoid junction), C20.9 (rectum), and C26.0 (malignant neoplasm of intestinal tract, part unspecified). These codes are used by Canadian Cancer Statistics publications to define CRC. We excluded the following morphology codes: 905 (mesothelial neoplasms), 9140 (Kaposi sarcoma), and 9590–9992 (lymphomas). We also excluded appendix cancers as they are not affected by screening. Cause of death was determined using ICD version 9 codes from 1980 to 1999 and ICD version 10 codes from 2000 to 2018. The following ICD codes were used: ICD-9 1530–1539 (excluding 1535), 1540, 1541, and 1590; ICD-10 C18.0–C18.9 (excluding C18.1), C19.9, C20.9, and C26.0.

Data sources

We used data (age at diagnosis and area of residence) from the Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR) to determine CRC incidence in Canada from 1992 (the year the CCR was created) to 2016. The CCR is a person-level database that includes clinical (tumor location, histological subtype, and grade) and demographic (including 6-digit postal code) information about Canadian residents diagnosed with new cases of cancer. The CCR was also used to determine stage at diagnosis. Stage data were available from 2010 to 2016. We used data from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database from 1980 to 2018 to determine CRC mortality. The Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database collects demographic and medical (cause of death) information and province or territory of occurrence of death on all deaths in Canada. Cause of death information was not available for 2019 or 2020. Deaths that occurred in the United States were excluded because this information was available only until 2009.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of rectal cancer 2023 supplement [^41e99df8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Statement of the problem — In the United States, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths; approximately 30% of these cancers will originate in the rectum, and the American Cancer Society estimated a total of 44,850 new rectal cancer diagnoses in the United States for 2022. Adenocarcinoma of the rectum is inherently complex, and surgery for rectal cancer is technically challenging and is associated with major alterations in GI, urinary, and sexual functions and with decreased quality of life.

### Operative mortality prediction for primary rectal cancer: age matters [^e51bb488]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk of colorectal cancer increases with age, and the number of older adults requiring operations has increased. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a current risk calculator can accurately predict operative mortality for rectal cancer and whether the predictive accuracy varied with age.

Methods

The American College of Surgeons NSQIP database using ICD-9/10 codes for rectal cancer and CPT codes for proctectomy was accessed (2012 to 2015). The prognostic value of the risk calculator was evaluated using the predicted mortality variable code. Age categories were 18 to 64 years, 65 to 79 years, and 80 to 89 years. Analysis of variance was performed to assess differences between age categories in predicted and actual mortality and Pearson correlation coefficients were computed. Logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate associations adjusted for key covariates.

Results

There were 9,289 patients included, with age distribution as follows: 18 to 64 years (n = 5,674), 65 to 79 years (n = 2,899), and 80 to 89 years (n = 716). Both predicted and actual mortality increased with age, adjusting for functional status, comorbidity, and other covariates (p < 0.0001). The overall correlation between predicted and actual mortality was low (r = 0.20). The correlation was weakest from 18 to 64 years (r = 0.07), strongest from 65 to 79 years (r = 0.25), and in between from 80 to 89 years (r = 0.13). Predicted mortality was overestimated in the 18 to 64 years and underestimated in both the 65 to 79 years and 80 to 89 years age groups. Predicted mortality by age category interaction terms was also significantly associated with actual mortality in covariate-adjusted logistic regression models, providing additional evidence that the accuracy of predicted mortality varies by age.

Conclusions

The American College of Surgeons NSQIP mortality risk estimates appear to be poorly associated with actual mortality and the accuracy might differ between younger and older patients with primary rectal cancer. Goals of care discussion with the older patient about outcomes are indicated, as there is an almost twice predicted mortality.

Materials and methods

Population

The SEER database, supported by the National Cancer Institute, is currently one of the most valuable cancer registry databases worldwide. To extract clinical information, SEER*Stat software (Version 8.4.2;) was utilized. Given the public nature of the SEER database's data, our study did not necessitate obtaining informed consent from patients. For our research, the 3rd Edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3) criteria was applied to identify cases related to rectal cancer (codes C19.9 and C20.9). Our study included 186,721 cases from the SEER Research data, encompassing 17 registries and data from November 2022 (covering the period from 2000 to 2020). Our focus was on patients with primary tumors localized in the rectum. The schematic representation detailing the inclusion and exclusion criteria for metastatic rectal cancer patients can be viewed in Fig. 1.

### What is the impact of hospital and surgeon volumes on outcomes in rectal cancer surgery? [^bc1f8df5]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

METHOD

Data sources

This study used data from the National Bowel Cancer Audit (NBOCA), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS), and Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data linked at patient‐level for patients with a primary diagnosis of rectal cancer in the English NHS [International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD‐10) code C20].

National Bowel Cancer Audit

The NBOCA is a prospective mandatory database for all patients newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the English NHS. NBOCA case ascertainment is above 95% when compared with HES and National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) 'gold standard' data. Patients diagnosed within the private sector and undergoing major resection in an NHS hospital were included. Patients diagnosed and treated entirely in the private sector were not captured, but represent a small number of patients.

Data items from the NBOCA were used to determine sex, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, pathological staging according to the TNM system, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, date of surgery, surgical procedure, surgical urgency (elective/scheduled or emergency/urgent), and surgical access.

Hospital Episode Statistics

The HES dataset is a national administrative dataset of all admissions to English NHS hospitals. HES provided information on the number of comorbidities according to the Royal College of Surgeons of England Comorbidity score, socioeconomic deprivation reported as quintiles of the national distribution of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), and ethnicity.

Radiotherapy Dataset

Radiotherapy information was obtained from linkage to the RTDS and included whether the patient received radiotherapy and whether this was short‐ or long‐course based on prior methodology using the number of fractionations and time between radiotherapy and surgery. The study timeframe pre‐dated the publication of data and subsequent impact on clinical practice for the use of total neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer.

Study population

Patients undergoing a major resection for rectal cancer, excluding those not treated, treated with nonoperative palliative intent, or treated with organ preservation intention (transanal techniques, local excisions or complete clinical responders on a watch‐and‐wait protocol) between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2019 according to the NBOCA were identified (Figure 1). Procedures included were anterior resection, abdominoperineal resection (APR), low Hartmann's procedure, panproctocolectomy, and pelvic exenteration.

### Effect of misclassified underlying cause of death on survival estimates of colon and rectal cancer [^fbd8a9c0]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2011). Low credibility.

Inaccurate coding of patients' Underlying Cause of Death (UCOD) has constrained cause-specific survival estimates for colon and rectal cancers. Using California data from the Accuracy of Cancer Mortality study, we compared the cancer site data from the California Cancer Registry (CCR) with UCODs reported on death certificates and reclassified the UCODs based on cancer registry data when they disagreed. We then calculated 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year cause-specific survival for colon and rectal cancers separately, before and after the reclassification. Records from 26 312 colon and 10 687 rectal cancer patients were examined. UCOD records disagreed with CCR records for 700 (6%) of 11 404 colon cancer deaths and with 1958 (39%) of 5011 rectal cancer deaths, and 82% of the misclassified rectal cancer deaths were coded as colon cancer deaths in the UCOD. Reclassification decreased cause-specific survival for both colon and rectal cancers, but the impact was more pronounced for rectal cancer (eg, 5-year cause-specific survival of colon cancer decreased by 2.8% and of rectal cancer decreased by 20.0% relative to previous estimates; absolute rates changed from 65.4% to 63.6%, and 81.2% to 64.9%, respectively, after reclassification). Interchangeable use of the terms colon cancer and colorectal cancer is likely to be one of the reasons for UCOD misclassification. Educational measures could improve the accuracy of UCOD for colon and rectal cancer deaths.

### Increasing late stage colorectal cancer and rectal cancer mortality demonstrates the need for screening: a population based study in Ireland, 1994–2010 [^edd1dbec]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

We examined incidence for 1994–2010 and mortality for 1994–2009 (2009 was the latest year for which mortality data was available at the time of the study). Information on incident cases was abstracted from the National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI). The NCRI records all cancers diagnosed in the population usually resident in Ireland through active case finding by tumour registration officers. The completeness of registration for all invasive cancers diagnosed to end 2008 was estimated to be over 97%.

The NCR has permission under the Health (Provision of Information) Act 1997 to collect and hold data on all persons diagnosed with cancer in Ireland. The use of that data for research is covered by the Statutory Instrument which established the Registry Board in 1991. All datasets were anonymised prior to analysis.

Site of tumour was recorded according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD10), and analysis included all primary invasive cancers of the colon (C18) and rectum (C19-C20) with a date of diagnosis during 01/01/1994 and 31/12/2010. For each diagnosed cancer, summary stage was derived from primary tumour (T), regional nodes (N) and distant metastasis (M) as recorded in pathology reports or, in the absence of these, from clinical staging, according to TNM 5 th edition. Where a patient was classified as MX ("distant metastases cannot be assessed"), the M category was defaulted to "M0" (no distant metastasis). For example, a patient with stage composite T3N1MX was treated as T3N1M0, stage III (Dukes C). Data on treatment received during the first year post-diagnosis was defined as planned first course of tumour directed treatment administered within one year of the diagnosis date (-30 to 365 days) and aimed at removing, destroying or preventing further tumour growth and included four treatment scenarios: (Surgery (Y/N), chemotherapy(Y/N), radiotherapy(Y/N), or not treated [ICD9CM and ICD10-AM]). Analyses of stage and treatment included cases diagnosed during 1995–2009, as this information was incomplete for 2010 cases and unreliable for 1994 cases, the first year of national registration. Colorectal cancer deaths (C18-20) were obtained from the Central Statistics Office (CSO).

### Epidemiological classification changes and incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer [^483c9378]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

All incident solid colorectal cancers diagnosed between 2004 and 2021 in inhabitants of 7 French administrative areas (Calvados, Côte-d'Or, Doubs, Finistère, Hérault, Isère, and Saône-et-Loire) were included in this cohort study. Rules of the International Agency for Research on Cancer allow for the inclusion of only 1 cancer per body site during a patient's lifetime, unless there are multiple cancers of different histological types. If there were multiple synchronous colorectal tumors in the same patient, the most advanced stage was included.

According to ICD-O-3, the cancer sites were the colon (ICD-O-3 code C18), including the appendix (ICD-O-3 code C18.1), rectosigmoid junction (ICD-O-3 code C19), and rectal ampulla (ICD-O-3 code C20). Adenocarcinoma (ADC) codes were 8140–8149, 8160–8163, 8190–8221, 8250–8384, 8390–8420, 8430, 8440–8490, 8500–8543, 8550–8552, and 8570–8576. Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) included all neuroendocrine tumors, carcinomas, and mixed types; NEN codes were as follows: 8013, 8150–8158, and 8240–8249. Other rare histological types were included only when considering all colorectal cancer histological types (CRC-All). Stage at diagnosis for ADC was coded using the pathological TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours: stages I (T1-2, N0M0), II (T3-4, N0M0), III (all T, N1-2M0), and IV (M1). Additionally, unresected, nonmetastatic colorectal ADC was classified as the M0 unresected stage. For some analyses, stages I, II, III, and M0 unresected were grouped into ADC M0. For NENs, stage at diagnosis was defined as NEN M0 for no distant metastasis and NEN M1 for distant metastasis. Metastatic status was unknown for 1285 ADCs and 77 NENs; therefore, they were excluded from stage-specific analyses. Age at diagnosis was classified into 15 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, and 50 years or older age classes. For the descriptive analysis of specific incidence rates, the 18-year time frame between 2004 and 2021 was divided into 6 periods of 3 years.

### Sex and tumor-site differences in the association of alcohol intake with the risk of early-onset colorectal cancer [^b5e94734]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of Covariates

Participant smoking status during the study (nonsmoker, past smoker, and current smoker) and pack-years were recorded. Regular exercise was defined as ≥ 20 minutes of vigorous-intensity (≥ 3 times/wk) or ≥ 30 minutes of moderate-intensity (≥ 5 times/wk) exercise. Low income was defined as the lowest quantile of income-based insurance contributions. Comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus [DM], and dyslipidemia) were identified from the NHIS health checkup and claims data. Hypertension was defined on the basis of the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes I10-I13 or I15 with any claim for prescription of antihypertensive medications, or a recorded blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg in the index year. DM was defined as a fasting glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL, or at least one annual claim for prescription of antidiabetic medications under the ICD-10 codes E11-E14. Dyslipidemia was defined as a serum total cholesterol level ≥ 240 mg/dL, or at least one annual claim for prescription of lipid-lowering medications under the ICD-10 code E78.

Study Outcomes

The primary outcome was the incidence of early-onset CRC diagnosed before age 50 years. CRC was defined as C18-20 on the basis of the ICD-10-CM codes (C18.0–18.4 for proximal colon cancer; C18.5–18.7 and C19.0 for distal colon cancer; C18.9 for unspecified colon cancer; C20.0 for rectal cancer) and the registration code for cancer (V193). In the subgroup analysis by tumor subsites, malignant neoplasms in overlapping sites in the colon (C18.8) were excluded because they were not specific to one location. The proportion of overlapping sites in the colon was 0.5% (46/8,314) in early-onset CRC cases. Carcinoid tumors were excluded.

### A Belgian population-based study reveals subgroups of right-sided colorectal cancer with a better prognosis compared to left-sided cancer [^489c6cee]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

Database and Study Population

In Belgium, data on patient and tumor characteristics of all newly diagnosed cancers are collected in a national cancer registry; the Belgian Cancer Registry (BCR). In this study, a retrospective analysis of data of the BCR was performed. Data collected and followed by the BCR includes demographic characteristics, primary tumor location, stage at diagnosis, and survival.

All Belgian patients diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma (International Classification of Diseases, Oncology Third Revision (ICD-O-3) histology codes: 8140, 8141, 8210, 8211, 8221, 8260, 8261, 8262, 8263, 8480, 8481, and 8490) were included in this study. All stages (except stage 0, in situ tumors) were included. Patients with tumors located in the appendix (topographical code ICD-O-3: 18.1) and unspecified or overlapping lesions (topographical code ICD-O-3: C18.8, C18.9) were excluded. Patients who died at the time of diagnosis or were diagnosed at autopsy were also excluded.

The anatomical location of tumors was classified according to the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). Cancers were classified as left-sided if they were located at the splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid, and rectosigmoid. This corresponds to the topographical code ICD-O-3: C18.5, C18.6, C18.7, and C19.9. Right-sided colon cancer was defined as cancer of the caecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, and transverse colon, corresponding to topographical code ICD-O-3: C18.0, C18.2, C18.3, C18.4. Rectal cancer was interpreted as a third separate group (topographical code ICD-O-3: C20.9).

### Early mortality from colorectal cancer in england: a retrospective observational study of the factors associated with death in the first year after diagnosis [^3fdf6506]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Information was extracted from the NCDR on all patients diagnosed with a first primary colon (International Classification of Diseases Version 10 (ICD10) code C18-19) or rectal (ICD10 code C20) cancer in England between 2006 and 2008. Patient and tumour information was obtained from the cancer registry component of the NCDR. Postcode of residence at diagnosis was used to measure socioeconomic background using the income domain of the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation.

A number of variables were derived using the linked data available in the NCDR. A Charlson co-morbidity score was calculated for each individual linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) based on the diagnostic reasons for any hospital admissions in the year preceding diagnosis of their colorectal tumour. Patients were grouped into Charlson score categories of 0, 1, 2 or ⩾3 and unknown (if the patient could not be identified in HES). A primary procedure (as defined by the OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures version 4 was sought for every individual identified in HES. A hierarchy of primary procedures occurring within 12 months of diagnosis was established: major resection; minor resection; palliative procedures. Individuals were allocated to the highest category compatible with their HES records. If no primary procedure could be identified, individuals were allocated to the 'no surgical treatment' category. Individuals that could not be identified in HES were included in a separate 'unknown' category. The method of presentation at hospital was categorised as: elective; emergency or unknown by combining the admission method from the relevant HES episodes with the 'route to diagnosis' information from the NCDR. The 'route to diagnosis' uses multiple data sources to characterise a 'pathway' to diagnosis, one of which is emergency presentation.

Cases were split into groups by survival time after diagnosis: ≤ 1 month (0–30 days), 1–3 months (31–90 days), 3–12 months (91–365 days), alive at 1 year (> 365 days). Logistic regression was used to investigate the odds of death within 1 month, 1–3 months and 3–12 months after adjustment for patient, tumour and treatment characteristics. Colon and rectal cancers were analysed separately (see Supplementary Tables online for study population characteristics). The colon cancer model was built with a multi-level structure (with patients nested within cancer registries) as cancer registry was a significant factor in the single-level model.

Methods

Data Sources

Mortality data for this study were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which compiles comprehensive US mortality data abstracted from death certificates of all deaths that occur in the United States and its territories. Underlying causes of death were classified according to the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), coding rules for the years 1993–1998 and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), coding rules for the years 1999–2001. The ICD-9 codes used for the underlying causes of death were 153–154.1 and 159.0 for colon or rectal cancer, 174–175 for breast cancer, 185 for prostate cancer, and 162.2–162.5, 162.8, and 162.9 for cancer of the lung or bronchus. The ICD-10 codes used were C18–C20 and C26.0 for colon or rectal cancer, C61 for prostate cancer, C50 for breast cancer, and C34 for cancer of the lung or bronchus.

### Association of ICD-10 clinical modification codes for social determinants of health with surgical outcomes and hospital charges among cancer patients [^bc4ee3cf]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We sought to characterize the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH)-related codes on outcomes among patients with a cancer diagnosis.

Methods

Patients diagnosed with lung, pancreas, colon, or rectal cancer between 2017 and 2020 were identified in the California Department of Healthcare Access and Information Patient Discharge Database. Data on concomitant SDOH-related codes (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] Z55-Z65) designating health hazards related to socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances were obtained. The association of these SDOH codes with postoperative outcomes was evaluated.

Results

Among 10,421 patients who underwent an operation from 2017 to 2020, median age was 66 years (interquartile range [IQR] 56–75) and nearly half of the cohort was male (n = 551,252.9%). In total, 102 (1%) patients had a concurrent ICD-10 SDOH diagnosis. After controlling for competing risk factors, the risk-adjusted probability of in-hospital death was 4.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0–7.2) among patients with an SDOH diagnosis compared with 2.9% (95% CI 2.5–3.2) among patients without an SDOH diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% CI 0.63–3.66; p = 0.258); postoperative complications were 27.0% (95% CI 20.0–34.1) compared with 24.9% (95% CI 24.1–25.6) among patients without an SDOH diagnosis (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.73–1.82; p = 0.141), and length of stay was 10.6 days (95% CI 10.0–11.2) compared with 9.4 days (95% CI 9.3–9.5) among patients without an SDOH diagnosis. Patients with an SDOH diagnosis had a 5.19 (95% CI 3.23–8.34; p < 0.005) higher odds of being discharged to a skilled nursing facility versus patients without an SDOH diagnosis.

Conclusion

Uptake and utilization of ICD-10 SDOH was 1% among California patients with lung, pancreas, colon, or rectal cancer. Patients with a concomitant ICD-10 SDOH code had longer length of stay and had higher odds of being discharged to a skilled nursing facility.

### Association of radiotherapy for rectal cancer and second gynecological malignant neoplasms [^55038d05]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Database and Participants

Female patients diagnosed with rectal cancer as the first primary cancer were identified from 9 registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 2015. All primary cancer sites were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition. The patients included were pathologically diagnosed with rectal cancer (C19.9) or rectosigmoid cancer (C20.9). The tumor stage was restricted to the localized and regional stage, and the details of tumor stage are shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement. The exclusion criteria included patients in whom rectal cancer were not their first primary cancer, patients who were aged younger than 20 years, patients with distant stage, patients who survived less than 5 years after rectal cancer diagnosis, patients who did not undergo surgery, and patients with missing data on radiotherapy, surgery, age, tumor stage, race, survival status or follow-up information. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The access to and use of SEER data did not require informed patient consent. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

Treatment Interventions for Rectal Cancer

Patients with rectal cancer were classified into 2 groups according to initial treatment modality. The radiotherapy group was composed of patients with rectal cancer who received surgery and neoadjuvant external-beam radiotherapy, and the no-radiotherapy group was composed of patients who received surgery alone. We excluded patients who received other types of radiotherapy (ie, brachytherapy, combination therapy). The SEER database collected data only on the initial course of cancer treatment, and the radiotherapy doses were not registered in the SEER database.

### Evaluation of bowel cancer registration data in england, 1996–2004 [^ed73cf88]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Results

Between 1996 and 2004, a total of 177 379 individual bowel cancers in men and women aged 50–79 years were registered in England. There were 109 196 cancers of the colon and 68 183 cancers of the rectosigmoid junction and rectum. Crude incidence rates for all sites (ICD10 C18–C20) for men and women were 172 per 100 000 and 117 per 100 000 in 1996, and 163 per 100 000 and 105 per 100 000 in 2004, respectively.

Table 1 shows that the mean age at diagnosis was slightly, but significantly, lower in men (68.4 years) than in women (69.0 years) (P < 0.001) Age-specific incidence rate ratios of men/women shows that the rate was higher in men than women in each age group, for example, in 2004 for age groups 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74 and 75–79 years the ratios were 1.38, 1.46, 1.68, 1.64, 1.71 and 1.69, respectively. Mean age at diagnosis for cancers of the rectosigmoid junction and rectum was significantly younger than for cancers of the colon (68.0 years compared with 69.1, respectively) (P < 0.001).

Age-standardised incidence rates of bowel cancer declined between 1996 and 2004 (Figure 1). The results of a Poisson regression analysis showed that after adjustment for age and cancer registry, incidence rates declined by an average of 1% (P < 0.001) each year for both men and women; when sex was included in the model, the risk of bowel cancer was 39% lower for women compared with men (P < 0.001).

Age and sex-specific incidence rates also declined significantly (P < 0.001) by 1% each year for all age–sex groups except for the 75–79 year olds in which there was no change in women and a slight increase in men (Figure 2). Both incidence rates and their decrease with time varied between cancer registries.

### Predicting opportunities to increase utilization of laparoscopy for rectal cancer [^6f032813]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Despite proven safety and efficacy, rates of laparoscopy for rectal cancer in the US are low. With reports of inferiority with laparoscopy compared to open surgery, and movements to develop accredited centers, investigating utilization and predictors of laparoscopy are warranted. Our goal was to evaluate current utilization and identify factors impacting use of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer.

Methods

The Premier™ Hospital Database was reviewed for elective inpatient rectal cancer resections (1/1/2010–6/30/2015). Patients were identified by ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, and then stratified into open or laparoscopic approaches by ICD-9-CM procedure codes or billing charge. Logistic multivariable regression identified variables predictive of laparoscopy. The Cochran-Armitage test assessed trend analysis. The main outcome measures were trends in utilization and factors independently associated with use of laparoscopy.

Results

3336 patients were included-43.8% laparoscopic (n = 1464) and 56.2% open (n = 1872). Use of laparoscopy increased from 37.6 to 55.3% during the study period (p < 0.0001). General surgeons performed the majority of all resections, but colorectal surgeons were more likely to approach rectal cancer laparoscopically (41.31 vs. 36.65%, OR 1.082, 95% CI [0.92, 1.27], p < 0.3363). Higher volume surgeons were more likely to use laparoscopy than low-volume surgeons (OR 3.72, 95% CI [2.64, 5.25], p < 0.0001). Younger patients (OR 1.49, 95% CI [1.03, 2.17], p = 0.036) with minor (OR 2.13, 95% CI [1.45, 3.12], p < 0.0001) or moderate illness severity (OR 1.582, 95% CI [1.08, 2.31], p < 0.0174) were more likely to receive a laparoscopic resection. Teaching hospitals (OR 0.842, 95% CI [0.710, 0.997], p = 0.0463) and hospitals in the Midwest (OR 0.69, 95% CI [0.54, 0.89], p = 0.0044) were less likely to use laparoscopy. Insurance status and hospital size did not impact use.

Conclusions

Laparoscopy for rectal cancer steadily increased over the years examined. Patient, provider, and regional variables exist, with hospital status, geographic location, and colorectal specialization impacting the likelihood. However, surgeon volume had the greatest influence. These results emphasize training and surgeon-specific outcomes to increase utilization and quality in appropriate cases.

Materials and Methods

Data Sources

We extracted data from the most current version of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) research database (November 2017 release) 12. The SEER program is the most authoritative and premier source of cancer statistics in the U.S. collecting demographics, tumor characteristics, and survival data from 18 population‐based cancer registries. Primary cancer site and histology were coded according to criteria in the 3rd edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD‐O‐3). Patients with colon cancer were identified using ICD‐O‐3 site codes C18.0 and C18.2–C18.9, whereas patients with rectal cancer were identified using C19.9 and C20.9.

Study Population

This study involved patients who were initially diagnosed with CRC aged between 20 and 79 years. Although data were available through 2015, we included patients with CRC before 2010 to ensure a follow‐up period of at least 5 years after the initial cancer diagnosis, because the risk of developing an SPM depends on the length of the follow‐up period. Additionally, information on cancer treatment, surgery, and radiotherapy was only available from 1998, so we restricted our study cohort to patients who were diagnosed between 1998 and 2010. Moreover, only complete cases without missing values on important covariates (age, race, tumor site, grade, size, surgery, and radiation) were eligible. We subsequently excluded cases that were reported from a death certificate or autopsy, and a 2‐month latency exclusion was set to further distinguish SPMs from the simultaneous cancers. Then, we categorized the identified patients with CRC into two cohorts: the OOPM cohort and the SPM cohort. A study flowchart is presented in supplemental online Figure 1.

Definition of SPM

The SEER rules for classifying multiple primary cancers depended on the cancer site of origin, date of diagnosis, histology, tumor behavior (i.e. in situ versus invasive), and laterality of paired organs. In general, all SPMs occurring 2 or more months after the initial diagnosis were considered as separate primaries unless the medical record stated that the tumor was recurrent or metastatic 13. There were also two key variables of indicating multiple primary malignancies in SEER, "total number of in situ/malignant tumors for patient" and the "sequence number" of the multiple primary malignancies. The former could be used to identify patients with an SPM, and the latter could be used to index the sequence of multiple malignancies.

Rectal cancer — definition and initial evaluation of malignant rectal polyps: A malignant rectal polyp is defined as an adenoma with cancer invading through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa (pT1), whereas carcinoma in situ (pTis) has not penetrated the submucosa and is incapable of regional nodal metastasis. Before deciding on formal surgical resection for an endoscopically resected pedunculated or sessile malignant polyp, clinicians should review the pathology and consult with the patient. The panel recommends marking the malignant polyp site at colonoscopy or within 2 weeks if deemed necessary by the surgeon. All patients with a malignant polyp should undergo mismatch repair (MMR) or microsatellite instability (MSI) testing at diagnosis.

Methods

Study Design and Cohort

We performed a cohort study of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older with incident, nonmetastatic colon cancer. This study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College, Lebanon, New Hampshire, which waived the need for informed consent because the research presented minimal risk of harm to participants and protections for privacy were in place, as required by the data use agreement. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

We identified patients with incident colon cancer using a previously validated algorithm with minor modifications. We included beneficiaries meeting 1 or more of the following criteria: (1) any claim for inpatient or outpatient chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or cancer-directed surgery with a colon cancer diagnosis code; (2) 2 claims from different dates with a colon cancer diagnosis code within 12 months after a diagnostic biopsy; or (3) 2 claims with a colon cancer diagnosis code, with the first occurring within 14 days of a claim with a diagnosis code for a cancer-related symptom or complication and the second occurring within the 12 months after the cancer-related symptom. We included patients with incident colon cancer diagnoses from April 1, 2016, to September 30, 2018, allowing for minimum follow-up of 90 days until December 31, 2018.

Among beneficiaries meeting at least 1 criterion for incident cancer, we excluded those with distant metastasis within 90 days of diagnosis (Figure 1). Evidence of distant metastasis was defined as any claim listing a diagnosis of a secondary malignant neoplasm (excepting the intra-abdominal lymph nodes). Because rectal cancer is sometimes miscoded as colon cancer in claims, we further excluded beneficiaries who had as many or more diagnoses of rectal cancer as for colon cancer within 60 days after index diagnosis (eMethods in the Supplement). The data that support the findings of this study are available with the permission from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

### Association between proteinuria changes and colorectal cancer incidence: evidence from a nationwide cohort study [^885d25c8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and outcome analysis

PU was assessed using dipstick urinalysis. Urine samples were collected from random spot specimens obtained early in the morning after an overnight fast. The dipstick results were interpreted using a semi-quantitative color scale, ranging from negative to trace (±), 1+, 2+, 3+, or 4+. Dipstick PU results were classified into three categories: no PU (−), trace (±), and overt PU (1 + or higher). The same dipstick method was used for both the 2010 and 2012 NHID national screenings to measure PU, allowing for evaluation of changes in dipstick PU over the 2-year period for each participant.

Study participants were classified into four groups based on changes in their PU status by the presence or absence of PU at first screening (S1) and second screening (S2). Individuals without PU at S1 were categorized into either the PU-free group (no PU at both S1 and S2) or the PU-developed group (no PU at S1 but presence of PU at S2). Participants with PU at S1 were categorized into the PU-persistent group (PU present at both S1 and S2) or the PU-recovered group (PU present at S1 but absent at S2) based on the change in PU status confirmed at S2.

The primary outcome was the newly diagnosed CRC identified based on hospitalization with the respective ICD-10-CM codes. CRC is classified using ICD-10-CM codes C18–C20, with specific codes for different tumor locations: C18.0–C18.4 for right-sided colon cancer, C18.5–C18.7 and C19.0 for left-sided colon cancer, and C20.0 for rectal cancer, along with the cancer registration code (V193). Since 2006, the NHIS policy enhanced the health coverage for cancer, and to qualify for a reduced copayment rate of 5% for cancer-related tests and treatments, physicians and medical institutions are required to certify cancer diagnoses using a special reimbursement code (V193). This code ensures that all patients with a confirmed cancer diagnosis are included in the national NHIS registry. In the subgroup analysis based on tumor location, cases of malignant neoplasms in overlapping colon sites (C18.8) and unspecified colon cancer (C18.9) were excluded because they were not specific to a single location.

### Irritable bowel syndrome and risk of colorectal cancer: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^685f5011]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry allowed us to identify cancers diagnosed in patients with IBS. This is a population-based nationwide registry containing data on incident cases of cancer in Denmark since 1943. Data recorded for each individual include civil registration number, method of cancer verification, stage, and residence on the date of cancer diagnosis. Diagnoses in the Cancer Registry have been coded according to ICD-10 since 2004. During the 1978–2003 period, all data were initially coded according to ICD-7; subsequently they were recoded using the ICD-10 classification. We used ICD-10 codes C18-C19 to identify cases of colon cancer and C20 to identify cases of rectal cancer. Patients with a cancer diagnosis before the date of their first IBS diagnosis were not included.

The civil registration number encodes age and gender. We computed age at the time of IBS diagnosis and categorised it into seven groups (< 20 years, 20–39 years, 40–49 years, 50–59 years, 60–69 years, 70–79 years, and 80+ years).

### Utilization of a colorectal cancer screening test among individuals with average risk [^a5b2940b]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Patient Selection and Study Periods

Because this study used a longitudinal design, the cohort included individuals continuously enrolled in the MarketScan databases throughout the 18-year study period from August 1, 2001, through July 31, 2019. This period was segmented into a screening measurement period (August 1, 2011, through July 31, 2019) and a 10-year prescreening period (August 1, 2001, through July 31, 2011). The screening measurement period was further segmented into the pre–mt-sDNA period (August 1, 2011, through July 31, 2014) and the post–mt-sDNA period (August 1, 2016, through July 31, 2019). Due to the lack of availability of a CPT code for the mt-sDNA test during the period between mt-sDNA approval in 2014 and the adoption of the CPT code for the mt-sDNA test on January 1, 2016, the period from August 1, 2014, and July 31, 2016, was defined as a washout period.

To be included in the current study, individuals were required to be aged at least 45 years but no older than 67 years on August 1, 2011, which ensured that individuals were 75 years or younger by the end of the screening measurement period on July 31, 2019. In addition, individuals were required to have no evidence of having above average risk of CRC. Individuals were considered to have above average risk if (1) they had at least 1 medical non–rule out claim with ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for benign or malignant colorectal neoplasms, colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, or family history of gastrointestinal cancer during the 10-year prescreening period or (2) they had at least 1 medical non–rule out claim with an ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for a high-risk symptom (eg, blood in the stool) during the 3 months immediately preceding the start of the screening measurement period. A rule out claim is for a service typically used to rule out a condition rather than to confirm it.

### Recurrence and malignancy rates in a benign colorectal neoplasm patient cohort: results of a 5-year analysis in a managed care environment [^5cadb793]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the apparent recurrence rates of benign neoplasms and the development of malignant colorectal neoplasms over a 5-yr period in a high risk managed care population.

Methods

Using the CPT and ICD-9 CM codes, a cohort of subjects with benign neoplasms were identified with a colonoscopy in 1992 from a longitudinal claims database (MarketScan). Three groups of subjects (benign neoplasms with polypectomy, benign neoplasms without polypectomy, and no neoplasms) were evaluated. Five-year recurrence rates of benign or new malignant colorectal neoplasms were determined for the baseline benign neoplasms with polypectomy and no neoplasm groups. For the benign neoplasm without polypectomy, only rates for malignancy were evaluated.

Results

Of 16,293 subjects at baseline, 39.50% were diagnosed with benign and 5.50% with malignant neoplasms. The 5-yr cumulative incidence of benign neoplasms in subjects without an index neoplasm (n = 8,967) was 7.92% compared to the recurrence of 40.93% in subjects with a benign neoplasm and polypectomy (n = 4,046) at baseline (p < 0.001). The 5-yr cumulative incidence rates of malignant colorectal neoplasms in the no neoplasm (n = 8,967) and benign neoplasm groups (n = 6,438) were 1.81% and 2.55%, respectively (p < 0.005). A lower 5-yr malignancy rate was observed in benign neoplasm group with polypectomy (2.17%) compared to the benign neoplasm group without polypectomy (3.18%) (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The high recurrence rate of benign colorectal neoplasms and a higher incidence of colorectal cancer in subjects at high risk (history of benign colorectal neoplasm) highlight a healthcare opportunity for surveillance and/or interventions to reduce the morbidity associated with colorectal neoplasms.

### Do colorectal cancer patients diagnosed as an emergency differ from non-emergency patients in their consultation patterns and symptoms? A longitudinal data-linkage study in england [^b96eab8f]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Variable definitions

Our outcome of interest was an emergency cancer diagnosis, defined according to the 'routes to diagnosis' algorithm based on several routine data sets and provided by NCIN. In particular, an emergency diagnosis is defined as a diagnosis of cancer following presentation to an Accident and Emergency Unit, or following a GP emergency referral or following emergency pathways for in/out-patients. Non-emergency cancer diagnoses include routine GP referrals, 2-week wait GP referrals (introduced in 2000 to allow GPs to refer suspected cancer patients urgently, so that they can see a specialist within 2 weeks), elective inpatient/outpatient and screening. For the purpose of our study focusing on emergency presentation, and similarly to previous research, after an initial description of the different routes we have grouped patients into two categories: emergency and non-emergency cancer patients (the latter including all the non-emergency routes).

Our main explanatory variables were signs and symptoms recorded in primary care prior to the cancer diagnosis. On the basis of the published literature and guidelines, we have operationally defined signs/symptoms potentially relevant for colorectal cancer. Our preliminary list has been reviewed by clinical experts and a final list has been compiled (Supplementary Material 1). Examples of relevant signs/symptoms are as follows: rectal bleeding, change in bowel habits, palpable rectal mass, iron-deficiency anaemia, abdominal pain and weight loss. Read codes for relevant symptoms have been identified and applied to records in CPRD (Supplementary Material 1). The Read codes included in the final list are as comprehensive as possible, considering that different codes can be used for similar symptoms (e.g. 16 different codes were included for identifying patients with diarrhoea). It was based on codes used in previous studies and further expanded following a detailed revision by clinical experts, as well as an examination of the data and the Read Code hierarchy (see Supplementary Material 2 for details on the development of the list of signs/symptoms).

In order to account for patient characteristics we also examined age, gender and deprivation, based on the income domain of the Index of Multiple Deprivation for England (Department for Communities and Local Government, 2008, The English Indices of Deprivation, 2007 London).

### Do presenting symptoms, use of pre-diagnostic endoscopy and risk of emergency cancer diagnosis vary by comorbidity burden and type in patients with colorectal cancer? [^b1752858]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Study variables

The main explanatory variables were comorbidities recorded in HES during the 6 years before and up to the CRC diagnosis. We focused on hospital-recorded comorbidities to provide evidence on the likely role played by severe morbidities in influencing the use and timeliness of diagnostic endoscopy, due to their possible impact on patients' procedural risk. In addition to examining the most common severe morbidities in hospitalised patients, we obtained two further measures of comorbidity burden, the Charlson comorbidity score and the count of morbidities. Using a validated algorithm, we identified morbidities through ICD-10 codes within HES in-patient and out-patient records and selected the 17 conditions typically included in the Charlson score (Box 1). We used the Charlson score as the main measure of comorbidity burden, as it is likely to better reflect the assessment of procedural risk than the morbidity count.

Further explanatory variables were red flag symptoms/signs recorded in primary care pre-cancer diagnosis, including CRC-localising symptoms (rectal bleeding or change in bowel habit) and non-localising signs (laboratory-confirmed anaemia); we also examined non-red flag symptoms potentially related to CRC (including abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue). Classification in red flag or non-red flag symptoms follows the UK NICE guidelines for suspected cancer recognition and referral. Change in bowel habit, as well as rectal bleeding or unexplained anaemia, are considered red flag symptoms, which warrant urgent referral for investigations, as they have a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) > 3% for colorectal cancer. Other symptoms, such as diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain are associated with a lower PPV for colorectal cancer and are not considered as red flag symptoms based on NICE guidelines. While the terms 'diarrhea' or 'constipation' can be considered as deviations from normal bowel patterns, the term 'change in bowel habit' is typically used in UK primary care records when there is a higher suspicion of CRC, as it warrants urgent referral according to NICE guidelines.

### Liver disease and 30-day mortality after colorectal cancer surgery: a Danish population-based cohort study [^495d9e75]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Study cohort

We included all patients with a diagnosis of CRC who underwent first-time CRC surgery during the study period. Patients with a CRC diagnosis (see Additional file 1 for diagnosis codes) were identified using the Danish Cancer Registry (DCR), which contains records of all incident cases of malignant neoplasms in Denmark since 1943. Data recorded for each individual include method of cancer verification, cancer stage, and place of residence on the date of cancer diagnosis. Tumors registered after January 1, 1978 have been reclassified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th revision (ICD-10).

We used the CPR number to link CRC patients identified in the DCR to the Danish National Registry of Patients (DNRP) to obtain information about comorbidities and surgery. The DNRP includes information on all non-psychiatric hospitalizations since 1977 and on outpatient contacts since 1995. Diagnoses have been recorded according to the ICD-8 until 1993 and according to the ICD-10 thereafter. Each record includes the dates of hospital admission and discharge, up to 20 discharge diagnoses, the type of admission (acute or elective), and information about surgery, including type and date of surgical procedure. Since 1996, surgical procedures have been coded according to the NOMESCO (Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee) Classification of Surgical Procedures. We therefore chose 1996 as the beginning of our study period.

As the indication for surgery is not coded in the DNRP, we defined CRC surgery as a procedure involving colorectal surgery performed during a hospitalization where CRC was listed as a diagnosis in the DNRP (see Additional file 1 for codes). We categorized CRC surgery into groups according to type of the first recorded procedure. "Radical resection" included surgeries with the intention of eradicating the primary tumor, such as partial and total resections of the colon and/or rectum. This group was further divided into laparoscopic and open surgery. "Non-resectional procedures" included colostomy, stent placement, or excision of a very small part of the colon (see Additional file 1 for codes). For each patient we reported the timing of the admission as elective or acute using the information about type of the hospitalization in the DNRP.

We classified CRCs with local spread at the time of first diagnosis as "localized" and those with regional and/or distant metastases as "non-localized" (see Additional file 1 for codes).

### KRAS-mutation status in relation to colorectal cancer survival: the joint impact of correlated tumour markers [^e178900e]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Information on tumour site and stage at diagnosis was available from SEER. Tumours located in the caecum through the splenic flexure were grouped together as proximal colon cancers (ICD-O-3 codes C180, C182, C183, C184, and C185). Tumours located in the descending (C186) and sigmoid colon (C187) were classified as distal colon cancer, and tumours in the rectosigmoid junction (C199) and rectum (C209) were grouped together as rectal cancer. Stage at diagnosis was recorded according to SEER summary staging conventions (localised-, regional-, distant-stage).

Survival information

Vital status was determined via linkage to SEER and the National Death Index. For cases who died during study follow-up, information was obtained on the date and cause of death, classified according to ICD-10 conventions. Deaths with an underlying cause attributed to ICD-10 codes C18.0-C20.0 or C26.0 (that is, CRC) were classified as disease-specific mortality events. Vital-status linkage was performed periodically, with the most recent linkage capturing deaths occurring through September 2010.

### Who performs proctectomy for rectal cancer in the United States? [^bdbae117]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is wide variation in surgical care for rectal cancer in the United States.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the differences in individual surgeon procedural profiles that might explain variations in the rates of restorative vs nonrestorative proctectomy for rectal cancer.

Design

This study was a retrospective examination of a cohort derived from trackable state hospital discharge data from 11 states.

Patients

We identified all patients with rectal cancer that underwent restorative proctectomy (sphincter-sparing surgery) vs nonrestorative proctectomy (colostomy formation) over a 24-month study period (January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2004).

Intervention

We developed an inpatient procedural profile of each treating surgeon's practice across general surgery procedure codes and summed the number of restorative vs nonrestorative proctectomies for rectal cancer by surgeon.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measures were nonrestorative proctectomy, mortality, and length of stay.

Results

A total of 7519 proctectomies were performed for rectal cancer by 2588 surgeons. During the 24-month study period, 1003 (38.8%) surgeons performed only nonrestorative procedures for rectal cancer. On multivariate analysis, the likelihood that a surgeon performed only nonrestorative procedures was increased if that surgeon performed more integumentary procedures and decreased if the surgeon performed at least one ileoanal pouch procedure or more anorectal procedures. Patients who underwent proctectomy by surgeons who performed only nonrestorative procedures had significantly higher mortality (2.5 ± 0.7%) and longer length of stay (11.3 ± 8.8 days) in comparison with those patients treated by surgeons who performed both restorative and nonrestorative procedures (1.3 ± 0.3% mortality and 9.2 ± 6.9 days, P < .001 for both analyses). The volume of proctectomy performed significantly affected all analyses.

Limitations

The retrospective design introduces potential selection bias.

Conclusions

Over a 24-month period, 38.8% of surgeons performed only nonrestorative procedures for rectal cancer. These surgeons did not regularly perform anorectal or ileoanal pouch procedures, suggesting that they may not have a focus on colorectal disease in their practice; they had significantly higher mortality and length of stay for their patients who underwent proctectomy for rectal cancer.

### Inequity in colorectal cancer treatment and outcomes: a population-based study [^c8905cba]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Details of individuals aged ⩾20 with invasive colorectal cancer (ICD-02: C18-20) diagnosed during 1994–2002 were abstracted from the National Cancer Registry (NCR), which records all cancers diagnosed in Ireland. Completeness of registration is approximately 98%. Cases were excluded where diagnosis was made by death certificate only or at autopsy, or the tumour was a secondary malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin), or occurred simultaneously with another tumour.

Using information on treatments administered within 1 year of diagnosis, cases were categorised by receipt of (1) 'cancer-directed' surgery (i.e. colon or rectal resection), (2) chemotherapy, or (3) radiotherapy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were classified as 'any', 'pre-operative', or 'post-operative' based on dates of surgery and the start of the first treatment course. Stage was defined by AJCC summary staging, making the assumption that patients with no information on distant metastasis (MX) had no metastasis (M0). Dates and causes of death were ascertained by linkage to death certificates. Patients were followed up from date of diagnosis to death or 31 December 2004, whichever was sooner.

The purpose of such regional registries is to collect data on cancer patients to reveal diagnostic or therapeutic shortcomings with the intention of improvement. Registries in the south and east of Germany are overrepresented in the dataset, because the variables considered necessary for this study have been collected in these regions for a longer period of time. For the present study, all registered rectal cancer cases from 2007 to 2016 with information on the surgical approach were considered. Data contain explicit details about sex, age, tumor location, histologic type, Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage, grading, surgery, and perioperative therapy, as well as on survival and recurrences. The classification of tumor location was carried out according to UICC specifications by measurement from the anocutaneous line (upper rectum: > 12–16 cm, middle rectum: > 6–12 cm, lower rectum: < 6 cm). All patient data were anonymized. The study design was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review Board of the University of Regensburg, Germany (approval no. 15-170-0000).

Patient collective

23,001 patients with rectal cancer (ICD-10 C20) who had undergone either laparoscopic or open surgery with sphincter preservation between 2007 and 2016 were identified. Patients with a second previous or simultaneous colorectal tumor, or with histological types other than adenocarcinoma were excluded (Fig. 1). Furthermore, only patients with UICC stages I–III who had undergone R0 resection were included. Emergency surgery cases were ruled out and patients who died within 90 days after surgery were excluded from the analysis of long-term outcome to discriminate 90-day mortality from long-term survival. After applying the above mentioned criteria, 16,378 patients were available for long-term analyses.

### The rise of proximal colorectal cancer: a trend analysis of subsite specific primary colorectal cancer in the SEER database [^24f04048]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Study population

Patients aged ≥ 20 years diagnosed with CRC between 1973 and 2007 were selected for the cohort. ICD-O-3 codes were used to identify CRCs. Our study sample identified a total of 505,141 patients, aged 20 and older. A total of 24,942 cases were excluded from the analysis because of missing data for the analytic variables described below.

For descriptive analyses, based on prior epidemiological and clinical research, CRC subsites were divided into proximal, distal and rectal cancers using ICD-O-3 codes. These codes correspond to the following locations: proximal, distal, rectal, or not otherwise specified (NOS). The codes that corresponded to proximal CRCs consisted of those in the cecum (C18.0), ascending colon (C18.2), hepatic flexure of colon (C18.3), transverse colon (C18.4) and splenic flexure of colon (C18.5), whereas the distal CRCs included the descending colon (C18.6) and the sigmoid colon (C18.7). Rectal CRCs encompassed the rectosigmoid junction (C19.9) and the rectum (C20.9). Demographic and clinical data regarding age, sex, race/ethnicity, year of diagnosis, initial cancer diagnosis, staging, treatment, along with rural vs. urban origin were extracted from the SEER database. In the SEER registry, races were listed as White, Non-Hispanic Black, American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander (PI) and Hispanic. Grouping based on the year of diagnosis was divided into 5-year intervals (1973–1977; 1978–1982; 1983–1987; 1988–1992; 1993–1997; 1998–2002; 2003–2007).

Outcome

Vital status on all enrolled cancer cases was determined through linkages to the National Death Index to obtain date and cause of death; cause of death was classified using ICD10 coding conventions. The National Death Index identifies known deaths with a high degree of sensitivity, validity and completeness. The primary outcome of interest was death due to colorectal cancer. Time to death was evaluated from SEER-recorded date of colorectal cancer diagnosis and National Death Index-recorded date of death. Patients alive at the time of their last known vital assessment were censored at that date, with the most recent vital status linkage occurring in December 2009. Patients dying of causes other than colorectal cancer were censored at their recorded date of death.

Sub-site and stage of the colorectal tumour at diagnosis were defined using SEER records. Advanced disease was defined as colorectal cancer with distant metastasis at diagnosis; non-advanced disease included local and regional stage disease at diagnosis. Sub-site of disease was categorized using ICD10 codes: proximal disease (C18.0–C18.5); distal disease (C18.6–C18.7); and rectal disease (C19.9–C20.9).

### Effectiveness, benefit harm and cost effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening in Austria [^c1ffe9bf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Costs

Direct medical costs were derived from the perspective of the Austrian public-health care system. Both medical outpatient- and inpatient-care costs were based on original data from the Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions (HVB) and include costs of tests, staging, medication follow-up, screening, treatments of complications and average cost for end-of-life treatment of colorectal cancer and rectal cancer. All costs were inflated to the index year 2017 by using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Austria from the OECD. Table 1 presents the aggregated costs taking into account the relative frequency distribution of cancer location, cancer stage and medication options (reported in the Additional file 1). The cancer locations are classified using the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and include malignant neoplasms of colon (ICD-10 C18), of rectosigmoid junction (ICD-10 C19) and of rectum (ICD-10 C20). Further information and cost data are provided in the Additional file 1: Table S3, S4 and S5.

### Prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Patients with potentially curable Malignancies: a national registry dataset analysis [^e4838091]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

NCRD has existing linkages with the National Radiotherapy Dataset and Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy database. The National Radiotherapy Dataset standard (SCCI0111)requires all National Health Service radiotherapy providers in England to collect standardized data. National Health Service Trusts providing systemic anticancer therapy submit data to the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy database. Data quality is considered sufficient for data analysis from 2013.

This study was reviewed and approved by the Virtual Cardio-Oncology Research Initiative Consortium Project Review Panel. The Virtual Cardio-Oncology Research Initiative research program has received favorable ethical opinion from the Northeast–Newcastle & North Tyneside 2 Research Ethics Committee (reference 18/NE/0123). The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Identification of the patient cohort

We analyzed NCRD data to identify patients from England with potentially curable cancers. Specifically, we included individuals diagnosed with malignancy (breast cancer, non-small-cell-lung cancer [NSCLC], colon cancer, rectal cancer, prostate cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL], and Hodgkin lymphoma) and with potentially curable cancer stages. We used the ICD-10 codesto identify the first record of breast cancer (code C50), colon cancer (codes C18 and C19), rectal cancer (code C20), prostate cancer (code C61) and NSCLC (code C34 excluding small-cell morphology codes 8041, 8042, 8043, 8044, or 8045), DLBCL (code C83.3), and Hodgkin lymphoma (code C81) from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018.

### Measurement of clinical delay intervals among younger adults with colorectal cancer using health administrative data: a population-based analysis [^6928825b]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Results

Patient and disease characteristics

From the OCR, 8081 patients aged 15–49 were diagnosed with CRC between 2003 and 2018. After exclusions, 7053 patients remained. We were unable to assign a date of first presentation for 200 patients, resulting in 6853 patients included in the analysis (online supplemental material 6). Patient characteristics are presented in table 1. Men comprised 52% (3,587) of the cohort, and the median age was 45 years (IQR 40–47). Rectal cancer patients represented 31% of the cohort. For those diagnosed after 2007 when stage of disease was available, 25% of patients presented with stage IV disease. Patients aged 15–39 were more likely to have stage IV disease (28% age 15–39, 24% age 40–44, 25% age 45–49; p < 0.001) and proximal colon cancer (39% age 15–39, 32% age 40–44, 34% age 45–49; p < 0.001) compared with older patients (table 1).

Patient characteristics stratified by sex are presented in online supplemental material 7.

Characterising dates of first presentation, investigation and diagnosis

Codes defining the date of first presentation, investigation and diagnosis were visualised and explored (figure 2). The date of first presentation was characterised mainly by physician encounters for abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation/obstruction, and rectal bleeding. Additionally, codes for abdominal X-ray and general surgery consultations were common. The date of first investigation consisted of abdominal imaging, endoscopy and more general interventions such as blood work and chest X-rays. The diagnosis date was most often characterised by endoscopy and endoscopic biopsies.

Health administrative codes included in the algorithm occurring on the first date of presentation, investigation and diagnosis. Codes are identified by type, including Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI) codes, International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) codes, Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP) billing codes and OHIP diagnostic codes. The top 10 codes for each time point by frequency are presented.

### Do colorectal cancer patients diagnosed as an emergency differ from non-emergency patients in their consultation patterns and symptoms? A longitudinal data-linkage study in england [^c42eeb93]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Our study will need to be extended to more recent cohorts of cancer patients with individually linked primary-care data. However, although some changes occurred since the study period in guidelines, clinical practice and patient awareness of symptoms, the natural history of colorectal cancer and the disease processes determining the occurrence of signs and symptom will not have changed. It is also noteworthy that emergency presentations have remained stable over recent years for rectal cancers with a slight decrease for colon cancers; moreover, socio-demographic inequalities in emergency presentations and cancer survival are still relevant. We have performed sensitivity analyses evaluating whether our results differed for patients diagnosed in 2005 and 2006, which showed that the overall findings were not affected by the year of diagnosis in our sample.

Our results have to be interpreted with caution as the examined symptomatic presentations are based on clinical records and do not fully reflect all symptoms experienced by patients. However, this can be assumed to apply equally to emergency and non-emergency presenters. Moreover, clinical data were recorded prospectively by > 200 GP practices before the cancer diagnosis, and emergency and non-emergency patients had similar records regarding their background consultation history.

Although routine data sources may contain inaccuracies, the validity of diagnostic coding and consultation rates in CPRD has been extensively confirmed. CPRD are electronic versions of case notes and therefore include data reported by patients and considered relevant by doctors. It should be noted that sometimes doctors record clinical information only in free-text format rather than READ codes. We did not have access to free-text information, which might have led to an underestimation of symptoms. Interviews with patients/doctors could verify the validity and improve accuracy, but this is beyond the purpose of the present work. Similarly, we lacked data on patient experience which can provide important insights. The possibility of linking CPRD records to patient experience data is an area that would merit future consideration in order to overcome this limitation.

### Mental health morbidities and time to cancer diagnosis among adults with colon cancer in england [^2bf88a9a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

This cohort study was approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for database research, which enables regulated access for research of anonymous data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), for which there is no requirement for informed consent. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Study Population and Data Sources

We performed a cohort study of patients aged 30 to 99 years diagnosed with colon cancer (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes C18.1-C18.9) between 2011 and 2015 using National Cancer Registry records linked to primary care data (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) outpatient and admitted patient data. We included 3766 patients with at least 1 colon cancer–relevant symptom recorded in primary care during the 24 months before cancer diagnosis (symptom list in eTable 1 in the Supplement). Nonsymptomatic screening–detected cancers or emergency diagnoses without prior symptomatic primary care presentation were excluded. We also excluded rectal cancers and focused specifically on colon cancer given that diagnostic delays and emergency and advance-stage diagnoses occur more frequently in colon cancer (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Study Sample, Data Sources, and Diagnostic Interval Definition

Colorectal cancer (CRC)–relevant symptoms included red-flag symptoms and signs (ie, rectal bleeding, change in bowel habit, and anemia) and nonspecific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue).

### Trends in the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of rectal adenocarcinoma in the US from 2004 to 2019: a national cancer database analysis [^ecef8b39]. JAMA Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Rectal cancer management has significantly evolved over the last 2 decades.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate trends in the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of rectal adenocarcinoma across 16 years.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, observational case series study used data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to evaluate patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma from 2004 through 2019. Data analysis was performed from March to May 2022.

Exposures

Trends in the treatment and outcomes of rectal adenocarcinoma in the US between 2004 and 2019 were explored. This period was subdivided into 4 equal periods: 2004–2007, 2008–2011, 2012–2015, and 2016–2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patient and tumor characteristics, treatments, short-term outcomes, and overall survival.

Results

A total of 318 548 patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma were included in the analysis, 191 369 (60.1%) of whom were males and 127 179 (39.9%%) were females. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 63.5(13.4) years, and 46 824 patients (14.8%) were younger than 50 years. Among the patients, 10 859 (3.4%) were of Asian race and ethnicity, 28 464 (8.9%) were Black, and 271 236 (85.1%) were White. The percentage of patients younger than 50 years who were diagnosed with rectal cancer increased by 1.5%, from 13.9% in period 1 to 15.4% in period 4. Patients in the last period (2016–2019) presented more often with stages III (36.2% vs 30.2% vs 25.0% vs 23.4%; P < .001) and IV (21.5% vs 19.3% vs 18.1% vs 18.6%; P < .001) disease compared with those in the remaining 3 periods. The use of chemotherapy (36.8% vs 48.1% vs 49.1% vs 47.0%; P < .001) and immunotherapy (0.4% vs 0.2% vs 3.5% vs 6.5%; P < .001) significantly increased across the 4 periods. Although neoadjuvant radiotherapy was used more often across the periods studied (28.6% in period 1 to 34.3% in period 4), the use of adjuvant radiotherapy was reduced by half (12.9% to 6.0%). The median (IQR) time from diagnosis to definitive surgery increased from 95 (15–126) days in period 1 to 128 (47–158) days in period 4. The rate of use of open surgery decreased by half (60.1% in period 2 to 30.1% in period 4), and the use of robotic surgery significantly increased (5.2% in period 2 to 28.4% in period 4). The conversion rate was significantly reduced (11.2% in period 2 to 7.3% in period 4) and the median (IQR) hospital stay decreased by 2 days, from 6 (3–9) days to 4 (2–7) days. The median (IQR) overall survival significantly increased across the periods (from 83.1 months [95% CI, 81.8–84.6 months] in period 1 to 92.1 months [95% CI, 90.2–93.6 months] in period 3; P < .001).

Conclusion and Relevance

The findings of this case series study suggest a treatment trend of increased use of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, sphincter-saving surgery, and minimally invasive surgery. In addition, the time between diagnosis and definitive surgery increased by a median of 33 days. This treatment trend was associated with a significant improvement in the overall survival, reduction in the conversion rate by 3.9%, and a 2-day shorter hospital stay. These findings have major clinical relevance to the management of rectal cancer. The improvements seen in short-term outcomes and survival of patients diagnosed with rectal cancer can probably be attributed to the treatment trends observed. Continued improvement in outcomes warrant further updates in treatments.

### Surgical treatment and survival from colorectal cancer in Denmark, england, Norway, and Sweden: a population-based study [^887185e1]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and data sources

In this population-based study, we included all patients aged 18–99 years diagnosed with primary, invasive colorectal adenocarcinomas from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2012. Patients diagnosed by their death certification alone and patients with records with invalid date sequences were excluded. In Denmark, England, and Norway, we extracted data from population-based national cancer registries. By linking individual patient records in Denmark to thedatabase, additional clinical information was available for 11 746 (90·7%) patients registered with colorectal adenocarcinomas in the Danish National Cancer Registry. Similarly, 97 185 (99·7%) English national cancer registry records for patients with colorectal cancer were linked to at least one of thedata, inpatient and outpatient records, and the. Norwegian national cancer registry data are routinely linked to the, a specialised registry that contains detailed clinical information on all patients with colorectal cancer nationwide. Theprovided clinical data on patients with colorectal cancer in Sweden; its coverage for the study period was near complete. Definitions of clinical variables (site, stage, or treatment) were agreed with in-country clinicians and specialised cancer registry staff to reconcile differences in coding between the various data sources. The data specifications were agreed in advance with other countries through a prespecified data protocol. Some further discussions with clinicians and registry staff were held to understand and reconcile differences in coding and clinical practices in those countries.

All patients included in this study were followed up from time of diagnosis until death or until Dec 31, 2014, whichever occurred first. Last vital status was assessed by linking data to national death registry records.

Procedures

Colon cancer was defined by topographical codes C18.0–C19.9 and rectal cancer by codes C20.0–C20.9 of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition. Tumours located 15 cm or less from the anal verge were considered rectal cancers. Tumours with morphological codes for non-adenocarcinoma were excluded from analyses.

We applied consistent quality control measures to all records (appendix pp 1–2). In cases of multiple tumours diagnosed at the same site within 6 months of each other, we retained the date of diagnosis of the first tumour; where stage and type of surgery were inconsistent between records (n = 327, 0·23%), we selected the most advanced stage and most extensive surgery. For all patients with record of more than one surgery, we selected the most extensive surgery.

### Social variations in access to hospital care for patients with colorectal, breast, and lung cancer between 1999 and 2006: retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics [^4e8d4eca]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Study design

We limited our analysis to patients aged 50 and over because over 90% of cancers are diagnosed in this age group. We included all such patients admitted to NHS trusts (identified with the three digit provider code beginning with "R") initially between 1 April 1998 and 31 March 2006 with colorectal cancer (ICD-10 codes C18, C19, C20, C21) or lung cancer (ICD-10 codes C33, C34), and all women admitted with breast cancer (ICD-10 code C50) (based on 1st to 4th diagnosis fields). To analyse variations in admission type, we identified the first elective or emergency admission record for each patient within the study period. Each admission period was defined as one year (from 1 April to 31 March for each year within the study). Because admission records from the first year in the dataset (1998–9) were likely to include a mixture of first and subsequent admissions, we excluded 1998–9 data from the analyses. Our results therefore cover the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2006. For the purposes of analysis, we coded year 1999–2000 as zero and 2005–6 as six.

We determined patients' age at admission by using the 15th day of each month (in combination with year and month of birth) as an arbitrary birth date. We grouped age into 10 year increments from age 50 to age 90 and over. We examined patients' socioeconomic circumstances by dividing the deprivation ranks supplied by HES into fifths (where the lowest fifth referred to the most deprived).

Surgical procedures were identified (in up to 12 operation fields) with OPCS-4 codes. Thus we examined the probability of anterior resection (H33.2-H33.6) compared with abdominoperineal resection (H33.1) for colorectal cancer code ICD-10 C20 because this is the code for rectal cancer. For breast cancer we examined the likelihood of receiving breast conserving surgery (B28) compared with mastectomy (B27). For lung cancer we examined the probability of surgical resection (E441, E54, E574, and E57.8).

We excluded records if they contained missing or invalid data for HES patient identifier, date of birth, sex, admission date, episode start date, episode end date, and discharge method. We also excluded records with surgical dates that either preceded the admission date or followed the discharge date.

Their purpose is to provide information on which decisions can be made, rather than dictate a specific form of treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners, health care workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient.

Methods

Population selection

This study investigates the incidence rate, clinical characteristics, and oncological outcomes of patients with CRC. The data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and described in accordance with the items and codes documented by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Patients between 2004 and 2015 were extracted and coded in accordance with the year of diagnosis (Item 390). Tumor site and histology were coded in accordance with the criteria in the third edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology. Colorectal cancers included C18.0-cecum, C18.2-ascending colon, C18.3-hepatic flexure of the colon, C18.4-transverse colon, C18.5-splenic flexure of the colon, C18.6-descending colon, C18.7-sigmoid colon, C188-C189-large intestine, NOS, C19.9-rectosigmoid junction, and C20.9-rectum (Items 522 and 523). Patients who were diagnosed at autopsy or by death certificate only, who had another malignancy before CRC (Item 380), and who had no histologically confirmed cancer (Items 490 and 2180) were excluded from this study. This study was further stated patients with ACs, which were identified by histology codes 8140, 8144, 8210,8211, 8220, 8221,8255, 8260, 8261, 8262, 8263, mucinous 8480, mucin-producing adenocarcinoma 8481, and signet ring cell carcinoma 8490 (Item 522). Finally, this study was stated patients with clear stages as identified by the DERIVED AJCC-6 STAGE GRP (Item 3000).

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.). Proportions were analyzed by the chi-squared test, and the correlations of each factor with OS and CSS were tested by logistic analysis. OS and CSS were also analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier method and Cox regression analysis.

Methodology — guideline development used a comprehensive literature search and GRADE-based ratings. A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews was performed from January 1, 2013 through January 15, 2020, and the 1812 screened articles were evaluated for their level of evidence with a final list of 361 sources reviewed to formulate the treatment guideline. The final grade of recommendation and level of evidence for each statement were determined using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the guideline is updated every 5 years, and no funding or competing interests were declared.
