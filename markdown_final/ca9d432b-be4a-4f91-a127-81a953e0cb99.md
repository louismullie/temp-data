## Question

Low iron elevated ferritin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret the combination of low serum iron with elevated ferritin and to outline diagnostic and management steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pattern and its most likely explanation. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially the role of hepcidin. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and how to distinguish functional iron deficiency from absolute iron deficiency and iron overload. After that, I need to check which adjunctive tests best resolve ambiguity, including TSAT, sTfR, sTfR/log ferritin index, CRP, and hepcidin. Finally, I will consider condition-specific thresholds, when to image for iron overload, and how to treat, including when IV iron is indicated and when to avoid iron altogether.

> Let me first confirm the pattern: low serum iron with elevated ferritin is classically seen in anemia of inflammation, also called anemia of chronic disease, where inflammation drives hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration and reduced availability for erythropoiesis despite adequate or increased stores, so ferritin is normal or high while serum iron and transferrin saturation are low [^117Bn4Sx] [^116ir8de] [^113VYsQK].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before moving on. In inflammatory states, IL-6 induces hepcidin, which inhibits ferroportin, thereby reducing iron export from macrophages and enterocytes. This produces hypoferremia and low TSAT while ferritin rises as an acute-phase reactant, creating functional iron deficiency even when total body iron is not depleted [^116ir8de] [^111wSktU] [^112mrZJS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to ensure we consider the differential. Functional iron deficiency from inflammation is most likely, but absolute iron deficiency can coexist with inflammation and still show low iron with ferritin in the 30–100 ng/mL range, whereas pure iron overload (for example, HFE hemochromatosis) typically shows high ferritin with high TSAT, not low TSAT. Liver disease (NAFLD, alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis) and malignancy can elevate ferritin via inflammation or hepatic injury, and rare genetic hyperferritinemia syndromes exist but are uncommon and usually lack low TSAT [^115wbRKn] [^112PDk3f] [^115pf4Z2] [^114fuicn].

> I should double-check the role of ferritin thresholds because inflammation confounds interpretation. In the absence of inflammation, ferritin less than about 30 ng/mL is highly specific for absolute iron deficiency, but in inflammatory states, ferritin up to 100 ng/mL may still be consistent with iron deficiency. Thus, ferritin alone cannot reliably exclude iron deficiency when CRP is high, and guidelines endorse using adjunct markers or a therapeutic iron trial to clarify [^111vsMJh] [^111wSktU] [^112knLuE].

> Next, I should review which tests best resolve the ambiguity. Let me think about TSAT first: a TSAT less than 20% supports iron-restricted erythropoiesis and is endorsed across perioperative, CKD, and inflammatory settings as a key discriminator. sTfR rises with iron deficiency but is relatively unaffected by inflammation, and the sTfR/log ferritin index greater than about 2 strongly suggests iron deficiency even when ferritin is 30–100 ng/mL. CRP helps flag inflammation that can falsely elevate ferritin. And hepcidin, when available, tends to be high in pure anemia of inflammation but lower when absolute iron deficiency is present, aiding differentiation [^114stzej] [^114MZmUH] [^115iRmFf] [^111wSktU].

> But wait, what if the ferritin is very high, say above 500–800 ng/mL, with low TSAT? Does that still fit inflammation? Yes, in CKD and other inflammatory states, high ferritin with low TSAT is common and more reflective of inflammation and functional iron deficiency than of true iron overload; in such cases, withholding iron solely based on a high ferritin can worsen iron-restricted erythropoiesis, and a therapeutic trial of IV iron may be appropriate if TSAT remains low and symptoms persist [^1139RudT] [^1133mjD8] [^114Kcnym].

> I will now examine condition-specific thresholds to guide decisions. In IBD, ferritin less than 30 ng/mL in quiescent disease or less than 100 ng/mL in active disease supports iron deficiency. In CKD, functional iron deficiency is defined by TSAT less than 20% even with ferritin up to 100–200 ng/mL depending on dialysis status. In perioperative pathways, ferritin 30–100 ng/mL with TSAT less than 20% warrants iron therapy to mitigate transfusion risk. And in heart failure, low TSAT with elevated hepcidin and sTfR identifies patients with cellular iron deficiency who benefit from IV iron beyond simple ferritin/TSAT definitions [^111n1hRb] [^117CPYjP] [^111oZS7Z] [^114stzej].

> Hold on, I should verify when to image for iron overload. If TSAT is elevated above about 45% with high ferritin, hereditary hemochromatosis becomes more likely and HFE testing plus liver MRI for iron quantification is appropriate. Conversely, if TSAT is low with high ferritin, secondary causes like inflammation, NAFLD, alcohol, or malignancy are more likely, and MRI can still help distinguish parenchymal from reticuloendothelial iron distribution when the etiology remains unclear [^112PDk3f] [^113PRqko] [^113UwyPT].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic approach to avoid premature closure. A practical sequence is to confirm low serum iron and elevated ferritin, calculate TSAT, check CRP, and then add sTfR or the sTfR/log ferritin index. If results remain equivocal and management hinges on clarifying iron deficiency, a monitored therapeutic trial of iron with hemoglobin response can be decisive, as a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within about 2 weeks strongly supports absolute iron deficiency even when baseline studies are discordant [^114J4SK1] [^116PBzzy].

> I need to ensure the treatment plan aligns with the mechanism. For functional iron deficiency due to inflammation, IV iron is generally preferred because it bypasses hepcidin-mediated blockade of oral absorption; oral iron may still be tried in mild cases or when IV is not feasible, but expectations should be tempered. In CKD, IV iron is reasonable even with ferritin up to roughly 500–1200 ng/mL if TSAT is low and anemia persists, with close monitoring for response and safety; in heart failure and IBD, IV iron improves symptoms and outcomes in appropriately selected patients with low TSAT and inflammatory milieu [^1133mjD8] [^114Kcnym] [^111vsMJh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "never give iron if ferritin is above 100 ng/mL"; that would be an overstatement. I should correct that: in inflammatory states, ferritin up to 100–200 ng/mL can still accompany iron-restricted erythropoiesis, and withholding iron solely on ferritin in this range can be inappropriate; decisions should integrate TSAT, sTfR or sTfR/log ferritin, CRP, and clinical context, and a therapeutic iron trial is acceptable when the pretest probability of benefit is high [^111oZS7Z] [^114stzej] [^114J4SK1].

> Finally, I should confirm that we address the underlying cause of inflammation whenever possible, because treating the driver (for example, optimizing CKD, controlling IBD activity, managing heart failure, treating infection or malignancy) improves iron utilization and may reduce the need for ongoing iron therapy. This integrated approach prevents misattribution of anemia solely to iron deficiency and avoids unnecessary iron accumulation [^117Bn4Sx] [^111vsMJh].

Low iron with high ferritin most often reflects **anemia of chronic disease** (ACD) [^117Bn4Sx], where inflammation drives hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration and reduced availability for erythropoiesis despite adequate stores [^116ir8de]. Ferritin is an **acute-phase reactant** [^114aKFku] and can be elevated in inflammation, liver disease, malignancy, or hyperferritinemia syndromes, masking true iron deficiency [^115WFgXM]. Evaluate with **TSAT, CRP, and sTfR** [^116PBzzy]; TSAT < 20% with ferritin 30–100 ng/mL suggests iron deficiency with inflammation, while ferritin > 100 ng/mL with low TSAT favors ACD [^114stzej] [^1162718v]. Management targets the underlying cause; IV iron is preferred when iron deficiency coexists with inflammation or when oral iron fails [^111vsMJh] [^1133mjD8].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain the coexistence of low serum iron and elevated ferritin:

---

### Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)

- **Hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration**: Inflammatory cytokines (especially IL-6) increase hepcidin, which inhibits iron export from macrophages and enterocytes, reducing circulating iron despite adequate stores [^116ir8de] [^111wSktU].

- **Ferritin as an acute-phase reactant**: Ferritin rises with inflammation, independent of iron stores, potentially masking iron deficiency [^111vsMJh].

- **Functional iron deficiency**: Iron is present but unavailable for erythropoiesis, causing anemia despite normal or high ferritin [^117Bn4Sx].

---

### Liver disease

In liver disease, **impaired hepatic protein synthesis** lowers transferrin, reducing serum iron and TSAT, while ferritin may be elevated due to hepatic synthesis and inflammation [^116M47yq]. Hepcidin dysregulation further increases iron absorption and release, raising ferritin [^1153TVnp].

---

### Malignancy

In malignancy, **tumor-derived cytokines** drive inflammation and hepcidin, causing iron sequestration and elevated ferritin [^116ir8de]. Tumor cells may also directly alter iron metabolism, increasing ferritin and reducing circulating iron.

---

### Genetic disorders

Genetic disorders include **hyperferritinemia syndromes**, in which mutations (e.g. L-ferritin IRE) cause high ferritin without iron overload [^115pf4Z2]. Ferroportin disease causes iron accumulation and elevated ferritin with low serum iron due to impaired export [^115pf4Z2].

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis requires a **comprehensive evaluation**:

- **Iron studies**: Serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) [^111wbP4h].

- **Inflammatory markers**: C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [^114G1cVV].

- **Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)**: Elevated in iron deficiency, not affected by inflammation; sTfR/log ferritin index > 2 suggests iron deficiency with inflammation [^114MZmUH] [^115iRmFf].

- **Hepcidin levels**: Elevated in inflammation, low in absolute iron deficiency [^111wSktU].

- **Liver function tests**: Assess for liver disease [^112t5EEr].

- **Genetic testing**: Consider in suspected hyperferritinemia syndromes [^115pf4Z2].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Treat underlying inflammation**: Address the cause of chronic inflammation or malignancy [^117Fk92E].

- **Iron supplementation**: IV iron preferred in inflammation or when oral iron fails; oral iron may be ineffective due to hepcidin-mediated blockade [^111vsMJh] [^117CPYjP].

- **Monitor ferritin and TSAT**: Guide therapy and avoid iron overload [^116RmEyQ].

- **Genetic counseling**: For hereditary hyperferritinemia syndromes [^notfound].

---

Low iron with high ferritin most often reflects **ACD**, but liver disease, malignancy, and genetic syndromes must be considered. Accurate diagnosis relies on TSAT, CRP, and sTfR, and management should target the cause while using IV iron when iron deficiency coexists with inflammation.

### Oral iron supplements for children in malaria-endemic areas [^112X1PKv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia relies mainly on the measurement of a person's haemoglobin, iron, and ferritin (Pasricha 2013). The measurement of haemoglobin alone is not sufficiently sensitive (due to overlapping values in iron‐replete and iron‐deficient individuals) and is not specific because of the numerous causes of anaemia in developing countries. Ferritin is the most commonly accepted measure of iron status (Mei 2005). However, there is a complex interaction between infection, inflammation (even when subclinical), and ferritin. Infection and inflammation increase ferritin, which is an acute phase reactant. The increase is proportional to the baseline ferritin levels and available iron stores (Thurnham 2010). It decreases only slowly after the resolution of infection and remains elevated in the convalescent phases of infection. Thus, in developing countries it is difficult to interpret ferritin levels and their use as a biomarker of iron deficiency may underestimate the true prevalence of iron deficiency (Nyakeriga 2004; Zimmermann 2005). Other biomarkers or combinations of biomarkers have been suggested for the assessment of iron deficiency in locations with a high prevalence of infection. These include the serum transferrin receptor, zinc protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation, and the ratio of serum transferrin receptor to serum ferritin (Lynch 2011), as well as the adjustment of ferritin to C‐reactive protein or alpha1‐acid glycoprotein levels, or both (Mburu 2008; Thurnham 2010). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend the use of concurrent measurements of haemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin receptor to assess the iron status of a group (WHO/CDC 2004; WHO 2011b). The concurrent measurement of the inflammatory markers C‐reactive protein and alpha1‐acid glycoprotein facilitates the interpretation of ferritin levels. However, the exclusion of children with elevated markers of inflammation from iron deficiency assessment is not reasonable, since up to 69% of children in malaria‐endemic areas may have elevated markers of inflammation (Darboe 2007).

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation. Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status. This study also underscores the limitations of ferritin, particularly its low sensitivity. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L, the specificity rates were impressively high at 97% for females and 99% for males, but the sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. This indicates that while a ferritin of 30 μg/L or lower is highly specific for low or absent bone marrow iron, it is not sensitive enough to detect all cases of low iron stores, especially in patients with comorbid conditions that can increase ferritin levels. It is important to recognize that in this study, there were females with serum ferritin > 1750 μg/L and males with serum ferritin > 4967 μg/L who had low or absent bone marrow iron stores.

Guideline 2.2.1

We recommend that ESA or HIF-PHI therapy should not be initiated in the presence of absolute iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 mcg/L in NDD-CKD and < 200 mcg/L in DD-CKD) or functional Iron deficiency (TSAT < 20% will normal or elevated ferritin levels) until this is corrected and anaemia persists. Iron supplements should be given prior to or when initiating ESA or HIF-PHI therapy. (1B)

Guideline 2.2.2

We suggest that to define functional iron deficiency (FID) ("iron restricted erythropoiesis"), a TSAT < 20% in people with NDD-CKD or maintained on PD, and in those receiving HD be used. Normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation. (2B)

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — anemia definition and ferritin threshold context note that in adults with anemia, defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in nonpregnant women, determining iron deficiency is an important step, and diagnosing iron deficiency has proposed ferritin cutoff values ranging from 15 to 100 ng/mL; studies that use bone marrow biopsy as the gold standard have defined the sensitivity and specificity of ferritin levels at different cutoff values.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

DMT1 deficiency causes microcytic hypochromic anemia due to decreased erythroid iron utilization. Anemia is present from birth.

Cardiac risk biomarkers in β-thalassemia major — serum ferritin trends indicate that long-term elevations predict cardiac mortality, but single measurements may mislead; a ferritin level > 2500 μg/L indicates raised risk, risk is increased even down to 1000 μg/L, and a low ferritin does not guarantee freedom from heart failure (HF); inflammation, infection or vitamin C deficiency can alter ferritin, so individual serum ferritin may not reflect total body iron load or cardiac risk.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^114G1cVV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^1153TVnp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Different metabolic and hematological abnormalities often associate with different chronic liver diseases. Both iron overload and iron deficient anemia are reported in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC).

Iron overload in LC seems to be due, at least in part, to reduced hepcidin levels caused by decreased synthetic capacity of hepatocytes. The role of hepcidin is to inhibit iron uptake by ferroportin in the basal membrane of enterocytes. Therefore, decreased hepcidin concentration leads to increased iron uptake. Additionally, infection/inflammation also decreases hepcidin levels. Endotoxemia, driven by bacterial translocation, is common in LC and maintains a chronic inflammatory state in these patients. At the same time, since cirrhosis is an immune suppressed condition, especially in the later decompensated state of the disease, infections appear more frequently and show a more severe course in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy population. Thus, in LC, hepcidin synthesis can be suppressed both chronically (deteriorating liver function and chronic inflammation) and acutely (infections), leading to increased iron absorption and elevated free iron levels. Iron, loaded in the liver cells or macrophages, was shown to be toxic, potentiates oxidative stress and induces peroxidation, resulting in further liver cell damage.

On the other hand, acute and chronic bleedings are common in cirrhotic patients. Portal hypertension and instable hemostasis increase the risk of variceal bleeding, portal hypertensive gastropathy, gastric antral vascular ectasia and peptic ulcer bleeding. Malabsorption may also be present in cirrhotic individuals contributing to reduced iron storages. Iron deficiency in return was shown to contribute to lipid, glucose and nutrient metabolic dysfunction, as well as induction of cell apoptosis.

Serum ferritin level is a sensitive marker of iron homeostasis in the healthy population; reduced iron levels are associated with low ferritin, while iron overload results in higher serum ferritin concentrations, by modulating iron-response elements and their binding proteins. However, in cirrhosis, the interpretation of ferritin level is more complicated since ferritin is an acute phase protein. Therefore, its concentration also increases due to inflammation. As discussed above, both inflammation and iron overload might be present in LC. Accordingly, elevated hepatic and serum ferritin levels are consistently reported in chronic liver diseases.

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a transferrin saturation < 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or maintained on peritoneal dialysis and in those receiving hemodialysis. Recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of preoperative anemia (thresholds), BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to view ferritin levels of 30–100 mcg/L with a low transferrin saturation (< 20%) as indicative of possible iron depletion or deficiency in the context of inflammation that may benefit from iron supplementation.

### Clinical experience with ferric carboxymaltose in the treatment of cancer-and chemotherapy-associated anaemia [^1112cqiu]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Since patients with baseline serum ferritin levels < 100 ng/ml achieved a more rapid Hb increase, low baseline ferritin is a good indicator of depleted iron stores and predicts rapid treatment response. These patients can benefit most from i.v. iron therapy. Furthermore, the observed Hb improvement in patients with low mean baseline TSAT (14.2%) and ferritin baseline levels up to 500 ng/ml confirms that cancer patients can experience a shortage in available iron despite elevated ferritin levels (FID). Accordingly, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend the concomitant use of i.v. iron and ESAs in patients with ferritin up to 800 ng/ml, if TSAT is < 20%. Patients with FID can particularly benefit from i.v. iron treatment. Currently, only a small proportion of patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia are treated with iron, and the majority of these receive oral iron, although this is less effective in patients with FID and associated with gastrointestinal intolerance and poor compliance.

Higher baseline TSAT levels (28.8%) and more advanced disease in patients with serum ferritin > 500 ng/ml might be the reason why this subgroup of patients showed a slower response to iron treatment, although they received a higher total dose per patient. Notably, Hb responders in this population had a lower mean baseline TSAT than non-responders. However, the number of patients in this subpopulation is too low to draw conclusions on the predictive role of TSAT in patients with ongoing acute-phase reactions. Observed fluctuations in Hb levels may be a consequence of the small patient numbers in this group.

In general, FCM at total iron doses of 600–1500 mg was well tolerated. ADRs were recorded for only 14 (2.3%) patients, and the mortality and completion rate are in line with a population of cancer patients in which 27.9% were receiving second-line or higher anti-tumour therapy, and 64.2% had metastatic disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, more specifically with respect to MRI, MHF-CG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a noninvasive estimation of iron concentration in the liver by MRI in the context of a clinical trial, given the initial evidence that serum levels of ferritin might be associated with iron accumulation in tissue in patients with stable metabolic hyperferritinemia. Consider obtaining it in patients with high serum levels of ferritin (grade 2, but in particular, grade 3) and/or additional clinical risk factors for iron overload. Prefer iron concentration in tissues over serum ferritin levels, when available, for grading metabolic hyperferritinemia.

### Unexplained isolated hyperferritinemia without iron overload [^113NsueP]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Although hyperferritinemia may be reflective of elevated total body iron stores, there are conditions in which ferritin levels are disproportionately elevated relative to iron status. Autosomal dominant forms of hyperferritinemia due to mutations in the L-ferritin IRE or in A helix of L-ferritin gene have been described, however cases of isolated hyperferritinemia still remain unsolved. We describe 12 Italian subjects with unexplained isolated hyperferritinemia (UIH). Four probands have affected siblings, but no affected parents or offspring. Sequencing analyses did not identify casual mutations in ferritin gene or IRE regions. These patients had normal levels of intracellular ferritin protein and mRNA in peripheral blood cells excluding pathological ferritin production at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In contrast with individuals with benign hyperferritinemia caused by mutations affecting the ferritin A helix, low rather than high glycosylation of serum ferritin was observed in our UIH subjects compared with controls. These findings suggest that subjects with UIH have a previously undescribed form of hyperferritinemia possibly attributable to increased cellular ferritin secretion and/or decreased serum ferritin clearance. The cause remains to be defined and we can only speculate the existence of mutations in gene/s not directly implicated in iron metabolism that could affect ferritin turnover including ferritin secretion.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^116RmEyQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to measure serum ferritin levels in the assessment and management of patients with all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, including functional iron deficiency. View values < 12 mcg/L indicative for absent iron stores.
Do not exclude the possibility of functional iron deficiency in case of values as high as 1,200 mcg/L in patients with CKD, and recognize that some such patients may respond to IV iron therapy. View a serum ferritin concentration of < 100 mcg/L in non-dialysis patients or < 200 mcg/L in chronic hemodialysis patients as predictive of iron deficiency and potentially good response to IV iron therapy.
Do not use values above the suggested cut-offs to guide iron therapy. Use serum ferritin values > 1,200 mcg/L to ascertain obtaining evaluation for potential iron overload.

### Serum hepcidin levels are innately low in HFE-related haemochromatosis but differ between C282Y-homozygotes with elevated and normal ferritin levels [^117WWH3c]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

HFE C282Y-homozygosity has been associated with low hepcidin expression, leading to increased ferritin levels. However, serum hepcidin protein levels have not been documented in humans. In the current study, we compared serum hepcidin levels of newly diagnosed HFE C282Y-homozygotes with (N = 15) and without (N = 7) elevated serum ferritin levels to levels of 40 controls (20 heterozygotes and 20 wild types). In addition, hepcidin levels of four C282Y homozygotes were investigated during the course of all phlebotomy treatment phases. Serum hepcidin levels were lower in HFE C282Y-homozygotes (median; 25th-75th percentile: 1.88; 0.78–2.77 nmol/l) compared to controls (2.74; 1.45–5.39). Hepcidin/ferritin ratios were also lower in homozygotes. Homozygotes with an elevated serum ferritin had a higher serum hepcidin but a lower hepcidin/ferritin ratio than those with normal ferritin (2.28; 1.62–3.23 nmol/l hepcidin vs. 0.80; 0.60–1.29 and 3.63; 2.72–7.59 pmol hepcidin/microg ferritin vs. 13.2; 5.15–14.2). Serum hepcidin decreased during the depletion phase of phlebotomy and remained low during maintenance. This study showed that serum hepcidin is innately low in HFE-related haemochromatosis. Elevated ferritin levels were associated with increased hepcidin levels while erythropoiesis lead to lower hepcidin levels. During depletion, therefore, hepcidin levels are decreased, which may exacerbate intestinal iron absorption.

### Combined high serum ferritin and low iron saturation in hemodialysis patients: the role of inflammation [^1139RudT]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Serum ferritin, frequently used as a marker of iron status in individuals with chronic kidney disease, is also an inflammatory marker. The concurrent combination of high serum ferritin and low iron saturation ratio (ISAT) usually poses a diagnostic dilemma. We hypothesized that serum ferritin ≥ 500 ng/ml, especially in the seemingly paradoxical presence of ISAT level < 25%, is more strongly associated with inflammation than with iron in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In 789 MHD patients in the Los Angeles area, the association of serum ferritin ≥ 500 ng/ml with inflammatory markers, including IL-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein levels, and malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS) was examined.

Results

After multivariate adjustment for case-mix and other measures of malnutrition-inflammation complex, MHD patients with serum ferritin ≥ 500 ng/ml and ISAT < 25% had higher odds ratio for serum C-reactive protein ≥ 10 mg/L. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the continuum of ISAT and IL-6 in detecting a serum ferritin ≥ 500 ng/ml were identical (0.57 versus 0.56, P = 0.7). The combination of IL-6 with ISAT yielded a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.61) than either ISAT or IL-6 alone (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively).

Conclusion

In MHD patients, ferritin values above 500 ng/ml, especially in paradoxical conjunction with low ISAT, are associated with inflammation. Strategies to dissociate inflammation from iron metabolism to mitigate the confounding impact of inflammation on iron and to improve iron treatment responsiveness may improve anemia management in chronic kidney disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115iRmFf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

ID anemia in IBD patients

Low serum ferritin levels (< 30 µg/L), high transferrin levels and a decreased MCV index are routinely used to screen for ID. In IBD-patients, these parameters may not always allow for reliable conclusions, because of overlapping causes of anemia and multiple confounding factors (see above). In particular, active inflammation can result in falsely normal or elevated ferritin levels as part of an acute-phase reaction. Under chronic inflammatory conditions, other parameters of low iron stores are also less interpretable, as a result of changes such as increased platelet counts or low transferrin levels. In these cases, it is important to consider that serum ferritin levels up to 100 µg/L do not adequately exclude ID. Therefore, the concentration of sTfR may indicate the status of iron supply more precisely, since this parameter is not influenced by chronic inflammation. Recently, the ratio of sTfR to the logarithm of serum ferritin (sTfR/log ferritin index) has been reported as providing more accuracy in differentiating ID anemia from ACD. For example, a prospective multicenter observational trial in a cohort of 145 non-IBD patients with anemia demonstrated the utility of the sTfR/log ferritin index. Skikne et al demonstrated that subjects with ID anemia or ACD + ID anemia had significantly higher sTfR and sTfR/log ferritin index values than subjects with ACD. ROC curves produced cutoffs of 21 nmol/L for sTfR and 14 (using nmol/L) for the sTfR/log ferritin index. The sTfR/log ferritin index was superior to sTfR.

ACD in IBD patients

Functional ID is a state in which there is insufficient iron incorporation during erythropoiesis, despite normal total body iron stores, and it is a major component of ACD. Therefore, besides "true" ID anemia, functional ID should be considered if serum ferritin is > 100 µg/L and TfS below 20%. Again, sTfR/log ferritin may help discriminate absolute from functional ID anemia. In patients with evidence of inflammation and intermediate serum ferritin levels (< 100 µg/L but > 30 µg/L), a value of sTfR/log ferritin > 2 may indicate a combined anemic status, whereas a ratio < 2 is consistent with normal total body iron stores.

### Serum transferrin receptor [^114MZmUH]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Transferrin receptors (TfRs) are the conventional pathway by which cells acquire iron for physiological requirements. Under iron-deficient conditions there is an increased concentration of surface TfR, especially on bone marrow erythroid precursors, as a mechanism to sequester needed iron. TfRs are also present in the circulation, and the circulating serum TfR (sTfR) level reflects total body TfR concentration. Under normal conditions erythroid precursors are the main source of sTfR. Disorders of the bone marrow with reduced erythroid precursors are associated with low sTfR levels. The sTfR concentration begins to rise early in iron deficiency with the onset of iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and continues to rise as iron-deficient erythropoiesis progressively worsens, prior to the development of anemia. The sTfR level does not increase in anemia of chronic inflammation, but is increased when anemia of chronic inflammation is combined with iron deficiency. The sTfR level is also increased in patients with expanded erythropoiesis, including hemolytic anemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, and use of erythropoietic stimulating agents. The ratio of sTfR/ferritin can be used to quantify the entire spectrum of iron status from positive iron stores through negative iron balance, and is particularly useful in evaluating iron status in population studies. The sTfR/log ferritin ratio is valuable for distinguishing anemia of chronic inflammation from iron deficiency anemia, whether the latter occurs alone or in combination with anemia of chronic inflammation.

### A comprehensive vision for intravenous iron therapy [^1133mjD8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Commonly used iron indices, such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), have limited utility in patients with chronic kidney disease. Both dialysis and nondialysis patients may have normal to high serum ferritin levels and little or no iron available for erythropoiesis. Inflammation can result in increased serum ferritin level and low TSAT and restrict the ability to mobilize iron stores. Management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease requires recognizing that not only decreased erythropoietin production, but also decreased iron availability, can lead to anemia. The Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) trial showed the efficacy of intravenous (IV) iron in anemic hemodialysis patients with serum ferritin levels of 500 to 1,200 ng/mL and TSAT of 25% or less receiving adequate erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses. Withholding iron from these patients resulted in worsening iron-restricted erythropoiesis. To improve anemia management in patients receiving hemodialysis and being treated with ESAs, clinicians should consider the benefits of IV iron.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Identification of three mechanistic pathways for iron-deficient heart failure [^117CPYjP]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Inflammation-related hypoferraemia exacerbates skeletal muscle iron depletion and can contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities and exercise intolerance in heart failure

Given these vulnerable conditions, it is noteworthy that the systemic inflammatory state in heart failure cannot only interfere with skeletal muscle function, but it can also impair the ability of existing total iron body stores to be mobilized, leading to a state of functional iron deficiency. Functional iron deficiency is characterized by heightened expression of systemic hepcidin, and an increase in circulating hepcidin impairs the action of ferroportin to allow for iron export out of duodenal enterocytes, hepatocytes, and the reticuloendothelial system. Impairment of the release of iron from macrophages creates a particularly problematic state, since the recycling of iron from senescent erythrocytes following macrophage engulfment provides > 90% of the daily iron requirements for haemoglobin synthesis and erythropoiesis. If iron is trapped in the reticuloendothelial system, circulating iron declines, but increased hepcidin inhibits the export of iron from erythroblasts, thus preserving erythropoiesis.

As a result, functional iron deficiency is characterized by a decrease in TSAT (< ≈20%), which is often accompanied by a mild normochromic and normocytic anaemia or occurs without anaemia. Many patients with heart failure have a TSAT < 20%, elevated serum hepcidin and proinflammatory biomarkers, macrophage iron trapping in the bone marrow, and haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels in the normal range. Elevated levels of hepcidin explain why — following oral iron supplementation — patients with heart failure do not show an improvement in exercise capacity, and only a minority (those without systemic inflammation and preserved gastrointestinal absorption) show changes in TSAT or serum ferritin. Furthermore, higher serum ferritin levels (which are closely related to skeletal muscle ferritin but inversely related to skeletal muscle TfR1,) cause intracellular sequestration and further depletion of cytosolic Fe 2+. Therefore, in patients with heart failure, modest hypoferraemia — insufficient to cause anaemia — may trigger a disproportionate depletion of intracellular iron within skeletal myocytes, especially when inflammation or immobilization (acting in concert) have already drained the cytosolic iron pool. Interestingly, experimentally and clinically induced muscle immobilization — perhaps by promoting inflammation — may lead to increased hepcidin and hypoferraemia. It is therefore noteworthy that there is a consistent association of systemic inflammation and iron deficiency in prospectively defined cohorts of patients with heart failure, particularly in those with the most marked degrees of exercise intolerance.

### Elevated serum iron level is a predictor of prognosis in ICU patients with acute kidney injury [^111gfMVJ]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition, our study found that transferrin was associated with increased survival rates of patients with AKI. Transferrin is an iron-binding blood plasma glycoprotein that controls the level of free iron in body fluids. Recently, it has been shown to be a good indicator of organ failure; elevated transferrin levels have been associated with a reduction in the short-time mortality of patients with decompensated cirrhosis and low serum transferrin levels have been associated with an increased risk in patients with sepsis. As the main protein that binds and transports iron into the circulatory system, transferrin may decrease iron-mediated cell injury by increasingly combining with overloaded iron. The potential mechanisms behind this require further investigation.

Ferritin, an iron binding protein whose function is to store iron in tissue, has the ability to sequester large amounts of intracellular iron and thereby prevent oxidative cellular damage. In humans, there are conflicting reports on the role of ferritin in AKI. Several studies have demonstrated the protective effect of ferritin heavy chain on renal function. Some studies have shown that lower levels of ferritin are associated with increased morbidity of AKI after cardiopulmonary bypass. Dimitrijevic ZM, et al. reported that elevated serum ferritin levels favour renal function recovery, but this association was not observed in another study of 120 patients. The latter observation was consistent with our study, in which ferritin had no significant correlation with mortality in ICU patients with AKI. Disturbances in cellular and systemic iron balance and AKI may affect each other as the kidney is an important player in preventing iron loss from the body by reabsorption. Different tubular segments play different roles in handling iron; the proximal tubule has the maximum reabsorption capacity. The kidney reabsorbs iron, even when systemic iron levels are high. Studies have shown that levels of catalytic iron in urine increased, rather than decreased, in AKI patients, but body iron stores are not low in AKI patients. The iron-mediated mechanisms underlying AKI are complex and may include multiple pathways. Excess iron is associated with OS, and production of oxygen free radicals causes damage to lipids, DNA, and proteins; renal tubular epithelial cells are particularly vulnerable to OS due to the high number of mitochondria in these cells. In a rat model of acute ischaemia, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by OS was seen to lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Free iron can amplify the inflammatory response through the intracellular uptake and catabolism of damaged stored red blood cells via the monocyte-macrophage system. This is amplified by the fact that the inflammatory response is important in the pathogenesis of AKI. Iron-mediated OS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory responses are possible mechanisms of AKI. Ferroptosis has also been considered a central player in AKI, characterized by the accumulation of lethal lipid ROS produced by iron-mediated lipid peroxidation. The excess iron in AKI may arise from degraded red blood cells, iron release from ferritin, and from mitochondria rich in haem and non-haem iron.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113CLG4W]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy — diagnosis and initial management begin with serological testing, where serum transferrin saturation (serum iron/total iron binding capacity of > 45%) and elevated serum ferritin > 200 µg/L in men or > 150 µg/L in women supports the diagnosis; if HH is suspected, especially with a known family history, testing for the HH genotype should be performed. Diagnosis of cardiac iron overload is possible with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in which a decreased T2 signal correlates with myocardial iron infiltration and depressed left ventricular function. The established treatment for HH is phlebotomy, and in secondary iron overload, there is a role for chelation therapy.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^111nbrx1]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One-fourth of the world's population is currently having anemia. Anemia is defined by the World Health Organization as hemoglobin concentration < 130 g/L for males, 120 g/L for nonpregnant females, and 110 g/L for pregnant females. The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which contributes to approximately half of the cases in females worldwide and more than half of the cases in high-income regions. Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. In addition, reliable detection of iron deficiency is clinically important because it may indicate other diseases such as gastrointestinal cancer.

Given that iron is stored in the bone marrow, bone marrow aspiration has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing iron deficiency, but it is invasive and costly. More commonly, surrogate plasma or serum biomarkers are used to assess anemia and iron stores: ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and hemoglobin and erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV). These biomarkers have high diagnostic accuracy value in healthy adult population in diagnosing IDA. However, interpretation of these laboratory tests is not always straightforward, with multiple confounding factors, including patient-specific, preanalytical, and analytical laboratory assay considerations. For example, inflammation can increase ferritin concentrations and decrease TSAT, and erythropoietic activity affects sTfR levels. Cutoffs are dependent on the reference population and laboratory methods, and consensus on their use in patients with comorbidities (eg, inflammation or cancer) is lacking.

Of these laboratory tests, ferritin has been compared most with bone marrow iron stores in published studies. However, although a recent systematic reviewincluded 6059 patients with ferritin and bone marrow iron data, the diagnostic efficacy of the commonly used decision-making cutoff of 30 μg/Lwas studied in only 512 participants. Other studied cutoffs were heterogenous, ranging from 12 to 200 μg/L. Although ferritin has demonstrated satisfactory specificity in most cutoffs, its sensitivity has been inadequate. Consequently, patients with iron deficiency may present with elevated ferritin levels.

We aimed to assess the agreement of iron biomarkers ferritin, TSAT, sTfR, and MCV with the gold standard bone marrow Prussian blue stain on iron stores in a large real-life population of patients with hematologic disorders. Furthermore, we aimed to determine predictive values for single biomarkers and multivariate models for iron deficiency prediction and to illustrate them.

The commentary highlights data that intravenous iron given to patients with ferritin > 500 ng/mL reduced ESA doses and costs, and states a therapeutic trial of IV iron (or oral iron in CKD ND) "should be considered when TSAT is low (≤ 30%), even if ferritin concentration is above 500 ng/mL". It also states "there are currently no data available that suggest long-term IV iron administration in moderate doses causes worse outcomes", and that "Hb response to iron therapy, TSAT, and ferritin should be monitored closely and further iron therapy titrated accordingly".

### Importance of ferritin for optimizing anemia therapy in chronic kidney disease [^113SAR2s]. American Journal of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of serum ferritin in monitoring the iron status of patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) has become suspected. In this review, we reassess the interpretation of high serum ferritin values in such patients, with the goal of treating their anemia in a safe way. From the observations that (1) H-ferritin gene transcription is predominantly active in inflammatory conditions, whereas L-ferritin is induced only after exposure to very high iron concentrations and is preferentially secreted to plasma from hepatocytes; (2) the expression of both types of ferritin proteins are exclusively dependent on intracellular free iron, which is often sequestered by LPS or cytokines in several cell types, and (3) splenic iron is depleted and serum ferritin does not increase in the combined conditions of both inflammation and iron deficiency, it is deduced that elevated serum ferritin levels are caused by the accumulation of intracellular iron, especially reticuloendothelial cells or macrophages, hepatocytes, and other cells, while cytokines or inflammation might modulate the relative ratio of ferritin to body iron storage. Therefore, high levels of serum ferritin in patients on MHD can be used to indicate iron deposition in most cells, including vascular and immunocompetent cells, and is still a reliable indicator of the need to withhold iron administration.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis [^114sGJEd]. Genetics in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

In populations of northern European descent, the p.C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is highly prevalent, and HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common type of inherited iron overload disorder. Inappropriate low secretion of hepcidin, which negatively regulates iron absorption, is postulated to be the mechanism for iron overload in this condition. The characteristic biochemical abnormalities are elevated serum transferrin-iron saturation and serum ferritin. Typical clinical manifestations include cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, diabetes mellitus, restrictive cardiomyopathy and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. Most patients are now diagnosed before the development of these clinical features. Molecular genetic tests are currently available for genotypic diagnosis. In selected individuals, diagnosis might require liver biopsy or quantitative phlebotomy. Iron depletion by phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment and is highly effective in preventing the complications of iron overload if instituted before the development of cirrhosis. Genetic testing is currently not recommended for population screening because of low yield as the majority of the healthy, asymptomatic p.C282Y homozygotes do not develop clinically significant iron overload. HFE gene testing remains an excellent tool for the screening of first-degree relatives of affected probands who are p.C282Y homozygotes.

### Erythropoietin (Procrit) [^116Zov3Q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosing Information

Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating PROCRIT. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

Selection of Formulation

In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

2.2 Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse reactions [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].

### A European patient record study on diagnosis and treatment of chemotherapy-induced anaemia [^115UMdYh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with cancer frequently experience chemotherapy-induced or cancer-related anaemia and iron deficiency (ID). Anaemia adds a substantial burden to these patients already affected by cancer and its treatment. ID is a major component in the pathogenesis of anaemia in cancer patients and has been estimated to affect 19–63% of patients with different tumour types. The prevalence of ID increases with progression of the disease and correlates with the prevalence of anaemia.

Impaired iron homeostasis (a common feature in chronic disease), chronic blood loss and nutritional deficiencies (e.g. cancer-induced anorexia) are the main causes of ID in cancer patients. Early diagnosis and management of ID is important to reduce the risk of anaemia and improve patient care. Biological iron status markers include serum ferritin, which reflects storage iron under non-inflammatory conditions, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), reflecting circulating iron that is available for erythropoiesis. A low TSAT is related to both absolute and functional iron deficiency. In absolute ID, iron stores are depleted (serum ferritin ≤ 100 ng/mL in patients with inflammation, including cancer). Functional ID is characterised by a lack of available iron (TSAT ≤ 20%) despite normal or elevated serum ferritin. Most iron-deficient cancer patients present with functional ID.

Historically, anaemia in cancer patients was treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). However, a substantial proportion of anaemic cancer patients remain unresponsive to ESA treatment, and over recent years, evidence has accumulated that RBC transfusions, as well as ESA use outside the current label and guidelines, can increase all-cause mortality. Current guidelines therefore recommend preventing RBC transfusions and using ESAs with the lowest effective dose and in approved indications only.

In ESA-treated patients with functional ID, concomitant administration of intravenous (i.v.) iron should be considered. Several controlled clinical trials have shown that i.v. iron supplementation of ESA therapy enhances haematological response and may be effective in reducing ESA doses and transfusion requirements. In contrast, administration of oral iron showed less or no effect in comparative trials.

This cross-sectional study evaluated the routine practice in the diagnosis and treatment of anaemia and ID in patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia (CIA) and the implementation of anaemia treatment guidelines into practical management.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^114aKFku]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

### Iron status of the free-living, elderly framingham heart study cohort: an iron-replete population with a high prevalence of elevated iron stores [^1166TELi]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although iron deficiency occurs commonly in vulnerable groups of women of reproductive age, infants, and children, less is known about the iron nutriture of the elderly.

Objective

Our objective was to evaluate the iron status of a noninstitutionalized, elderly US population, with a particular focus on 2 concerns unique to the elderly: 1) potential confounding effects of chronic disease on iron measures and 2) increased occurrence of elevated iron stores.

Design

Multiple iron measures, including serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, mean cell volume, and hemoglobin, were used to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID), iron deficiency anemia (IDA), and other measures of iron nutriture in 1016 elderly white Americans aged 67–96 y from the Framingham Heart Study. "Diseased" subjects were defined as those with possible pathologically altered iron measures due to inflammation, infection, elevated liver enzymes, hereditary hemochromatosis, or cancer. The effect of altered iron status on various prevalence estimates was assessed.

Results

The elderly subjects had a low prevalence of ID (2.7%), IDA (1.2%), and depleted iron stores (3%; SF < 12 microg/L). In contrast, 12.9% had elevated iron stores (SF > 300 microg/L in men and SF > 200 microg/L in women), of which only 1% was attributable to chronic disease. The prevalence of ID, IDA, and depleted iron stores was unaffected by the presence of chronic disease.

Conclusions

The Framingham Heart Study cohort is an iron-replete elderly population with a high prevalence of elevated iron stores in contrast with a low prevalence of iron deficiency, with insignificant effects of chronic disease on these iron status estimates. The likely liability in iron nutriture in free-living, elderly white Americans eating a Western diet is high iron stores, not iron deficiency.

### Iron deficiency in adults: a review [^111vsMJh]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Observations

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency. The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%), HF (37%-61%), and cancer (18%-82%). Testing for iron deficiency is indicated for patients with anemia and/or symptoms of iron deficiency (fatigue, pica, or restless legs syndrome) and should be considered for those with risk factors such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, or IBD. Iron deficiency is diagnosed by low serum ferritin (typically < 30 ng/mL) in individuals without inflammatory conditions or by transferrin saturation (iron/total iron binding capacity×100) less than 20%. Causes of iron deficiency should be identified and treated. Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg/d or on alternate days) is typically first-line therapy. Intravenous iron is indicated for patients with oral iron intolerance, poor absorption (celiac disease, post-bariatric surgical procedure), chronic inflammatory conditions (CKD, HF, IBD, cancer), ongoing blood loss, and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are common conditions that may cause symptoms such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Ferritin and/or transferrin saturation are required for diagnosis and screening. Oral iron is first-line therapy for most patients. Intravenous iron is used for individuals who do not tolerate or have impaired absorption of oral iron, those with ongoing blood loss, certain chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, CKD, HF, cancer), and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

### Association between serum phosphate levels and anemia in non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease: a retrospective cross-sectional study from the fuji city CKD network [^111AftSG]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, we performed a multivariate linear regression analysis, including iron kinetics and inflammation in a group of patients without any treatment effect on anemia and CKD-MBD, to eliminate the impact of treatment as far as possible. Our results showed a significant correlation between high serum phosphate levels and anemia, even after adjusting the effects of factors already known to be involved in anemia, such as renal function, nutritional status, and iron metabolism. This finding underscores the possibility of mechanistic overlap between CKD-MBD and anemia.

The subgroup analysis showed a robust correlation between high serum phosphate levels and anemia in the low-ferritin and CKD stage 4–5 groups, indicating a possible interaction of association between high serum phosphate levels and anemia in these groups. Nevertheless, both eGFR and ferritin level were not significant in the test of interaction (P = 0.336 and P = 0.398, respectively). However, the sample size in this study was not adequately powerful for conclusive interaction test results; thus, these interactions cannot be ruled out. Concerning the physiological mechanism of the interaction between phosphate and ferritin, iron deficiency may strengthen the association between CKD-MBD and anemia through FGF23, whose level is elevated during iron deficiency. Unfortunately, no subgroup analysis of iron kinetics was conducted in previous studies, making it difficult to compare the results. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that iron-deficient patients with CKD may benefit from appropriate iron supplementation and strict management of CKD-MBD to prevent the development and progression of renal anemia. In contrast, the possibility of an interaction between phosphate and renal function may indicate that it is difficult to generalize the present results to the entire non-dialysis CKD population.

### Iron deficiency-not only a premenopausal topic after bariatric surgery? [^112DTbJt]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite exceeding the reference intakes of the normal population by more than 7 times with the supplementation of at least 70 mg of iron per day, no postmenopausal woman and only one man at 6 months post surgery had elevated ferritin values. The premenopausal women exceeded their reference intake by more than 3 times but had a higher prevalence of patients with elevated ferritin levels, although it also remained relatively low (data not shown). It has to be mentioned, however, that the patient numbers were little and even decreased over the investigated period.

Including all follow-up records with documented supplementation, on average, men in this study took in 43.53 mg of iron per day, and pre- and postmenopausal women took in 69.08 mg and 53.60 mg iron per day, respectively. The increasement of the prevalence of patients with iron deficiency suggests that all cohorts should take in a higher amount of iron. Considering the low percentage of excess ferritin levels in both pre- and postmenopausal women, the risk of iron overload even with a higher intake of iron supplements is low.

In this present analysis, different cut-off values for the three groups were used to define iron deficiency. Some authors claim that there is no objective evidence for different reference ranges for men and women as there is no evidence that women have lower requirements of iron. When applying a cut-off value for ferritin of 30 μg/L instead of 15 μg/L to define iron deficiency in premenopausal women, the difference between the cohorts becomes more apparent. Thirty-six months after surgery, the prevalence of iron deficiency of the premenopausal women rises from 68.4 to 78.9%. Other authors however showed that haematological parameters indicating a state of iron deficiency changed at higher serum ferritin levels in postmenopausal women than they did in premenopausal women. Therefore, the authors propose using different cut-off values of ferritin in pre- and postmenopausal women.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. hematological abnormalities [^113YLrwi]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.7. Anemia

The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which can affect any patient with inadequate dietary intake of iron, or reduced iron absorption. CBC will typically reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia as evidenced by a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), respectively. Iron deficiency can be confirmed with a reduced serum ferritin. However, it should be noted that ferritin levels are often artificially elevated in the presence of systemic inflammation or kidney disease, so a normal or even elevated serum ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. In this setting, iron studies can provide further information, but are often susceptible to similar changes in the setting of inflammation.

Anemia of chronic disease can occur in any disorder where there is co-existent chronic inflammation. In a study of hematological abnormalities in 319 patients with IMDs in Turkey, anemia of chronic disease was the most common hematological finding encountered. This is usually characterized by a normocytic, normochromic anemia, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease involves iron-restricted erythropoiesis due to upregulation of hepcidin. Increased red cell turnover and reduced production of erythropoietin also play a role in the pathogenesis. Iron deficiency anemia frequently co-exists with anemia of chronic disease, and it can be very challenging to diagnose in this setting, as the serum ferritin is unreliable. Novel red cell indices available on modern automated blood count analyzer such as the reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration (RET–He) and the percentage of hypochromic reticulocytes (%HYPO) can predict functional iron deficiency where the ferritin is unreliable, and predict response to iron replacement.

### Ferroportin disease: pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^115pf4Z2]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 4.
Diagnostic algorithm for Ferroportin Disease and hereditary hyperferritinemia. ACD/AI: anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation. *Gaucher disease may present with or without siderosis depending on the disease stage. Advanced ACD/AI may also present with siderosis at MRI (usually spleen and bone marrow).

On the contrary, in subjects with increased serum ferritin and low or normal TS, the workup should focus on common causes of secondary hyperferritinemia and other rare causes of hereditary hyperferritinemia to confirm the diagnosis of FD (Figure 4). First, common causes of hyperferritinemia, such as metabolic disorders, inflammation, cancer, etc. should be considered. If they are not found, or if the hyperferritinemia persists after their treatment, the next step depends on whether or not anemia is present. In the absence of overt anemia, if liver and spleen iron content are increased at MRI or liver biopsy shows prominent Kupffer cell iron load, FD disease should be considered and genetic testing performed for confirmation of diagnosis (Figure 4). Another common cause of hereditary hyperferritinemia with normal TS associated with iron accumulation and anemia is Gaucher disease, usually associated with hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, abnormal coagulation, bone disease, and neuropathic manifestations.

In the absence of body iron accumulation, but in the presence of elevated SF levels and normal TS, autosomal dominant hyperferritinemia with cataract (due to mutations of the iron responsive element in the 5′ untranslated region of the L ferritin mRNA) or without cataract, should be considered. If overt anemia is present, but TS is normal/low, aceruloplasminemia should be suspected, a rare autosomal recessive disease due to loss of function mutations in ceruloplasmin (CP) and resulting in iron overload in the liver and pancreas, and progressive neurodegeneration, diabetes and retinal degeneration.

Brain MRI with typical iron accumulation in basal ganglia and thalamus may help confirm the diagnosis. As mentioned above, another rare genetic disease presenting with hyperferritinemia and anemia is atransferrinemia/hypotransferrinemiawhich, however, is characterized by increased transferrin saturation due to extremely low serum transferrin levels.

### Causes of ferritin elevation… [^114fuicn]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

In Reply Dr Lippi raises the important point that an elevated serum ferritin level may also be associated with underlying malignancy; it is true that ferritin may be elevated in a broad variety of other disease processes, as we noted in our JAMA Diagnostic Test Interpretation article. Elevated serum ferritin levels are commonly encountered in general practice and many elevations may be due to non–iron overload conditions. The patient described was a relatively healthy middle-aged man who was unexpectedly noted to have a markedly elevated ferritin level. The cited investigation by Moore et al1 retrospectively studied the underlying etiology of markedly elevated serum ferritin levels in a large group of patients at a tertiary care medical center, including patients with a range of cancers, infections, inflammatory conditions, and renal diseases. 1 This study population is distinctly different from the relatively healthy patient described in our article.

### Is obesity associated with anemia of chronic disease? A population-based study [^115rAxKV]. Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Obesity is characterized by chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation, which, in turn, has been associated with anemia of chronic disease. We hypothesized that obesity may be associated with the features of anemia of chronic disease, including low hemoglobin concentration, low serum iron and transferrin saturation (TS), and elevated serum ferritin. We compared normal-weight to overweight and obese adult participants of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with respect to hemoglobin concentration and levels of serum iron, TS, and ferritin. Measured BMI was used to categorize participants into normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m(2), n = 6,059), overweight (BMI 25 to < 30 kg/m(2), n = 5,108), mildly obese (BMI 30 to < 35 kg/m(2), n = 2,366), moderately obese (BMI 35 to < 40 kg/m(2), n = 850), and severely obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2), n = 465). After adjustment for age, gender, menstruation, race/ethnicity, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, blood donation, and dietary iron intake, serum ferritin was progressively higher with increasing BMI category, whereas serum iron and TS were progressively lower. However, compared to normal-weight persons, those in all other higher BMI categories did not have a significant change in hemoglobin concentration after adjustment for the above-mentioned confounders. Overweight and obesity were associated with changes in serum iron, TS, and ferritin that would be expected to occur in the setting of chronic, systemic inflammation. However, overweight and obese persons were not more likely to be anemic compared with normal-weight persons.

### Restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease: epidemiology, pathogenetic overlaps, and clinical management [^116q7qt1]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency

In PD patients with RLS, plasma ferritin levels are lower than PD, based on studies indicating that reduced serum ferritin may constitute a risk factor for RLS in these patients. Pathological examinations have shown that in RLS patients, iron depletion in dopaminergic regions (reduced ferritin staining) leads to reduced striatal dopaminergic function. Iron serves as a crucial cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), so that iron deficiency can directly impair dopamine synthesis. Additionally, dietary iron deficiency has been linked to reduced striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) function in both PD and RLS. The reduction in DAT function compromises dopamine reuptake in the synaptic cleft, leading to further decreases in intracellular dopamine levels.

However, iron content is elevated in the substantia nigra and basal ganglia of PD patients. As a potent oxidant, iron's redox activity may be a key factor in PD-related neuronal cell death. The specific mechanism may involve mitochondrial dysfunction in PD patients (e.g. due to environmental toxins or PINK1 gene mutations), which results in inadequate production of ATP and iron – sulfur clusters (ISCs). This triggers the activation of iron-regulating protein (IRP1), increases labile iron production, and generates excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the Fenton reaction. Ultimately, this leads to dopaminergic neuron death and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, iron deposition in PD creates a dopamine-deficient environment in the brain, establishing a pathological basis for the subsequent progression of RLS.

Combined with findings that PD + RLS patients have increased transferrin and decreased cerebrospinal fluid iron, ferritin, dopamine (DA), and 5-HT levels, RLS in PD patients may result from dysfunction of iron transport, binding, and storage in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This dysfunction mediates iron deficiency in relevant brain regions, leading to decreased DA and 5-HT levels and ultimately causing RLS in PD patients.

### Iron supplementation in pregnant sicklers: an opinion [^112ibN8G]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency in pregnant Sicklers

The gold standard for the diagnosis of iron deficiency remains the absence of stainable iron in smears of bone marrow aspirate. However serum ferritin < 30 ng/mL though only 32% sensitive is currently considered diagnostic of iron deficiency. The serum ferritin level and the total iron binding capacity are best used as complementary tests in the diagnosis of iron deficiency. The free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) level has limited value in the diagnosis of iron deficiency because of non-specific elevation due to the high FEP content of reticulocytes. Yet these indices cannot be readily measured in most health facilities in low income countries.

Anaemia is the most common medical complication of pregnancy and iron deficiency anaemia remains the most common cause of anaemia in pregnancy affecting 51–63% of pregnancies in Africa. Anaemia in pregnancy is not merely common in Africa, it is also frequently severe and can be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. Maternal consequences of anaemia in pregnancy vary from reduced peripartal blood reserves, reduced physical activity and mental performance, cardiovascular strain, increased risk of peri-partum transfusion to maternal death while foetal consequences of low iron include; intrauterine growth restriction, hydrops foetalis, prematurity, low birth weight and death in utero. These dreaded complications are well recognized and feared even by the WHO. In a bit to avoid these complications by preventing anaemia in pregnancy, WHO has since 1998 and currently still recommends iron and folic acid supplementation in pregnancy. Current WHO recommendations states that for countries with prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy > 40% such as seen in African countries, daily 60 mg elemental iron +400μg of folic acid daily for 6 months during pregnancy and 3 months postpartum.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113eMMXn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Serum ferritin — assessment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes threshold-based interpretation and important caveats: the WHO and American Academy of Pediatrics definitions note iron deficiency at ferritin levels below 12 and 15 μg/L in otherwise healthy children, while in adult IBD guidance serum ferritin levels below 30 μg/L are highly suggestive of iron deficiency and levels above 100 μg/L are unlikely; values between 30 and 100 μg/L may still indicate iron deficiency with inflammation, and post–intravenous iron ferritin may be misleading for up to 8 weeks. Interpretation requires consideration of inflammatory markers because ferritin is an acute phase reactant and can be altered by non–iron-related conditions.

### Mutations causing hemochromatosis: variable phenotypic expression in a pair of twins [^111offzT]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

We measured serum hepcidin levels in both twins. Twin A has a low serum hepcidin of 7.7 ng/mL (normal range 4.4–47.3 ng/mL) despite elevated ferritin, and hepcidin to ferritin (H: F) ratio of 0.018 indicating classical hemochromatosis phenotype. Twin B has a serum hepcidin level of 12.3 ng/ mL and H: F ratio of 0.072, four-times higher than twin A. The level of hepcidin in twin B is inappropriately low considering the high serum transferrin saturation (> 50%). It is unclear why the patient has high transferrin saturation but no evidence of elevated iron stores (ferritin 170 ng/ mL). Iron utilization appears normal as hemoglobin (13.4 g/dL) is within the normal range. Twin B has higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), by ~10% consistently (Table 1B). This may indicate that she is utilizing iron for erythropoiesis at a higher rate than her sister, however their reticulocyte count is similar.

Twin B has a BUB1B mutation which is associated with MVA syndrome. Based on exome sequencing, she appears to be a carrier for this condition. We pursued additional testing, a sensitive genome-wide method to assess aneuploidy from blood DNA for which the whole genome sequence was generated. There was no evidence of any aneuploidy. There are no reports of any relationship between BUB1B mutation and iron metabolism. Twin B however has a few features of the MVA, such as IUGR, slow post-natal growth, shorter than average stature, and pachygyria with seizures. Currently, twin B weighs 15.6 kg at 8 years of age, less than the 1 percentile (compared to twin A who is 39 kg at 91 st percentile). It is likely that twin B's chronic malnutrition has contributed to having normal serum iron and ferritin levels despite having high transferrin saturation levels (> 50%). She may be absorbing iron at a higher rate than other nutrients because of her hemochromatosis mutations, which allows maintaining iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis at a normal level despite malnutrition. In contrast, the patient has been taking zinc supplements. Serum zinc lowest at 49 µg/dL at age 4 years, maintains in the range of 62.6–98.6 µg/dL with zinc supplements (normal range, 60–120 µg/dL).

### Interpretation of serum ferritin concentrations as indicators of total-body iron stores in survey populations: the role of biomarkers for the acute phase response [^116iwYfs]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Nutritional surveys use acute phase protein (APP) biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) to identify the influence of inflammation on the distribution of iron status biomarkers. Few, however, have examined which biomarker better identifies persons with spurious elevations in iron status markers.

Objective

We explored the relations of APP biomarkers to iron-status biomarkers in infants and school-age children.

Design

In screening surveys, we identified a sample of African American infants (n = 351) and Guatemalan school-age children (n = 375). We used a common set of APP and iron-status biomarkers to examine the association between the 2 sets of markers (laboratory variables).

Results

The overall prevalence of either inflammation or iron deficiency was < 10% in both samples. The log AGP and CRP values were significantly correlated (r = 0.70), but the unexplained variance still was > 50%. Serum ferritin-but not transferrin receptor, transferrin receptor index, or serum iron-was related to APP concentrations, but poor positive predictive value (< 72%) and low kappa scores were found. Ferritin concentrations > 1 geometric SD above the geometric mean were poorly predicted by either elevated AGP or CRP. Qualitative CRP analysis was not effective in identifying persons who had other indications of mild inflammation.

Conclusions

These analyses show that a low prevalence of inflammation has little influence on the distribution of ferritin, and 2 common indicators of inflammation do not perform equally well in identifying persons who may have elevations in ferritin due to inflammation.

### Prognostic value of post-operative iron biomarkers in colorectal cancer: population-based patient cohort [^116zWZrj]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based prospective cohort of patients who had surgery for CRC, we examined associations of post-operative serum iron biomarkers with survival. Within the first month after surgery, higher serum iron was protective against all-cause mortality while abnormally elevated TS% was associated with shorter CSS. On the other hand, elevated ferritin and low TS% levels assessed a month or more after surgery were significantly associated with worse survival for both CSS and OS.

Previous observational studies have investigated the predictive value of iron biomarkers measured pre-operatively on CRC outcomes. Significantly shorter CSS, OS, and recurrence-free survival have been reported for patients with low pre-operative transferrin, whereas low pre-operative serum iron was shown to be independently associated with worse OS among CRC patients. To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate the predictive value of post-operative iron biomarkers for long-term survival among patients with prior diagnosis of CRC.

Our findings showed that elevated levels of post-operative ferritin were associated with worse OS, with comparable results to those reported in previous studies in which pre-operative ferritin was used to predict OS. Ferritin is a marker of iron storage, and plays a crucial role in iron homoeostasis in the body. Ferritin stores body iron, thereby preventing the harmful effects of excess free iron, which is known to cause oxidative cell damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Nevertheless, high ferritin levels may be indicative of iron overload (hemochromatosis), liver disease, or chronic inflammation. Indeed, we observed a significant positive correlation between acute phase proteins ferritin and CRP, both of which are elevated in response to inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha.

Elevated levels of post-operative serum transferrin, iron, and TS% consistently demonstrated statistically significant associations with better CSS and OS after adjustment for age, sex, cancer stage, and tumour site. Interestingly, the association of TS% and survival outcomes remained significant even after comprehensive adjustment for important covariates. These iron biomarkers may serve as potential indicators of improved survival outcomes among CRC patients, albeit with non-monotonic (U-shaped) dose-response patterns. Abnormally low serum levels of these iron markers are precursors of anaemia, which has a negative impact on prognosis. On the other hand, abnormally elevated iron states increase oxidative stress which may lead to DNA, protein, and lipid damage. Therefore, it appears vital to maintain appropriate physiological iron states to optimise long-term survival among CRC patients.

Hemochromatosis — serum ferritin interpretation and predictive thresholds include the following: in a study of individuals < 35 years of age, serum ferritin in the normal range in combination with a TS < 45% had a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload; in a California primary care population, a serum ferritin > 250 μg/L in men and > 200 μg/L in women was positive in 77% and 56% of C282Y homozygotes; and in the HEIRS screening study of 99,711 North American participants, serum ferritin levels were elevated (> 300 μg/L in men, > 200 μg/L in women) in 57% of female and 88% of male C282Y homozygotes. Ferritin can be elevated in the absence of increased iron stores, and in the general population, iron overload is not the most common cause of an elevated ferritin level; in most circumstances, serum ferritin provides additional confirmation of the significance of an elevated TS in C282Y homozygotes, and an elevated ferritin with a normal TS may occur particularly in non–HFE-related iron overload or in a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote.

### Serum ferritin levels are increased in patients with glomerular diseases and proteinuria [^1167xcUq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ferritin is a high molecular weight protein which reflects body iron stores, but may also rise in the case of an acute phase response. Recently, ferritin has been identified as a predictive factor in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. This is the first report on serum ferritin levels in patients with proteinuria.

Methods

We have analysed the data of 142 male patients with a glomerular disease, and proteinuria exceeding 1 g/day. In all patients, we measured various parameters related to proteinuria, serum ferritin and serum iron. Serum beta2-microglobulin and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation were used as measures of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Results

Mean age (± SD) was 46 ± 15 years, MDRD-GFR 57 ± 25 ml/min/1.73 m2 and median proteinuria 8.0 g/day [interquartile range (IQR) 3.6–13]. Serum albumin (29 ± 9 g/l) and transferrin levels (1.7 ± 0.5 g/l) were low, and cholesterol levels were elevated (median 7.3, IQR 5.9–9.5 mmol/l). Median serum ferritin was 148 microg/l (IQR 89–282), and exceeded 280 microg/l, the upper limit of normal, in 36 patients (25%). Elevated serum ferritin levels could not be explained by an acute phase response as determined by C-reactive protein, or haemochromatosis (DNA analysis). Regression analysis showed an independent relationship between ferritin levels and serum cholesterol, GFR and serum transferrin.

Conclusions

Serum ferritin levels are elevated in patients with overt proteinuria. The independent negative relationship between serum ferritin and transferrin points to a specific process and suggests that increased production of ferritin may compensate for the loss of the iron-binding protein transferrin, thus reducing the amount of free iron. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of ferritin in patients with proteinuria, especially because of the suggested association between ferritin and atherosclerosis.

### Iron and heart Failure: diagnosis, therapies, and future directions [^1171NwN9]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Unlike systemic iron, cellular iron levels in myocardial tissue appear to be dysregulated in HF. Leszek et al. showed reduced levels of mitochondrial iron in the explanted heart of patients with advanced HF who underwent cardiac transplantation. Interestingly, serum levels of ferritin and TSAT were not associated with myocardial iron, and the only serum marker that showed association was soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR). In a similar study, Melenovsky et al. showed myocardial ID in the explanted hearts of patients with advanced HF, and this was associated with abnormal mitochondrial function. In contrast, our group has shown that mitochondrial iron and total cellular heme levels are elevated in advanced HF. We have also shown increased mitochondrial iron in mice after ischemia/reperfusion and in human hearts with ischemic heart disease, suggesting detrimental effects of increased cellular iron by generating ROS and oxidative damage. These studies do not demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship, and more research is needed to determine whether the changes in myocardial iron in patients with HF are pathologic and maladaptive or protective and compensatory.

In a prospective study of 165 patients with a recent episode of acute HF, Jankowska et al. defined ID as the concomitance of low serum hepcidin (as a marker of depleted body iron stores) and elevated sTfR (as a marker of insufficient cellular iron). In multivariable analysis, this definition was strongly predictive of all-cause mortality at 12 months. However, ID based on the definition of ferritin < 100 ng/ml or TSAT < 20% was not predictive of the outcomes. More importantly, according to the ferritin-TSAT definition, 65% of the patients in this study were categorized as "iron deficient". However, ID was present in only 37% of the patients based on the hepcidin-sTfR definition, indicating the risk of misclassification of HF patients as "iron deficient" simply based on ferritin and TSAT values.

### Association of elevated serum ferritin levels and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant women: the camden study [^116seAbT]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE- We examined the influence of a moderately elevated serum ferritin level at entry to care on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and a possible mechanism (increased iron stores versus inflammation). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS- In a prospective observational study with 1,456 healthy pregnant women in Camden, New Jersey, serum ferritin and anthropometric measurements were determined. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was measured in a nested case-control study of 172 subjects. RESULTS- Women who developed GDM had a higher concentration of serum ferritin than women who did not develop GDM (P < 0.001). Elevated serum ferritin level (highest quintile) was significantly and positively correlated with prepregnant BMI and skinfold measurements. Women in the highest quintile of serum ferritin had a twofold increased risk of developing GDM adjusted for several known risk factors (adjusted odds ratio, 2.02 [95% CI 1.04–3.92], P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained with a nested case-control study, in which women in the highest tertile of serum ferritin (2.35 [1.06–5.22], P < 0.05) or CRP (2.67 [1.16–6.17], P < 0.001) had a greater than twofold increased risk of GDM. However, these effects were modified and became nonstatistically significant after additional adjustment for prepregnant BMI. CONCLUSIONS- Elevated serum ferritin concentrations early in gestation are associated with an increased risk of GDM. The association, at least in part, is mediated by the maternal fat mass and obesity. These data suggest a possible link between elevated serum ferritin and low-grade inflammation.

### The association between serum ferritin levels and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: a prospective cohort study [^115w2wor]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Although a previous study investigated the effects of changes in serum ferritin levels on T2DM incidence, no such study has been performed in pregnant women who might experience considerable changes in iron load. Fortunately, two repeated measurements of serum-ferritin levels in the first and second trimesters enabled us to explore the relationship between changes in serum-ferritin levels and incident GDM. Our findings revealed, for the first time, that the risk of GDM increased by nearly 30% in pregnant women with elevated or continuously high levels of serum ferritin in the first and second trimesters (Low-High and High-High groups). Such associations were consistently significant, but attenuated after adjusting for baseline glycolipid metabolism indicators. These findings imply that glucose metabolism dysfunction may occur gradually with the accumulation of iron storage from early to mid-gestation. The results from our pregnant cohort differed from evidence in the general population, where individuals with higher serum ferritin levels at baseline had an increased risk of new-onset T2DM, regardless of a subsequent decline in serum ferritin levels. This distinction may be due to differences in population characteristics or the duration of high iron storage between the general population and pregnant women. Overall, our study underscores the importance of maintaining an appropriate level of iron storage during early to mid-pregnancy to prevent GDM. For individuals whose serum ferritin concentrations may increase during pregnancy, such as those taking iron supplements, regular monitoring of iron storage levels could help reduce the risk of GDM. This conclusion supports the study by Zhang et al. which also suggested that precision nutrition approaches considering both baseline iron status and supplement use are needed to balance the benefits and risks of iron supplementation during pregnancy.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117Bn4Sx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Biomarkers of iron metabolism facilitate clinical diagnosis ininfection [^113VYsQK]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron is a micronutrient that is important for host and MTB metabolism. Pathogenic mycobacteria compete with the host for iron, either by directly depleting intracellular iron from the host cytoplasm or by synthesising siderophores and macromolecules, including transferrin, ferritin or lactoferrin, which have high affinity to capture extracellular ferric ion. Anaemia, as a result of inflammation caused by MTB infection, is predominantly caused by an iron delivery problem, where erythrocyte iron is poorly used and dietary iron is enriched in intestinal enterocytes. This condition is in contrast to iron deficiency-mediated anaemia, which is mainly due to malnutrition. Although serum iron levels are low in both types of anaemia, other components involved in iron homeostasis are high in anaemia due to inflammation, including ferritin and hepcidin, a peptide involved in regulating iron metabolism.

Previous studies have found that serum iron and transferrin concentrations are lower and ferritin levels are higher in patients with TB compared with those without TB. These abnormalities in ferritin and transferrin concentration in affected patients typically normalise following treatment. Others have suggested that reduced transferrin levels are associated with the progression of TB at any time point, and higher ferritin and hepcidin levels are associated with a higher risk of early TB progression in household contacts of TB cases. In addition, iron biomarker status can be used as an indicator of treatment failure (low ferritin) and mortality (high ferritin). Finally, low transferrin and serum iron, and high ferritin concentrations in HIV-infected patients suggest increased risks of TB incidence and recurrence. However, no previous study has examined the possible combination of these iron homeostasis biomarkers for clinical TB diagnosis, particularly in differentiating TB from LTBI and PN.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^116ir8de]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron-deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^1135e9FE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this nationally representative survey study of internal medicine PCPs, we found substantial variation in the management of anemia. Specifically, we found self-reported evidence of both overuse of screening CBCs (76.9% of respondents) and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy in patients with IDA. Certain knowledge gaps also existed in the interpretation of discordant laboratory test results, which may contribute to diagnostic errors. Specifically, 26.5% of respondents misdiagnosed a scenario of IDA as anemia with an alternate cause despite a low transferrin saturation (2%) and a borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL). Several subtle but important nuances in interpretation of these studies may contribute to errors, including the high specificity of a low ferritin level (98% specific for iron deficiency with a ferritin level ≤ 12 ng/mL), the potential for the ferritin level to be normal or elevated in inflammatory states when a patient is iron deficient, and the importance of measuring serum iron level in a fasting state to avoid potential confounders of dietary or supplemental iron. Given the relatively high baseline prevalence of anemia of 5.6% in the US, incorrect interpretation of these laboratory results may lead to a substantial number of missed or delayed diagnoses of IDA and, by extension, potential delays in diagnosis of GI tract malignant neoplasm.

### The serum hepcidin and the hepcidin / ferritin ratio in NAFLD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mrZJS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin, an acute-phase reactant, is often elevated in inflammatory states commonly observed in NAFLD, which can confound the interpretation of hepcidin level, as both are influenced by inflammation. Elevated ferritin may indicate not only iron storage but also underlying inflammation, masking the role of dysregulation of iron metabolism in NAFLD. To address this, we employed the hepcidin/ferritin ratio, which normalizes hepcidin levels relative to ferritin, accounting for inflammation. Our finding of lower hepcidin/ferritin ratios in NAFLD suggests disruptions in iron metabolism beyond inflammation. However, the limited number of studies on this ratio reduces the strength of this conclusion. In patients with NASH and Dysmetabolic Iron Overload Syndrome (DIOS), a reduced hepcidin/ferritin ratio reflects significant disruptions in iron metabolism. Studies indicate that IR is more pronounced in NASH compared to SS, and this IR is associated with decreased hepcidin levels. This connection may arise from IR interfering with the normal regulatory mechanisms of hepcidin, leading to reduced hepcidin levels in NASH and subsequently affecting the hepcidin/ferritin ratio.

However, our study did not confirm this result because only two studies categorized NAFLD into SS and NASH. Although the combined effect size of serum hepcidin was − 0.04, the result was not statistically significant. Additionally, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH may exacerbate iron metabolism, leading to lower hepcidin/ferritin ratios in patients with severe hepatocellular damage. These mechanisms collectively highlight the pivotal role of hepcidin in regulating iron metabolism and its impact on the progression of NAFLD, emphasizing the need to target iron homeostasis and inflammatory pathways in therapeutic strategies.

Our meta-analysis indicated that obese groups exhibited higher levels of serum hepcidin compared to overweight groups. This difference is likely driven by chronic low-grade inflammation associated with obesity, which increases levels of inflammatory cytokines such as leptin, TNF-α, and IL-6. These cytokines promote hepcidin synthesis through various signalling pathways, resulting in decreased iron absorption and increased iron storage. Consequently, this process helps reduce excessive iron release caused by inflammation, serving as a protective mechanism against inflammatory responses. However, inflammation related to obesity may confound the use of hepcidin as a biomarker for NAFLD, as elevated hepcidin levels could reflect both liver disease and inflammatory conditions associated with obesity. Future research should explore strategies to differentiate hepcidin elevations attributable to NAFLD from those caused by obesity-related inflammation.

### The serum hepcidin and the hepcidin / ferritin ratio in NAFLD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178oGCZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The liver plays a critical role in iron metabolism; numerous studies have reported that iron overload is considered one of the injury mechanisms of NAFLD. Studies have shown that patients with simple fatty liver and NASH frequently exhibit iron overload, suggesting its role in the disease's development. Research suggests that iron overload in the liver and adipose tissues may result from IR and contribute to NAFLD development by inducing oxidative stress, disrupting circadian rhythms, and elevating sex hormone-binding globulin levels. As the primary iron reservoir in the body, the liver's excess iron accumulation can lead to cellular damage and inflammation. The complex interplay between hepatic iron levels and the emergence of NAFLD has ignited a growing interest in the intricacies of iron metabolism.

Iron is the most abundant essential trace element in the human body, primarily existing in the form of ferritin, and is regulated by hepcidin. Kowdley et al. suggested that elevated serum ferritin levels, hepatic iron deposition and iron overload are closely correlated with NAFLD. Ferritin, the primary iron storage protein in the body, is found in high concentrations in liver cells and plays a crucial role in regulating iron homeostasis. It is also an acute-phase reactant, reflecting inflammatory states. Increased ferritin synthesis is often induced by pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18. In NAFLD, disruptions in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism may promote the release of ferritin into the bloodstream, thereby further linking iron metabolism to disease severity. Studies have established a significant correlation between serum ferritin levels and NAFLD risk. In addition to ferritin, hepcidin is pivotal in regulating systemic iron balance. Hepcidin exerts its effects by binding to iron transport proteins, inhibiting iron absorption in the duodenum, and limiting the release of iron from macrophages and hepatocytes. Inflammation, a common feature of NAFLD, triggers elevated serum hepcidin levels, disrupting normal iron metabolism and exacerbating liver damage. Chronic low-grade inflammation associated with obesity and NAFLD/NASH can further stimulate hepcidin expression, contributing to iron overload and liver injury. Due to its central role in iron regulation, hepcidin has been suggested as a key factor in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the hepcidin/ferritin ratio may offer diagnostic value, particularly in monitoring fibrosis progression in chronic liver diseases.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^112PDk3f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hereditary hemochromatosis diagnostic evaluation and management emphasize that the increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has made quantification of hepatic iron deposition easier and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients, and that serum ferritin of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings. Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in those with alcoholic liver disease, and these diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, so a secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, although emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.

Initial evaluation of suspected NAFLD — diagnostic requirements and laboratory considerations specify that the diagnosis of NAFLD requires that there is HS by imaging or histology, no significant alcohol consumption, no competing etiologies for HS, and no coexisting causes of CLD; if serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are elevated, genetic hemochromatosis should be excluded, and although the data are somewhat conflicting, serum ferritin > 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) was associated with more advanced fibrosis in a retrospective cohort of 628 adults; mutations in the HFE gene occur with variable frequency and the clinical significance is unclear; liver biopsy should be considered in the setting of high ferritin and a high iron saturation; low‑titer autoantibodies are common and often prompt biopsy to exclude autoimmune disease, and in a study of 864 NAFLD subjects, significant autoantibody elevations (antinuclear antibodies > 1:160 or antismooth muscle antibodies > 1:40) were present in 21% and were not associated with more advanced disease or atypical histological features.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^1128644A]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.9 Expert recommendation

There is little focus in the guidelines on how iron deficiency in the absence of anemia should be diagnosed in relation to the underlying chronic disease. Thus, it is of little surprise that physicians may not prioritize iron deficiency treatment. We wish to propose, based on the literature available, the following consensus laboratory test cut‐off values in patients with CHF, CKD or IBD:

Serum ferritin < 100 µg L −1 or TSAT < 20%

If serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg L −1, a TSAT test will be required to confirm iron deficiency

Furthermore, we also propose the following algorithms for the diagnostic workup of iron deficiency in patients with CHF, CKD, and IBD (Figures 2, 3, 4). In all conditions, initial workup should incorporate assessment of serum ferritin and TSAT, as well as Hb levels, in order to distinguish between those with normal hematological parameters, those with some form of iron deficiency (iron deficiency: normal Hb and low iron; or iron deficiency anemia: low Hb and low iron), and those with some other form of anemia (where iron levels are normal but Hb is low). In CKD, we must also consider whether the patient is receiving dialysis (Figure 3 A, B). Finally, in IBD, we must further consider whether the underlying condition is in remission or active. For IBD, we therefore also recommend measuring CRP levels or stool markers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin at the time of iron markers and hematological workup, in order to appropriately manage iron deficiency in relation to these results. We recommend a CRP threshold of 5 mg L −1 to determine the IBD disease activity. Although laboratory markers are usually sufficient with clinical disease activity markers, other indicators of intestinal inflammation, such as transabdominal ultrasound or endoscopy, may also be used to supplement these assessments.

### What do we know about micronutrients in critically ill patients? A narrative review [^115fUwBF]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Plasma concentrations in critically ill patients

Critical illness alters iron metabolism, and its specific requirements during ICU stay are not well defined.

Ferroptosis

Acute disease can disrupt the redox systems, causing intracellular iron overload and lipid peroxide accumulation in ferroptosis, an iron‐dependent, nonapoptotic cell death. Ferroptosis has been linked to sepsis, viral infections, and ALI, and may contribute to multiorgan dysfunction in practically every ICU patient.

Anemia

Anemia may affect up to 90% of ICU patients, requiring blood transfusion in 15%–35%. The two leading causes of iron‐related anemia are
Iron deficiency anemia: absolute iron deficiency owing to poor intake/adsorption or increased loss owing to phlebotomiesand hemorrhages, affecting 20%–40% of ICU patients.
Anemia of inflammation: Inflammation causes iron storage in the macrophages to reduce redox stress and hide iron from infectious pathogens, leading to iron‐deficient erythropoiesis independently from erythropoietin levels.

The most used biomarkers to determine iron status are iron plasma levels, ferritin, and transferrin, which enable the calculation of transferrin saturation. These are highly affected by inflammation and poorly differentiate between anemia because of inflammation or iron deficiency in acute phases of disease. The newer biomarkers hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) are expensive but increasingly available; they are less affected by inflammation, making these biomarkers promising in critically ill patients. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed by microcytic hypochromic anemia, increased sTfR, and reduced ferritin and hepcidin levels. Anemia of inflammation is diagnosed by normocytic normochromic anemia, normal sTfR, and increased ferritin and hepcidin levels. Anemia of inflammation in patients with non–iron deficiency anemia develops within 8 days of ICU admission.

Low plasma iron levels and iron deficiency are associated with worsening of chronic cardiac dysfunction. Decreased hepcidin levels are associated with ICU mortality. At ICU discharge, hemoglobin (Hb) < 100 g/L affects up to 53.3% of patients and persists in 46% at hospital discharge and up to 12 months later. Post‐ICU anemia correlates with increased ICU readmission rates, prolonged hospital length of stay, increased mortality, and lower quality of life,(see Table S20).

### Iron parameters determine the prognosis of critically ill patients [^113Kvmyd]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Because iron is both an essential and toxic micronutrient influencing the development of microbial infections, we evaluated the usefulness of iron parameters as outcome predictors in ICU patients.

Design

Prospective clinical single-center non-interventional study.

Setting

General internal medicine ICU; German University hospital.

Patients

One hundred and twelve septic and 43 nonseptic ICU patients, 156 healthy blood donors.

Measurements and Main Results

Serum iron parameters at admission were correlated with short and long term mortality in ICU subjects. Both hepcidin and ferritin concentrations were significantly elevated in ICU patients compared with blood donors and were the highest in septic patients. On the contrary, serum iron and transferrin levels were decreased in ICU subjects with lowest values among septic patients. Hepcidin values correlated with ferritin levels, and serum iron correlated strongly with transferrin saturation. A moderate correlation of hepcidin, ferritin, and transferrin with inflammatory parameters was noted. Both short- and long-term survivors displayed higher ferritin/transferrin levels and lower transferrin saturation. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, low iron levels (cutoff 10.5 μmol/mL), low transferrin saturation (cutoff 55%), and high serum transferrin concentrations (cutoff 1.6g/L) were associated with short- and long-term survival. In the subgroup of septic ICU subjects, low iron levels and transferrin saturation went along with a nonlethal outcome.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that parameters of iron metabolism, particularly transferrin saturation, that reflect serum iron availability, are strong outcome predictors in ICU patients. These data suggest that a failure of iron homeostasis with increased iron availability in serum occurs in lethally ill ICU patients and should trigger prospective clinical trials evaluating the usefulness of iron-chelating therapy in critical illness and sepsis.

### Serum ferritin is derived primarily from macrophages through a nonclassical secretory pathway [^1124kgh5]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

The serum ferritin concentration is a clinical parameter measured widely for the differential diagnosis of anemia. Its levels increase with elevations of tissue iron stores and with inflammation, but studies on cellular sources of serum ferritin as well as its subunit composition, degree of iron loading and glycosylation have given rise to conflicting results. To gain further understanding of serum ferritin, we have used traditional and modern methodologies to characterize mouse serum ferritin. We find that both splenic macrophages and proximal tubule cells of the kidney are possible cellular sources for serum ferritin and that serum ferritin is secreted by cells rather than being the product of a cytosolic leak from damaged cells. Mouse serum ferritin is composed mostly of L-subunits, whereas it contains few H-subunits and iron content is low. L-subunits of serum ferritin are frequently truncated at the C-terminus, giving rise to a characteristic 17-kD band that has been previously observed in lysosomal ferritin. Taken together with the fact that mouse serum ferritin is not detectably glycosylated, we propose that mouse serum ferritin is secreted through the nonclassical lysosomal secretory pathway.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^111wSktU]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is considered to be present if ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%. It has been considered uncommon in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease), but this may be attributable to difficulties using the usual iron parameters in this setting. Because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant in inflammatory states, ferritin levels are often elevated independent of iron status therefore a higher cutoff (< 100 µg/L) is needed to define IDA in these settings. Also in inflammatory states, serum iron and total iron-binding capacity are generally low, limiting the utility of TSAT for diagnosing IDA. This may be explained by the potential for inflammation to dysregulate iron homeostasis. The key regulator of iron homeostasis is hepcidin, a peptide that is produced primarily by hepatocytes. Increased hepcidin levels decrease iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes. In inflammatory states, hepcidin levels generally increase as a response to inflammatory cytokines and the net effect is decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. Patients with inflammatory disorders and iron deficiency exhibit lower levels of hepcidin than those with "pure" anemia of inflammation and, consequently, hepcidin levels can help distinguish between IDA and other anemias where there is no iron deficiency. The serum hepcidin level may be more reliable than ferritin or TSAT for identifying iron deficiency. For example, in patients discharged from the intensive care unit, a low hepcidin level (< 20 µg/L) identified iron deficiency in 37% of patients in contrast to 6% identified by iron tests alone.

In patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin receptor may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

### Nonlinear association between serum iron levels and moderate-to-severe uremic pruritus in peritoneal dialysis patients: a cross-sectional study [^114pfWQ6]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversely, Cluster 3 (low TSAT/low ferritin/low serum iron: TSAT 24.51 ± 8.14%, ferritin 54.5 ng/mL [30.1–78.5], serum iron 12.41 ± 3.86 µmol/L) demonstrated intermediate pruritus prevalence (27.3%), representing an iron-deficient metabolic state. Previous studies have primarily associated iron deficiency anemia with pruritus and suggest that iron supplementation may effectively relieve symptoms. A small-scale study in dialysis patients with similar characteristics provides some verification for this relationship.

In contrast, Cluster 1 (moderate TSAT/high ferritin/moderate serum iron: TSAT 30.05 ± 8.44%, ferritin 228.7 ng/mL [150.1–304.9], serum iron 16.38 ± 4.24 µmol/L) demonstrated the lowest pruritus rate (17.2%, p < 0.001 vs. Cluster 2), representing a balanced iron metabolism profile. The high ferritin levels in this cluster may reflect adequate iron storage capacity while maintaining controlled circulating iron levels. This optimal iron homeostasis may explain the significantly reduced pruritus prevalence observed in this phenotype. All these findings indicate that both iron excess and deficiency can contribute to pruritus through distinct pathophysiological pathways.

Serum iron measurements are rarely used independently as clinical indicators, primarily serving as a numerator in the TSAT calculation(TSAT = serum iron/TIBC (total iron binding capacity)). However, Kalantar-Zadeh et al. demonstrated that serum iron is a better predictor than TSAT, independently associated with increased mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Multiple observations have documented serum iron as an independent risk factor in various cancers. These findings collectively suggest that serum iron level beyond its role in TSAT calculation, may serve as a valuable standalone clinical indicator in various disease states. Furthermore, with advances in NTBI detection technology, elevated serum iron levels coupled with high TSAT may indicate NTBI formation, which directly mediates iron-related tissue damage through free radical generation and oxidative stress.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116gS2jE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — when to initiate treatment is outlined for HFE genotypes: Treatment should be initiated in C282Y homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin (SF), defined as > 300 ng/mL in men and > 200 ng/mL in women, along with a transferrin saturation (TS) of ≥ 45%. Homozygous patients with a SF within normal limits at diagnosis are unlikely to develop clinically relevant iron overload later in life and therefore can be monitored with serial assessment of liver aminotransferase and SF levels. Although patients with a SF of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis are unlikely to have end-organ damage, we still suggest treatment because between 13% and 35% of men and between 16% and 22% of women will progress to a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL if left untreated. For compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) the risk of developing clinically relevant iron overload is low; a liver biopsy can be considered to rule out secondary liver disorders or to evaluate NAFLD and cirrhosis, particularly among individuals with a SF above 1,000 ng/mL, and for compound heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes with evidence of elevated hepatic iron concentration (HIC) on biopsy, iron removal can be considered.

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^1145jGej]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The other biomarkers studied by the authors demonstrated inferior diagnostic performance compared to ferritin except for transferrin in females. Multivariate logistic regression models including these biomarkers did not improve the prediction of low or absent bone marrow iron stores over ferritin alone.

The clinical implications of the current study are important. The high specificity of ferritin at the 30 μg/L cutoff suggests that it can be a reliable marker for ruling in low or absent iron stores in patients with a high pretest probability of the condition. However, the low sensitivity indicates that clinicians should be cautious in ruling out low or absent iron stores based solely on ferritin levels, particularly in patients with conditions that can elevate ferritin, such as inflammation or liver disease. In such cases, additional diagnostic tests or clinical judgment may be necessary to accurately diagnose low or absent iron stores. We cannot emphasize too strongly that bone marrow aspirate with iron staining is often necessary, as the finding of absent iron necessitates an evaluation that may uncover a gastrointestinal or genitourinary malignance at an early, curable stage.

The reliability of the bone marrow iron determination depends on the adequacy of the specimen including the presence of spicules in the aspirate, and it would have been good to have specific comments about these factors in this study. In addition, it would have been good to provide their analysis based on the classical definition of iron deficiency, which is absence of stainable iron in an adequate bone marrow aspirate. The retrospective design and single institution character of the study are offset by the very impressive sample size.

In conclusion, this study reinforces the importance of ferritin as the primary biomarker for diagnosing iron deficiency, while also highlighting its limitations in terms of sensitivity. Clinicians should consider these findings when interpreting laboratory measures of iron status, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions. Importantly, the presence of a normal or elevated serum ferritin does not negate the potential need for a bone marrow aspirate to assess potential metabolic or malignant conditions that may present with iron deficiency.

### Iron status and survival in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^111XxZY6]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated that measures of iron status predict long-term outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes and clinically overt CAD, even after adjusting for conventional (e.g. age, sex, and renal function) and some more advanced (e.g. hsCRP and NT-proBNP) prognostic markers.

We deliberately assessed three different markers of iron status. Ferritin is the major intracellular protein storing iron, and serum concentrations < 30 μg/L are specific for absolute ID. However, serum ferritin is commonly elevated when inflammatory pathways are activated, including atherosclerosis and renal dysfunction. A normal serum ferritin may be misleading. Extremely high serum ferritin (> 1,000 μg/L) indicates a high probability of hemochromatosis. Importantly, high circulating ferritin provides no insight about the amount of intracellular iron available for metabolic (including energetic) needs. Tsat is a direct measure of the circulating iron pool, but it is unclear if this reflects the amount in peripheral tissues. Transferrin receptor is the major entrance pathway for iron to most hematopoietic and extrahematopoietic cells. When cells become deficient in iron for metabolic processes (mainly in mitochondria), this particle is overexpressed on the cellular membrane and shed into the circulation, and thus, high circulating sTfR reflects intracellular iron depletion. We found only moderate (at the most) associations between Tsat and serum ferritin and sTfR. Importantly, patients with both low and high serum ferritin had increased circulating sTfR. There are two possible explanations for cellular ID in the presence of high serum ferritin. It is possible that in patients with more advanced disease, an inflammatory state exists, causing serum ferritin to rise despite cellular ID. Alternatively, it is possible that tissue stores of iron are high but not metabolically available for hematopoesis or other cell functions, or even that iron overload causes an inflammatory response.
