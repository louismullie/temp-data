## Question

A 54-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 3-month history of intermittent painless bright red blood per rectum, typically noticed on the toilet paper and occasionally dripping into the toilet bowl. He has a known history of external hemorrhoids diagnosed several years ago. He denies any abdominal pain, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits. On examination, there are visible external hemorrhoids, but no other abnormalities. His hemoglobin is mildly decreased at 12.5 g/dL (reference: 13.5–17.5 g/dL).

Based on current guidelines, what is the next best step in the evaluation of this patient's rectal bleeding?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next best step in evaluating a 54-year-old man with intermittent painless bright red rectal bleeding and a hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis and whether hemorrhoids alone explain the bleeding. Then, I should verify guideline-based thresholds for endoscopic evaluation by age, symptoms, and anemia. Next, I will consider the role of anoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy versus full colonoscopy. Finally, I will confirm the urgency, preparation, and what to do if the initial endoscopy is unrevealing or if bleeding persists despite treatment.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and its implications. Intermittent painless bright red blood per rectum is classic for internal hemorrhoids, but I should not jump to conclusions because other colorectal pathology can mimic this presentation, and attributing bleeding to hemorrhoids without visualization risks missing neoplasia or inflammatory disease, especially in patients over 50 years old [^5baa4e00] [^0b60fbe0].

> Wait, let me verify the anemia significance. A hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL in a man is mild anemia and, while not severe, it is below the normal male reference range and raises concern for chronic blood loss; even mild anemia modestly increases the post-test probability of colorectal cancer and warrants further evaluation rather than reassurance alone [^979a9767].

> Next, I should review guideline thresholds for endoscopic evaluation. I initially thought that because he is over 50, colonoscopy is universally indicated, but hold on, I should verify the nuance. Multiple high-quality guidelines recommend complete colonic evaluation in patients over 50 with rectal bleeding, and also when there is anemia, alarm features, or persistent bleeding, even if hemorrhoids are present on exam, because hemorrhoids are common and may be incidental rather than causal [^5baa4e00] [^0b60fbe0] [^51a6e24d].

> I will now examine the role of limited distal evaluation. Flexible sigmoidoscopy can be reasonable in carefully selected younger patients without alarm features, but in a 54-year-old with anemia and persistent bleeding, a full colonoscopy is preferred to evaluate the entire colon for polyps, cancer, ischemia, angioectasia, and other sources that would be missed by sigmoidoscopy alone [^34f1f493] [^51a6e24d].

> Let me consider anoscopy briefly. Anoscopy can visualize internal hemorrhoids and confirm the anorectal source, but it does not evaluate the colon; therefore, even if anoscopy shows hemorrhoids, guidelines still support colonoscopic evaluation in this age group and clinical context to exclude more proximal disease [^0b60fbe0] [^5baa4e00].

> I should confirm urgency and preparation. This is not an acute severe lower GI bleed, so urgent colonoscopy is not required; however, it should be scheduled expediently, and the colon must be adequately prepped to maximize diagnostic yield and enable polypectomy if lesions are found, which is standard in elective colonoscopy for hematochezia [^2742cb39].

> But wait, what if the colonoscopy is negative and bleeding persists? If no source is identified and bleeding continues, I need to ensure we revisit the differential, consider small-bowel evaluation for obscure bleeding, and reassess for missed colonic lesions or an upper GI source when appropriate, aligning with guideline-based algorithms for persistent hematochezia [^4535a1f5] [^727f2de9].

> Putting this together, the next best step is to arrange a colonoscopy with appropriate bowel preparation to evaluate the entire colon, given the patient's age, mild anemia, and persistent bleeding, even though external hemorrhoids are visible on exam. This aligns with ASCRS, ACG, and ASGE guidance and mitigates the risk of missing significant colorectal pathology [^0b60fbe0] [^5baa4e00] [^51a6e24d].

---

The next best step is **colonoscopy** [^0b60fbe0] because the patient is over 50 years old [^51a6e24d] and has intermittent painless hematochezia with mild anemia, which warrants complete colonic evaluation to exclude neoplasia or other serious pathology [^5baa4e00]. Even with known external hemorrhoids, **do not attribute bleeding to hemorrhoids without visualizing the colon** [^0b60fbe0], as this is a common missed cancer scenario [^e7b465fb]. If colonoscopy is unavailable, flexible sigmoidoscopy with anoscopy is an alternative, but colonoscopy is preferred [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for painless rectal bleeding in a 54-year-old male includes:

- **Hemorrhoids**: Internal hemorrhoids typically cause painless bright red bleeding [^3c97ae8c].
- **Colorectal polyps or cancer**: Painless bleeding may be an early sign of neoplasia [^notfound].
- **Diverticular disease**: Often painless, though typically presents in older patients [^notfound].
- **Angiodysplasia**: Vascular malformations causing painless bleeding [^b6508006].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Usually associated with other symptoms such as diarrhea or abdominal pain [^notfound].

Given the patient's age and mild anemia, **colorectal cancer and polyps must be excluded** [^0b60fbe0].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) provide clear recommendations for evaluating rectal bleeding in this clinical scenario:

- **ACG 2021 guidelines**: Recommend colonoscopy for patients over 50 years old with rectal bleeding, even in the presence of known hemorrhoids, to exclude neoplasia or other serious pathology [^notfound].
- **ASCRS 2024 guidelines**: Emphasize that rectal bleeding should not be automatically attributed to hemorrhoids without complete colonic evaluation, particularly in patients over 50 years old or those with anemia [^0b60fbe0].

---

## Role of colonoscopy

Colonoscopy is the **gold standard** for evaluating painless rectal bleeding in patients over 50 years old [^notfound]. It allows direct visualization of the entire colon and rectum, enabling detection and biopsy of polyps, cancer, or other abnormalities. Colonoscopy is superior to flexible sigmoidoscopy because it examines the entire colon, whereas sigmoidoscopy only evaluates the distal colon and rectum [^notfound].

---

## Alternative diagnostic modalities

If colonoscopy is unavailable or contraindicated, **flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with anoscopy** is a reasonable alternative [^e40377b8]. However, this approach may miss proximal lesions, which is why colonoscopy remains the preferred modality [^notfound]. Computed tomography colonography (CTC) is another option, but it lacks the ability to provide therapeutic interventions and may miss small polyps or flat lesions [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's age, intermittent painless hematochezia, and mild anemia, **the next best step is to perform a colonoscopy** [^0b60fbe0] to exclude colorectal neoplasia or other serious pathology [^5baa4e00]. This approach aligns with current ACG and ASCRS guidelines and ensures that potentially life-threatening conditions are not missed [^0b60fbe0]. If colonoscopy is unavailable, flexible sigmoidoscopy with anoscopy may be considered, but colonoscopy is strongly preferred [^notfound].

In patients with complicated hemorrhoids, we suggest to perform anoscopy as part of the physical examination, whenever feasible and well tolerated (low recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with complicated hemorrhoids, we suggest to perform colonoscopy in case of concern for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer arising from patient personal and family history, or from physical examination (low recommendation based on low quality evidence, 2C).

Endoscopy has a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of LGIB. Most authors recommend the use of anoscopy in all patients referred with complicated hemorrhoids, and this opinion is supported by multiple studies that highlight the good accuracy of anoscopy in detecting hemorrhoids and other anorectal lesions, when compared to flexible endoscopy. However, patients with trombosed and strangulated hemorrhoids usually experience excruciating anal pain and therefore it is not possible to perform an accurate anoscopy in an awake patient in this setting. Anoscopy could be an option for the evaluation of painless anorectal bleeding, while its application in case of hemorrhoidal crisis usually requires proper sedation. The next step is to determine which patients requires a full colonoscopy; it is extremely important not to blindly attribute painless rectal bleeding to hemorrhoids, because it may be a sign of other diseases (i.e. colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or other colitis, diverticular disease, angiodysplasia). According to the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, further endoscopic evaluation is warranted if there is concern for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer arising from a detailed patient personal and family history, and from a physical examination which may include anoscopy/proctoscopy and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy. Obviously, risk factors include anemia, atypical bleeding, alteration of bowel habits, preceding weight loss, and personal and family history of colorectal cancer or IBD.

### Endoscopic band ligation in diverticular bleeding: a stepwise approach for successful treatment [^5f1974ae]. VideoGIE (2017). Low credibility.

A 90-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute painless hematochezia. A previous colonoscopy 2 years earlier confirmed severe diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon with active bleeding from a diverticulum, which was treated with thermal therapy and endoscopic clipping. Digital rectal examination demonstrated gross bright red blood with no evidence of hemorrhoids. Vital signs were negative for hypotension or orthostasis. Laboratory findings included normal hemoglobin and hematocrit: 15.6 g/dL and 44.7%, respectively. Platelets, international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time were unremarkable.

Given the prior history of diverticular-related bleeding, a rapid bowel preparation with 2 L of polyethylene glycol was administered over the course of 2 hours, followed by a same-day colonoscopy with a high-definition white-light adult colonoscope. Severe left-sided diverticulosis was once again confirmed. Intubation of the terminal ileum demonstrated no recent or old blood, excluding a small-bowel source. Upon careful withdrawal of the colonoscope, we detected active bleeding from a diverticulum 40 cm from the anal verge (Figs. 1 A and B). In order to not lose the site of interest, an area in the vicinity of the bleeding was immediately tattooed (Fig. 1 C). To allow better examination of the bleeding site, the colonoscope was exchanged for a standard gastroscope, and a second tattoo was placed immediately adjacent to the diverticulum. Given the inability to directly visualize the bleeding vessel, the decision was made to invert the diverticulum with suction (Fig. 1 D) and subsequently band it with a variceal banding device attached to the end of the gastroscope (Fig. 1 E) (Video 1, available online at). There was no evidence of bleeding at the end of the procedure (Fig. 1 F).

Hemorrhoids — diagnostic assessment and grading — gastroenterologists and other providers should diagnose hemorrhoids by history and physical examination, and if there is bleeding, the source often requires confirmation by endoscopic studies (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Physical examination should include visual inspection of the anus, both at rest and while straining, and digital examination for other anal pathology, and internal hemorrhoids can be assigned a functional grade based on their history: first-degree hemorrhoids do not prolapse, second-degree hemorrhoids prolapse but self-reduce, third-degree hemorrhoids protrude and require manual reduction, and fourth-degree hemorrhoids protrude and cannot be reduced. Laboratory testing is almost never helpful, and the clinical diagnosis of hemorrhoids usually includes hemorrhoid-pattern bleeding that mandates at least sigmoidoscopy to rule out other sources of bleeding; in patients over the age of 50 years or with a suggestive family history, this may be the occasion for evaluation of the entire colon, usually by colonoscopy. Hemorrhoids without symptoms are not diagnosed by flexible endoscopy, and a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is easily recognized on physical examination as a usually tender blue lump at the anal verge, and no other workup or classification is needed.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^0b60fbe0]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease evaluation — initial assessment and colonoscopy indications: Physical examination should include visual inspection of the anus, both at rest and while straining, and digital rectal examination should be performed to rule out other anorectal pathology and evaluate the sphincter tone; anoscopy can be considered to assess the hemorrhoidal anatomy and rule out other pathology of the anal canal. Rectal bleeding should not automatically be attributed to hemorrhoids and, although hemorrhoidal disease is the most common reason for hematochezia, other colorectal disease processes can also result in blood per rectum; rectal bleeding attributed to hemorrhoids represents the most often missed opportunity to establish a cancer diagnosis. Complete endoscopic evaluation of the colon is indicated in select patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding (Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence), and patients should undergo a colonoscopy when no obvious source of anorectal bleeding is observed or when abdominal pain, distention, new onset constipation, or progressive constipation are present at initial evaluation; patients who continue to experience hematochezia after otherwise successful hemorrhoid treatment should undergo further investigation, and those due for colorectal cancer screening should be counseled appropriately.

ASCRS hemorrhoids guideline — statement of the problem describes hemorrhoids as vascular structures that arise from a channel of arteriovenous connective tissues and drain into the superior and inferior hemorrhoidal veins; they are categorized as external or internal based on their relationship with the dentate line, communicate with one another, and often coexist. Symptoms related to hemorrhoids are very common in the Western hemisphere and other industrialized societies, and hemorrhoidal disease represents one of the most common medical and surgical disease processes encountered in the United States, resulting in more than 2.2 million outpatient evaluations per year. Many diverse symptoms may be, correctly or incorrectly, attributed to hemorrhoids by both patients and referring physicians.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^efab2fb0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with suspected anorectal varices, we suggest to check vital signs, to determine hemoglobin and hematocrit, and to assess coagulation, to evaluate the severity of the bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C). In case of severe bleeding, we suggest blood typing and cross-matching (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

Anorectal varices (ARV) have been defined as discrete, dilated, and submucosal veins, extending proximal to the dentate line and into the rectum. They are a known complication of portal hypertension and can occur in up to 89% of patients with the portal pressure above 10 mmhg, although the overall incidence in the general population is low. Despite this high prevalence, serious hemorrhage from ARV is uncommon, with significant bleeding reported in less than 5% of such patients, but can be fatal. The presence of ARV is not directly related to a specific cause of portal hypertension, nor to the grade or extension of other varices (esophageal or gastric); the only clue to suspect this disease is the presence of anorectal bleeding in patients with a history of long-standing or uncontrolled portal hypertension.

As already mentioned in relation to bleeding hemorrhoids, the first assessment of patients with haematochezia should follow the indications for the management of acute LIGB. In the case of ARV, a correct and thorough medical history is crucial to suspect this specific disease and can guide the subsequent diagnostic process. It is necessary to define the severity of bleeding and to correctly stratify the risk for every patient. Blood test should include a CBC, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and the coagulation assessment. Blood type and crossmatch for possible transfusion of blood components should also be ordered at the time of initial assessment for patients with signs of severe bleeding. Furthermore, it is advisable to carry out a pregnancy test with the woman's consent if there is any doubt about pregnancy. The risk stratification strategy is superimposable to what has already been discussed in the bleeding hemorrhoids section.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^3c97ae8c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease

Approximately 4 of 10 patients with hemorrhoids are symptomatic. It is uncertain why hemorrhoids become symptomatic. They are believed to start producing symptoms when anal cushions start their sliding down process.

Bleeding is the commonest symptom of internal hemorrhoids. In the vast majority of cases bleeding is painless, because of the absence of pain fibers. Hemorrhage is due to congestion of the sinusoids, transferred backwards to the presinusoidal arterioles. Bleeding from hemorrhoids is therefore arterial in origin, hence bright red. Since dilated arterioles are located in the lamina propria, just below the inflamed, injured and friable epithelium of the descending nodule, they are easily eroded during defecation by hard, dehydrated or diarrheal stool. As presinusoidal arterioles are usually tiny, oozing is the commonest type of bleeding; blood is present in the toilet paper exclusively and is typically associated with bowel movements. When small arterioles are corroded, bright red blood will spurt; in this case bright red blood drips into the toilet bowl during or immediately after evacuation. Blood may rarely emerge from the newly-formed, hypertrophied arterioles, leading to serious bleeding, manifesting as blood spray around the toilet bowl. In rare cases, blood from internal hemorrhoids may follow a cranial direction towards the rectum, and then return caudally to the anus, presenting as hematochezia. Bleeding is usually the first complaint to appear, before the hemorrhoids start to prolapse (first degree). In this initial stage, the dilatation of sinusoids is still in evolution, rendering them prone to bleeding, while the deterioration of the fibromuscular supporting tissue has just begun. Therefore, although hemorrhoidal cushions may be prominent on endoscopic evaluation, their prolapse is not obvious on strenuous clinical examination.

Discussion

Main findings

In this study, we observed statistically significant associations between CRC symptoms and CRC anatomic site. There was evidence that those who experienced blood in stool and changes to stool were more likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer, while those who experienced abdominal pain, anemia, and other symptoms were more likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer. The observed positive association between the experience of blood in stool and rectal cancer site were particularly pronounced for early-onset CRC.

Interpretation of findings

Rectal cancer patients diagnosed under the age of 50 (early-onset) are more likely to display symptoms for a length of time before they seek medical care perhaps due to a lack of risk awareness for their age or access to health services. Early onset rectal cancer patients are also more likely to present with a later disease stage. Furthermore, there is an average 6-month time to diagnosis from symptom presentation in early-onset CRC patients. Our study indicates that blood in stool is a more common pre-diagnostic symptom in patients who go on to a diagnosis of rectal vs. colon cancer. For early-onset CRC patients, the likelihood of being diagnosed with rectal cancer among those experiencing blood in stool increases. Because we know that patients with rectal cancer are more likely to display symptoms for a duration of time, this may differentially impact time to diagnosis in rectal cancer patients compared to colon cancer patients. The results also suggest that red flag symptoms may be predictive of early-onset rectal cancer. Specifically, blood in stool (a form of rectal bleeding) should be investigated further, as a common clinical scenario that is mistakenly attributed to hemorrhoids or other benign etiology and not generally evaluated further in a young patient.

### Rectal artery embolization for hemorrhoidal disease: anatomy, evaluation, and treatment techniques [^8a6c5158]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic hemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal condition that leads to hemorrhoidal hyperplasia, which affects millions of people worldwide and is a significant medical and socioeconomic issue. Rectal bleeding is one of the main chronic symptoms. Recurrent rectal bleeding can alter an individual's quality of life and, more rarely, cause anemia. Pain is less common, occurring only in the event of complications such as congestive exacerbation, external hemorrhoidal thrombosis, or fissures. The most standard treatment involves dietary and hygiene measures, use of phlebotonic drugs, and nonsurgical treatment such as infrared photocoagulation or elastic band ligation. Excisional treatments such as hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidopexy are the reference standards for treatment of hemorrhoidal disease. Embolization of the rectal arteries (ie, emborrhoid) has recently emerged as an effective treatment option, with few reported adverse effects, minimal blood loss, and a same-day hospital procedure. Hemorrhoid embolization is performed by using femoral or radial access. The inferior mesenteric artery and then the superior rectal arteries are catheterized with a microcatheter. Embolization can be performed by using different agents. Studies have shown improvement in symptoms and high technical success rates after treatment. The basic principles of hemorrhoid embolization that must be understood to achieve effective treatment, including those related to patient evaluation, the arterial anatomy, basic embolization, and published results, are reviewed.

Initial management — initial triage/evaluation emphasizes comprehensive bedside assessment: "A thorough history and physical examination is needed to determine potential sources of bleeding and help identify patients at risk of severe bleeding and adverse outcomes such as rebleeding and mortality." History should cover "cardiovascular, oncologic, or renal comorbidities; GI surgeries; and associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, alteration in bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss." Examination should include "careful attention to vital signs and assessment for signs of hypovolemia," and "Careful rectal examination can help determine whether a bleeding source may be emanating from the anorectal region or indicate the presence of melena, which may increase the likelihood of an UGIB." Medication review should assess "NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants," and "findings such as a preceding history of decompensated liver disease or prior peptic ulcer disease… or visible stigmata of advanced liver disease may indicate the possibility of an upper GI source of bleeding in a patient with severe hematochezia."

Introduction

Hemorrhoids (HD) are the fourth most prevalent gastrointestinal diagnosis in adults in outpatient settings and the most common cause of anal pathology, contributing to approximately 3.3 million visits for ambulatory care in the United States every year. The self-reported annual occurrence of hemorrhoids in the country is around 10 million cases, representing approximately 4.4% of the total population. HD can manifest with various symptoms, such as anal pruritis, pain, swelling, and bleeding.

Several risk factors contribute to the development of HD, including straining during bowel movements, prolonged sitting, chronic diarrhea or constipation, obesity, pregnancy, anal intercourse, a low-fiber diet, and heavy lifting. HD significantly impacts patients' quality of life due to physical discomfort, potentially requiring lifestyle adjustments. Additionally, acute severe hemorrhoidal bleeding can result in acute blood loss anemia that may require hospitalization, hemodynamic support and blood transfusion while chronic blood loss anemia may necessitate oral or intravenous iron supplementation ± blood transfusion.

The use of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to evaluate the effect of HD symptoms on daily life provides a deeper understanding of the disease's burden by collecting direct patient feedback. This approach aids clinicians in better addressing patients' experiences with the condition.

Hemorrhoids (HD) are either internal hemorrhoids (IH) or external hemorrhoids (EH). IH and EH differ primarily in their location and the symptoms they produce. IH are situated inside the anus, typically causing painless rectal bleeding and, in more severe cases, prolapse during bowel movements. In contrast, EH can extend up to the dentate line. They can involve both the anal verge and the first half of the anal canal and are often associated with symptoms like pain, itching, swelling, and the potential formation of painful blood clots (thrombosis). These distinctions in location and symptoms are crucial in the diagnosis and treatment of hemorrhoids, helping healthcare professionals determine the appropriate management strategies for each patient's specific condition.

### Lack of colonic neoplastic lesions in patients under 50 yr of age with hematochezia: a multicenter prospective study [^53533178]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

It is still not clear what is the best way of evaluating rectal bleeding in young people. Our aim was to examine the prevalence of neoplastic colonic lesions in these patients.

Methods

This prospective, multicenter study enrolled 622 patients aged 30–50 yr (F 232/M 390) consecutively seen in 14 open-access endoscopy departments for hematochezia, defined as bright red blood from the rectum, red blood noted either in the feces, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl. At colonoscopy, pathology was stratified as either proximal or distal to the splenic flexure. Exclusion criteria were a history of colitis, colorectal cancer, polyps, anemia, significant weight loss, severe bleeding, or strong family history of colorectal cancer.

Results

Malignant polyps were found in two patients (0.6%), aged 30–40 yr, one in the rectum and one in the sigmoid. A malignant polyp of the cecum was found in a 41-yr-old patient. Another, aged 47, had a malignant granular-cell tumor of the rectum. A total of 35 advanced adenomas were identified in 18 patients. In 7 patients (2.2%) within the 30–40 yr age bracket we found 8 advanced adenomas (all in the rectum/sigmoid). The other 27 advanced adenomas were in 11 patients (3.5%) in the 41–50 yr age bracket. In this age group we observed 3 patients with 10 isolated proximal advanced adenomas.

Conclusions

In patients younger than 40 yr with hematochezia, advanced neoplastic lesions are rare and usually located in the rectum and sigmoid colon. Sigmoidoscopy appears to be sufficient for evaluation in these patients.

Initial management and blood transfusion

Statement 6
SEED recommends evaluating the patient's general clinical condition and prioritizing resuscitation measures if necessary. The initial assessment should include a focused medical history, a physical examination (including an anorectal exam), and blood tests.
Good Practice Statement. (Strongly agree: 92.3%; agree: 7.7%)

There are no studies evaluating initial supportive measures in patients with DPPB. Recommendations are derived from expert consensus and clinical guidelines aimed at managing LGIB. Initially, the patient's hemodynamic stability should be assessed, prioritizing resuscitation measures. It is recommended to secure two adequately sized peripheral veins and/or a central line. Crystalloids are usually preferred over colloids for volume replacement and stabilization. The initial patient evaluation should involve a focused medical history that details colonoscopy information (date, lesions removed, size, location, removal technique, symptom onset, and prophylactic scar therapy), relevant comorbidities, current pharmacological treatments (such as antiplatelets and anticoagulants), a rectal examination, and blood tests including a complete blood count and coagulation studies.

There are no studies comparing out versus inpatient management in patients with DPPB. Most studies do not specify the criteria for patient admission or discharge. In a retrospective study of 548 patients with DPPB, 80.8% were admitted, but admission criteria were not detailed. Another study of 69 DPPB patients found that 69.6% underwent therapeutic colonoscopy as inpatients, while the rest were managed as outpatients, with no details on observation time or discharge criteria.

Other authors advocate for admitting all patients. Burgess et al. propose an algorithm recommending 24 h of surveillance and considering discharge if there is no recurrence of bleeding, the patient remains hemodynamically stable, and there is no significant change in hemoglobin level during that time. Van der Star et al. evaluated 42 patients and suggested discharge if bleeding stops spontaneously and does not recur during 24 h of observation.

### Colonoscopic removal of a polypoid arteriovenous malformation [^7b7e0d4e]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

A 53-year-old male presenting with a 3-month history of intermittent mild rectal bleeding was found, on double contrast barium enema, to have a large polyp on a long stalk in the sigmoid colon. Large bowel endoscopy confirmed the presence of a 2 cm pedunculated polyp which was removed using a diathermic snare, with slight bleeding following the procedure that did not require endoscopic haemostasis. Only after histologic examination was the polyp shown to be a colonic arteriovenous malformation. Endoscopically, arteriovenous malformations generally appear as flat or elevated bright red lesions. A pedunculated polypoid appearance is extremely uncommon. In this case, no gastrointestinal bleeding or polypoid recurrence was observed during the 12 months of clinical and endoscopic follow-up.

External hemorrhoid thrombosis (EHT) urgent/emergent care — 6. Select patients with thrombosed external hemorrhoids may benefit from early surgical excision. Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence. In a randomized series of 50 patients, hemorrhoid excision reduced pain versus topical glyceryl trinitrate (p < 0.001) or thrombectomy (p < 0.01) on day 4, with no symptomatic difference at 1-month follow-up; at 1 year, recurrence was significantly lower after excision versus thrombectomy (p < 0.05) or topical glyceryl trinitrate (p < 0.05). In a retrospective review, 48.5% were treated surgically and 97.3% of these underwent excision of the thrombosed hemorrhoid or thrombectomy, while 51.5% received nonoperative care. Time to resolution of presenting symptoms was shorter with surgery (3.9 vs 24 days; p < 0.001). For nonoperative care in 504 consecutive EHT patients, the median time to symptom improvement was 5 days (range, 1–23 days) and to complete resolution was 8 days (range, 1–45 days).

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1a57b1b8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, based on the paucity of available studies and on the small numbers of patients included, we believe that hemorrhoidectomy can be beneficial in selected patients and the decision between NOM and early surgical excision should be based on physician's expertise and patient's preference; furthermore, we suggest against the use of incision and drainage of the thrombus, given the higher incidence of bleeding and relapse of symptoms. The evidence about stapled hemorrhoidectomy is scarce and, also given the potential for life-threatening complications of this procedure in the elective setting, we do not make any recommendation for its application in an acute care - emergency setting.

This literature review could not identify any data regarding the role of surgery for bleeding hemorrhoids, so we cannot make any recommendations in this setting.
3.G - in patients with complicated hemorrhoids, what is the role of angiography?

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of angiography in complicated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

There is growing evidence that angiography and angioembolization could have a role for the treatment of hemorrhoids in an elective setting. The reported results are encouraging, but there are not enough data to make any recommendation regarding its application to an acute care - emergency setting.
4) Bleeding anorectal varices 4. A - in patients with suspected bleeding anorectal varices, what is the role of clinical examination and biochemical investigations?

In patients with suspected bleeding anorectal varices, we suggest to collect a focused medical history and to perform a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal examination, to rule out other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

### Benign anorectal disease: hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas [^927dd875]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Internal hemorrhoids most often present with painless bleeding during bowel movements and/or prolapse. Prolapse may be associated with mild fecal incontinence, mucous drainage, perianal fullness, and painful skin irritation. Although rare, prolapsed internal hemorrhoids can strangulate, causing significant pain. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids tend to be more painful, given their somatic innervation, and patients present with a tender perianal mass that can bleed if it ulcerates. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids usually degenerate into perianal skin tags over time. The diagnosis of hemorrhoidal disease is based on history and physical exam. It is important to not blindly attribute painless rectal bleeding to hemorrhoids without a proper physical exam and further workup. Anoscopy is necessary to visualize internal hemorrhoids and identify anorectal pathology on exam. In the US, common practice is that painless rectal bleeding with a normal anoscopic evaluation is followed by diagnostic colonoscopy.

Medical treatment

Symptomatic hemorrhoids tend to be self-limiting and often respond well to conservative medical treatment: increasing fluid and fiber intake, regular exercise, avoiding constipation and straining, and spending less time on the toilet. A meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials comparing fiber supplementation (7–20 g/day) to no fiber showed that fiber supplementation decreases bleeding symptoms by 50%, but had little effect on prolapse, pain, and itching from hemorrhoids. There is no evidence to support the use of popular topical over-the-counter remedies like Preparation H or topical corticosteroids.

Case 1

An 80-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) who had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction a year ago, underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, and was on dual-antiplatelet therapy was referred for evaluation of anemia. He has had anemia for > 10 years with hemoglobin of ∼12 g/dL. He tolerated exercise by bicycling without any change in endurance over the past several years. He denied history of gastrointestinal bleeding and has had a negative fecal occult blood test (FOBT). No family members had hematologic disorders. He had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy 3 years ago, which showed no active bleeding sites. Colonoscopy only revealed diverticulosis and nonbleeding internal hemorrhoids.

Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 93 fL, platelet count of 206 × 10 9 /L, white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.5 × 10 9 /L, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 55 mL/min per 1.73m 2, vitamin B12 at 408 pg/mL (reference 123–730 pg/mL), folate at 39 ng/mL (reference > 5.2 ng/mL), iron at 69 μg/dL (reference 45–150 μg/dL), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) of 270 μg/dL (reference 261–478 μg/dL), ferritin at 91 ng/mL (reference 11–204 ng/mL), transferrin saturation (TSAT) of 26% (reference 15% to 55%), and normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at 3.06 μIU/mL (reference 0.34–5.66 μIU/mL).

### Gastrointestinal bleeding [^c180a81a]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding encompasses a broad array of clinical scenarios. The spectrum is diverse because of the multiple types of lesions that can cause bleeding, and because bleeding can occur from virtually anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The fundamental tenets of management of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding include the following: (1) the patient must undergo immediate assessment and stabilization of hemodynamic status, (2) the source of bleeding must be identified, (3) active bleeding should be stopped, (4) the underlying abnormality should be treated, and (5) recurrent bleeding should be "prevented.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1444633e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The management of bleeding ARV can be very challenging and essentially includes prompt resuscitation and correction of coagulopathy, immediate workup to localize the site/source of bleeding and then the application of a suitable treatment modality or immediate transfer to a tertiary referral center. Management options may vary with a combination of local/endoscopic, medical, radiological, and surgical methods available. In mild cases, intravenous fluid replacement, blood transfusion, correction of coagulopathy, and optimal medication for portal hypertension are usually effective.

Initial resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization are critical and patients' conditions should be optimized before endoscopic intervention. The management of comorbid conditions, including the appropriate management of anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants, requires a multidisciplinary and individualized approach.

The intravascular volume repletion is done with crystalloids and packed red blood cells. The targets of resuscitation are the restoration of hemodynamic status but avoiding over-expansion, which may exacerbate portal pressure, impair clot formation, and increase the risk of further bleeding. In fact, a certain degree of hypovolemia and hypotension promotes activation of endogenous vasoactive systems, leading to splanchnic vasoconstriction and, therefore, reducing portal blood flow and pressure. A recent randomized controlled trial showed that a restrictive packed red blood cell transfusion strategy improves survival in Child–Pugh A and B patients. The results of this study showed that patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding should be transfused when hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dl, aiming at a target level of 7–9 g/dl. Other risks related to blood product utilization are immunologic (transfusion-related lung injury and development of HLA antibodies) and can impact subsequent transplantation or impair the ability to receive further transfusions. A recent guideline from the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee suggests the following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding in advanced liver disease: hematocrit > 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dl. Exceptions to this restrictive strategy are massive bleeding, which should prompt the activation of a dedicated transfusional protocol, cardiovascular comorbidities, and any other condition that precludes adequate physiological response to acute anemia. It is important to keep in mind that an acute hypotension may decrease hepatic perfusion, which in the setting of underlying chronic liver disease can exacerbate liver injury. A helpful maneuver to slow down the bleeding rate could be the endorectal placement of a compression tube (i.e. Sengstaken-Blakemore Tube or a Linton-Nachlas balloon compression tube) held under moderate traction: this device should be left in place until the patient is sufficiently stabilized or until the patient is transferred to a center with available expertise. The placement of balloon tamponade can also give additional time to correctly study the patients with CT scans or other imaging techniques, thus enabling to tailor the management strategy to the anatomy of the bleeding vessel. Eventually, rebleeding is almost universal if another modality of treatment is not instituted.

### A case of ectopic pancreas in the ileum presenting as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain [^b5f1f8bb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 59-year-old man with 3 months history of intermittent melena accompanied by the episodes of abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant and generalized fatigue was admitted to the department. He denied any other change in bowel habits or a history of hemorrhoids and was referred to hospital for evaluation of the GI bleeding. Patient's medical history did not include any previous diagnoses. He was not taking any medications. At the time he was a non-smoker and did not consume any alcoholic drinks or recreational drugs. The patient also had two repeated episodes of left upper quadrant abdominal pain and dark black tarry feces within the last 3 months prior to admission to our hospital. However, symptoms resolved spontaneously and the patient did not make an appointment to see the doctor.

On examination the patient was pale, the abdomen was tender in the left upper abdominal area with no signs of rebound tenderness, no lump was palpable. Digital rectal examination revealed melena; the rest of the examination was unremarkable. The investigations showed that the patient had a low hemoglobin level, i.e. 10.9 g/dL with hypochromic microcytic anemia pattern seen in complete blood count (MCV 70.2 fl, MCH 21.4 pg). In addition, the patient had low serum iron, i.e. 6.4 μmol/L (normal range 9.5–29.9 μmol/L) and low ferritin levels, i.e. 28.8 μg/L (normal range 20–300 μg/L). The carcinoembryonic antigen level was 1.2 μg/L (normal < 5.00 μg/L). Other routine blood tests including lipase, plain chest and abdominal X rays along with abdominal ultrasound, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were unremarkable. Thorough conventional evaluation of GI bleeding has failed to reveal a source, therefore, it was rational to proceed with further investigation of the small intestine.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^4535a1f5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding — recommendations: We recommend colonoscopy in patients with occult GI bleeding. We recommend EGD in patients with occult GI bleeding if a bleeding source is not identified in the colon, especially in those patients with upper GI symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. We suggest small-bowel evaluation after negative EGD and colonoscopy results in patients with occult GI bleeding who have persistent anemia. We recommend colonoscopy for the evaluation of chronic intermittent scant hematochezia in patients aged > 50 years and for patients who have iron deficiency anemia, risk factors for colorectal neoplasia, or the alarm symptoms of weight loss or bowel habit changes. We suggest that in younger patients presenting with chronic intermittent scant hematochezia without alarm symptoms, a digital rectal examination and flexible sigmoidoscopy may be sufficient evaluation. We recommend EGD in the initial evaluation of patients with melena followed by colonoscopy if the EGD result is negative. We recommend an initial EGD in patients with severe hematochezia and hemodynamic instability to evaluate for a high-risk upper GI lesion, followed by colonoscopy if the EGD result is negative. We suggest colonoscopy within 24 hours of admission after a rapid bowel preparation in the evaluation of patients with severe hematochezia.

### Evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding [^a3107310]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Occult gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as gastrointestinal bleeding that is not visible to the patient or physician, resulting in either a positive fecal occult blood test, or iron deficiency anemia with or without a positive fecal occult blood test. A stepwise evaluation will identify the cause of bleeding in the majority of patients. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy will find the bleeding source in 48 to 71 percent of patients. In patients with recurrent bleeding, repeat EGD and colonoscopy may find missed lesions in 35 percent of those who had negative initial findings. If a cause is not found after EGD and colonoscopy have been performed, capsule endoscopy has a diagnostic yield of 61 to 74 percent. Deep enteroscopy reaches into the mid and distal small bowel to further investigate and treat lesions found during capsule endoscopy or computed tomographic enterography. Evaluation of a patient who has a positive fecal occult blood test without iron deficiency anemia should begin with colonoscopy; asymptomatic patients whose colonoscopic findings are negative do not require further study unless anemia develops. All men and postmenopausal women with iron deficiency anemia, and premenopausal women who have iron deficiency anemia that cannot be explained by heavy menses, should be evaluated for occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Physicians should not attribute a positive fecal occult blood test to low-dose aspirin or anticoagulant medications without further evaluation.

### Diagnostic accuracy systematic review of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and tests in relation to colorectal cancer [^979a9767]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Principal results

No individual symptom, sign or diagnostic test in patients with rectal bleeding is likely to shift the probability of colorectal cancer to the extent of 'ruling in' or 'ruling out' the diagnosis with any degree of certainty. Even the presence of anaemia (< 12.0 g per 100 mL for women and < 13.3 g per 100 mL for men) produces a shift in post-test probability to 21.6% (assuming a prior probability of 7.0%), a level that requires further diagnostic testing before colorectal cancer diagnosis is confirmed. 'Red flag' symptoms, such as weight loss and blood mixed with stool, seem to have only modest diagnostic value. Although the presence of these symptoms nearly doubles the post-test probability of colorectal cancer to about 13%, and their presence should ensure referral for further investigation, caution is needed when counselling patients about the possible reasons for their referral in terms of likely diagnoses. The fact that a presenting patient may be aged over 60 years also only provides modest diagnostic value in terms of probability of colorectal cancer (Table 3).

The findings from this systematic review have implications for clinical practice guidelines, showing that considerable diagnostic uncertainty is likely to exist in patients presenting to their general practitioner, even when they have additional symptoms, signs or test results that are conventionally associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The ideal threshold for referral is subject to several factors: individual patient's utilities or values regarding timely identification of colorectal cancer balanced against the iatrogenic harm and psychological damage of unnecessary investigation, and potential harm in patients free from disease. In addition, cost effectiveness of different referral thresholds in relation to probability of colorectal cancer also needs to be considered. To resolve these difficulties, formal cost utility estimates are required, which incorporate patient's utilities and cost at different referral thresholds.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding – management [^87f39486]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Although acute LGIB is only about one fifth as common and is usually less hemodynamically significant than upper gastrointestinal bleeding, it presents numerous unique clinical challenges. The best diagnostic approach for patients with active bleeding is unknown, but urgent prepared colonoscopy is safe and likely to be beneficial (Fig. 3, Table 2). In patients who have aggressive bleeding or recurrent bleeding, it is critical for the practitioner to judge when angiography and surgery are necessary.

### Diagnosis and management of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^c6c0769a]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that the initial assessment of patients presenting with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding should include: a history of co-morbidities and medications that promote bleeding; hemodynamic parameters; physical examination (including digital rectal examination); and laboratory markers. A risk score can be used to aid, but should not replace, clinician judgment. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that, in patients presenting with a self-limited bleed and no adverse clinical features, an Oakland score of ≤ 8 points can be used to guide the clinician decision to discharge the patient for outpatient investigation. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 7g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of 7-9g/dL is desirable. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a history of acute or chronic cardiovascular disease, a more liberal red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 8g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of ≥ 10g/dL is desirable. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 5: ESGE recommends that, in patients with major acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding, colonoscopy should be performed sometime during their hospital stay because there is no high quality evidence that early colonoscopy influences patient outcomes. Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence. 6: ESGE recommends that patients with hemodynamic instability and suspected ongoing bleeding undergo computed tomography angiography before endoscopic or radiologic treatment to locate the site of bleeding. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends withholding vitamin K antagonists in patients with major lower gastrointestinal bleeding and correcting their coagulopathy according to the severity of bleeding and their thrombotic risk. In patients with hemodynamic instability, we recommend administering intravenous vitamin K and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma if PCC is not available. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends temporarily withholding direct oral anticoagulants at presentation in patients with major lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 9: ESGE does not recommend withholding aspirin in patients taking low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention. If withheld, low dose aspirin should be resumed, preferably within 5 days or even earlier if hemostasis is achieved or there is no further evidence of bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 10: ESGE does not recommend routinely discontinuing dual antiplatelet therapy (low dose aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist) before cardiology consultation. Continuation of the aspirin is recommended, whereas the P2Y12 receptor antagonist can be continued or temporarily interrupted according to the severity of bleeding and the ischemic risk. If interrupted, the P2Y12 receptor antagonist should be restarted within 5 days, if still indicated. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.

In general, the likelihood of an adverse outcome increases with the number of risk factors present, and monitoring in an intensive care setting should be considered in patients with high-risk features.

### The mortality of colorectal cancer in relation to the initial symptom at presentation to primary care and to the duration of symptoms: a cohort study using medical records [^f8e5ce6c]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

The associations between rectal bleeding as an initial symptom and better mortality, and between mild anaemia and worse mortality are important findings. The only other studies to examine outcomes in relation to the initial symptom reported better staging with rectal bleeding, and worse staging with either abdominal pain or anaemia (though anaemia was described in that paper as a symptom, rather than being confirmed by estimation of the haemoglobin, as in the study reported here). The mortality in relation to these symptoms was not reported in either previous paper, though it would be expected to mirror the staging differences.

Why is rectal bleeding as an initial symptom linked with a good prognosis and anaemia with a poor prognosis? The associations remained present even once the recognised confounders of emergency admission, sex, and the site of the tumour were added to the model, so these variables cannot explain the results. There are two likely explanations. The first possible explanation is that anaemia arises from colorectal cancers as a result of persistent, occult, bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, so the bleeding (and the tumour) will have been present for some time, perhaps months. In contrast, overt rectal bleeding may occur early in the development of the tumour. A second possibility is that doctors are more alert to the possibility of cancer with rectal bleeding and choose to investigate, even though current guidance suggests 6 weeks of isolated bleeding is required to warrant urgent investigation. Although severe anaemia is recognised as a feature of possible colorectal cancer, with a risk of approximately 7%, it is still under-investigated in around half of primary care patients. Mild anaemia, with haemoglobin values in the range 10.0–12.9 g dL −1, is common in the elderly population, but carries a risk of colorectal cancer of around 1%. Many GPs would not even consider the possibility of cancer with such mild anaemia – and others may consider investigation of the gastrointestinal tract inappropriate when the risk is relatively low. Nonetheless, it is likely that our finding of increased mortality from colorectal cancer when anaemia is the initial feature will be perpetuated unless doctors change their investigatory behaviour. Testing the stool of such patients for occult blood would be good clinical practice.

### Hemorrhoids [^084eefb4]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Most patients with hemorrhoids experience only mild symptoms that can be treated with nonprescription topical preparations. Patients usually seek treatment when symptoms increase. Internal hemorrhoids typically present with prolapse or painless rectal bleeding. External hemorrhoids also bleed and can cause acute pain if thrombosed. Medical therapy should be initiated with stool softeners plus local therapy to relieve swelling and symptoms. If medical therapy is inadequate, surgical intervention is warranted. Rubber band ligation is the treatment of choice for grades 1 and 2 hemorrhoids. Rubber band ligation, excisional hemorrhoidectomy, or stapled hemorrhoidopexy can be performed in patients with grade 3 hemorrhoids. Rubber band ligation causes less postoperative pain and fewer complications than excisional hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy, but has a higher recurrence rate. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy is recommended for treatment of grade 4 hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has a faster postoperative recovery, but a higher recurrence rate. Postoperative pain from excisional hemorrhoidectomy can be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, fiber supplements, and topical antispasmodics. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be treated conservatively or excised.

Traditional hemorrhoidectomy remains very effective, stapled hemorrhoidopexy shows slightly lower complication rates but higher long-term recurrence rates compared with standard hemorrhoidectomy and is an established alternative in most cases, and for Doppler-assisted hemorrhoidal artery ligation success rates are comparable to hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy although comparative studies are lacking.

### Emergency medicine updates: lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^01adaf5f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department. Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning LGIB for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

LGIB is most commonly due to diverticulosis or anorectal disease, though there are a variety of etiologies. The majority of cases resolve spontaneously, but patients can have severe bleeding resulting in hemodynamic instability. Initial evaluation should focus on patient hemodynamics, the severity of bleeding, and differentiating upper gastrointestinal bleeding from LGIB. Factors associated with LGIB include prior history of LGIB, age over 50 years, and presence of blood clots per rectum. Computed tomography angiography is the imaging modality of choice in those with severe bleeding to diagnose the source of bleeding and guide management when embolization is indicated. Among stable patients without severe bleeding, colonoscopy is the recommended modality for diagnosis and management. A transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL hemoglobin is recommended based on recent data and guidelines (8 g/dL in those with myocardial ischemia), though patients with severe bleeding and hemodynamic instability should undergo emergent transfusion. Anticoagulation reversal may be necessary. If bleeding does not resolve, embolization or endoscopic therapies are necessary. There are several risk scores that can predict the risk of adverse outcomes; however, these scores should not replace clinical judgment in determining patient disposition.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the care of patients with LGIB.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^13d47ce0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding epidemiology and definitions — acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) accounts for ~20% of all cases of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, usually leads to hospital admission with invasive diagnostic evaluations, and consumes significant medical resources. Although most patients with acute LGIB stop bleeding spontaneously and have favorable outcomes, morbidity and mortality are increased in older patients and those with comorbid medical conditions. An individual with acute LGIB classically presents with the sudden onset of hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed per rectum), although in rare cases patients with bleeding from the cecum/right colon can present with melena (black, tarry stools), and hematochezia can be seen in patients with brisk upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Approximately 15% of patients with presumed LGIB are ultimately found to have an upper GI source for their bleeding, and for the purposes of this guideline, we define LGIB as the onset of hematochezia originating from either the colon or the rectum.

In up to half of the patients presenting with rectal bleeding after radiotherapy, the bleeding is not caused by the radiotherapy so no assumptions as to the cause of the bleeding should be made. All patients should be assessed with digital rectal examination and either flexible sigmoidoscopy (if the bleeding is bright red) or colonoscopy. Virtual CT colonoscopy is less helpful for assessing bleeding unless there is a high suspicion of a neoplasm within the bowel.

Endoscopy frequently reveals telangiectasia after pelvic radiotherapy. These can be categorised in different ways, but the correlation between the endoscopic appearance and the risk of bleeding is poor. Biopsy of irradiated mucosa does not contribute usefully to making a diagnosis of radiation damage and carries a risk of fistula development or necrosis. Biopsies should be carried out cautiously if neoplastic or inflammatory processes seem likely.

Treatment approaches to radiation-induced bleeding

Many treatment options for people with bleeding interfering with their life have been described, but there is no agreed optimal approach. All treatments used historically for radiation-induced bleeding carry a significant risk of serious complications. Treatment is only required if symptoms demand it (eg, faecal incontinence with blood, rectal bleeding interfering with daily life, transfusion-dependent bleeding or recurrent anaemia). Reassurance and explanation of the natural history of radiation bleeding are often all that is necessary. Where anaemia or troublesome symptoms are present, a number of strategies exist, a recommended approach to management is described in figure 8.

Argon plasma coagulation is widely used for bleeding radiation proctopathy. However, it carries a serious complication rate of up to 26%, including stricture formation, rectal pain, perforation and fistula formation. Its use is absolutely contraindicated on the anterior rectal wall after prostate brachytherapy because of the high risk of fistula formation, which invariably then requires diversion of the bowel.

### Visible vessel in diverticular bleeding: a rare sighting [^f6c0bcb0]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old male with a remote history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease presented to the emergency department after having hematochezia. He denied having abdominal pain, hematemesis, rectal tenderness, or prior hemorrhoids. Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient had a syncopal event while having another episode of hematochezia. The patient was stabilized with intravenous fluids and 1 unit of packed red blood cells. His hematocrit remained stable, and he was prepped for colonoscopy overnight. Colonoscopy revealed moderately severe diverticulosis. Using an Olympus ® 190 colonoscope, a diverticulum was noted to have old blood covering it. After irrigation there was a non-bleeding visible vessel within the base of the diverticulum. Using the near-focus resolution and water immersion, the visible vessel was closely evaluated (Fig. 1). A Cook ® Instinct clip was then placed across the base of the visible vessel (Fig. 2). The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no further bleeding during his hospitalization.

Figure 1

Early colonoscopy is indicated as a safe and efficacious diagnostic and therapeutic modality for acute lower GI bleeding. While diverticular bleeding is one of the most common causes of lower GI hemorrhage, greater than 70% of episodes resolve without intervention. Stigmata of bleeding, such as adherent clot and non-bleeding visible vessel, have prognostic implications as these findings indicate a greater risk of re-bleeding, and thus warrant therapeutic intervention. Mechanical hemostasis, which prevents early re-bleeding, can be safely achieved by endoscopic clipping technique, as demonstrated in our case.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding-computed tomographic angiography, colonoscopy or both? [^c0fe0e0f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a common clinical problem, representing 20 to 30% of patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. LGIB incidence is increasing over time, as it is associated with older age and pre-existing comorbidities. Very distal bleeding, e.g. due to hemorrhoids and low rectal cancer, is rather easy to diagnose, but bleeding from the colon and small bowel remains a diagnostic challenge. According to recent guidelines, hemodynamic stabilization and resuscitation must be performed prior to search any bleeding source. While nasogastric lavage and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy can be considered to rule out upper gastrointestinal bleeding for patients presenting severe hematochezia, lower endoscopy (LE) is the preferred diagnostic approach for LGIB. Nevertheless, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for evaluation of GI bleeding is increasingly used and may challenges lower endoscopy as most appropriate tool. This non-invasive diagnostic modality is readily available in most hospitals and can be rapidly performed without any bowel preparation. Reported sensitivity and specificity rates are 86 and 95%, respectively and bleeding as low as 0.4ml/min can be detected.

So far, there is only limited evidence on the routine use of CTA in the initial management of LGIB. Its accuracy compared to LE remains unclear; and subsequently, its use as a first-line diagnostic modality is not considered in current management algorithms.

This current study aimed to compare the accuracy of CTA and colonoscopy in the diagnosis of LGIB and their influence on bleeding control.

Occult and obscure bleeding are challenging conditions to manage; however, recent advances in gastroenterology and endoscopy have improved our diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is an umbrella category of bleeding of unknown origin that persists or recurs after endoscopic evaluation of the entire bowel fails to reveal a bleeding source. This review details the evaluation of patients with occult and obscure GI bleeding and offers diagnostic algorithms. The treatment of GI bleeding depends on the type and location of the bleeding lesion and an overview of how to manage these conditions is presented.

Clinical Presentation

A middle-aged man was admitted for episodes of fresh per-rectal bleeding, which were not associated with defecation. He was recently investigated for macrocytic anaemia in the outpatient haematology clinic. Examination of the perineum revealed grade 1 internal haemorrhoids with no signs of bleeding. Initial laboratory tests revealed macrocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 10.5g/dL, normal 12.9–17.0 g/dL; mean corpuscular haemoglobin 95.3fL, normal 80.0–95.0 fL). Peripheral blood film showing blasts, dysplastic neutrophils, nucleated red blood cells and hypogranular platelets. The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy and rubber band ligation of the internal haemorrhoids after persistent fresh per-rectal bleeding. The bleeding persisted with the development of hypotension and a significant drop of haemoglobin to 4.8g/dL requiring blood transfusions and intensive care monitoring. Repeated endoscopy, including intubation of the terminal ileum, revealed uncomplicated right-sided diverticulosis. CT mesenteric angiography performed during an episode of significant bleeding revealed extravasation of contrast in the ileum, but mesenteric angiography was unsuccessful, possibly due to a temporary cessation of bleeding. Bleeding subsequently recurred and in light of the persistent bleeding with no clear source and with a total of 12units of packed cell transfused, exploratory laparotomy, on-table enteroscopy (figure 1) with small bowel resection was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen was performed (figures 2–4).gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F1F1GUTJNL2016313252F1Figure 1Multiple ileal lesions with stigmata of recent bleed.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F2F2GUTJNL2016313252F2Figure 2Area of ulceration associated with atypical mononuclear infiltrate.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F3F3GUTJNL2016313252F3Figure 3Atypical mononuclear infiltrate composed of cells with enlarged, irregular nuclei containing variably prominent nucleoli.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F4F4GUTJNL2016313252F4Figure 4Atypical cells displayed cytoplasmic expression of myeloperoxidase.

Suspected small-bowel bleeding — algorithmic endoscopic and imaging approach includes an initial step to "Repeat EGD/PE or colonoscopy when upper or lower GI sources suspected," followed by small-bowel evaluation stratified as "Stable (overt or occult)" versus "Unstable, brisk bleeding (overt)." For unstable overt bleeding, the pathway specifies "RBC scan or CT angiography after stabilization" with "Angiography for embolization." Stable evaluation references modality selection by anatomy, including "Possible obstruction or surgically altered anatomy" leading to cross-sectional imaging such as "Multiphase CTE or MRE," and capsule-based options per the figure's legend expansions of "VCE, video capsule endoscopy." Recurrence management options include "Observation and iron supplements" or "Repeat EGD/colonoscopy, VCE, ± intraoperative enteroscopy."

### Hemorrhoidectomy for thrombosed external hemorrhoids [^9484ca88]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

External hemorrhoids represent distended vascular tissue in the anal canal distal to the dentate line. Persons with thrombosed external hemorrhoids usually present with pain on standing, sitting or defecating. Acutely tender, thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be surgically removed if encountered within the first 72 hours after onset. Hemorrhoidectomy is performed through an elliptic incision over the site of thrombosis with removal of the entire diseased hemorrhoidal plexus in one piece. Caution must be exercised to avoid cutting into the muscle sphincter below the hemorrhoidal vessels. Infection after suture closure is rare secondary to the rich vascular network in the anal area. Stool softeners must be prescribed postoperatively to help prevent tearing at the suture line. Training and experience in general and skin surgery are necessary before the physician attempts this procedure unsupervised.

Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients — initial evaluation and differential: When elderly persons present with symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and weight loss, providers should have a strong clinical suspicion for IBD, but compared with persons younger than 40 years those older than 60 years are more likely to have mimics including colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced pathology, radiation enteritis or colitis, or microscopic colitis. The first diagnostic steps should include laboratory investigations that include a complete blood count and serum albumin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels; liver enzymes and urea and creatinine levels serve to assess comorbidities and provide a baseline for toxicity monitoring. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile in all new presentations of diarrhea, regardless of antibiotic use history, and selective testing of stool for culture and ova and parasites may be appropriate. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography is appropriate in elderly persons with acute symptoms, especially when abdominal pain is prominent, and colonoscopy with histologic confirmation remains a cornerstone of diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^812c9b1f]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) can present as an acute and life-threatening event or as chronic bleeding, which might manifest as iron-deficiency anemia, fecal occult blood or intermittent scant hematochezia. Bleeding from the small bowel has been shown to be a distinct entity, and LGIB is defined as bleeding from a colonic source. Acute bleeding from the colon is usually less dramatic than upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and is self-limiting in most cases. Several factors might contribute to increased mortality, a severe course of bleeding and recurrent bleeding, including advanced age, comorbidity, intestinal ischemia, bleeding as a result of a separate process, and hemodynamic instability. Diverticula, angiodysplasias, neoplasms, colitis, ischemia, anorectal disorders and postpolypectomy bleeding are the most common causes of LGIB. Volume resuscitation should take place concurrently upon initial patient assessment. Colonoscopy is the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice, for acute and chronic bleeding. Angiography is used if colonoscopy fails or cannot be performed. The use of radioisotope scans is reserved for cases of unexplained intermittent bleeding, when other methods have failed to detect the source. Embolization or modern endoscopy techniques, such as injection therapy, thermocoagulation and mechanical devices, effectively promote hemostasis. Surgery is the final approach for severe bleeding.

### Hemorrhoidal disease: a review [^34d2d88e]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hemorrhoidal disease, pathology of the tissue lining of the anal canal, affects approximately 10 million individuals in the US. Hemorrhoidal disease may impair quality of life due to bleeding, pain, anal irritation, and tissue prolapse.

Observations

Hemorrhoids are classified as internal, external, or mixed (concurrent internal and external hemorrhoidal disease). Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line, the boundary between the upper and lower anal canal, and may cause rectal bleeding, discomfort, and tissue prolapse from the anal canal. Internal hemorrhoid prolapse is classified as grade I (into anal canal), grade II (beyond the anus with spontaneous reduction), grade III (requiring manual reduction), and grade IV (irreducible). External hemorrhoids, arising below the dentate line, cause rectal pain when engorged or thrombosed. Initial treatment of all hemorrhoidal disease involves increasing intake of dietary fiber and water and avoiding straining during defecation. Phlebotonics (eg, flavonoids [thought to improve venous tone]) reduce bleeding, rectal pain, and swelling, although symptom recurrence reaches 80% within 3 to 6 months after treatment cessation. If dietary modification and phlebotonics are ineffective, grade I to grade III internal hemorrhoidal disease can be treated with office-based interventions. Rubber band ligation-placing a band around the base of hemorrhoid tissue during anoscopy to restrict blood flow-resolves symptoms in 89% of patients, but repeated banding is needed in up to 20%. Sclerotherapy, which induces fibrosis with a sclerosant injection, is efficacious in the short term (weeks to months) among 70% to 85% of patients, but long-term remission occurs in only one-third of patients. Infrared coagulation uses heat to coagulate hemorrhoidal tissue, yielding 70% to 80% success in reducing bleeding and prolapse. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy, for disease unresponsive to office-based therapy or for mixed hemorrhoidal disease, achieves low recurrence (2%-10%), although with longer recovery (9–14 days). External hemorrhoidal disease rarely requires surgery unless acutely thrombosed. Outpatient clot evacuation within 72 hours of onset of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is associated with decreased pain and reduced risk of repeat thrombosis. Patients presenting more than 72 hours after external hemorrhoid acute thrombosis should receive medical treatment (eg, stool softeners, oral and topical analgesics such as 5% lidocaine).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hemorrhoidal disease affects 10 million people in the US. First-line treatment is increased fiber intake, avoidance of straining during defecation, and phlebotonics. In-office rubber band ligation for grade I to III internal hemorrhoid disease is first-line procedural treatment for persistent symptoms despite conservative therapies. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for grade III to IV prolapse, thrombosis, or mixed hemorrhoidal disease that does not improve with less invasive approaches.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to bowel preparation, ACG 2016 guidelines recommend to perform colonoscopy after adequate colon cleansing in hemodynamically stable patients. Administer 4–6 liters of a polyethylene glycol-based solution (or equivalent) over 3–4 hours, until the rectal effluent is clear of blood and stool. Avoid performing an unprepped colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy.

Internal hemorrhoids — procedural cautions, banding limits, and indications are outlined. Experts caution against RBL of internal hemorrhoids in sedated patients because significant pain from errant bands near or below the dentate line can occur. Usually, no more than 3 hemorrhoidal groups are banded in 1 session, and some experts advocate placing only 1 band at a time. Hemorrhoidal disease requiring 4 or more bands was associated with higher failure and greater need for operative hemorrhoidectomy. Surgical treatments are the treatments of choice for fourth-degree, strangulated, or refractory hemorrhoids, whereas RBL is the treatment of choice for mild rectal mucosal prolapse and bleeding in first-, second-, and selected third-degree hemorrhoids when medical treatments fail; surgery should be reserved for very large third- and fourth-degree hemorrhoids or when RBL fails.

Case presentation

A 77-year-old woman presented with 2 months history of intermittent painless per rectal bleeding and symptoms of anaemia. The character of bleeding ranged from fresh to dark red and mixed in the stools.

Her previous medical history was significant for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with moderate aortic stenosis, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. She also had diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, resulting in stage 4 chronic kidney disease not yet requiring dialysis.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of constipation [^3957befe]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Constipation — endoscopic evaluation indications — states that patients with constipation should undergo colonoscopy if they have rectal bleeding, heme-positive stool, iron deficiency anemia, weight loss, or obstructive symptoms; colonoscopy should be considered in selected patients to exclude obstruction from cancer, stricture, and extrinsic compression; colonoscopy also should be done prior to surgery for constipation; in younger patients, a flexible sigmoidoscopy may be sufficient to exclude distal disease; suspected Hirschsprung's disease requires anorectal manometry and deep biopsy to examine for the absence of myenteric neurons.

### AGA clinical practice update on young adult-onset colorectal cancer diagnosis and management: expert review [^971398e6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — young adult–onset colorectal cancer (CRC) is defined as CRC diagnosed in individuals 18 - < 50 years of age. With the rising incidence of people developing CRC before 50 years of age, diagnostic evaluation of the colon and rectum is encouraged for all patients, irrespective of age, who present with symptoms that may be consistent with CRC, including but not limited to: rectal bleeding, weight loss, change in bowel habit, abdominal pain, iron deficiency anemia. Clinicians should obtain family history of colorectal and other cancers in first and second degree relatives of patients with young adult–onset CRC and discuss genetic evaluation with germline genetic testing either in targeted genes based on phenotypic presentation or in multiplex gene panels regardless of family history. Clinicians should present the role of fertility preservation prior to cancer-directed therapy including surgery, pelvic radiation, or chemotherapy. Clinicians should counsel young patients on the benefit of germline genetic testing and familial cancer panel testing in the pre-surgical period to inform which surgical options may be available to the patient with young adult–onset CRC. Clinicians should consider utilizing germline and somatic genetic testing results to inform chemotherapeutic strategies. Clinicians should offer hereditary CRC syndrome specific screening for CRC and extra-colonic cancers only to young adult–onset CRC patients who have a genetically or clinically diagnosed hereditary CRC syndrome, and for patients with sporadic young adult-onset CRC, extra-colonic screening and CRC surveillance intervals are the same as for patients with older adult-onset CRC.

Internal hemorrhoids — initial treatment selection: We suggest rubber band ligation (RBL) or sclerotherapy as the initial treatment of choice for first-degree internal hemorrhoids that bleed but do not prolapse when conservative management has failed, and we recommend RBL as the initial treatment of choice for patients with chronic bleeding and/or prolapsing internal hemorrhoids of second- and third-degree in whom conservative management fails.
