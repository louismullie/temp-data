## Question

Twitching of the foot in 2 month old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 2-month-old infant with foot twitching, including differential diagnosis, red flags, evaluation, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise characterization of the movements and the infant's overall appearance. Then, I should categorize likely etiologies into benign versus concerning causes. Next, I will outline a focused history and examination to separate benign from pathologic movements. After that, I will define red flags that mandate urgent evaluation. Finally, I will specify when to obtain EEG, labs, and imaging, and close with counseling and follow-up plans, ensuring I verify each step against the best available guidance and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the key descriptors I need to capture: timing (sleep vs awake), symmetry, rhythmicity, clustering, associated autonomic changes, and whether the movements are suppressible or stimulus-provoked. I also need to check for developmental milestones, feeding, and growth trajectory, because these contextual features strongly influence pretest probabilities and next steps [^117JEu8F] [^115NnS6a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize the differential into benign physiologic movements versus epileptic, metabolic, structural, or neuromuscular etiologies. Benign sleep myoclonus is common in early infancy, typically occurs in sleep, is not associated with autonomic changes, and stops with passive flexion. Benign myoclonus of early infancy can mimic infantile spasms but has a normal EEG and excellent prognosis. Infantile spasms, by contrast, are clustered, often symmetric, and associated with hypsarrhythmia and developmental regression, requiring urgent treatment. Hyperekplexia presents with exaggerated startle and stiffness. Hypocalcemia can cause jitteriness or seizures. And structural or neuromuscular causes may show focal weakness or asymmetry, so I need to ensure I screen for these patterns carefully [^114bJXGk] [^113RUjU7] [^112xXa57] [^116g6AD3] [^113Ww6E1] [^113TjziS].

> Wait, let me verify the seizure mimics that commonly confuse families and clinicians. Benign sleep myoclonus ceases with passive limb flexion and lacks autonomic compromise, whereas epileptic seizures are typically uninterruptible and may involve color change, apnea, or heart rate shifts. Similarly, jitteriness from hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia is often stimulus-provoked and may be accompanied by feeding difficulty or irritability, so I should double-check for these systemic clues before labeling a spell as epileptic [^117JEu8F] [^115bsqPn] [^113Ww6E1].

> I need to check the focused history next: perinatal course including gestational age, birth complications, and NICU stay; family history of seizures, neuromuscular disease, or metabolic disorders; medication exposures including maternal calcium or vitamin D excess, antacids, and psychotropics; and detailed characterization of the movements with timing, triggers, and evolution, because these elements shift the likelihood of benign versus pathologic causes substantially [^113Ww6E1] [^1122GQxY].

> Let me consider the examination elements I must not miss: general appearance and growth, head circumference, fontanels, and skin findings; cranial nerves and fundi; tone and strength in neck, trunk, and limbs; symmetry of spontaneous movements; deep tendon reflexes; primitive reflexes including Moro and plantar grasp; and careful inspection of the feet for deformities or skin crease asymmetry suggesting metatarsus adductus or clubfoot, since these orthopedic variants are common and can coexist with movement concerns [^111Tmjpx] [^114jtDCp] [^115Wfqyx].

> But wait, what if the movements are clustered, symmetric, and occur in drowsy states? I should confirm whether this fits infantile spasms, which require urgent EEG and treatment because delays worsen neurodevelopmental outcomes. Telemedicine-enabled video review is acceptable, and parents should be coached to capture multiple events with the whole body visible to distinguish spasms from benign myoclonus or sleep-related movements [^112xXa57] [^116vye1P] [^116NE3AV].

> I should double-check for red flags that mandate urgent evaluation: movements during wakefulness with altered awareness, rhythmic clonic jerking, autonomic changes such as color change or apnea, persistent focal deficits or asymmetry, failure to thrive, or regression. Any of these should prompt same-day EEG and consideration of labs and imaging rather than watchful waiting [^117JEu8F] [^116NE3AV].

> Next, I should review when to obtain EEG, labs, and imaging. EEG is indicated if movements are suspected to be epileptic, occur in wakefulness, are rhythmic or clonic, or are clustered with developmental concerns; continuous video EEG is the gold standard for classification and detection of subclinical seizures; basic labs such as glucose, calcium, magnesium, and electrolytes are reasonable if there are systemic signs, feeding issues, or risk factors for metabolic derangements; neuroimaging is reserved for focal deficits, abnormal exam, or when seizures persist despite initial evaluation [^117JEu8F] [^115bsqPn] [^111dFw7y].

> Hold on, I should verify the benign entities I might reassure about. Benign sleep myoclonus typically resolves spontaneously and does not require treatment. Benign myoclonus of early infancy is diagnosed with a normal EEG and has an excellent prognosis. Hyperekplexia may need low-dose benzodiazepines if severe, but most infants recover fully. Metatarsus adductus and flexible clubfoot often respond to stretching and observation, with early referral if rigid or uncorrected by 2 months, so I need to ensure parents receive clear return precautions and developmental surveillance plans [^114bJXGk] [^113RUjU7] [^116g6AD3] [^114jtDCp].

> I will now examine the management pathway by scenario. If the infant is well-appearing with sleep-only, suppressible, non-clustered movements and a normal exam, I should counsel on benign sleep myoclonus, provide anticipatory guidance, and arrange routine follow-up. If movements are concerning for infantile spasms, I should arrange urgent pediatric neurology referral and EEG within days. If there are focal deficits or persistent asymmetry, I should consider brain MRI and neurology input. If there are systemic signs or risk factors for hypocalcemia or hypoglycemia, I should obtain targeted labs and treat promptly. Throughout, I should coach parents to record events and avoid unnecessary antiepileptic therapy unless a diagnosis warrants it [^112xXa57] [^117JEu8F] [^115bsqPn] [^113RUjU7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked the importance of developmental surveillance at 2 months. I should confirm milestones and feeding, and if asymmetries or postural preferences are present, I should consider early intervention referrals and follow-up aligned with pediatric physical therapy guidance to optimize motor development and detect atypical patterns early [^112ECKSD] [^1143bQbN].

> In summary, I need to ensure the movements are characterized precisely, the infant's systemic and neurologic status is intact, and red flags are actively excluded. Most isolated, sleep-related foot twitching in a thriving 2-month-old is benign, but persistent wakeful movements, clustering, autonomic changes, focal deficits, or regression should trigger EEG and targeted workup without delay, with parental video documentation serving as a critical diagnostic adjunct [^117JEu8F] [^116vye1P] [^116NE3AV].

Foot twitching in a 2-month-old is most often due to **benign sleep myoclonus** [^114bJXGk] or **immature nervous system** [^117JEu8F], especially if it occurs during sleep, is brief, symmetric, and stops with gentle stimulation. Persistent, asymmetric, or daytime twitching with altered tone, feeding difficulty, or developmental delay warrants evaluation for seizures, metabolic disturbances, or neuromuscular disorders [^113A6mnQ] [^113Ww6E1] [^113TjziS]. Red flags include rhythmic jerking, color change, apnea, or poor feeding; these require **urgent pediatric evaluation** and may need EEG, labs, or imaging [^117JEu8F] [^116DMzBH]. Most cases are benign and resolve spontaneously, but persistent or atypical movements should be assessed by a pediatrician.

---

## Normal developmental considerations

At 2 months, the nervous system is immature, and **benign sleep myoclonus** — brief, symmetric, stimulus-sensitive jerks during sleep — is common and self-limited [^114bJXGk]. The **plantar grasp reflex** may also cause brief foot movements when the sole is stimulated and typically disappears by 6 months [^111Tmjpx].

---

## Common benign causes of foot twitching

| **Condition** | **Description** | **Clinical features** | **Prognosis** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benign sleep myoclonus | Brief, symmetric jerks during sleep | - Occurs in sleep <br/> - Stops with stimulation <br/> - Normal exam | Self-limited; excellent [^114bJXGk] |
| Immature nervous system | Developmental motor immaturity | - Brief <br/> - Symmetric <br/> - No other symptoms | Resolves with development [^notfound] |
| Plantar grasp reflex | Reflexive foot movement with sole stimulation | - Triggered by touch <br/> - Normal exam | Disappears by 6 months [^111Tmjpx] |

## Potential medical concerns

While most foot twitching is benign, persistent or atypical movements may indicate underlying pathology:

- **Seizures**: Rhythmic, unprovoked, asymmetric, or associated with color change, apnea, or altered tone [^117JEu8F] [^112T9CXu].
- **Metabolic disturbances**: Hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, or electrolyte imbalances can cause twitching or seizures [^113Ww6E1] [^115bsqPn].
- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Congenital myopathies or peripheral neuropathies may present with weakness, hypotonia, or asymmetric movements [^113TjziS] [^112YQZpS].
- **Medication withdrawal**: Maternal medications (e.g. baclofen) can cause neonatal withdrawal with jitteriness or twitching [^113dn64f].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

- Rhythmic, repetitive, or unprovoked twitching
- Asymmetric movements or persistent focal twitching
- Associated color change (cyanosis, pallor)
- Apnea or breathing irregularities
- Altered muscle tone (hypotonia or hypertonia)
- Feeding difficulties or poor weight gain
- Developmental delay or regression

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

If red flags are present, evaluation may include:

- **Clinical history and examination**: Detailed characterization of movements, perinatal history, and family history [^notfound].
- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: To differentiate epileptic from non-epileptic movements [^117JEu8F].
- **Laboratory tests**: Calcium, glucose, electrolytes, and metabolic screening [^notfound].
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or ultrasound if structural brain abnormalities are suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management and follow-up

Benign cases require **reassurance and observation**, with routine developmental follow-up. Pathological cases are managed by treating the **underlying cause** — anticonvulsants for seizures, correcting metabolic abnormalities, or neurology referral for neuromuscular disorders. Regular developmental assessments are essential to ensure normal progression.

---

## Prognosis

Benign causes have an **excellent prognosis**, with spontaneous resolution and normal development. Pathological causes vary with the underlying condition and the timeliness of intervention.

---

Foot twitching in a 2-month-old is usually benign and self-limited, but persistent, asymmetric, or associated with other symptoms warrants evaluation. Most cases resolve spontaneously, but **red flags** should prompt urgent pediatric assessment.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

Study 2

Study 2 (N = 40) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study consisting of a pre-treatment (baseline) period of 2 to 3 days, followed by a 5-day double-blind treatment phase during which patients were treated with vigabatrin (initial dose of 50 mg/kg/day with titration allowed to 150 mg/kg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the average percent change in daily spasm frequency, assessed during a pre-defined and consistent 2-hour window of evaluation, comparing baseline to the final 2 days of the 5-day double-blind treatment phase. No statistically significant differences were observed in the average frequency of spasms using the 2-hour evaluation window. However, a post-hoc alternative efficacy analysis, using a 24-hour clinical evaluation window found a statistically significant difference in the overall percentage of reductions in spasms between the vigabatrin group (68.9%) and the placebo group (17.0%) (p = 0.030).

Duration of therapy for infantile spasms was evaluated in a post hoc analysis of a Canadian Pediatric Epilepsy Network (CPEN) study of developmental outcomes in infantile spasms patients. The 38/68 infants in the study who had responded to vigabatrin therapy (complete cessation of spasms and hypsarrhythmia) continued vigabatrin therapy for a total duration of 6 months therapy. The 38 infants who responded were then followed for an additional 18 months after discontinuation of vigabatrin to determine their clinical outcome. A post hoc analysis indicated no observed recurrence of infantile spasms in any of these 38 infants.

### A 15-day-old male infant presenting with jerking movements of the limbs [^114bJXGk]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

This 15-day-old Caucasian male infant presented to the clinic with his mother for a well-child visit. During the visit, the mother mentioned that she had observed jerking movements of the limbs, arms more than legs. Various tests were performed and observation in the ward helped determine the characteristics of the seizure-like movements. The infant was born by vaginal delivery with vacuum extraction with a history of possible perinatal asphyxia. After seizures were observed in the ward, the patient was referred to neurology where an EEG was performed. It was normal, excluding epilepsy states. A normal newborn screen excluded most metabolic disorders. After history and examination, investigations and observation, benign sleep myoclonus was diagnosed. Benign sleep myoclonus is a benign disorder that consists of jerking movements of the limbs, usually involving the upper limbs more than the lower limbs and usually occurring during sleep. The seizures spontaneously stopped when the infant was approximately 1.5 months old. This was consistent with the final diagnosis of neonatal sleep myoclonus.

### Benign myoclonus of early infancy: an imitator of west's syndrome [^113RUjU7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Benign myoclonus of early infancy is a rare condition characterized by nonepileptic spasms that may resemble the epileptic spasms seen in West's syndrome. The spells in benign myoclonus of early infancy begin before age 1 year and are self-limited. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is invariably normal, and neurologic development is not affected. West's syndrome is characterized by infantile spasms that appear before 1 year of age, an abnormal EEG with hypsarrhythmia, and a poor prognosis. We describe six infants who presented for evaluation of clusters of head, trunk or extremity spasms, eye blinking, brief jerking of upper extremities or trunk, and head nodding episodes. In most, a presumptive diagnosis of West's syndrome was made prior to the referral. One infant had been placed on valproate. Routine EEG recordings or prolonged video EEG monitoring were normal both during and between episodes. After the negative evaluations, the diagnosis of benign myoclonus of early infancy was made in each infant. Subsequently, no infant was treated with anticonvulsants. Follow-up revealed complete resolution of the episodes in all children within 2 weeks to 8 months of onset. All had normal neurologic development. Based on our cases and review of the literature, the prognosis for this disorder is excellent. Care should be taken to recognize this rare entity and avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful antiepileptic therapy.

### Reliability of quantifying foot and ankle muscle strength in very young children [^114pTpKG]. Muscle & Nerve (2008). Low credibility.

Preschool-age children with neuromuscular disorders are often excluded from clinical trials due to the lack of reliable and objective strength measures. We evaluated the reliability of measuring foot and ankle muscle strength in 60 healthy children age 2–4 years. The strength of foot inversion and eversion, ankle plantarflexion, and dorsiflexion was measured using a hand-held dynamometer. Intrarater and interrater reliability of two assessors was determined for each muscle group using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and standard error of measurement (SEM). For all muscle groups intrarater (ICC(2,2) = 0.85–0.94, 95% CI = 0.75–0.96, SEM = 1.5–4.7 N) and interrater (ICC(2,1) = 0.88–0.96, 95% CI = 0.81–0.98, SEM = 1.2–4.6 N) reliability was high for all children. As expected, reliability was generally highest in 3- and 4-year-old children and lowest in 2-year-old children. Hand-held dynamometry can reliably measure foot and ankle strength in very young children and may help aid in diagnosis and in characterizing disease progression in disorders affecting the foot and ankle.

### A novel homozygous p. Ser69Pro SOD1 mutation causes severe young-onset ALS with decreased enzyme activity [^115Y8M83]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The parents of the index patient (IV-2) were cousins and had one daughter and two sons (Fig. 1). There was no history of a neuromuscular disease in the family before the youngest brother (IV-4) developed a right foot drop at the age of 10 years. Within a few months, the disease spread to the other limbs and bulbar muscles. He died from respiratory failure at the age of 12 years. No autopsy or genetic study was done. A diagnosis of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was postulated. His sister (IV-2) started experiencing cramps of both lower limbs upon walking or standing for longer periods at the age of 25 years. At the age of 26 years, and during her third month of pregnancy, she started complaining of weakness of her right foot rapidly progressing to foot drop. Shortly after delivering a healthy baby, a neurological examination revealed weakness of both right extensor digitorum brevis and right tibialis anterior muscles with loss of the right Achilles reflex. The left ankle reflex was preserved, while both patellar reflexes were exaggerated. A neurophysiological study was consistent with anterior horn cell disease. Within 6 months, the left lower limb was affected with foot drop and loss of the Achilles reflex. Both plantar responses were flexor, diffuse fasciculation of lower limbs, trunk and both upper limbs were observed; the tongue showed atrophy and fasciculation. Electromyography showed diffuse fasciculation with motor unit potentials of high amplitude, increased duration with frequent giant potentials and reduced interference pattern. This was found in cervical, dorsal and lumbar segments and the diagnosis of familial ALS was made based on the earlier affected brother. The condition progressed rapidly and the patient became wheelchair-bound within 3 years of onset. There was no impairment of coordination, extrapyramidal and sphincter function, or sensory deficits. Baseline ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS - R) was 38, dropping to 23 after 2 years (normal range 0–48). Assessment of cognitive functions using the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) after 2 years of onset gave a score of 118 (normal range 0–136), with decreased scores for language, verbal fluency, and visuospatial orientation. A brain MRI was unremarkable. The patient died 3 years after the disease onset. Her total creatin kinase (CK) level was normal. No genetic testing for dystophinopathies was done. The second brother (IV-3), in his mid-20 s, had no symptom of ALS. A recent neurological examination was unremarkable except for some infrequent fasciculations in his arms that was considered as benign. The parents, in their mid-50 s, show no neurological manifestations.

Limb Weakness, Contractures, Muscle Bulk and Motor Development

In most cases, limb weakness was predominantly proximal and symmetrical, and affected both upper and lower limbs. Severity was typically mild to moderate (Medical Research Council [MRC] 3–4/5), but sometimes severe (MRC 2/5 or less). Generalized muscle wasting was common (75%). Calf hypertrophy was rare (Family 13 proband only). Acquired limb contractures were frequent (67%), affected both proximal and distal joints, and were often multiple (see Supplementary Table 2).

A total of 19 of 30 patients could, or had previously been able to walk. Three (11%) were younger than 5 years and might still walk. Nine patients could walk fast or run, and 4 could jump. Rate of ambulatory loss was often slow (defined as "still ambulant or predicted to be still ambulant after 20 years of age"; 9/19 patients), and 4 of 19 patients were still gaining rather than losing walking ability (see Supplementary Table 2). Only 1 patient had lost the ability to walk independently (without aids) once achieved (Family 2 proband; unable to walk from age 7 years). Another initially walked with calipers but became wheelchair dependent at age 4 years (Family 5 proband). Three were experiencing increasing walking difficulties due to progressive weakness, pain, contractures, foot deformities, and/or fatigue (Family 7, 8, and 15 probands).

Axial Features and Respiratory Insufficiency

Neck flexion weakness was present in all but 1 of the 21 patients for whom data were available. Neck extension weakness was also common (83%). Three patients had a striking "dropped head" phenotype (Sibling1/Family 1, Sibling 1/Family 26, and Family 2 proband). 27

Many patients (63%) had objective evidence of respiratory impairment, and 44% required nocturnal or full‐time ventilation. Scoliosis was present in 57% of patients and was typically early‐onset, rapidly progressive, and had required (or was likely to require) intervention. Chest wall deformities and scapular winging were present in 43% and 45% of patients respectively. Scoliosis, chest wall deformities, and respiratory insufficiency were often concurrent. Spinal rigidity, kyphosis, and lumbar hyperlordosis were sometimes present (6, 3, and 6 cases respectively).

### "Did I just do that? "-six-month-olds learn the contingency between their vocalizations and a visual reward in 5 minutes [^117HKV5j]. Infancy (2021). Medium credibility.

In all the studies described above, there were haptic, proprioceptive, and timing (simultaneity) cues for the existence of the contingency. The haptic cues involved the touch of the dummy in the mouth, the touch of the head on a pressure‐sensing pillow, the tug of the ribbon on the skin, the touch of the lever when banging on it, etc. But timing is crucial: The responses need to be time‐locked to the behaviors in order for the learning to occur (Skinner). In Millar's study, which required 6–8‐month‐old infants to perform a big arm movement, response delays of 1 or 2 s led to reduced learning of the contingency, and a delay of 3 s disrupted learning completely. 1 In the current study, we created a contingency whose initiation and frequency were infant‐dependent and that involved timing cues but no haptic cues, because the mechanism that provides the external event does not touch any part of the infant's body (unlike the dummy in the mouth, the ribbon on the foot, etc.). Like the Rovee‐Collier tasks, in which "the infants themselves are moving contingently with the mobile; the faster and harder they kick, the more vigorously the mobile will jiggle" (Thelen & Smith, p. 205), the task in the current study provided the child with analogous input to their own action in terms of timing, amplitude, and duration.

Recommendations

Diagnosis of New-Onset Infantile Spasms

The initial clinical visit for suspected infantile spasms may be performed by telemedicine or video conference. [Enduring]

In-person access to child neurology clinical expertise is uneven in the United States. Telemedicine allows clinicians to evaluate children from afar. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, growing experience suggested telemedicine was a feasible and effective way to expand access to neurology care for children. - For infantile spasms, clinical decision-making relies on the infant's medical and neurologic history and the characteristics of the events — these can be evaluated remotely.

Instruct parents to obtain and share video recordings of several consecutive typical events. Review the videos prior to or during the initial clinical encounter. [Enduring]

Given that 92% of US adults aged 30–49 years own a smartphone, it is reasonable to ask a parent or caregiver to obtain home video recording of the events. Individual epileptic spasms are typically flexor movements (though they can be extensor) of the arms, legs, and/or neck, usually lasting less than 2 seconds. The movement lasts longer than myoclonus, but briefer than a tonic seizure. Of key importance to the diagnosis of infantile spasms, the epileptic spasms usually occur at regular intervals (every 3–30 seconds)within clusters lasting several minutes. Parents and caregivers should be requested to capture at least 3 events, including the interval between events (intervals less than 3 seconds are essentially never epileptic spasms). The entire body and face should be within camera view along with adequate lighting. If possible, the recordings should include the infant in multiple positions (eg supine and seated) and multiple states (eg awake and asleep).

### Utilizing animal models of infantile spasms [^1158SUL6]. Epilepsy Currents (2018). Low credibility.

Infantile spasms are a devastating epileptic encephalopathy characterized by early life spasms and later seizures. Clinical outcomes of infantile spasms are poor and therapeutic options are limited with significant adverse effects. Therefore, new strategies to treat infantile spasms are of the utmost importance. Animals models of infantile spasms are a critical component of developing new therapies. Here, we review current chronic animal models of infantile spasms and consider future advances that may help improve patient care, as well as our scientific understanding of this debilitating disease.

A 39-year-old white woman with a history of adult-onset asthma, chronic sinusitis, and nasal polyposis presented to the ED with dyspnea and left lower extremity weakness and pain. Three months prior to her presentation she had an uncomplicated delivery of her second child, but during her pregnancy she experienced increasing asthma symptoms and nasal congestion. These symptoms progressed after delivery despite treatment with albuterol inhalers and antibiotics.

### Pharmacologic and dietary treatments for epilepsies in children aged 1–36 months: a systematic review [^114mJg8B]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Because direct evidence to support the development of a clinical practice guideline for early life epilepsy may be lacking, approaches for creating a guideline beyond expert opinion survey may include extrapolation of efficacy of data from older patients for certain seizure or epilepsy types. US Food and Drug Administration industry guidanceallows for extrapolation of efficacy data in partial (focal)–onset seizures down to the age of 1 month based on presumed mechanistic similarity across age groups, with regulatory approval for age extension requiring only safety and pharmacokinetic data. While extrapolation reduces regulatory burden, future guidelines should acknowledge the indirectness of efficacy evidence.

Evidence on the management of infantile spasms is more substantial, than the evidence for other early life seizure types or epilepsies and has been used to develop clinical practice guidelines–thus, our scoping process resulted in the exclusion of infantile spasms from this review.

Another substantial limitation of the literature highlighted by this review is the lack of reporting on treatment outcomes beyond seizure frequency, such as hospitalization, neurodevelopment, functional performance, or sleep quality. While these facets may have a greater effect than seizure frequency on quality of life in epilepsy, drug development has largely focused on antiseizure treatment, often narrowly defined as seizure frequency. In addition, for logistical and cost reasons, short-term outcome measurement predominates despite the greater importance of long-term outcomes.

As knowledge grows of the etiologically specific mechanisms of seizures and other manifestations of early life epilepsies, we expect future therapeutic research will focus on increasingly specific populations of patients with epilepsy. In future studies of ASM in patients with diverse etiologies and clinical syndromes, greater attention to reporting results by etiology and syndrome may address key questions about the applicability of outcome data to specific patient types in clinical practice. In addition, this report demonstrates the lack of attention to outcome measures beyond seizure frequency in existing studies of treatment effectiveness. Working now to develop appropriate outcome measures for neurodevelopmental trajectories, functional performance, and quality of life for patients with early life epilepsies will be critical to the incorporation of nonseizure outcomes into future treatment trials.

This review underscores the need for high-quality investigations of early life epilepsy treatment. Given the difficulty in enrolling infants in RCTs, one pragmatic step would be to initiate a prospective multicenter observational registry measuring critical long-term outcomes such as neurodevelopment, functional performance, and quality of life. If sufficiently large, a registry would permit analyses specific to different etiologies, which may help targeted treatment choices to individual patients.

There are four unresolved clinical issues at bedside with respect to the recognition, differential diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of infants who present with seizures. There is also an overriding fifth question which bridges these four clinical issues, based on a laboratory researcher's perspective at the "bench". Given the increasing understanding of the neurobiologic and pathophysiologic explanations for seizures in animal models, one must consider the question of whether neonatal seizures cause brain injury or are a surrogate of injury resulting from other etiologies.

### Reliability and predictive validity of the standardized infant neuroDevelopmental assessment neurological scale [^115NnS6a]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The neurological scale has five domains assessing spontaneous movements (eight items), cranial nerve function (seven items), motor reactions (five items), muscle tone (four items), and reflexes (four items; see Appendix S1, online supporting information). The assessment procedures, definition of the items, and criteria for typical and atypical performance have been described in the manual (hitherto unpublished).

Each item is scored as pass or fail according to simple and well‐defined criteria. For many items, consistent asymmetry results in the assignment of 'fail'. Seven of the eight items on spontaneous motility evaluate movement quality in terms of variation versus stereotypy, the eighth item addressing the quantity of motility. The classification of movement variation versus stereotypy is based on clinical observation, not on video assessment as in the assessment of general movements. 1 This implies that only striking stereotypies, including consistent asymmetries, are recorded as atypical, in line with clinical practices. 7, 10, 11, 12 The inclusion of seven items on movement quality also means that asymmetries, such as a head‐turn preference with an accompanying asymmetry in arm movements, and eventually in hand movements which occurs relatively frequently in 2‐month or 3‐month‐old infants, only results in a reduction of 2 or 3 points. The latter may be interpreted as a minor dysfunction. This contrasts with strikingly stereotyped movements in all parts of the body that will result in a 7‐point reduction of the score. The cranial nerve function domain includes items assessing facial and oral motor behaviour, eye movements, and reactions to light and sound. The motor reactions domain consists of items evaluating the infant's reaction to postural stimulation; examples are the pull‐to‐sit manoeuvre and vertical suspension. Muscle tone is evaluated separately in neck and trunk, arms, legs, and feet. The reflexes domain does not only contain tendon reflexes, but also the footsole response and footsole sensibility (i.e. the response of the infant's foot to gentle tickling). We decided to exclude responses such as the Moro response, the palmar and plantar grasp responses, and the parachute reaction from the examination as they are clearly age‐dependent. The latter interfered with our aim to develop an assessment that was largely independent of the infant's age in the first postterm year.

### Fever-induced dystonia [^1173zmuy]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The etiology of dystonia in children is often elusive. We report two children with fever-induced dystonia, an association which has not been previously reported. Both children had episodes of lower extremity dystonia with inversion of the feet and dorsiflexion of the great toes. Events began at 2 years of age, were preceded by febrile illness, and lasted for up to 24 hours. In both children, one of the parents had a history of similar but milder symptoms in childhood. Between spells the children were neurologically normal. Multiple investigations, including metabolic and imaging studies, were normal and therapies were ineffective. As the children aged the dystonic events occurred less frequently. This dystonic syndrome is a previously unrecognized benign episodic movement disorder of childhood.

Methods

Study Design, Setting, and Participants

Infants and young children 21 days- < 18 months of age who were hospitalized at the Lao Friends Hospital for Children in Luang Prabang, northern Lao People's Democratic Republic with signs and symptoms consistent with TDD were enrolled into a prospective cohort study between June 2019 and December 2020 (registered atas). The study protocol has previously been described in detail. Hospitalized children were eligible if they presented with at least 1 of the following signs and symptoms consistent with TDD: hepatomegaly (liver edge > 2 cm below the right costal margin), edema, tachypnea (respiratory rate > 60/min for infants 3–8 weeks old; > 50/min for infants 2–11 months old; > 40/min for children 12–18 months old), tachycardia (heart rate > 160/min for under 12 month olds; > 120/min for children 12–18 months old), oxygen saturation < 92%, respiratory distress (chest indrawing or nasal flaring), refusal to breastfeed or consume infant formula or food for > 24 hours, repetitive or recurrent vomiting with no other apparent cause (> 3 times in past 24 hours), persistent crying not relieved by soothing or feeding with no obvious other cause, hoarse voice/cry or loss of voice, nystagmus or other unusual eye movements, muscle twitching, loss of consciousness, convulsion, opisthotonos/abnormal posturing, and acute/flaccid paralysis.

### Neonatal seizures-part 1: not everything that jerks, stiffens and shakes is a fit [^113A6mnQ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

The neonatal period is the most frequent time of life to have epileptic seizures. However, neonates can also exhibit unusual movements that are not epileptic seizures. Differentiating between epileptic and non-epileptic movements can be difficult. Many neonatal seizures exhibit few or no clinical features at all. This article is for the benefit of paediatric trainees and reviews the published evidence on which neonatal movements are likely to be epileptic seizures and which are not. We also discuss epileptic seizure classification.

### Baclofen [^113dn64f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

a. Neonatal Withdrawal Symptoms: Withdrawal symptoms have been reported starting hours to days after delivery in neonates whose mothers were treated with oral baclofen throughout pregnancy. The symptoms of withdrawal in these infants have included increased muscle tone, tremor, jitteriness, and seizure. If the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus and oral baclofen is continued during pregnancy, gradually reduce the dose and discontinue baclofen before delivery. If slow withdrawal is not feasible, advise the parents or caregivers of the potential for neonatal withdrawal.

b. Abrupt Drug Withdrawal: Hallucinations and seizures have occurred on abrupt withdrawal of baclofen. Therefore, except for serious adverse reactions, the dose should be reduced slowly when the drug is discontinued.

c. Impaired Renal Function: Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.

d. Stroke: Baclofen has not significantly benefited patients with stroke. These patients have also shown poor tolerability to the drug.

e. Pregnancy: Baclofen has been shown to increase the incidence of omphaloceles (ventral hernias) in fetuses of rats given approximately 13 times the maximum dose recommended for human use, at a dose which caused significant reductions in food intake and weight gain in dams. This abnormality was not seen in mice or rabbits.

There was also an increased incidence of incomplete sternebral ossification in fetuses of rats given approximately 13 times the maximum recommended human dose, and an increased incidence of unossified phalangeal nuclei of forelimbs and hindlimbs in fetuses of rabbits given approximately 7 times the maximum recommended human dose. In mice, no teratogenic effects were observed, although reductions in mean fetal weight with consequent delays in skeletal ossification were present when dams were given 17 and 34 times the human daily dose. There are no studies in pregnant women. Baclofen should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

### Neonatal seizure management: is the timing of treatment critical? [^1119xAwD]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

We evaluated the different etiologies in our cohort, therapeutic hypothermia status, age at initiation of EEG monitoring, and age at first electrographic seizure as possible confounders for this analysis but noted no significant differences among the treatment groups. Our results are supported by previous animal and human work demonstrating that the sooner the treatment, the better the response.

For our analysis of treatment timing, we had a large multicenter European neonatal cohort from eight tertiary neonatal intensive care units available, and thus we also described the overall seizure management in this cohort. Out of 472 newborns, 258 (54.7%) received at least 1 dose of antiseizure medication during the study period. Seventy-eight infants received antiseizure medication before EEG monitoring was started for suspected clinical seizures, among whom 58 infants had no evidence of further electrographic seizures. We can only assume that in these infants, the seizures responded to the initial antiseizure medication treatment, or that what was diagnosed as a clinical seizure was likely part of a neonatal movement disorder rather than a true seizure, as demonstrated previously by our group.

### Electrocortical functional connectivity in infancy: response to body tilt [^111viK35]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that infant cortical regions activated by a head-up tilt also exhibit increased functional electrocortical connectivity, prone sleeping newborn and 2- to 4-month-old infants were tilted head-up to 30 degrees. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected with 128 electrodes and coherence calculated to quantify electrocortical synchrony. Local coherence, defined as the average of coherence measurements between the EEG at each electrode site and neighboring sites (approximately 1 cm electrode spacing), was found in activated cortical regions that had previously shown increased high-frequency power with tilt. Long-distance coherence was computed between the regions. Newborn infants had significant increases in local coherence in the activated left frontal, right frontal-temporal, and occipital cortical regions; long-distance coherence increased between the right frontal-temporal and occipital regions. In contrast, infants at 2 to 4 months old, the age of maximum risk for sudden infant death syndrome, had no significant changes in coherence. Newborn and 2- to 4-month-old infants thus have different electrocortical responses to a classic cardiovascular challenge.

Clinical Features

Common and significant clinical features, and the prevalence of each feature, are summarized in Table 1, with more detailed clinical information provided in Supplementary Table 2. Selected features are illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2
Examples of common and clinically significant features. Lower limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also shown. (A) Female Family 25 proband. The pregnancy for this infant was complicated by reduced fetal movements and prenatal ultrasound detection of limb contractures. The image shows typical "frog leg" positioning due to marked congenital hypotonia and weakness. Note also the nasogastric feeding tube and reduced palmar creases (inset). This infant also had mild pulmonary stenosis and needed intubation and ventilation for a short period following delivery. (B, C) The older of the 2 affected brothers (Sibling 1) from Family 1 at age 34 years. Both brothers had congenital scoliosis, which progressed during childhood. Spinal surgery was not possible in the pictured brother due to concurrent development of severe respiratory insufficiency. His respiratory deficit was diagnosed at age 13 years following an out of hospital respiratory arrest, and he has since relied on nocturnal ventilation via a tracheostomy tube. This patient has slowly progressive mild to moderate limb weakness but remains ambulant despite significant axial involvement. He also has left ventricular cardiac dysfunction. In addition, these images demonstrate bilateral non‐congenital elbow contractures and marked generalized muscle hypotrophy. (D) Family 24 female proband who was born following a pregnancy complicated by reduced fetal movements and breech presentation. She was significantly hypotonic at birth and had congenital bilateral wrist contractures and fixed foot deformities. (E, F) Ptosis and facial weakness in the younger sibling (Sibling 2) from Family 26 during early childhood (E) and at age 12 years (F). (G, H) The same child as shown in (A) at age 2 years with a pectus excavatum chest wall deformity (G) and scapular winging (H). (I) Distal joint hypermobility in Sibling 1 from Family 1. (J, K) Reduced range of neck movement in Sibling 1 from Family 26. (L–N) Lower limb MRI result for Sibling 1 from Family 26 at age 15 years. This shows fatty infiltration of the gluteal muscles (L), severe fatty replacement of both visible hamstring muscles (complete fatty replacement of semitendinosus and incomplete but marked replacement of biceps femoris; M), relative sparing of the adductor compartment, and mild involvement of the calf and peroneal muscles (N). (O–Q) Lower limb MRI result for the Family 31 proband at age 29 years. This is one of the 4 segregation‐inconclusive cases described in this paper, but not included within the clinical analysis cohort. The features in this individual's lower limb MRI may represent the more severe end of the spectrum of muscle involvement associated with this disorder. The images show severe fatty replacement of the quadriceps and hamstrings, sparing of the adductors (also seen in the first MRI case), and severe replacement of both calves and the right peroneus, with mild fatty marbling in the anterior and lateral compartment on the left. Consent was obtained from patients/parents/legal guardians for use of the clinical photographs shown in this figure, including the non‐obscured facial photographs shown in D–F.

14.2 Infantile Spasms

The effectiveness of SABRIL as monotherapy was established for infantile spasms in two multicenter controlled studies. Both studies were similar in terms of disease characteristics and prior treatments of patients and all enrolled infants had a confirmed diagnosis of infantile spasms.

Study 1

Study 1 (N = 221) was a multicenter, randomized, low-dose high-dose, parallel-group, partially-blind (caregivers knew the actual dose but not whether their child was classified as low or high dose; EEG reader was blinded but investigators were not blinded) study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vigabatrin in patients < 2 years of age with new-onset infantile spasms. Patients with both symptomatic and cryptogenic etiologies were studied. The study was comprised of two phases. The first phase was a 14 to 21 day partially-blind phase in which patients were randomized to receive either low-dose (18–36 mg/kg/day) or high-dose (100–148 mg/kg/day) vigabatrin. Study drug was titrated over 7 days, followed by a constant dose for 7 days. If the patient became spasm-free on or before day 14, another 7 days of constant dose was administered. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients who were spasm-free for 7 consecutive days beginning within the first 14 days of vigabatrin therapy. Patients considered spasm-free were defined as those patients who remained free of spasms (evaluated according to caregiver response to direct questioning regarding spasm frequency) and who had no indication of spasms or hypsarrhythmia during 8 hours of CCTV EEG recording (including at least one sleep-wake-sleep cycle) performed within 3 days of the seventh day of spasm freedom and interpreted by a blinded EEG reader. Seventeen patients in the high-dose group achieved spasm freedom compared with 8 patients in the low dose group. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0375). Primary efficacy results are shown in Table 10.

### Under the skin: exploring 2-month-olds' thermal reactions in different social interactions with mother and stranger [^116gaMBt]. Infancy (2021). Medium credibility.

Physiological adaptations to external stressors can reveal socio-cognitive health in infancy. With the use of thermal imaging and behavioural analyses, the current study examined the arousal markers accompanying infants' interactions with a familiar and an unfamiliar person. To address the current research question, the mother and a complete stranger interacted with 2 to 3 month-old infants (N = 10, 2 boys)in three different conditions: Neutral, Play, and Compliment. Behavioral analyses showed that overall gaze was longer to the Stranger compared to the Mother independent of condition. Physiological findings showed that skin temperature was significantly higher with the stranger independent of condition. The regions of the face that passed the significance threshold included the maxillary area, the nose, and the forehead. Both behavioral and physiological findings emphasize the ability of the infant to distinguish between a familiar and an unfamiliar person. Most importantly, however thermal imaging has proven to be a promising tool in physiologically differentiating between variable social conditions in very young infants opening up a new experimental portal for identifying healthy physiological development.

The onset was preceded by a sore throat 4 weeks prior, but no recent immunizations and no sick contacts. He began having problems "catching his toes" for 2 weeks. He had no visual complaints and no bowel or bladder incontinence. He had no recent travel and there were no heavy metal or solvent exposures. He had no prior medical history and he was on no prescription medications. Developmentally, he was on track and had just successfully completed fifth grade. However, he was reported to be behaviorally oppositional, especially regarding his diet which was restricted to beef jerky, yogurt from a squeeze tube, and fruit drinks. Family history included diabetic peripheral neuropathy in his mother, idiopathic peripheral neuropathy in his maternal grandfather, and left lower extremity neuropathy from trauma in his father. There was no known family history of recurrent pressure palsies or cardiac problems.

### The newborn foot… [^114jtDCp]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The examination of the feet is an essential component of a comprehensive evaluation of a newborn. With proper skills, this examination, which often is reassuring to new parents, can be performed quickly, yet thoroughly. Early detection of foot problems in infants allows timely corrective treatment, if required. Simultaneous observation of both feet can reveal many deformities. The skin should be examined for unusual creases or folds that can be formed by various foot deviations. Certain areas of the skin might be abnormally taut, indicating extra tension on the skin, while the skin on the opposite side of the foot might reveal loose, excessive skinfolds. Treatment is based on the severity of the condition and is controversial. While some authors 1 advocate only observation without active intervention for mild cases, others would intervene early in all severe cases or by two months of age, if the condition is not resolved.

4 Other authors 3 recommend treatment as soon as possible, especially in moderate to severe cases. Based on the natural course of the condition, a more conservative approach seems reasonable. Mild MTA requires only parental reassurance. Moderate MTA can be treated with stretching exercises at every diaper change. First, the heel is stabilized within the notch between the thumb and index finger. Then, the forefoot is slightly pulled distally, held between the thumb and index finger of the other hand, and gently pushed into a corrected position. 3 It occurs in about 5 percent of all newborns 5 and is associated with external rotation of the calcaneus, an overstretched Achilles tendon, and tight anterior leg musculature, all of which warrant treatment. 11 On inspection, the foot has an "up and out" appearance, with the dorsal forefoot practically touching the anterior aspect of the ankle and lower leg.

Treatment should begin as early as possible. Mild cases can be treated with stretching exercises performed at each diaper change. Stretching consists of gentle plantarflexion of the foot with mild inversion for a count of 10, repeated three times. In moderate cases or when stretching fails to correct the deformity, splinting or firm, high-top, lace-up shoes that prevent dorsiflexion can be used. Conservative therapy can assist in stretching the forefoot and hindfoot, but surgery is needed in most cases. Surgery is complex, requiring correction in all three cardinal planes, and should be performed by a specialist in pediatric foot deformities.

The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the average percent change in daily spasm frequency, assessed during a pre-defined and consistent 2-hour window of evaluation, comparing baseline to the final 2 days of the 5-day double-blind treatment phase. No statistically significant differences were observed in the average frequency of spasms using the 2-hour evaluation window. However, a post-hoc alternative efficacy analysis, using a 24-hour clinical evaluation window found a statistically significant difference in the overall percentage of reductions in spasms between the vigabatrin group (68.9%) and the placebo group (17.0%) (p = 0.030).

Duration of therapy for infantile spasms was evaluated in a post hoc analysis of a Canadian Pediatric Epilepsy Network (CPEN) study of developmental outcomes in infantile spasms patients. The 38/68 infants in the study who had responded to vigabatrin therapy (complete cessation of spasms and hypsarrhythmia) continued vigabatrin therapy for a total duration of 6 months therapy. The 38 infants who responded were then followed for an additional 18 months after discontinuation of vigabatrin to determine their clinical outcome. A post hoc analysis indicated no observed recurrence of infantile spasms in any of these 38 infants.

### Diagnosis of fraser syndrome missed out until the age of six months old in a low-resource setting: a case report [^112ZhE3B]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A six-month-old female infant living in urban Yaoundé, Cameroon presented to our emergency department with a fever, difficulties in breathing and refusal to feed, all of progressive onset. These symptoms lasted 48 h before consultation, and no medication was given to the infant before her presentation. Her past history was relevant for several points. Firstly, her mother did not attend any antenatal care visit during pregnancy. However, her mother reported she had vaginal delivery at home at nine months of pregnancy without professional care. The infant had a vigorous cry at birth. The mother of the child sought neonatal and postpartum care at day one postpartum in a nearby health center where the neanate's diagnosis was surprisingly overlooked. She was the first child born to a 29-year-old HIV woman, with histories of psychiatric disorders and bilateral club foot. We could not have more information on the father of the infant because he abandoned her mother during her pregnancy. However, there was no consanguinity between both parents. There was no contact history of passive smoking and/or acute, sub-acute or chronic cough and her psychomotor development were adequate for her age. There was no family history of similar congenital malformations.

### Transient dystonic toe-walking: differentiation from cerebral palsy and a rare explanation for some unexplained cases of idiopathic toe-walking [^111mHzgs]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

We report on seven children (five males, two females) who presented with marked, often asymmetrical, toe-walking from onset of independent walking, associated with abnormal foot postures and increased tone at the ankles with characteristics of dystonia. Most of the children had presented with unusual pre-walking locomotion and a mild delay in independent walking. They did not fit into the usual categories of 'habitual' toe-walking or congenital short tendo calcaneus but nor did they have the clinical signs of spastic diplegia or of a peripheral neuromuscular disease. Normalization occurred progressively in the second to fourth years of life. The children were re-examined several years later (1 to 11y) and were normal. We believe that their persistent toe-walking corresponded to a variant of 'transient focal dystonia of infancy'. Knowledge of its existence may justify a period of observation without special investigations, surgery, or casting.

### Genetic vulnerability of exposures to antenatal maternal treatments in 1-to 2-month-old infants [^1122GQxY]. Infancy (2021). Medium credibility.

It is unknown whether subtle sensorimotor deficits during rest or sleep are associated with in utero exposure to medications in infants at high versus low genetic (familial) risk for developing autism spectrum disorders (ASD). One possibility is that regardless of whether or not an utero exposure was experienced, 1- to 2-month-old infants at a higher genetic risk (HR) for autism, who have an older biological sibling diagnosed with an ASD, would show the worst sensorimotor patterns relative to infants at low risk (LR). This "genetic primacy" prediction would be consistent with previous work showing that 1- to 2-month-old HR infants have the most atypically noisy head movements during sleep fMRI scans, and future ASD diagnoses at 3 years are predicted by atypically inflexible movements to different experimental conditions in 9- to 10-month-olds. However, another possibility is that genetic and environmental liabilities may interact to produce the most atypical sensorimotor outcomes. Would in utero exposure to different classes of drugs dissociate between movements of exposed versus non-exposed infants who are at a genetically higher (vs. lower) risk for developing ASD? Specifically, one prediction is that infants at HR for ASD with in utero psychotropic medications exposures would show "worse" motor features versus those of all other infants. The goal is to investigate whether several important maternal health variables before birth (in utero exposure to prescription medication, infection and fever during pregnancy, and maternal psychiatric diagnoses) map onto relevant neurobiological features of the infant immediately after birth: specifically, sensorimotor features of head movements during sleep rs-fMRI in 1- to 2-month-old infants at high or low risk for autism.

### A neonatal diagnosis of congenital chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^113TjziS]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

We report a female infant noticed by her mother to have reduced movements of her right wrist and left foot at birth. This female presented to the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London, UK, aged 6 weeks, with significant weakness of her right wrist and left foot. Her clinical history also revealed sudden diminution in fetal movements 2 weeks before delivery, consistent with neuropathology in utero and neuromuscular deficit in the immediate postnatal period. An initial examination revealed generalized hypotonia, areflexia, and paucity of movements. Electrophysiological studies suggested demyelinating polyneuropathy; sural nerve biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). With the results and the pre- and postnatal clinical history, we believe this to be the first reported individual with congenital CIDP confirmed in the neonatal period. We describe the treatment and outcome up to the age of six years.

### A 10-month-old with intermittent hypotonia and paralysis [^115z8hfU]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

A 10-month-old boy presented with a 1-day history of flaccid quadriplegia and dysconjugate gaze. His history was remarkable for stereotyped episodes of flaccid quadriplegia or hemiplegia, oculomotor abnormalities, and limb or neck posturing, beginning in the first days of life and becoming more frequent and more prolonged over time. The patient was healthy and developmentally normal between episodes. Results of extensive laboratory evaluations, including EEG and brain imaging studies, were negative. The patient's history, diagnostic evaluation, and final diagnosis are reviewed. This case illustrates the importance of a fundamental understanding of neurologic localization in pediatric care and a focused diagnostic approach to an infant with paroxysmal neurologic signs.

### Neural mechanism and clinical significance of the plantar grasp reflex in infants [^111Tmjpx]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The plantar grasp reflex can be elicited in all normal infants from 25 weeks of postconceptional age until the end of 6 months of corrected age according to the expected birth date. This reflex in human infants can be regarded as a rudiment of responses that were once essential for ape infants in arboreal life. The spinal center for this reflex is probably located at the L(5)-S(2) levels, which, however, are controlled by higher brain structures. Nonprimary motor areas may exert regulatory control of the spinal reflex mechanism through interneurons. In infants, this reflex can be elicited as the result of insufficient control of the spinal mechanism by the immature brain. In adults, lesions in nonprimary motor areas may cause a release of inhibitory control by spinal interneurons, leading to a reappearance of the reflex. The plantar grasp reflex in infants is of high clinical significance. A negative or diminished reflex during early infancy is often a sensitive indicator of spasticity. Infants with athetoid type cerebral palsy exhibit an extremely strong retention of the reflex, and infants with mental retardation also exhibit a tendency toward prolonged retention of the reflex.

14.2 Infantile Spasms

The effectiveness of vigabatrin as monotherapy was established for infantile spasms in two multicenter controlled studies. Both studies were similar in terms of disease characteristics and prior treatments of patients and all enrolled infants had a confirmed diagnosis of infantile spasms.

Study 1

Study 1 (N = 221) was a multicenter, randomized, low-dose high-dose, parallel-group, partially-blind (caregivers knew the actual dose but not whether their child was classified as low or high dose; EEG reader was blinded but investigators were not blinded) study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vigabatrin in patients < 2 years of age with new-onset infantile spasms. Patients with both symptomatic and cryptogenic etiologies were studied. The study was comprised of two phases. The first phase was a 14 to 21 day partially-blind phase in which patients were randomized to receive either low-dose (18 to 36 mg/kg/day) or high-dose (100 to 148 mg/kg/day) vigabatrin. Study drug was titrated over 7 days, followed by a constant dose for 7 days. If the patient became spasm-free on or before day 14, another 7 days of constant dose was administered. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients who were spasm-free for 7 consecutive days beginning within the first 14 days of vigabatrin therapy. Patients considered spasm-free were defined as those patients who remained free of spasms (evaluated according to caregiver response to direct questioning regarding spasm frequency) and who had no indication of spasms or hypsarrhythmia during 8 hours of CCTV EEG recording (including at least one sleep-wake-sleep cycle) performed within 3 days of the seventh day of spasm freedom and interpreted by a blinded EEG reader. Seventeen patients in the high-dose group achieved spasm freedom compared with 8 patients in the low dose group. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0375). Primary efficacy results are shown in Table 10.

### Hypoparathyroidism and late-onset hypogonadism in an adult male with familial 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: a case report with 3-year follow-up and review of the literature [^114e1oTE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Phenotypes of 22q11.2DS have extensive heterogeneity and variability. It usually comes in the form of the triad of DiGeorge syndrome, which includes immunodeficiency, congenital heart defects, and hypocalcemia caused by hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disease characterized by hypocalcemia. Hypoparathyroidism caused by DiGeorge syndrome accounts for 60% of hypoparathyroidism in children. Hypocalcemia in patients with 22q11.2DS can occur at any age, usually in the neonatal period, and rarely in adults. Because of the 22q11.2DS phenotypic variability, mild symptoms may be missed clinically. In the review of 28 cases, we found that more than half of the patients presented with symptomatic hypocalcemia, which manifested as limb twitching, seizures, and sudden loss of consciousness. They were also seen in different departments as a result, including neurology, psychiatry, and endocrinology, and most of them received calcium supplementation and were eventually diagnosed with 22q11.2DS. Giving 10% calcium gluconate and calcium supplementation, vitamin D supplementation, and vitamin analogues are all important ways to treat hypocalcemia or hypoparathyroidism.

3.3 Maternal behavior and infant limbic volumes

With infant age and sex controlled, infant right hippocampal volume was negatively associated with maternal withdrawal, but only at older ages (Table 2). The region of significance for the withdrawal by age interaction effect is shown in Figure 3, indicating that right hippocampal volume was reduced in relation to increased maternal withdrawal after 492.98 days or 16.16 months of age. There were no other effects of either aspect of maternal behavior on amygdala or hippocampal volume nor were there interactions with age (Table 2).

### Acquired neuromyotonia heralding recurrent thymoma… [^111uu32y]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Observations A report of a single case of a 53-year-old man with myasthenia gravis and a prior thymectomy presenting with 2 months of diffuse, involuntary muscle twitching in the absence of myasthenic symptoms, electrophysiologically confirmed to be neuromyotonia. Further evaluation revealed the recurrence of malignant thymoma, accompanied by refractory arrhythmia. Serologic and cerebrospinal fluid testing confirmed the presence of antibodies directed against 2 voltage-gated potassium channel–associated proteins: LGI1 and Caspr2. Acquired neuromyotonia, Isaacs syndrome, is a form of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability that was first described by Hyam Isaacs in the 1960s. 1, 2 Patients develop fasciculations, cramps, and stiffness on the basis of abnormal spontaneous electrical activity originating from motor nerve axons. A 53-year-old man with MG who previously underwent a thymectomy presented with 2 months of muscle twitching and weight loss.

He initially received a diagnosis of MG 6 years previously, when presenting with fatigable ptosis and diplopia. The diagnosis was confirmed by an electromyogram and positive striational antibody test results. Three months after his clinical presentation, he was found to have a stage II malignant thymoma and underwent resection followed by radiation therapy. His MG had been well controlled with mycophenolate mofetil and pyridostigmine bromide for many years. Two months prior to hospital admission, he experienced the unintentional weight loss of 9 kg, low back and bilateral hip pain, and dysesthesias in his hands and feet. He subsequently developed diffuse arthralgia and muscle twitching beginning in his legs and spreading to his arms within 1 week. The twitches were not large enough to move his limbs, but they were bothersome and not suppressible.

The results of serial testing for troponins were negative, and his abnormal test results were attributed to tachycardia-induced demand ischemia. The results of an exercise stress test and an echocardiogram were unrevealing. Computed tomography of his chest revealed a large, pleural-based mass of soft tissue. The cardiology team noted diffuse muscle twitching in the patient's limbs and consulted neurology.

### Interacting socially with human hands at 24 months of age [^115cfizP]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

This experiment explored whether or not 2-year-olds would engage in synchronic imitation with human hands. Sixty-four 24-month-old infants participated. In a test of synchronic imitation, infants were given a toy while a model simultaneously performed novel actions on an identical toy. Infants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 model conditions: a familiar person, an unfamiliar person, disembodied human hands, and disembodied robotic pincers. Infants were as likely to synchronically imitate disembodied hands as a person. Imitation of the pincers was significantly lower. This pattern suggests that 2-year-olds will engage socially with human hands in the absence of the rest of the body.

### Rocuronium [^111XbQ21]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For sevoflurane (induction) rocuronium bromide doses of 0.45 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg in general produce excellent to good intubating conditions within 75 seconds. When halothane is used, a 0.6 mg/kg dose of rocuronium bromide resulted in excellent to good intubating conditions within 60 seconds.

The time to maximum block for an intubating dose was shortest in infants (28 days up to 3 months) and longest in neonates (birth to less than 28 days). The duration of clinical relaxation following an intubating dose is shortest in children (greater than 2 years up to 11 years) and longest in infants.

When sevoflurane is used for induction and isoflurane/nitrous oxide for maintenance of general anesthesia, maintenance dosing of rocuronium bromide can be administered as bolus doses of 0.15 mg/kg at reappearance of T3in all pediatric age groups. Maintenance dosing can also be administered at the reappearance of T2at a rate of 7 to 10 mcg/kg/min, with the lowest dose requirement for neonates (birth to less than 28 days) and the highest dose requirement for children (greater than 2 years up to 11 years).

When halothane is used for general anesthesia, patients ranging from 3 months old through adolescence can be administered rocuronium bromide maintenance doses of 0.075 to 0.125 mg/kg upon return of T1to 0.25% to provide clinical relaxation for 7 to 10 minutes. Alternatively, a continuous infusion of rocuronium bromide initiated at a rate of 12 mcg/kg/min upon return of T1to 10% (one twitch present in train-of-four) may also be used to maintain neuromuscular blockade in pediatric patients.

### Hypovitaminosis D and severe hypocalcaemia: the rebirth of an old disease [^116Hx6Q5]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency, once thought to be eradicated, is becoming a frequent occurence in children, caused mainly by dietary insufficiency. The classical manifestation is rickets, but in infants severe hypocalcaemia may present as stridor, tetany, seizures or, rarely, heart disease. Here, we describe four infants who presented with complications of severe hypocalcaemia secondary to nutritional vitamin D deficiency. (1) Female, 4 months old, several spasms. (2) Male, 8 days old, generalised tonic-clonic seizure. (3) Male, 9 months old, tetany. (4) Male, 4 months old, cardiogenic shock. The cases highlight the importance of child vitamin D supplementation from birth and throughout childhood. We also note that the vitamin D state should be evaluated by the 25(OH)-D value and not the 1,25(OH)2-D.

### Sporadic major hyperekplexia in neonates and infants: clinical manifestations and outcome [^116g6AD3]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study is to report on the syndrome of sporadic major hyperekplexia during the neonatal period and early infancy, diagnosed in 39 patients at an average age of 3.3 months, the most severely affected during the first month of life. The patients mainly presented with marked irritability and recurrent startles in response to handling or even minute sounds, accompanied by rhythmic jerky movements and occasionally breath-holding episodes. Family history was negative for hyperekplexia, although eight parents reported jerky leg movements during sleep. The hallmark of hyperekplexia consisted of a hyper-alert gaze and an exaggerated startle with delayed habituation, also elicited by nose tapping and air blowing on the face accompanied by increasing rigidity. Nine severely affected infants, presenting with relentless startles, marked stiffness, violent rhythmic jerks, and breath-holding episodes were treated with oral low doses of clonazepam and completely recovered. Overall, the debilitating symptoms of hyperekplexia gradually resolved in all 39 infants, and their developmental assessment by 2 years of age was within the normal range. Therefore a prompt diagnosis of hyperekplexia during the neonatal period and early infancy, and then treatment if required with benzodiazepines to alleviate the debilitating symptoms, may prevent life-threatening events and enable better feeding and handling. Establishing the diagnosis of such a relatively benign disorder with a favorable developmental outcome may avoid unjustified extensive investigations or unnecessary treatment, suspecting an ominous progressive neurologic disorder.

### Repository corticotropin (Acthar) [^1125r5Pw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Acthar Gel is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms in infants and children less than 2 years of age. Both serious and other adverse reactions can occur in this population [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The efficacy of Acthar Gel for the treatment of infantile spasms in infants and children less than 2 years of age was evaluated in a randomized, single blinded (video EEG interpreter blinded) clinical trial and an additional active control supportive trial [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A responding patient was defined as having both complete cessation of spasms and elimination of hypsarrhythmia.

Safety in the pediatric population for infantile spasms was evaluated by retrospective chart reviews and data from non-sponsor conducted clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. While the types of adverse reactions seen in infants and children under 2 years of age treated for infantile spasms are similar to those seen in older patients, their frequency and severity may be different due to the very young age of the infant, the underlying disorder, the duration of therapy and the dosage regimen. Effects on growth are of particular concern [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. Serious adverse reactions observed in adults may also occur in children [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

### Adult-onset primary lower limb dystonia [^1124waWB]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

The lower extremity is affected infrequently in adult-onset primary dystonia in contrast to childhood-onset dystonia, which typically begins in the foot. When dystonia affects the foot in an adult, it is usually on a secondary basis. We present findings on 17 patients (11 women, 6 men; average age of onset 48.4 years; average time to diagnosis 2.7 years) with adult-onset primary foot dystonia. Prior to diagnosis, most patients underwent extensive testing and treatment, including unnecessary surgeries. Only the left lower extremity was involved in 8 patients, only the right in 7, and both in 2. The most common patterns were plantar flexion of all toes and inversion of the foot, typically activated with standing or walking. Only 2 patients had dystonia elsewhere. There was a family history of possible dystonia in 2 patients. One of five tested for DYT1 was positive, in the absence of a family history. One of eight patients treated with levodopa experienced mild improvement. Six of eight treated with botulinum toxin improved. No patient has been observed to have a secondary cause of dystonia. The prognosis, with regard to progression or spread to other body parts, has been favorable. Although uncommon, foot dystonia on a primary basis, not due to DYT1, can begin in adulthood. In this series of patients, the diagnosis was often not recognized, leading to extensive and unnecessary testing and treatment and emphasizing the need for wider recognition.

A 4-week-old female infant presented to the emergency department (ED) due to a 1-week history of not moving her left lower extremity as well as crying during diaper changes. She had been seen 6 days prior at an ED, had normal x-rays, and was discharged home. The infant was afebrile and well appearing and had been feeding well all week. Laboratory tests in our department, including a complete blood count with differential and inflammatory markers, were all normal. Repeat x-rays showed a subtle distal tibial lucency, initially overlooked. The infant was admitted to the hospital and received a magnetic resonance imaging, which demonstrated distal tibial osteomyelitis with an accompanying ankle effusion. Cultures from the bone grew group B Streptococcus, and the infant received 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy.

### About tourette syndrome… [^114Hg2Wg]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Tourette syndrome is a condition of the nervous system that causes people to make sudden and repeated twitches, movements, or sounds, called "tics".
- Health professionals look at the person's symptoms to diagnosis TS and other tic disorders.
- Although there is no cure for TS, treatment can help manage the tics. What it is Tourette syndrome is a condition of the nervous system. TS causes people to have "tics". Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that people do repeatedly. People who have tics cannot stop their body from doing these things. For example, a person might keep blinking over and over. Or a person might make a grunting sound unwillingly. Types There are two types of tics — motor and vocal. Motor tics are movements of the body. Examples of motor tics include blinking, shrugging the shoulders, or jerking an arm. Vocal tics are sounds that a person makes with his or her voice.

Examples of vocal tics include humming, clearing the throat, or yelling out a word or phrase. Symptoms The main symptoms of TS are tics. A person can have tics ranging from simple, temporary tics lasting a few weeks or months, to having many complex tics that are long-lasting. Symptoms of TS usually begin when a child is 5 to 10 years of age. The first symptoms often are motor tics that occur in the head and neck area. Diagnosis There is no single test, like a blood test, to diagnose TS. Health professionals look at the person's symptoms to diagnose TS and other tic disorders. The tic disorders differ from each other in terms of the type of tic present, and how long the symptoms have lasted. TS can be diagnosed if a person has both motor and vocal tics, and has had tic symptoms for at least a year.

Treatment and recovery Many people with TS have tics that do not get in the way of their daily life and, therefore, do not need any treatment. However, medication and behavioral treatments are available if tics cause pain or injury; interfere with school, work, or social life; or cause stress. Keep ReadingTreatment of Tourette Syndrome.

### Vigabatrin (VIgADRONE) [^116bkuaF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Infantile Spasms

The effectiveness of vigabatrin as monotherapy was established for infantile spasms in two multicenter controlled studies. Both studies were similar in terms of disease characteristics and prior treatments of patients and all enrolled infants had a confirmed diagnosis of infantile spasms.

Study 1

Study 1 (N = 221) was a multicenter, randomized, low-dose high-dose, parallel-group, partially-blind (caregivers knew the actual dose but not whether their child was classified as low or high dose; EEG reader was blinded but investigators were not blinded) study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vigabatrin in patients ˂2 years of age with new-onset infantile spasms. Patients with both symptomatic and cryptogenic etiologies were studied. The study was comprised of two phases. The first phase was a 14 to 21 day partially-blind phase in which patients were randomized to receive either low-dose (18 to 36 mg/kg/day) or high-dose (100 to 148 mg/kg/day) vigabatrin. Study drug was titrated over 7 days, followed by a constant dose for 7 days. If the patient became spasm-free on or before day 14, another 7 days of constant dose was administered. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients who were spasm-free for 7 consecutive days beginning within the first 14 days of vigabatrin therapy. Patients considered spasm-free were defined as those patients who remained free of spasms (evaluated according to caregiver response to direct questioning regarding spasm frequency) and who had no indication of spasms or hypsarrhythmia during 8 hours of CCTV EEG recording (including at least one sleep-wake-sleep cycle) performed within 3 days of the seventh day of spasm freedom and interpreted by a blinded EEG reader. Seventeen patients in the high-dose group achieved spasm freedom compared with 8 patients in the low dose group. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0375). Primary efficacy results are shown in Table 10.

### Hypotonia in the newborn infant [^117WmP65]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal hypotonia, defined as hypotonia present from birth to 4 w of age, has a plethora of causes. Distinguishing between central and peripheral causes is the key to arriving at a timely diagnosis. A thorough history, general and neurologic examination, and systematic utilization of laboratory and ancillary studies allow for rapid diagnosis in most cases. Strategic use of genetic testing yields a definitive diagnosis in some cases. Arriving at a diagnosis may afford rapid treatment initiation, with the potential to change prognosis.

### Adaptive capacity of 2-to 5-month-old infants to the flow, shape, and flexibility of different teats during bottle feeding: a cross-sectional study [^114XvCXg]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nutritive sucking is a complex activity, the biomechanical components of which may vary in relation to respiratory phase, swallow-rate per minute, suck-swallow ratio, and swallow non-inspiratory flow (SNIF). Quantitative measurement of these components during nutritive sucking in healthy infants could help us to understand the complex development of sucking, swallowing, and breathing. This is important because the coordination between these components is often disturbed in infants with feeding difficulties. The aims of this study were to describe the biomechanical components of sucking and swallowing in healthy 2- to 5-month-old infants during bottle feeding, to assess whether infants adapt to the characteristics of two different teats, and to determine which independent variables influence the occurrence of SNIF.

Methods

Submental muscle activity, nasal airflow, and cervical auscultation were evaluated during bottle-feeding with two different teats.

Results

Sixteen term-born infants (6 boys) aged 2–5 months were included. All infants showed variable inhalation and exhalation after swallowing. The swallow rate per minute was significantly higher when infants fed with a higher flow teat (Philips Avent Natural 2.0™). Infants had suck:swallow ratios ranging from 1:1 to 4:1. A suck:swallow ratio of 1:1 occurred significantly more often when infants fed with a higher flow teat, whereas a suck:swallow ratio of 2:1 occurred significantly more often when infants fed with a low-flow teat (Philips Avent Classic+™). A suck:swallow ratio of 1:1 was negatively correlated with SNIF, whereas a suck:swallow ratio of 2:1 was positively correlated with SNIF.

Conclusion

Healthy infants aged 2–5 months can adapt to the flow, shape, and flexibility of different teats, showing a wide range of biomechanical and motor adaptations.

### Consensus clinical management guideline for-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) [^116F5ym7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Seizures

Seizures occur in a significant minority of individuals with PLAN, and seizure types may include generalized tonic seizures, focal seizures, and myoclonic seizures. Epileptic spasms have also been reported. Complex epilepsy phenotypes have not been reported. Seizures tend to occur later in the disease course and are not generally refractory to treatment. An EEG may show fast rhythms, although this does not need to be routinely obtained if there is no clinical suspicion for seizures.

How can seizures be distinguished from nonepileptic phenomena?

Individuals with PLAN, particularly infantile PLAN later in disease, may have nonepileptic stiffening or jerking episodes that can only be distinguished from seizure with an ictal EEG. Without an EEG, there are other clues that can help with this determination. Seizures tend to be unprovoked, not interruptible, stereotyped, and involve loss of awareness and a postictal period. A video of the event may be helpful. If uncertainty remains after EEG, and the spells are frequent and bothersome, a trial of an antiseizure medication could be considered.

What is the most effective first-line and second-line antiepileptic medication for PLAN patients with seizures?

There is no evidence for a specific approach to seizure management in PLAN. As with other children, seizure medications are chosen based on seizure type and side effect profile.

### Loss-of-function mutations in SCN4A cause severe foetal hypokinesia or' classical'congenital myopathy [^111br5Ew]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Functional abilities

Delay in early motor milestones was universal. Age when independent ambulation was first achieved ranged from 18 months to 2 years 9 months. At least two cohort members were eventually able to run, albeit slowly and with difficulty. Gait was typically broad-based, slow, and waddling. Two of four used assistive devices (splints and/or frame), and 2/4 used a wheelchair. At least two cohort members had additional fine motor delay. All four experienced clearly documented improvements in strength and motor skills over time. All three that achieved independent ambulation remain able to walk. The youngest (2.5 years old) member is making good progress towards walking independently.

Additional features

Other features noted in two or more affected individuals included chest wall deformities (2/4), generalized joint hypermobility (at least 2/4), unilateral or bilateral scapular winging (one case each) (Fig. 3). One surviving cohort member had tricuspid insufficiency at birth, which resolved with time. No cardiac defects were present in the other three individuals, and none have developed additional cardiac complications over time.

Intermittent exacerbations in muscle weakness and increased fatigability

Marked fatigability with walking and/or writing was a feature in at least 3/4 of the surviving cohort members.

The proband from Family 1 (carrying heterozygous p.R1135C), who is now 14 years of age, began to experience exercise- and illness-associated exacerbations in her level of muscle weakness from the age of 12, and an activity-limiting increase in her fatigability from age 13. These episodes can last a few minutes and while they could be considered reminiscent of periodic paralysis, her repetitive stimulation and single fibre EMG results were normal, with no evidence of alteration of the amplitude or the total area of the compound muscle action potential during exercise test performed after cooling or after a long exercise test.

The oldest cohort member (now aged 35) has experienced a deterioration in her strength and motor abilities, and increase in fatigability over the past 5 years. She also has an abnormal repetitive stimulation test result suggestive of an additional neuromuscular junction abnormality (Table 2), which may be contributing to her fatigability. One of her mutations was reported previously in a family with autosomal dominant non-dystrophic myotonia; however, myotonia was notably absent in this and all other cohort members.

### Infantile spasms (west syndrome): update and resources for pediatricians and providers to share with parents [^112xXa57]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

In the great majority of cases, parental observation of spasms initiates the clinical evaluation of IS. Parents typically bring the child to the pediatrician for episodes that look like colic or may be mistaken for gastroesophageal reflux. Parental/caregiver videos of infant spasms may assist with the clinical evaluation. Consultation with a pediatric neurologist is warranted as early as possible if the events on video are suspicious. The potential benefits of early diagnosis and treatment cannot be overemphasized as improved neurodevelopment may result.

Spasms vary greatly depending upon the muscle groups involved, the intensity of the contraction, and position of the infant during the attack, that is, whether supine or sitting. Spasms may be subtle, brief, and sudden, the most subtle being a head nod or tonic eye rolling, which may be easily missed; they also show great variability in frequency. Typically the spasms involve brief symmetrical contractions of musculature of the neck, trunk and extremities lasting up to 5 seconds and occurring in clusters. In most cases there is an initial phasic component lasting less than 1 to 2 seconds, followed by a less intense but generally more sustained tonic contraction, which could last up to about 10 seconds. However, in some children this tonic phase may be absent and only the initial phasic component is seen. The number of spasms can vary from a few to more than a hundred per cluster; the duration of a cluster may vary from less than a minute to more than 10 minutes. Among many available web-based videos of IS spasms, the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance provides an IS informational video depicting spasms, currently found on YouTube at(see Table 1).

### Neonatal hypocalcemic seizures due to excessive maternal calcium ingestion [^113Ww6E1]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypocalcemia is a common, treatable cause of neonatal seizures. A term girl neonate with no apparent risk factors developed seizures on day 5 of life, consisting of rhythmic twitching of all extremities in a migrating pattern. Physical examination was normal except for jitteriness. Laboratory evaluation was unremarkable except for decreased total and ionized serum calcium levels and an elevated serum phosphorus level. The mother had ingested 3–6 g of calcium carbonate daily during the final 4 months of pregnancy to control morning sickness. The baby's electroencephalogram showed multifocal interictal sharp waves and intermittent electrographic seizures consisting of focal spikes in the left hemisphere accompanied by rhythmic jerking of the right arm and leg. Treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate over several days resulted in cessation of seizures and normalization of serum calcium. The child has remained seizure free and is normal developmentally at 9 years of age. Hypocalcemic seizures in this newborn were likely secondary to excessive maternal calcium ingestion, which led to transient neonatal hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia. Inquiry about perinatal maternal medication use should include a search for over-the-counter agents that might not be thought of as "drugs", as in this case, antacids.

### Neonatal hypertonia: II. differential diagnosis and proposed neuroprotection [^116253YV]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

More accurate documentation of a neonate's specific hypertonic state could be helpful as part of serial neurologic examinations. The clinician would then be in a more advantageous position to choose the appropriate neuroprotective drug or the procedure that best fits with the etiology, localization, and timing of injury. Ideally, choices for neuroprotection will integrate history, examination, and diagnostic findings before considering options for prophylaxis, neurorescue, or neurorepair. Measuring the efficacy of a neuroprotection protocol should include a complete list of life-course challenges, including motor, epileptic, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes as expressed at successively older ages.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for congenital muscular torticollis, more specifically with respect to physical therapy, APTA 2024 guidelines recommend to consult with the infant's primary care provider and/or specialists about other interventions when the infant is not progressing as anticipated, such as when asymmetries of the head, neck, and trunk are not starting to resolve after 4–6 weeks of comprehensive intervention or after 6 months of intervention with a plateau in resolution.

### Electrographic monitoring for seizure detection in the neonatal unit: current status and future direction [^117JEu8F]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Identifying and classifying seizures on cEEG

cEEG with video is the gold standard tool that measures the number and duration of seizures, the area of origin and the pattern of migration. The International League Against Epilepsy Task Force defined electrographic seizures as events with a sudden, paroxysmal, and abnormal alteration of activity. Pressler et al.described seizures as an electrographic event with a pattern characterised by sudden, repetitive, evolving stereotyped waveforms with a beginning and end. For the most part the definitions have remained the same but without a specific duration or the amplitude specified.

The majority of infants display repetitive startle type or even jerky movements, tremors, jitteriness or physiological myoclonus which are normal to the newborn but may complicate a diagnosis or seizures. However, these movements will cease with passive flexion, are predominantly tremulous and are not associated with apnoea/desaturations tachycardia or elevated blood pressure. Seizures may be electroclinical or electrographic (subclinical). Seizures may be localised or focal, multifocal, unilateral, or bilateral, asymmetric or symmetric.

Electroclinical seizures have electrographic features accompanied by clinical manifestation. The classification of seizure types is based on their primary clinical characteristics, categorising them into motor, non-motor and unclassified. Pressler et al. describe one category of motor seizures to include (but not limited to): (a) Clonic-type seizures as more readily identified clinically presenting as jerky movements on one or both sides of the body which are regular and involve the same muscle groups. (b) Tonic-type generalised seizures present as an increase in muscle contraction such as extension of the infant's limbs, posturing and clenching of fists. (c) Infants diagnosed with HIE may exhibit less coordinated movements or automatisms such as lip smacking, mouthing, eye deviations or appearance of cycling activity. Other categories of motor seizures include epileptic spasms and myoclonic non-motor seizures include autonomic and behavioural arrest.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for congenital muscular torticollis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, APTA 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a full evaluation to assess for recurrence of congenital muscular torticollis and evidence of atypical development at the following timepoints:

- when a parent/caregiver or primary care provider observes asymmetrical posture

- 3–12 months following discontinuation of direct physical therapy intervention

- when the child initiates walking.

### Pralidoxime chloride (protopam chloride) [^111PeeiP]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Symptoms Of Nerve Agent And Insecticide Poisoning

PROTOPAM Chloride dosing is based, in part, on the severity of symptoms of nerve agent intoxication. These symptoms include the following:

MILD symptoms:

Blurred vision and sore eyes
Teary eyes*
Runny nose*
Increased salivation such as sudden drooling*
Chest tightness or difficulty breathing
Tremors throughout the body or muscular twitching
Nausea and vomiting
Involuntary respiratory secretions

SEVERE symptoms:

Strange or confused behavior
Severe difficulty breathing or respiratory secretions
Severe muscular twitching and general weakness**
Involuntary urination and defecation*
Convulsions
Unconsciousness

Symptoms in INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN:

* These symptoms are sometimes observed in healthy infants and young children. In this age group, these symptoms are less reliable than other symptoms listed. Symptoms must be considered collectively when nerve agent or pesticide exposure is known or suspected.

** Infants may become drowsy or unconscious, with muscle floppiness rather than muscle twitching, soon after exposure to nerve agents or pesticides.

ADULT INTRAVENOUS DOSING:

Refer to the Preparation for Administration section for instructions on reconstitution and dilution of PROTOPAM Chloride that result in a 10–20 mg/mL solution for intravenous infusion.

Inject an initial dose of 1000 to 2000 mg of PROTOPAM Chloride, preferably as an infusion in 100 mL of normal saline, over a 15- to 30-minute period. If this is not practical or if pulmonary edema is present, the dose should be given slowly (over not less than five minutes) by intravenous injection, as a 50 mg/mL solution in water (e.g., 1000 mg in 20 mL). A second dose of 1000 to 2000 mg may be indicated after about one hour if muscle weakness has not been relieved. Additional doses may be given every 10–12 hours if muscle weakness persists.

Intravenous administration of PROTOPAM Chloride should be carried out slowly and, preferably, by continuous or intermittent infusion, since temporary worsening of cholinergic manifestations (i.e. tachycardia, cardiac arrest, laryngospasm, and muscle rigidity or paralysis) may occur if PROTOPAM Chloride is infused too rapidly. The intermittent infusion rate should not exceed 200 mg/minute. If intravenous administration is not feasible, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection should be used.

Evidence suggests that a loading dose followed by continuous intravenous infusion of PROTOPAM Chloride may maintain therapeutic levels longer than traditional short intermittent infusions therapy (see Pharmacokinetics).

### Muscle fiber myc is dispensable for muscle growth and its forced expression severely perturbs homeostasis [^1146pVwo]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Despite the strong reductions in muscle fiber Myc expression in HSA-MycKO mice, there was no obvious difference between genotypes in body mass for 2-month-old males or body mass and composition for 5- to 7-month-old male and female mice (Fig. 1C, D). Similarly, the mass of tibialis anterior (TA), QUAD, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus (SOL), plantaris (PLA), GAS and triceps brachii (TRI) were comparable between genotypes in 2-month-old males (Fig. S1A) as well as 5- to 7-month-old males (Fig. S1B) and females (Fig. S1C). As differences in body mass largely account for differences in muscle mass in healthy, young adult mice, we explored relationships between TA, TRI, GAS and QUAD mass and body mass in male and female mice between 6 and 37 weeks of age for CON and HSA-MycKO mice (Fig. 1E). The mass of each muscle strongly correlated with body mass in both CON and HSA-MycKO mice, with the only differences in slope (TRI, males) or intercept (GAS) between genotypes indicating, if anything, a slightly higher muscle mass in HSA-MycKO than CON mice. Isolated muscle force recordings in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles from 2-, and 5- to 7-month-old males showed identical responses of CON and HSA-MycKO muscles to stimulation frequencies from 50 to 250 Hz (Fig. 1F). On the other hand, peak EDL twitch force was slightly lower in male (Fig. 1F, G), but not female (Fig. S1D), HSA-MycKO than CON mice, without alteration in other twitch properties (Fig. 1G), while fatigability was comparable between genotypes. Similarly, specific force in the slow-type soleus muscle was comparable between genotypes (Fig. S1E). Together, these data indicate that muscle fiber MycKO has little impact on the development of normal muscle size and function.
