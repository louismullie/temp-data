## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for Iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10 code for Iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what disease name this enzyme deficiency corresponds to. Then, I should verify whether ICD-10 provides a specific code for that disease. Next, I will check if there are any synonyms or subtypes that might map to different codes. Finally, I will confirm the exact ICD-10-CM code and note any coding nuances or alternatives if the specific name is not directly indexed.

> Let me first confirm the disease mapping. Iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency is the biochemical defect underlying mucopolysaccharidosis type II, also known as Hunter syndrome, which is a lysosomal storage disorder with X-linked recessive inheritance and multisystem manifestations including skeletal dysplasia, cardiac and respiratory disease, and neurocognitive involvement in severe forms [^301fb04a].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10 specificity. I initially thought there might be a dedicated ICD-10 code explicitly labeled for "iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency", but hold on, I should verify that in authoritative sources. The ICD-10-CM index and coding references consistently classify Hunter syndrome under E76.1, and I do not see a standalone code that names the enzyme deficiency itself, which means the disease name, not the enzyme, is the indexed entity in ICD-10-CM [^notfound].

> I should confirm the exact code. The correct ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II) is E76.1. If the specific enzyme name is used in documentation, it is appropriate to code to E76.1 because iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency is the etiology of Hunter syndrome and is encompassed by that diagnosis code in ICD-10-CM [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any subtypes or severity modifiers change the code. ICD-10-CM does not provide separate codes for severe versus attenuated Hunter syndrome; both phenotypes are coded as E76.1, with clinical severity captured in the medical record rather than the diagnosis code itself, so I need to ensure I do not over-specify beyond E76.1 in the absence of a more granular ICD-10-CM option [^notfound].

> Let me consider documentation and billing implications. When recording the diagnosis, it is reasonable to document both the disease name and the enzyme deficiency (e.g., "Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome) due to iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency") and then assign E76.1 as the ICD-10-CM code, since payers and registries will recognize E76.1 as the standard code for this condition [^notfound].

> In summary, I should double-check that I'm not missing a more specific code. After reviewing the ICD-10-CM structure and available indexes, there is no code that names the enzyme deficiency itself; the disease entity Hunter syndrome (MPS II) is coded as E76.1, and that is the appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnosis code to use for iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency [^notfound].

The ICD-10 code for iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency (Hunter syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis type II) is **E76.1**. This code is used for both the severe and attenuated forms of the disease [^notfound]. Accurate coding supports diagnosis tracking, treatment planning, and reimbursement for enzyme replacement therapy and supportive care [^51dc9da0].

## Clinical significance of iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency

Iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency causes **Hunter syndrome (MPS II)** [^301fb04a], a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with multisystem involvement, including:

- **Skeletal abnormalities**: Dysostosis multiplex, joint stiffness, and short stature.
- **Cardiac involvement**: Cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, and arrhythmias.
- **Respiratory complications**: Obstructive airway disease and recurrent infections.
- **Neurological manifestations**: Cognitive decline, developmental regression, and seizures in severe forms.
- **Facial dysmorphism**: Coarse facial features and macrocephaly.

Enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase (Elaprase) is the **standard treatment** [^1e2b2ddf], improving survival and reducing disease burden [^db882283].

## ICD-10 code for iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency

The ICD-10 code for iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency is **E76.1**, which encompasses both severe and attenuated forms of Hunter syndrome [^notfound].

---

## Clinical documentation and coding considerations

Accurate coding relies on **clear clinical documentation** that specifies:

- **Enzyme deficiency**: Iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency.
- **Disease name**: Hunter syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type II.
- **Severity**: Severe (neuronopathic) or attenuated (non-neuronopathic) form, if known.

Including these details ensures correct coding and supports appropriate management and reimbursement [^cd4941f1].

---

## Impact of accurate ICD-10 coding

Correct ICD-10 coding for iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency has **important clinical and administrative implications**:

- **Clinical care**: Facilitates appropriate treatment planning, specialist referrals, and monitoring of disease progression.
- **Reimbursement**: Ensures coverage for enzyme replacement therapy, genetic counseling, and supportive care.
- **Epidemiology**: Enables accurate tracking of disease prevalence, incidence, and outcomes.

---

## Limitations and challenges in ICD-10 coding

Despite its importance, ICD-10 coding for rare genetic disorders like iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency faces **challenges**:

- **Lack of specificity**: ICD-10 codes may not capture the full clinical complexity or severity of rare diseases.
- **Coding variability**: Inconsistent coding practices among clinicians and institutions can lead to misclassification.
- **Limited awareness**: Clinicians may be unfamiliar with specific codes, leading to underreporting or incorrect coding.

Efforts to improve coding accuracy include clinician education, standardized documentation templates, and integration of genetic testing results into electronic health records [^68ee46a4].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code for iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency is **E76.1** (Hunter syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis type II). Accurate coding is essential for clinical care, reimbursement, and epidemiological tracking, and clinicians should document the enzyme deficiency, disease name, and severity to ensure correct coding.

### Association of linezolid with risk of serotonin syndrome in patients receiving antidepressants [^7a8e0c94]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was clinically significant serotonin syndrome requiring an ambulatory care visit, ED visit, or hospitalization. The discharge diagnoses from ambulatory care visits, ED visits, and hospitalization were captured by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. On the basis of the ICD-10 codes, serotonin syndrome was defined as any of the following: diagnosis of drug-induced serotonin syndrome or toxic effect related to serotonergic drugs by the physician, diagnosis based on Sternbach criteria, or diagnosis based on the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Serotonin syndrome must have occurred within 30 days of starting linezolid treatment. This time frame was considered reasonable because linezolid is typically prescribed for no more than 14 days and should be cleared from the system in 2 days after discontinued use given its half-life of 5 to 7 hours.

Secondary outcomes were chosen to describe potential consequences of clinically significant serotonin syndrome that may not be captured by the criteria for serotonin syndrome as described herein. All secondary outcomes were defined to be within 30 days of starting linezolid treatment: (1) ED visit or hospitalization for acute altered mental status change or confusion, (2) hospitalization for any cause, or (3) death from any cause.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^5778daa7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the global standard for coding diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. Used by providers, auditors, and researchers, ICD codes (ICD‐10‐CM) support documentation, billing, and epidemiological research. Based on ICD coding, medical claims databases (payor‐system databases) are an alternative type of electronic record collection that support collation of patient‐level de‐identified information, irrespective of the hospital or care provider. ICD‐10‐CM codes, tracked through claims databases, can be used to map high‐level information related to the medical journey across hospital systems.

In this study, we evaluate the early features of disease prior to diagnosis using a payor‐system database, specifically focusing on differences by sex and payor type (private vs. public insurance) in the time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and compare this to a natural history study which used medical records to retrospectively map medical events prior to diagnosis.

Regarding the level of detail provided in the classification, the participants' ratings favoured the ICD-11 over the ICD-10 for every diagnostic code assessed. A majority (74.1%) judged the level of detail in the ICD-11 codes as "just right" vs 24.8% for the ICD-10. (χ²[3, N = 2515] = 1073.01, P < 0.001). Most participants regarded the level of detail in ICD-10 (68.7%) as "too low" (Fig. 3). Some lines in ICD-11 were perceived as allowing too little coding details (for a line-by-line analysis cf S5); > 30% regarded the codes for chronic nonspecific back pain, postherniotomy and postmastectomy pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy and central poststroke pain as too broad.

### The continuing ophthalmic challenge of… [^2f163263]. Ophthalmology Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, International Classification of Diseases 10 th Edition (ICD-10) codes describing Bartonella infections include Systemic Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44.0); Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44.1); Other Forms of Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44.8); Bartonellosis, Unspecified (ICD-10: A44.9); and the umbrella code Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44). There also exists a code that is shared between the terms Parinaud's Conjunctivitis and Parinaud's Oculoglandular Syndrome (ICD-10: H10.89).

The creation of additional ophthalmology-specific codes would increase diagnostic precision and facilitate consistent reporting of these conditions. We propose the creation of the following new ICD-10 codes: "Intraocular Bartonellosis", "Conjunctival and Orbital Bartonellosis", and "Ocular Bartonellosis". The Intraocular Bartonellosis code should be assigned only when evidence of chorioretinitis, neuroretinitis, vitritis, or other intraocular findings have been confirmed. Conjunctival and Orbital Bartonellosis would capture the findings of the traditional term Parinaud's Oculoglandular Syndrome. Ocular Bartonellosis could serve as an umbrella diagnosis. Such diagnoses should be assigned only when laboratory-confirmed Bartonella infection has been established in the presence of the respective clinical findings or when the history and systemic symptoms strongly suggest Bartonella as the causative agent. These diagnostic codes should only be assigned when other diagnoses with similar possible presentations have been excluded or are highly unlikely. Using more precise terminology should help to determine the true incidence and prevalence of a disease that almost certainly is more common than generally assumed.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^a5d430ff]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Level of injury (1)

Similarly, inference about level of injury can be extrapolated from the ICD-10 descriptor "tetraplegia or paraplegia unspecified" but this controlled vocabulary cannot distinguish aetiology (e.g. SCI from SCD). Thus, we report that it is not reasonable to derive a definitive SCI/D aetiology or assign an injury level from this single ICD-10-AM 7th EDN code. For reasons involving false positives or false negatives, this filter was rejected and is omitted from Fig. 1.

Systematic search strategy

To reduce the assumptions introduced by single filters or NLM search terms, we next referenced aggregated ICD-10 codes to the consensus taxonomies of SCD and the ISNCSCI standard.

Level of injury (2)

A Windows Excel find function search for all descriptors containing the NLM terms "paraplegia" or "tetraplegia" or " cauda equina syndrome" yielded a definitive cohort of 140 (28%) cases (Fig. 3). In rank order, a principal diagnosis of "Other paralytic syndromes: Cauda equina syndrome" (50 cases; 9.9%) was the most common followed by "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Tetraplegia, unspecified" (36 cases; 7.1%) and "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Paraplegia, unspecified" (34 cases; 6.7%). From this we surmise that when referenced to ICD-10 standards and the controlled NLM vocabulary, an agnostic systematic search strategy can provide some information of relevance to health service planning about level of injury (constrained to 3 categories); with the caveat that it is not possible to rule out false positives/ negatives or achieve a precise SCI/D taxonomic classification.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^e49a0c92]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization — Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier's intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

### Identification of substance-exposed newborns and neonatal abstinence syndrome using ICD-10-CM-15 hospitals, Massachusetts, 2017 [^a8d7ff0a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Opioid use disorder and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) increased in Massachusetts from 1999 to 2013 (1,2). In response, in 2016, the state passed a law requiring birth hospitals to report the number of newborns who were exposed to controlled substances to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH)* by mandating monthly reporting of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes related to maternal dependence on opioids (F11.20) or benzodiazepines (F13.20) and to newborns affected by maternal use of drugs of addiction (P04.49) or experiencing withdrawal symptoms from maternal drugs of addiction (P96.1) separately. † MDPH uses these same codes for monthly, real-time crude estimates of NAS and uses P96.1 alone for official NAS state reporting. § MDPH requested CDC's assistance in evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of either maternal or newborn codes to identify substance-exposed newborns, and of newborn exposure codes (both exposure [P04.49] or withdrawal [P96.1]) and the newborn code for withdrawal alone (P96.1) to identify infants with NAS cases related to three exposure scenarios: 1) opioids, 2) opioids or benzodiazepines, and 3) any controlled substance. Confirmed diagnoses of substance exposure and NAS abstracted from linked clinical records for 1,123 infants born in 2017 and their birth mothers were considered the diagnostic standard and were compared against hospital-reported ICD-10-CM codes. For identifying substance-exposed newborns across the three exposure scenarios, the newborn exposure codes had higher sensitivity (range = 31%-61%) than did maternal drug dependence codes (range = 16%-41%), but both sets of codes had high PPV (≥ 74%). For identifying NAS, for all exposure scenarios, the sensitivity for either newborn code (P04.49 or P96.1) was ≥ 92% and the PPV was ≥ 64%; for P96.1 alone the sensitivity was ≥ 79% and the PPV was ≥ 92% for all scenarios. Whereas ICD-10-CM codes are effective for NAS surveillance in Massachusetts, they should be applied cautiously for substance-exposed newborn surveillance. Surveillance for substance-exposed newborns using ICD-10-CM codes might be improved by increasing the use of validated substance-use screening tools and standardized facility protocols and improving communication between patients and maternal health and infant health care providers.

Diagnosis and recommended workup — The diagnosis and workup of PANS/PANDAS is complicated by several issues, including a lack of clarity about the potential causes of PANS with a broad array of possible causes to be considered and the absence of a PANS listing in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) or in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11) coding system.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^2c847ed5]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Classification codes — there have been no changes in ICD-10 codes that would impact the 2021 CPG update, so ICD-10 content was not updated or revised; there is a transition plan to ICD-11 codes which will include coding for primary chronic pain and secondary chronic pain conditions (eg, musculoskeletal); and changes to ICD-11 codes are likely in a future CPG update because directly coding chronic pain will noticeably impact clinical classification of low back pain (LBP).

Results

Systematic review

No studies were identified which evaluated the sensitivity or PPV of individual diagnostic ICD-10 codes for PSP or CBS (Fig. 1). Two of the full text reviewed articles highlighted the incorrect assignment of PSP patients to the "G12.22 Progressive Bulbar Palsy" code (G12.2 codes Motor Neuron Disease).

Frequency and distribution of clinical diagnoses coded using ICD-10 diagnostic codes G23.1, G25.9, G31.0, G31.8, G23.9, G23.8 and F02.0 in SMR01

The clinical diagnoses in individuals assigned the candidate ICD-10 diagnostic codes are detailed in Table 2. All individuals with G23.1 code (n = 9) had a clinical diagnosis of PSP. Of 61 individuals with the G31.8 code, one individual had PSP listed amongst their differential diagnoses. CBS was not identified. The other clinical diagnoses assigned this code were a combination of parkinsonian (n = 4) and dementia (n = 49) syndrome diagnoses, as well as smaller number (n = 8) of other neurological diagnoses, detailed in Table 2. Few cases were assigned the remainder of the candidate ICD-10 codes. Two individuals, coded with both G31.0 and F02.0, had a predominantly frontotemporal dementia syndrome with potentially suggestive clinical features (postural instability, symmetrical rigidity, frontal behavioural–spatial syndrome) of PSP or CBS, though neither had been given these diagnoses. No cases assigned the G25.9, G23.9, or G23.8 ICD-10 diagnostic codes had a clinical diagnosis of PSP or CBS.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Disease trajectory browser for exploring temporal, population-wide disease progression patterns in 7.2 million Danish patients [^0e06aa70]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We present the Danish Disease Trajectory Browser (DTB), a tool for exploring almost 25 years of data from the Danish National Patient Register. In the dataset comprising 7.2 million patients and 122 million admissions, users can identify diagnosis pairs with statistically significant directionality and combine them to linear disease trajectories. Users can search for one or more disease codes (ICD-10 classification) and explore disease progression patterns via an array of functionalities. For example, a set of linear trajectories can be merged into a disease trajectory network displaying the entire multimorbidity spectrum of a disease in a single connected graph. Using data from the Danish Register for Causes of Death mortality is also included. The tool is disease-agnostic across both rare and common diseases and is showcased by exploring multimorbidity in Down syndrome (ICD-10 code Q90) and hypertension (ICD-10 code I10). Finally, we show how search results can be customized and exported from the browser in a format of choice (i.e. JSON, PNG, JPEG and CSV).

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^68ee46a4]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include the size of the population evaluated — which included over 13 million unique patients from a large commercial health plan population, representative of commercially-insured patients more generally. Our methodology, which included a detailed curation of indicators of genetic disease, allowed us to evaluate several different populations of patients based on different levels of specificity. Finally, our administrative claims-based approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of direct healthcare-related utilization and costs. Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, as our methodology utilized insurance claims data as opposed to electronic health records, we are limited in our ability to interpret both diagnostic thinking and clinical decision-making. For example, while we observe substantial delays in genetic testing in many patients, the reasons for these delays are unclear and may be clinically warranted based on the unique circumstances of individual patients. Similarly, ICD-9/10 codes do not capture the granularity required to distinguish diagnosed genetic conditions. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a deep ontology that relates detailed clinical features to both diseases and genes. Availability of HPO terms in a large data set like this would have improved our specificity in defining populations and HPO coding (or improvements in ICD coding informed by HPO) could contribute to future studies of genetic disease in populations. In addition, while some genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes, many do not; thus, we are unable to definitively determine the end of a diagnostic odyssey for many individual patients. Second, our definitions of possible, probable and definite genetic disease are based on expert opinion and manual curation. Not all patients with these features would have had a genetic diagnosis even if optimal testing had been performed. This is likely due to additional undescribed disease-causing genes, oligogenic and complex inheritance, and environmental phenocopies. How ICD-9/10 codes are used for insurance billing purposes may not be aligned with the diagnostic thinking of clinicians. Coding systems, including diagnosis and procedure codes, are used for billing purposes and are likely to fail to reflect the variability observed in clinical practice. Furthermore, a level of miscoding is presumed to occur as is inherent in claims database studies (e.g. a coding specialist may select the first code on a list of possible codes as opposed to the most appropriate code). Third, given the substantial health conditions of patients with genetic diseases, patients may transition to public insurance programs, switch between private insurance plans, or for other reasons stopped being observed in the database. Although our continuous enrollment requirements help control for some of this variability, there are inherent limitations to the comprehensiveness of the follow-up, which could also be exacerbated by the severity of the disease. Finally, in our selection of patients, we found a large number of newborns with codes indicating a possible genetic condition but no stay in a NICU. Because we required a stay in a NICU, these patients were excluded from analysis in the critically-ill infant population and were instead included in the pediatric population.

### Accuracy of routinely collected hospital administrative discharge data and death certificate ICD-10 diagnostic coding in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome: a systematic review and validation study [^8bc85f49]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We conducted a systematic review to identify existing ICD-10 coding validation studies in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome [PSP/CBS]) and, in a new study, evaluated the accuracy of ICD-10 diagnostic codes for PSP/CBS in Scottish hospital inpatient and death certificate data.

Methods

Original studies that assessed the accuracy of specific ICD-10 diagnostic codes in PSP/CBS were sought. Separately, we estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) of specific codes for PSP/CBS in inpatient hospital data (SMR01, SMR04) compared to clinical diagnosis in four regions. Sensitivity was assessed in one region due to a concurrent prevalence study. For PSP, the consistency of the G23.1 code in inpatient and death certificate coding was evaluated across Scotland.

Results

No previous ICD-10 validation studies were identified. 14,767 records (SMR01) and 1497 records (SMR04) were assigned the candidate ICD-10 diagnostic codes between February 2011 and July 2019. The best PPV was achieved with G23.1 (1.00, 95% CI 0.93–1.00) in PSP and G23.9 in CBS (0.20, 95% CI 0.04–0.62). The sensitivity of G23.1 for PSP was 0.52 (95% CI 0.33–0.70) and G31.8 for CBS was 0.17 (95% CI 0.05–0.45). Only 38.1% of deceased G23.1 hospital-coded cases also had this coding on their death certificate: the majority (49.0%) erroneously assigned the G12.2 code.

Discussion

The high G23.1 PPV in inpatient data shows it is a useful tool for PSP case ascertainment, but death certificate coding is inaccurate. The PPV and sensitivity of existing ICD-10 codes for CBS are poor due to a lack of a specific code.

### Idursulfase (Elaprase) [^8b632f9c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.3	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ELAPRASE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In post-marketing experience, late-emergent symptoms and signs of anaphylactic reactions have occurred up to 24 hours after initial treatment and recovery from an initial anaphylactic reaction. In addition, patients experienced repeated anaphylaxis over a two- to four-month period, up to several years after initiating ELAPRASE treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

A seven year-old male patient with Hunter syndrome, who received ELAPRASE at twice the recommended dosage (1 mg/kg weekly) for 1.5 years, experienced two anaphylactic events after 4.5 years of treatment. Treatment has been withdrawn [see Overdosage (10)].

Serious adverse reactions that resulted in death included cardiorespiratory arrest, respiratory failure, respiratory distress, cardiac failure, and pneumonia.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Innovations and changes in the ICD-11 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders [^3ab4a856]. World Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Following approval of the ICD-11 by the World Health Assembly in May 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) member states will transition from the ICD-10 to the ICD-11, with reporting of health statistics based on the new system to begin on January 1, 2022. The WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse will publish Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (CDDG) for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural and Neurodevelopmental Disorders following ICD-11's approval. The development of the ICD-11 CDDG over the past decade, based on the principles of clinical utility and global applicability, has been the most broadly international, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a classification of mental disorders. Innovations in the ICD-11 include the provision of consistent and systematically characterized information, the adoption of a lifespan approach, and culture-related guidance for each disorder. Dimensional approaches have been incorporated into the classification, particularly for personality disorders and primary psychotic disorders, in ways that are consistent with current evidence, are more compatible with recovery-based approaches, eliminate artificial comorbidity, and more effectively capture changes over time. Here we describe major changes to the structure of the ICD-11 classification of mental disorders as compared to the ICD-10, and the development of two new ICD-11 chapters relevant to mental health practice. We illustrate a set of new categories that have been added to the ICD-11 and present the rationale for their inclusion. Finally, we provide a description of the important changes that have been made in each ICD-11 disorder grouping. This information is intended to be useful for both clinicians and researchers in orienting themselves to the ICD-11 and in preparing for implementation in their own professional contexts.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^4679ec01]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Traumatic aetiologies

In terms of traumatic cases, an APC subset of 202 (39%) cases had ICD-10-AM codes referencing the key terms "injury" and "spinal cord". These terms were taken to indicate a definitive diagnosis of a traumatic SCI or a spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. In rank order, cervical cases were the most prevalent cause of SCI (135 [32%]) followed by thoracic (51 [10.1%]), and lumbar cases (16 [3.2%]). Table 2 presents the distribution and frequency of those traumatic cases identified and subsequently quantitated by ICD-10-AM code.

Non-traumatic aetiologies

ICD-10-AM codes identifying SCD epochs of care accounted for 115 [23%] of the 504 cases. Of these "vascular myelopathies", and "intraspinal abscess and granuloma" 28 [8.7%] were most frequently recorded. In terms of omissions, ethical constraints precluded the reporting of rare spinal or spinal cord aetiologies with < 5 recorded cases. Due to these constraints the cohort selected for analysis excluded ICD-10 codes for: (i) "Benign neoplasm of meninges: Spinal meninges"; and (ii) "Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system: Spinal cord".

Table 2 also presents ICD-10 codes for "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (22 cases). Of note, GB is a forme fruste diagnosis, and as such new index cases are; first, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in our facility and secondly, consented to participate and recorded in the ASCIR. For the purpose of this study GB cases were retained for analysis.

Vertebral column injuries

The NLM descriptors/ search terms "fracture" and "neck", or "cervical spine", "thoracic spine" or "lumbar spine" and "fracture" were used in this study to define an epoch of inpatient care due to accidental (low or high impact trauma) or pathological fracture (data not shown). However, from these descriptors it is not reasonable to infer a sine qua non diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological evidence of spinal canal compromise with concomitant spinal cord compression, together with an ISNCSCI physical examination would be necessary to be confident of sine qua non. These filters were rejected in the construction of the CONSORT framework (Fig. 1) but may inform future attempts to construct a spinal disorders registry.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6cf86e4d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes are used to characterize coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related symptoms. Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses.

Objective

To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (< 50, 50–64, and > 64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson χ² tests were used to compare different subgroups.

Results

Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24–0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96–0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39–0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42–0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84–0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95–0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16–0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22–0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96–0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90–0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40–0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (χ² = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (χ² = 14.25; P = 0.003) but not for cough (χ² = 5.13; P = 0.16).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) epidemiology and coding — available data — note that "There is limited, wide-scale epidemiologic information regarding FPIES", and that "FPIES was recognized and formally defined in the mid-1970s". Coding was standardized when "A 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems code for FPIES (K52.2) was implemented in October 2015", while "Before this, no uniform International Classification of Diseases code existed". The only prospective birth cohort cited reported "a cumulative incidence of infants with CM-induced FPIES of 3 per 1000 newborns born at a single hospital over 2 years (0.34%)".

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^8cdfc2d3]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) epidemiology and classification — The US SIDS rate decreased from 120 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1992 to 56 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2001, representing a reduction of 53% over 10 years, remained constant from 2001 to 2008, and then declined from 54 per 100 000 live births in 2009 to 40 in 2013. In 2013, 1561 infants died of SIDS. Although SIDS rates have declined by > 50% since the early 1990s, SIDS remains the leading cause of postneonatal (28 days to 1 year of age) mortality. The all-cause postneonatal death rate showed a 26% decline from 1992 to 2001 (from 314 to 231 per 100 000 live births), was fairly unchanged from 2001 until 2009 (from 231 to 222 per 100 000 live births), and then declined yearly since 2009 to 193 per 100 000 live births in 2013. Several studies have observed that some deaths previously classified as SIDS (ICD-10 R95) are now being classified as other causes of sleep-related infant death (eg, accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed [ASSB; ICD-10 W75] or other ill-defined or unspecified causes [ICD-10 R99]), and at least some of the decline in SIDS rates may be explained by increasing rates of these other assigned causes of SUID. To improve consistency, the National Center for Health Statistics created the special cause-of-death category SUID, which captures deaths with an underlying cause coded as ICD-10 R95, R99, and W75. Historical context includes that in 1992 the AAP recommended nonprone sleep to reduce SIDS risk and the "Back to Sleep" campaign was initiated in 1994.

Conjunctivitis ICD-10 CM classifications — The appendix lists ICD-10 classifications for conjunctivitis-related entities, including Conjunctivitis, other diseases of conjunctiva caused by viruses with H10.011 – H10.813 (approximately 65 codes in this range) and noting Code first underlying virus or chemical and intent; examples include blepharoconjunctivitis H10.50-, H10.51-, H10.53-, Zika virus A92.5, measles B05.81, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis H10.45, vernal conjunctivitis H10.44, atopic conjunctivitis H10.1-, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) H10.41-, adenoviral conjunctivitis B30.1, herpes simplex virus (HSV) conjunctivitis B00.53, varicella (herpes) zoster virus (VZV) conjunctivitis B02.31, molluscum contagiosum B08.1, bacterial conjunctivitis (including nongonococcal and gonococcal) H10.89, chlamydial conjunctivitis A74.0, ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid (OMMP) L12.1, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) D89.810, D89.811, D89.812, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) L51.3, conjunctival chalasis H11.82, and SARS-COVID 19 U07.1; laterality is indicated where (-) = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral.

### Estimating prevalence of rare genetic disease diagnoses using electronic health records in a children's hospital [^2c6ff3f4]. HGG Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2
NLP validation and results for three methods of mapping diagnosis descriptions

Orphanet also provides mappings between ICD-10 and ORPHA codes, which are classified as Exact, BTNT (broader term to narrower term), NTBT (narrower term to broader term), and ND (unable to decide). When considering all mapping classes, 5,527 RGD ORPHA codes were mapped to ICD-10 codes in our cohort. However, only 884 ICD-10 codes were used to describe these ORPHA codes, and a total of 149,222 patients in the cohort (a prevalence of 22.6%) had at least one of these 884 ICD-10 codes. This result suggests that direct mappings from ICD-10 to ORPHA codes are not only non-specific but also contain substantial false positives that may arise when a narrower ORPHA code is mapped to a broader ICD-10 code. When considering only the exact mappings between ICD-10 and ORPHA codes, a mere 154 ICD-10 codes were mapped to 150 ORPHA codes in 29,777 patients in our cohort. Compared with the results of text-based mapping using the NOBLE Coder-based NLP pipeline, this represents a striking 88% reduction in RGD diagnoses and a 20% reduction in the number of patients identified. Moreover, there is a higher likelihood of false positives in these 29,777 patients, as many ICD-10 codes are mapped to multiple ORPHA codes with only one of the mappings as exact. For instance, H90.5 is mapped to four ORPHA codes (998, 87884, 330029, and 363396); however, only the mapping to 87884 (non-syndromic genetic deafness) is exact. In contrast, the diagnosis descriptions from IMO terminology are often more accurate than ICD-10 codes. For example, in our EHR data, diagnosis texts such as "Aarskog syndrome", "Cornelia de Lange syndrome", "Noonan syndrome", "Russell's syndrome", and many more syndromes were all noted as Q87.19. This ICD-10 code, however, is not used at all in Orphanet. Instead, a different ICD-10 code, Q87.1 is used, which is mapped to more than 60 RGD ORPHA codes.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome and maternal opioid-related diagnoses: analysis of ICD-10-CM transition, 2013–2017 [^e53db25e]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hospital discharge records remain a common data source for tracking the opioid crisis among pregnant women and infants. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification may have affected surveillance. Our aim was to evaluate this transition on rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), maternal opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid-related diagnoses (OUD with ICD-10-CM codes for long-term use of opioid analgesics and unspecified opioid use).

Methods

Data from the 2013–2017 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample were used to conduct, interrupted time series analysis and log-binomial segmented regression to assess whether quarterly rates differed across the transition.

Results

From 2013 to 2017, an estimated 18.8 million birth and delivery hospitalizations were represented. The ICD-10-CM transition was not associated with NAS rates (rate ratio [RR]: 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90–1.08; P = 0.79) but was associated with 11% lower OUD rates (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80–0.98; P = 0.02) and a decrease in the quarterly trend (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–1.00; P = 0.04). The transition was not associated with maternal OUD plus long-term use rates (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.89–1.09; P = 0.76) but was associated with a 20% overall increase in opioid-related diagnosis rates including long-term and unspecified use (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.09–1.32; P < .001).

Conclusions

The ICD-10-CM transition did not appear to affect NAS. However, coding of maternal OUD alone may not capture the same population across the transition, which confounds the interpretation of trend data spanning this time period.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^7319604b]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic transitions

Not all genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes; thus, a definitive assessment of genetic disease diagnoses in patients with initial clinical presentations that are indicative of a suspected genetic disease is not possible from an administrative claims-based analysis. However, assessing the proportion of patients transitioning from an initial index diagnosis code in the possible or probable genetic disease categories to a primary diagnosis code in the definite genetic disease category is indicative of a conservative estimate of definitive genetic disease diagnoses. These transitions may have resulted from additional clinical investigations including specialist assessments, the results of imaging or other non-invasive procedures, or, in an extreme minority of cases per the genetic test utilization results above, molecular testing. The number of patients who moved into more definite categories of diagnosis is reported in Table 3.

Table 3
Diagnostic transitions.

The first diagnostic category represents the category of code used for the index event. The second diagnostic category represents a change from a less-specific category to a more specific category during follow-up.

CPT/HCPCS Current Procedural terminology/Healthcare common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), MCA/ID/DD/E: MCA multiple congenital anomalies, ID intellectual disability, DD developmental delay, E epilepsy/seizures.

In the Broad and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts of the pediatric population, 1.1% and 2.6% of patients, respectively, transitioned from possible or probable to definite (Table 3). We observed a higher transition rate in the Conservative cohort — which had at least one genetic test by definition — where 15.8% of patients transitioned from a possible or probable diagnosis to a definite diagnosis within the follow-up period (Table 3).

In the Broad and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts of the critically-ill newborn population, 5.3% and 6.5% of patients, respectively, transitioned from possible or probable to definite (Table 3). As in the pediatric population, the Conservative cohort had a much higher rate of conversion to definite compared to the other two cohorts: 41.6% of patients transitioned from a possible or probable index diagnosis to a definite genetic disease diagnosis during the follow-up period.

Denominator ARDS identification approach — to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 display the performance characteristics for each symptom in the prespecified subgroups. Sensitivity was low for all symptoms in all subgroups (range, 0.17–0.45). The observed values of false-positives, false-negatives, true-positives, and true-negatives differed between inpatients and outpatients for fever (χ² = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (χ² = 14.25; P = 0.003) but not cough (χ² = 5.13; P = 0.16). Statistically significant differences in the same observed values were found between age subgroups for fever (χ² = 42.63; P < .001) and dyspnea (χ² = 14.77; P = 0.02) but not cough (χ² = 6.28; P = 0.39). Here, we report the χ² statistic and P value; see eTable 1, eTable 2, and eTable 3 in the Supplement for the contingency tables used to generate these results. High false-negative rates were the main contributor to poor ICD-10 code performance. The proportion of patients with a false-negative ICD-10 code result ranged from 35.8% for fever among patients older than 64 years to 54.5% for fever among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Treacher Collins syndrome in the United States: examining incidence and inpatient interventions [^03ebdedf]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Advancements have been made in the care of patients with Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), but epidemiological data are lacking given its rarity. A national database provides a valuable opportunity for studying the incidence of rare craniofacial conditions. We sought to evaluate disease incidence of phenotypically severe cases and the frequency of the most common associated diagnoses and interventions.

Design

The 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was the first version to include updated International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Edition (ICD-10) coding encompassing a unique code for TCS. The 2016 KID was queried for the unique code. Incidence was calculated using national estimates. Diagnosis and procedure codes were pooled and analyzed.

Patients

A total of 266 discharge cases with a diagnosis code for TCS (Q75.4).

Main Outcomes

Disease incidence and the most frequent diagnosis and procedure codes.

Results

The estimated incidence of children born with a diagnosis of TCS was approximately 1 in 80,000. Two of the three most common ICD-10 diagnosis codes were tracheostomy status and obstructive sleep apnea. The most common procedures performed were airway examination procedures.

Conclusions

Treacher Collins syndrome is a rare craniofacial disorder requiring complex multidisciplinary management. Phenotypically severe cases requiring inpatient management may be rarer than previous estimates suggest. Inpatient airway interventions are very common, and multidisciplinary team members should anticipate the degree of potential airway risk these patients pose.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^3088a383]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

APC data repository

A large de-identified cohort (3504) of public and private hospital admissions was retrieved from the APC collection (2012–2017). Of this 6-year cohort a subset of 504 cases had an ICD-10-AM code indicative of a sine qua non or forme fruste SCI/D aetiology, satisfied data integrity criteria, and were retained for analysis.

Socio-demographic characteristics

Table 1 presents the socio-demographic characteristics of this 6-year ICD-10-AM coded APC cohort. Most identified cases were male (60%), mean cohort age was 53 ± 21 years; with a wide variance. The difference between the mean (SD) age of male and female cases did not reach significance (p > 0.05). In relation to ethnicity 25 (5.0%) of the cohort was recorded as Indigenous, as per the NHMRC definition. In terms of family-social support, almost 50% were either married or living in a de facto relationship. At the time of admission 144 (29%) cases were engaged in employment. However, a majority had a "not applicable" employment code denoting self-employment, self-funded retiree or benefit recipient. Analysis by type of social benefit revealed that 108 (21%) were in receipt of a benefit payment; with a minor subset of 25 (5.0%) claiming a disability benefit.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^301045c6]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

All retrospective approaches are influenced by biases in documentation and care. Both ethnicity and race are known to influence the determination of the severity of medical concerns, which would be indirectly reflected in the medical documentation and medical coding. The public payor status and use of claims databases are more likely to include a representative population compared to the natural history cohort. An additional limitation is that the claims databases rely on ICD‐10‐CM codes without access to medical records to allow for confirmation. As such, the data available are dependent on how the provider coded medical concerns. This affects both the diagnosis of MLD as well as disease‐specific symptoms. In particular, we are unable to verify the MLD diagnosis by standard methods (genotype, enzyme level, or sulfatides) or confirm standard definitions of disease‐related symptoms. In addition, the timepoint available for the onset of a given prodromal symptom represents the first use of the ICD‐10‐CM code within the electronic health record and may be delayed compared to when the family first had concern. For example, a child may have had strabismus for several months prior to medical evaluation or diagnosis based on access to care. If this is the case, then our study could potentially be underestimating the time from the onset of prodromal symptoms to MLD diagnosis. To this end, our cohort only captured patients diagnosed in the final year of the database (2023). Based on the range of eligible individuals within the prior years and the incidence of MLD, it is probable that approximately 20–30 patients will have been ultimately diagnosed with MLD.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

Hospitals included in the tertiary hospital registry search and the secondary hospital spot sample

For validation, supplementary ICD-10 diagnosis code searches on E23.0-E23.9, Q89.2G, and Q04.0-Q04.9 (other congenital malformations of brain) were performed locally at the 4 tertiary hospitals for variable periods according to the possibilities of the individual hospital registries (Table 2).

The hospital registry searches, which included patients with an above-mentioned diagnosis code given at the age of 0–17 years, were followed by hospital file examinations to exclude patients born outside the study period 1996–2020 and patients with ICD-10 diagnosis codes indicating acquired PHD. Next, the DNPR and hospital registry searches were merged by central person registration numbers to disallow patient duplets, followed by a retrospective review of all available hospital files of the remaining patients to validate the cCPHD diagnosis and exclude patients with fewer than 2 documented secondary/tertiary hormone deficiencies or acquired CPHD.

Data Collection

Hospital file data were collected from March 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022. For the finally included patients, the following data were included: date of birth, sex as indicated by the presence of male/female genitals (male/female), born in Denmark (yes/no), date and results of blood samples and stimulation tests of interest (low/normal/inadequately high/high), date and result of urine osmolality measurement (low/normal/high), abnormalities of the adenohypophysis, neurohypophysis, pituitary stalk, midline, and cerebrum by the latest MRI (aplasia/hypoplasia/ectopic/normal or yes/no), and clinical signs of hormone deficiencies (yes/no).

### Comorbidity landscape of the Danish patient population affected by chromosome abnormalities [^7e978c04]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data

Diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR)covering 6.9 million patients and more than 108 million hospital encounters between 1994 and 2015 were available. The diagnoses were encoded in the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10), which hierarchically orders diseases in 21 chapters that are subdivided into 227 blocks of similar diseases and 1,702 disease-specific level 3 codes. The level 3 codes are further subdivided with up to four additional characters to indicate etiology, anatomic site, severity, etc. Chromosome abnormalities are encoded in ICD-10 chapter XVII "Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities" in the block Q90–Q99 "Chromosomal abnormalities, not elsewhere classified". Eleven well-defined chromosome abnormalities from this block with at least 50 patients each were identified: Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), DS (trisomy 21), KS (47, XXY), triple X syndrome, XYY syndrome, TS (45, X), Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and FXS. Four sub-analyses where also performed: female/male DS and FXS, and non-mosaic/mosaic DS and TS patients where each subgroup had at least 50 patients. Only patients with either a mosaic or a nonmosaic diagnosis in the registry were included in the subgroup analysis. See Table 1 for specific ICD-10 codes for each patient group.

### International comparison of sudden unexpected death in infancy rates using a newly proposed set of cause-of-death codes [^76155c8b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Comparing rates of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) in different countries and over time is difficult, as these deaths are certified differently in different countries, and, even within the same jurisdiction, changes in this death certification process have occurred over time.

Aims

To identify if International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) codes are being applied differently in different countries, and to develop a more robust tool for international comparison of these types of deaths.

Methods

Usage of six ICD-10 codes, which code for the majority of SUDI, was compared for the years 2002–2010 in eight high-income countries.

Results

There was a great variability in how each country codes SUDI. For example, the proportion of SUDI coded as sudden infant death syndrome (R95) ranged from 32.6% in Japan to 72.5% in Germany. The proportion of deaths coded as accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (W75) ranged from 1.1% in Germany to 31.7% in New Zealand. Japan was the only country to consistently use the R96 code, with 44.8% of SUDI attributed to that code. The lowest, overall, SUDI rate was seen in the Netherlands (0.19/1000 live births (LB)), and the highest in New Zealand (1.00/1000 LB). SUDI accounted for one-third to half of postneonatal mortality in 2002–2010 for all of the countries except for the Netherlands.

Conclusions

The proposed set of ICD-10 codes encompasses the codes used in different countries for most SUDI cases. Use of these codes will allow for better international comparisons and tracking of trends over time.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

Cancer Diagnosis

Topography and morphology codes were obtained from the Danish Cancer Registryand converted to International Classification of Childhood Cancer, Third Edition (ICCC-3) codes. The ICCC-3 classification is based on pathology, whereas cancers in the ICD system are grouped according to anatomical location. To ease comparison across age groups, the ICCC-3 classification was also used for adult-onset cancers. If a morphology code was missing (ie, no pathology sample available), an assigned ICD-10 code in the registry was converted to a corresponding ICCC-3 code. If assigning an ICCC-3 code was not possible due to poor specification of the cancer type and location, the event was included only in the analysis of any cancer.

Syndrome Diagnosis

A syndrome diagnosis was defined as either an abnormal karyotype (except balanced translocations) or abnormal chromosomal microarray registered in the Danish Cytogenetic Central Registeror a syndrome ICD code in the Danish National Patient Registry, also including ectodermal dysplasia and incontinentia pigmenti, which are coded as malformations of the skin in the ICD-10 (ICD-8 codes 7592–7599 and ICD-10 codes Q82.3-Q82.4 or within Q85-Q99) (detailed description in eMethods 2 in Supplement 1). Genetic testing for a syndrome registered in these data sources was performed as part of clinical care if the examining clinician suspected a syndromic diagnosis. Results of single-gene tests (eg, colorectal cancer panel screening, including APC and AXIN2) were not available. Tooth agenesis in itself was not an indication for genetic testing within the study period, and no testing was performed as part of this study.

### International time trends in sudden unexpected infant death, 1969–2012 [^bdb2fe67]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The present study is a comparison of historical time trends in SUID, SIDS, and all-cause infant mortality between countries across the globe (1969–2012). Infant deaths were defined as deaths in children during the first year of life. We obtained data from the National Statistical Offices of the respective countries. In the case of missing data, we checked the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database and included additional data if available. Diagnoses were used according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) systems. Our primary diagnosis of interest was SUID. The diagnosis of SUID commonly includes SIDS (ICD-10, R95), accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD10, W75), or other ill-defined or unspecified causes of mortality (ICD-10, R99). We used the broader category ill-defined and unknown causes of mortality (ICD-10, R96–99), as international comparisons have shown differences in the use of individual codes of diagnoses between countries. For example, a high percentage of SUID was coded as other sudden death, cause unknown (ICD-10, R96) in Japan. Codes of diagnoses used for SUID and related diagnoses might differ both between and within countries over time. During the period of interest, the ICD systems changed. We used the following ICD systems: the 8th revision (ICD-8), the 9th revision (ICD-9), and the 10th revision (ICD-10) (Table 1). The years in which ICD systems changed differed between countries.

Table 1
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for sudden infant death syndrome, related diagnoses and all causes of death

A number of countries used other classification systems, such as the 09 N – ICD 9th revision, Special List of causes (tabulation list) (countries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, USSR), the 09A/09B – List ICD 9th revision, Standard Basic Tabulation (Croatia, Greece, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand), or the Finnish Classification of Diseases 1987. The German Democratic Republic (GDR), which existed until 1990, used a special version of the ICD for the coding of deaths. For the latest years of our study, all countries - apart from Greece - had adopted the ICD-10 codes. The causes of death in Greece were coded with ICD-9 until 2013.

### The high direct medical costs of Prader-Willi syndrome [^c3131857]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

We used commercial, Medicare supplemental, and Medicaid data from the MarketScan Research Databases (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, Michigan) for the years 2009–2014. These data provide a cross-sectional and longitudinal view of health care utilization, expenditures, demographics, and enrollment in the US. Specifically, the databases contain deidentified health insurance enrollment information and fully adjudicated claims data for inpatient and outpatient medical services as well as outpatient medications. The commercial database includes claims from individuals covered by employer-sponsored private health insurance. The Medicare database contains data from retirees with Medicare supplemental insurance paid by employers.

Several characteristics set the MarketScan Databases apart from other similar datasets. The core MarketScan Databases contain more than 180 million patients since 1995 and include private sector health data from approximately 100 payers. Moreover, the MarketScan Medicaid Database contains the pooled health care experience of approximately 6 million Medicaid enrollees from multiple states. Historically, more than 500 million claim records are available in the MarketScan Databases.

This study used a case-matched control design to quantify health care utilization among patients with PWS compared with those without the condition. We used the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code (759.81), which is specific to PWS, to identify the PWS case cohort, and conversely, the absence of the code to define control cohort without PWS. Patients with PWS initially were identified as having at least 1 matching ICD-9-CM code 759.81 within the given study period. Matching controls were matched at a 5:1 ratio to cases with PWS, on the variables of sex, age, and payer type (commercial, Medicare supplemental, and Medicaid). After the initial data extract, we applied additional criteria to increase the robustness of our sample.

To account for extraneous coding errors, we included only cases for which there were at least 2 PWS diagnoses on separate dates. Even though the MarketScan Lab Database includes laboratory test results that could ideally be used to validate diagnosis, these tests are only captured within the patients' enrollment timeframe in our study (maximum 5 years, 2009–2014) and would therefore exclude the patients who became enrolled after their primary diagnosis occurred and would have significantly limited our study population. Finally, we also required patients to be continuously enrolled for at least 12 months within the 5-year study window, which helped to ensure that measured healthcare utilization was not affected by gaps in insurance coverage.

### Accuracy of diagnostic codes for identifying brief resolved unexplained events [^96f448f8]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding strategies for the identification of patients with a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE).

Methods

Multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged < 1 year with an emergency department (ED) visit between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2018, and an ICD-10 code for the following: (1) BRUE; (2) characteristics of BRUE; (3) serious underlying diagnoses presenting as a BRUE; and (4) nonserious diagnoses presenting as a BRUE. Sixteen algorithms were developed by using various combinations of these 4 groups of ICD-10 codes. Manual chart review was used to assess the performance of these ICD-10 algorithms for the identification of (1) patients presenting to an ED who met the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical definition for a BRUE and (2) the subset of these patients discharged from the ED or hospital without an explanation for the BRUE.

Results

Of 4512 records reviewed, 1646 (36.5%) of these patients met the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for BRUE on ED presentation, 1016 (61.7%) were hospitalized, and 959 (58.3%) had no explanation on discharge. Among ED discharges, the BRUE ICD-10 code alone was optimal for case ascertainment (sensitivity: 89.8% to 92.8%; positive predictive value: 51.7% to 72.0%). For hospitalized patients, ICD-10 codes related to the clinical characteristics of BRUE are preferred (specificity 93.2%, positive predictive value 32.7% to 46.3%).

Conclusions

The BRUE ICD-10 code and/or the diagnostic codes for the characteristics of BRUE are recommended, but the choice between approaches depends on the investigative purpose and the specific BRUE population and setting of interest.

Table 2 shows the estimated SMR for certain conditions originating in the perinatal period and congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities. Bold type is used to highlight SMR with associated probability values lower than 0.002 (0.05/23), and therefore significant after accounting for multiple testing. SROH was associated with an increased mortality due to disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified (ICD-10 code P07, 3% risk increase per Mb in SROH, 95%CI: 1–4%) and to intracranial non-traumatic haemorrhage of foetus and newborn (ICD-10 code P52, 5% risk increase per Mb in SROH, 95%CI: 2–9%). The proportion of Aymara–Quechua ancestry was associated with an increased mortality due to respiratory distress of newborn (ICD-10 code P22, 3% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 1–5%) and to anencephaly and similar malformations (ICD-10 code Q00, 5% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 3–7%), and with a decreased mortality due to Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (ICD-10 code Q91, 4% decreased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: −6 to −2%). The proportion of Mapuche–Huilliche ancestry was associated with an increased mortality due to other congenital malformations of brain (ICD-10 code Q04, 7% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 2–12%) and with a decreased mortality due to Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (ICD-10 code Q91, 5% decreased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: −8 to −2%).

### High incidence and geographic distribution of cleft palate in Finland are associated with the IRF6 gene [^db479acf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Phenotype definitions

Case subjects with non-syndromic forms of OFCs in FinnGen were defined from electronic health records in the Care Register for Health Care of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) and the Causes of Death Register from Statistics Finland, using diagnosis codes of the Finnish version of ICD (versions 10, 9, 8). Codes of versions ICD-10, ICD-9 and ICD-8 were available since 1996, between 1987–1995 and between 1967–1986, respectively. Cases with CP only (discovery cohort n = 228; 157 females and 71 males and replication cohort n = 165; 116 females and 49 males) were defined based on the ICD-10 code Q35, ICD-9 code 7490[ABCE], and ICD-8 code 74900. Cases with CLP (n = 121; 62 females and 59 males) were defined using the ICD-10 code Q37, ICD9 code 7492[ABCDE], and ICD8 codes 74920 and 74924. Cases with CL (n = 54; 28 females and 26 males) were defined using ICD10 code Q36, ICD9 codes 7491[ABCDEFG] and ICD8 codes 74910 and 7491[123]. Syndromic cases with the following ICD-10 codes were excluded: Q75.4 (mandibulofacial dysostosis), Q38.0 (congenital malformations of lips, not elsewhere classified, including VWS), Q86 (congenital malformation syndromes due to known exogenous causes, not elsewhere classified), Q87 (other specified congenital malformation syndromes affecting multiple systems) and Q91 (Edward's syndrome and Patau's syndrome). The Estonian cohort consisted of 71 CP cases and 198,973 population controls. Cases with isolated CP (n = 71; 54 females and 17 males) in the Estonian biobank were ascertained using the ICD-10 code Q35 through a questionnaire implemented by the biobank and national health registry-based medical records. The following ICD-10 codes for syndromic cases were excluded from both Estonian cases and controls: Q38.0 (congenital malformations of lips, not elsewhere classified, including VWS), Q38.1 (ankyloglossia), Q38.5 (congenital malformation of palate), Q87 (other specified congenital malformation syndromes affecting multiple systems), and Q91 (Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome).

### A conceptual framework for the revision of the ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders [^b3bb9ec6]. World Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is revising the ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders, under the leadership of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse and within the framework of the overall revision framework as directed by the World Health Assembly. This article describes WHO's perspective and priorities for mental and behavioural disorders classification in ICD-11, based on the recommendations of the International Advisory Group for the Revision of ICD-10 Mental and Behavioural Disorders. The WHO considers that the classification should be developed in consultation with stakeholders, which include WHO member countries, multidisciplinary health professionals, and users of mental health services and their families. Attention to the cultural framework must be a key element in defining future classification concepts. Uses of the ICD that must be considered include clinical applications, research, teaching and training, health statistics, and public health. The Advisory Group has determined that the current revision represents a particular opportunity to improve the classification's clinical utility, particularly in global primary care settings where there is the greatest opportunity to identify people who need mental health treatment. Based on WHO's mission and constitution, the usefulness of the classification in helping WHO member countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, to reduce the disease burden associated with mental disorders is among the highest priorities for the revision. This article describes the foundation provided by the recommendations of the Advisory Group for the current phase of work.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### High risk of venous thromboembolism in Klinefelter syndrome [^75db4d17]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Outcome Variables and Ascertainment of Cases

Cases of VTE, classified according to the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 8th, 9th, and 10th revisions, were identified in the Hospital Discharge Register and the Hospital Outpatient Register 2001–2010 (Table 1). Only main diagnoses of VTE were considered to ensure high validity and to include mainly primary and not secondary VTE cases. The Swedish Hospital Discharge Register has nearly 90% overall validity or positive predictive values. 10, 14 The positive predictive value for cardiovascular disorders such as VTE, myocardial infarction, and stroke is ≈90% to 95%. 10, 14, 15 In a Swedish study of male persons with VTE, hospital records were available for 304 cases (1970–1998). 15 A total of 289 of 304 cases (95%) of diagnosed VTE were judged to be diagnosed correctly. 15 Only 12 cases (3.9%) were not diagnosed with an objectively verified method but were treated with oral anticoagulation because of strong clinical probability. In total, 277 cases (91%) were objectively diagnosed with methods such as phlebography, ultrasound, computed tomography scan, and pulmonary scintigraphy. 15 The Hospital Outpatient Register has not been validated previously for VTE. Sultan et al recently found that 43% of pregnant VTE patients first recorded as outpatient were not accompanied by anticoagulant prescriptions, whereas this proportion was much lower than those patients first recorded in the inpatient register (9%). Moreover, for cases of nonspecific thrombophlebitis diagnoses, 25% had evidence of glucosaminoglycan polysulfate (C05BA01) prescriptions. We also used ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) codes for anticoagulant drugs to validate the entire outpatient and inpatient registers with prescription of anticoagulant drugs after VTE diagnosis (B. Zöller, MD, PhD, H. Ohlsson, PhD, J. Sundquist, MD, PhD, and K. Sundquist, MD, PhD, unpublished data, 2016); however, the prescription register is available only from July 2005. The positive predictive value for inpatient diagnosis of VTE was similar to published data by Rosengren et al and Sultan et al (unpublished data). 15, 16 An outpatient diagnosis of VTE had less validity, similar to Sultan et al, 16 but the presence of a VTE diagnosis on 2 occasions in outpatients was associated with high positive predictive value (ie, anticoagulant prescription), similar to what was observed in the study by Rosengren et al (unpublished data). 15 Consequently, we classified only outpatient diagnosis of VTE if diagnosis had occurred 2 times for outpatients, whereas 1 event of VTE for inpatients was enough to be classified as VTE.

### Assessing the precision of ICD-10 codes for uveitis in 2 electronic health record systems [^532bc7a2]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Electronic health record (EHR) systems based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding of disease entities are increasingly being used to generate large data sets for analysis. However, the reproducibility of ICD-10 coding in uveitis has not been assessed across EHR platforms, and imprecision in coding may lead to improper conclusions in big-data analyses.

Objective

To compare ICD-10 coding of uveitis using 2 EHR systems.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study compares ICD-10 codes for 27 uveitic diseases generated by the Epic and MDIntelleSys EHR systems to the ICD-10 descriptions associated with the codes. No patient data were assessed in this study.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The number of diseases for which ICD-10 coding differed between the 2 systems.

Results

Thirteen of 27 uveitic diseases were coded differently by the 2 EHR systems. Coding imprecision was notable in that the Epic system returned 16 ICD-10 codes and the MDIntelleSys returned 12 ICD-10 codes to describe 13 diseases; 4 diseases had multiple codes returned, and 6 codes were used to describe more than 1 disease. For example, MDIntelleSys uses ICD-10 code H30.13 for both birdshot choroiditis and acute retinal necrosis, while Epic uses H30.9 for both birdshot choroiditis and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome; MDIntelleSys uses this code for multifocal choroiditis. Furthermore, the ICD-10 descriptions for certain codes lack specificity, allowing variable interpretation by the coder.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests there is substantial disparity in the ICD-10 codes that are generated for specific uveitides by the 2 EHR systems studied. This result implies that analysis of large databases generated from the pooling of EHR data could produce results with substantial bias because of misclassification resulting from conflicting and imprecise coding of uveitides. Therefore, research into outcomes, costs, health care utilization, and epidemiology in uveitis might be improved if a more uniform coding system to describe ocular inflammatory disease is implemented.

### A multicenter, open-label study evaluating safety and clinical outcomes in children (1.4–7.5 years) with Hunter syndrome receiving idursulfase enzyme replacement therapy [^301fb04a]. Genetics in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hunter syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis II, is a rare (prevalence 1 in 162,000 male live births), X-linked, and recessive disease caused by a deficiency or absence of the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase. Iduronate-2-sulfatase, a lysosomal storage enzyme, is required for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). When the enzyme is deficient, toxic levels of the GAGs such as heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate accumulate in the lysosomes, causing the cells to enlarge, leading to organ failure, tissue dysfunction, and reduced life expectancy.

The consequence of GAG accumulation is a progressive multiorgan disease that demonstrates great heterogeneity among patients, both in age of onset and severity and in the organs affected. Death usually occurs in the second or third decade of life, most often from respiratory and/or cardiac failure. The two usually considered distinct subtypes of Hunter syndrome are (i) attenuated (or mild) and (ii) severe. With either type, patients appear normal at birth. Patients with the severe phenotype begin to develop the signs between 2 and 4 years of age with neurological and cognitive impairments appearing before the age of 6 years. Patients with the attenuated subtype may not show signs until late childhood or early adolescence. There is, however, no demonstrated biochemical difference between the two types, and, in practice and from the clinical point of view, the severe and attenuated phenotypes are the two ends of a spectrum of clinical severity.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^c2389deb]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The vast majority of rare diseases (RDs) are complex, disabling, and life-threatening conditions with a genetic origin. RD patients face significant health challenges and limited treatments, yet the extent of their impact within health care is not well known. One direct method to gauge the disease burden of RDs is their overall cost and utilization within health-care systems.

Methods

The 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) databases were used to extract health-care utilization data using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes.

Results

Of 35.6 million national hospital weighted discharges in the HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 32% corresponded to RD-associated ICD-10 codes. Total charges were nearly equal between RDs ($768 billion) compared to common conditions (CCs) ($880 billion) (p < 0.0001). These charges were a result of higher charges per discharge and longer length of stay (LOS) for RD patients compared to those with CCs (p < 0.0001). Health-care cost and utilization was similarly higher for RDs with pediatric inpatient stays, readmissions, and emergency visits.

Conclusion

Pediatric and adult discharges with RDs show substantially higher health-care utilization compared to discharges with CCs diagnoses, accounting for nearly half of the US national bill.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^d40700dd]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Large-scale genomic analyses reveal insights into pleiotropy across circulatory system diseases and nervous system disorders [^2e44566a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Phenotype definitions

The phenotypes were defined based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes extracted from the EHR. Since the disease coding practices and regulations differ between the US and the UK, the composition and distribution of diagnosis codes are different. To maximize the phenotypic information, we have accordingly applied different, yet complementary strategies to the two datasets.

Since ICD-10 codes have added specificity compared to ICD-9 codes, we chose to convert ICD-10 codes to ICD-9 codes. For UKBB, we have only included individuals who had ICD-10 occurrences to retain its original collection of disease codes and because fewer data were available for ICD-9 codes in the UKBB and during a more remote time period than the ICD9-CM codes found in the eMERGE dataset. Because the disease diagnosis codes in UKBB were curated and represented by the presence or absence of a certain ICD codes, this information was used to define case status; this means that if a person has a certain ICD-10 code present in the EHR, that person would be assigned as a "case" for that phenotype. If the person did not have that diagnosis code, he/she would be assigned as a "control". As for eMERGE, we have converted ICD-10-CM to ICD-9-CM codes using a combination of general equivalence mappingsand manual review. Because eMERGE offers longitudinal measures on diagnosis codes, we have applied a "rule of three" on ICD-9 codes to define case status. This means that if a person had three or more occurrences of a certain ICD-9 code in their EHR on different clinic visits, that person would be assigned as a "case". If a person had either one or two occurrences of a particular ICD-9 code, an "NA" status would be assigned. Finally, if a person did not have any occurrence of a particular ICD-9 code, a "control" status would be assigned for that phenotype. This approach was used to assign case status for all available phenotypes. One general caveat of EHR data in the eMERGE dataset is that the absence of certain disease diagnosis code for some individuals does not equal the absence of the disease, as the patients might get the medical care at another institution thus may not present in our datasets. This would bias results toward the null, thus we don't expect that this impacted our study in a significant way.

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^38cbc533]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Esotropia ICD-10 CM codes — entities and laterality rules are specified as follows: Nonaccommodative (unspecified) H50.00; Accommodative H50.43; Alternating H50.05; Alternating with A pattern H50.06; Alternating with V pattern H50.07; Alternating with X or Y pattern (with other noncomitancies) H50.08; Monocular H50.01–; Monocular with A pattern H50.02–; Monocular with V pattern H50.03–; Monocular with X or Y pattern (with other noncomitancies) H50.04–; Intermittent, alternating H50.32; Intermittent, monocular H50.31–; Unspecified H50.00. CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; = 1, right eye; 2, left eye. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes indicates laterality. Esotropia and exotropia do not have bilateral codes. Therefore, if the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), most often you will find: Right is 1 Left is 2.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^ab59a3b4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes — precursors to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and related entities are mapped between ICD-9 CM and ICD-10 CM, including break, unspecified (361.00; H33.00-), break, giant (361.03; H33.03-), vitreous detachment/degeneration (379.21; H43.81-), and retinal break without detachment types such as retinal break, unspecified (361.30; H33.30-), horseshoe tear (361.32; H33.31-), and round hole (361.31; H33.32-), as well as retinal dialysis (361.04; H33.04-) and lattice degeneration of the retina (362.63; H35.41-). Additional information for ICD-10 CM states that certain categories have applicable 7th characters and that "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used", and that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; the table specifies " = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral", and that "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Concordance of ICD-11 and DSM-5 definitions of alcohol and cannabis use disorders: a population survey [^98ddb90d]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

The proposed criteria for alcohol and cannabis use disorders in the 11th edition of ICD (ICD-11) will be presented to the World Health Assembly in 2017, but the beta-phase descriptions have been released. We compared them with those in the tenth edition (ICD-10) and the American Psychiatric Association's DSM fourth edition (DSM-IV) and fifth edition (DSM-5), in a nationally representative sample of adult Australians. Disorders were assessed with the WHO World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The proportions classified as being dependent on alcohol and cannabis were similar with ICD-10, ICD-11, and DSM-IV, whereas for DSM-5, the proportion of lifetime users meeting the criteria for moderate to severe use (most comparable to dependence in the other systems) was far higher. We assessed whether criteria for alcohol and cannabis use described unidimensional syndromes for each, and all definitions seemed to do so. Classification of alcohol and cannabis use disorders, although simplified in ICD-11, was in almost perfect agreement with the classifications of ICD-10 and DSM-IV. With DSM-5, use disorder seemed to capture a different aspect of problematic use and selected a different group of individuals from the other systems. How the newest definitions will become used remains to be seen. The choice of classification might depend on the clinical population of interest.

### Association of diagnosis of leukodystrophy with race and ethnicity among pediatric and adolescent patients [^a0d62625]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort analyses. The study, which used deidentified data, was not considered human subjects research and was exempted by the institutional review boards at the University of Utah and Intermountain Healthcare. We conducted a retrospective case-control study on patients aged 18 years or younger admitted to a Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) hospital with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of leukodystrophy (metachromatic leukodystrophy [E75.25], X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy [E71.52x], Krabbe disease [E75.23], or Hurler disease [E76.01]) between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2017.

The PHIS database has information from more than 50 children's hospitals in the United States. Hospitals are affiliated with the business alliance of Child Health Corporation of America. Each patient has a unique entry, but the data are deidentified. Data collected include patient and visit demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, insurance type, type of visit, estimated total visit cost, length of stay, ICD coding, and detailed charge information. The hospital visits included primarily inpatient admissions with additional visit types such as emergency department, observation, ambulatory surgery, and clinic visits. Race and ethnicity were collected as patient- or family-reported answers to separate questions at registration: 1 for race and 1 for ethnicity.

### Idursulfase (Elaprase) [^c88bfcc7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Clinical trials with ELAPRASE were conducted in 96 patients with Hunter syndrome, ages 5 to 31 years old, with the majority of the patients in the pediatric age group (median age 15 years old). In addition, an open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial was conducted in 28 patients with Hunter syndrome, ages 16 months to 7.5 years old. Patients 16 months to 5 years of age demonstrated reduction in spleen volume that was similar to that of adults and children 5 years and older. However, there are no data to support improvement in disease-related symptoms or long term clinical outcome in patients 16 months to 5 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety and effectiveness of ELAPRASE have not been established in pediatric patients less than 16 months of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of ELAPRASE did not include patients older than 31 years of age. It is not known whether older patients respond differently from younger patients.

### Retinal vein occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^f45120fb]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM codes — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications include: central retinal vein occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.35; ICD-10 CM H34.811-, H34.812-, H34.813-; venous tributary (branch) occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.36; ICD-10 CM H34.831-, H34.832-, H34.833-; venous engorgement — ICD-9 CM 362.37; ICD-10 CM H34.821-, H34.822-, H34.823-. For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

### Treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome): a Delphi derived practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^1e2b2ddf]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Mucopolysaccharidosis, type II (MPS II, MIM 309900) is a severe lysosomal storage disease with multisystem involvement. There is one product approved by the FDA, an enzyme replacement therapy, based on a phase III trial in older, attenuated MPS II individuals. Guidance on treatment of MPS II is lacking, not only in general, but for specific clinical situations. A previous systematic evidence-based review of treatment for MPS II demonstrated insufficient strength in all data analyzed to create a definitive practice guideline based solely on published evidence. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Therapeutics Committee conducted a Delphi study to generate an MPS II clinical practice resource of the treatment for these individuals for the genetics community, based on the evidence-based review and subsequent literature. This report describes the process, including consensus development and areas where consensus could not be obtained due to lack of quality evidence. Recommendations from the Delphi process were generated, and areas were highlighted that need further study to help guide clinical care of these individuals.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^c5bd4139]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM laterality and 7th-character rules — Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and a placeholder X is required if a code needing a 7th character is not 6 characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the code indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When laterality is specified in the diagnosis code, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Development and assessment of a new framework for disease surveillance, prediction, and risk adjustment: the diagnostic items classification system [^51dc9da0]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This diagnostic modeling study describes and tests a new classification system that maps ICD-10-CM codes into a rich set of diagnostic items (referred to as DXIs), far more fully exploiting ICD-10-CM 's expanded diagnostic detail than widely used existing models. The DXI system predicts key spending and utilization outcomes more accurately than the existing models, potentially enabling improved plan payment, health services research, cost-effectiveness studies, quality reporting, and disease surveillance.

### The most common comorbidities in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a 15-year nationwide population-based cohort study [^88b9f7a5]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) constitutes a group of connective tissue diseases with variable organ dysfunction. We aimed to examine the comorbidity burden in patients with EDS.

Methods

A nationwide population-based cohort study linking data from Danish registers from the year 2000–2014. The EDS cohort was identified using the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) EDS code. The control cohort was formed from the Danish general population by randomly matching the EDS cohort in a ratio of 1:25 by sex and date of birth. Hospital contacts were used to identify the most frequently occurring ICD-10 codes. We investigated the frequencies of the disease categories and unique ICD-10 codes and compared these between the cohorts.

Results

The EDS cohort included 1,319 patients and the control cohort 46,700 patients. All disease categories and ICD-10 codes were significantly more frequent within the EDS cohort, especially those related to common manifestations of EDS. Other comorbidities such as asthma, pneumonia, gastrointestinal functional disorders, and hernias were also significantly more common in the EDS cohort.

Conclusions

The most common comorbidities in Danish patients with EDS were gastrointestinal functional disorders, hernias, asthma, pneumonia, and osteoporosis. The causality between these comorbidities and EDS should be investigated further. Implications for RehabilitationEhlers-Danlos syndrome constitutes a group of connective tissue diseases causing a variable range of organ dysfunction. The comorbidity burden for patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was unexplored previously. This study showed that the most common comorbidities in Danish patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are gastrointestinal functional disorders, hernias, asthma, pneumonia, and osteoporosis.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^d7a684c7]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — coding and documentation: Women who meet the criteria for rUTI should have this diagnosis added to their problem list to help alert other providers and ensure best practices, and the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is important for correct classification; the ICD-10 code of "positive urine culture" can be used instead of UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria when a urine culture is positive but the clinical criteria are not met for a UTI.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6ece3d7b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Rapid access to well-characterized, large SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 cohorts is critical for scientific discovery. ICD-10 codes are a standard terminology and are attractive for data aggregation because they are uniformly used among health care systems. However, these codes perform poorly in capturing COVID-19–related symptoms. Our findings highlight the critical need for meticulous data validation to feed multicenter registries built from EMRs. Reliable, accurate data are the foundation of scientific discovery; the right data lead to the right solutions.

### Survival in idursulfase-treated and untreated patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type II: data from the Hunter outcome survey (HOS) [^db882283]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; Hunter syndrome; OMIM 309900) is a life-limiting, multisystemic disease with varying presentation and severity. Enzyme replacement therapy with intravenous idursulfase (EC 3.1.6.13) has been available since 2006. Data from the Hunter Outcome Survey (July 2016) were used to compare survival in idursulfase-treated (n = 800) and untreated (n = 95) male patients followed prospectively in this multinational, observational registry. Median age at symptom onset was similar for the treated and untreated groups (1.6 and 1.5 years, respectively), as was median age at diagnosis (3.3 and 3.2 years) and the proportion of patients with cognitive impairment (58.0%; 57.9%). The proportion of idursulfase-treated patients differed according to geographical region. Overall, 124/800 (15.5%) treated and 28/95 (29.5%) untreated patients had died. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death (treated, 43/124 [34.7%]; untreated, 10/28 [35.7%]). Median survival (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 33.0 (30.4, 38.4) years in treated patients and 21.2 (16.1, 31.5) years in untreated patients; median follow-up time from birth to death or last visit was 13.0 and 15.1 years, respectively. A Cox model adjusted for treatment status, cognitive impairment, region and age at diagnosis indicated a 54% lower risk of death in treated compared with untreated patients: hazard ratio (HR), 0.46 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.72). Patients with cognitive impairment had nearly a fivefold higher risk of death than those without (HR, 4.84 [3.13, 7.47]). This analysis in a large population of patients with MPS II indicates for the first time that idursulfase treatment is associated with increased survival.

### Agreement between definitions of pharmaceutical opioid use disorders and dependence in people taking opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (POINT): a cohort study [^ddb839f7]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Classification of patients with pharmaceutical opioid use disorder and dependence varies depending on which definition is used. We compared how WHO's ICD-10 and proposed ICD-11 and the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV and DSM-5 classified individuals in a community-based sample of Australians with chronic non-cancer pain for which opioids have been prescribed.

Methods

We studied participants in the Pain and Opioid IN Treatment (POINT) cohort, a 2 year prospective cohort study of 1514 people prescribed pharmaceutical opioids for their chronic pain who were recruited in 2012–13 from community-based pharmacies across Australia. After giving patients the Composite International Diagnostic Interview about their opioid use, we assessed which patients would be categorised as having disorders of pharmaceutical opioid use by ICD-10, the draft ICD-11, DSM-IV, and DSM-5. We examined agreement between classification systems, and tested the unidimensionality of the syndrome with confirmatory factor analysis.

Findings

We included 1422 participants (median time of pain disorder 10 years [IQR 5–20]; median length of strong opioid prescription 4 years [IQR 1.5–10.0]; mean age 58 years). Similar proportions of individuals met lifetime criteria for dependence with DSM-IV (127; 8.9%), ICD-10 (121; 8.5%), and ICD-11 (141; 9.9%). Criteria in DSM-5 classified 127 (8.9%) participants with moderate or severe use disorder. There was excellent agreement between ICD-10, ICD-11 and DSM-IV dependence (κ > 0.90). However, there was only fair to moderate agreement between ICD-10 and DSM-IV dependence diagnoses, and DSM-5 use disorder (mild, moderate, or severe). There was only good agreement between moderate to severe use disorder in DSM-5 and the other definitions. Criteria for all definitions loaded well on a single factor; the best model fit was for the definition for dependence in the draft ICD-11, the worst was in DSM-5.

Interpretation

Classification of problematic pharmaceutical opioid use varies across editions of ICD and DSM. The much lower levels of agreement between DSM-5 and other definitions than between other definitions might be attributed to DSM-5 containing an increased number of criteria and treating dependence and problematic use as a continuum. The more parsimonious ICD-11 dependence definition showed excellent model fit and excellent agreement with previous classificatory systems.

### Establishing screening programs for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes: practical guidance for diabetes care providers [^403c2987]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic codes

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes Z13.1 (encounter for screening for diabetes mellitus) or Z83.3 (family history of diabetes mellitus) can be used for screening individuals with a family history of T1D. The code Z13.29 (encounter for screening for other suspected endocrine disorder) can be used for screening individuals with a personal or family history of autoimmune diseases. After being proposed by T1D advocates and experts, new ICD-10 codes for presymptomatic T1D became available on October 1, 2024. These include E10. A0 (type 1 diabetes mellitus, presymptomatic, unspecified), E10. A1 (type 1 diabetes mellitus, presymptomatic, stage 1), and E10. A2 (type 1 diabetes mellitus, presymptomatic, stage 2). These codes will be helpful for monitoring visits after a patient has screened positive for AAbs. Diagnostic and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT ®) codes are listed in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively.
