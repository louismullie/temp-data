## Question

can a patient be able to undergo mastopexy surgery if the platelet is 546k?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a platelet count of 546,000/μL (546 × 10⁹/L) is compatible with proceeding to mastopexy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what this platelet value means diagnostically and how to classify it. Then, I should verify the bleeding versus thrombotic risk profile for mastopexy and whether this count changes that risk. Next, I will review guideline-based thresholds for platelet transfusion and whether any apply here. After that, I need to check for underlying causes of thrombocytosis and whether preoperative cytoreduction is warranted. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-adapted plan for proceeding safely, including VTE prophylaxis and medication review, and confirm there are no special plastic surgery nuances that would alter management.

> Let me first confirm the laboratory interpretation. A platelet count of 546 × 10⁹/L exceeds the upper limit of normal (about 150–450 × 10⁹/L), so this meets the definition of thrombocytosis; I should double-check that I'm using the conventional reference range, which is supported by interventional pain guidelines and general hematology references, so yes, this is thrombocytosis rather than thrombocytopenia.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bleeding risk. My initial instinct is to worry about bleeding because platelets are central to hemostasis, but wait, that logic applies to low platelet counts; here the count is high, so the dominant perioperative concern is thrombosis, not bleeding, and contemporary guidance emphasizes that platelet count alone is a poor predictor of bleeding and should be interpreted in clinical context, which supports shifting focus toward thrombotic risk in thrombocytosis rather than hemorrhagic risk [^116GNRY7] [^1166aZVa].

> Next, I should review whether any major guidelines recommend preoperative platelet reduction for thrombocytosis. The British Society for Haematology and ESMO suggest considering lowering platelet counts to less than 400 × 10⁹/L before surgery where bleeding is a risk or where thromboprophylaxis would normally be prescribed, particularly in essential thrombocythemia; this is a conditional recommendation and requires individualized assessment of procedure risk and patient factors, so I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing it to low-risk cosmetic breast surgery without a myeloproliferative diagnosis [^1132K9ET] [^111mufjc] [^11156vXM].

> I will now examine the procedure-specific context. Mastopexy is a superficial, non-microneurosurgical breast procedure with moderate tissue dissection; it is not a free-flap operation and does not carry the same microvascular thrombotic risk profile seen in autologous breast reconstruction, where thrombocytosis has been linked to flap complications in observational cohorts; thus, the threshold to cytoreduce platelets solely for mastopexy is not established and would be hard to justify without a clonal myeloproliferative disorder or extreme thrombocytosis with symptoms [^116SQhCd] [^114WErkU].

> Let me consider the absolute platelet value. At 546 × 10⁹/L, this is a moderate thrombocytosis and, in the absence of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, is often reactive; importantly, there is no evidence that this degree of thrombocytosis independently predicts bleeding in mastopexy, and guidelines do not recommend prophylactic platelet transfusion or any intervention solely for a high platelet count in this setting, reinforcing that routine cytoreduction is not indicated here [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the thrombocytosis is clonal or extreme. I should confirm the etiology with a careful history, exam, and basic labs to distinguish reactive from essential thrombocythemia; if there are features suggesting a myeloproliferative neoplasm or if the platelet count is markedly higher, then preoperative hematology input and consideration of cytoreduction to less than 400 × 10⁹/L may be reasonable, particularly if major surgery or high thrombotic risk is present; in this case, with 546 × 10⁹/L and a low-risk cosmetic procedure, urgent cytoreduction is not mandated [^1132K9ET] [^111mufjc].

> Next, I should review perioperative thromboprophylaxis. Even in patients without thrombocytosis, mastopexy warrants standard VTE prevention; with thrombocytosis, I should ensure appropriate mechanical prophylaxis and consider pharmacologic prophylaxis if additional risk factors exist, balancing bleeding risk; BSH guidance supports individualized VTE risk assessment and graded prophylaxis in surgical patients with thrombocytosis, which fits this scenario [^113YM4KW].

> I need to ensure we are not missing bleeding risks unrelated to platelet number. I should double-check for medications that impair platelet function, such as SSRIs, NSAIDs, and antiplatelet agents, and review anticoagulants; SSRIs in particular have been associated with a several-fold increase in hematoma requiring intervention after breast cosmetic surgery, so a careful medication reconciliation and shared decision-making about perioperative management is essential even when the platelet count is high [^116noQVV].

> Let me synthesize the decision. Yes, mastopexy can proceed with a platelet count of 546 × 10⁹/L; no preoperative platelet-lowering therapy or transfusion is indicated, and the priority is to investigate the cause of thrombocytosis, optimize VTE prophylaxis, and manage bleeding risks from medications and comorbidities rather than the platelet count itself; if the patient has concerning features for a clonal myeloproliferative disorder or if the count is substantially higher, I should involve hematology preoperatively to guide cytoreduction decisions [^112SiCiN] [^115dVSvN] [^113YM4KW].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical perioperative plan. Pre-op: clarify etiology of thrombocytosis with history, exam, CBC with smear, iron studies, inflammatory markers, and consider JAK2/MPL/CALR testing if features suggest ET; hold or adjust antiplatelet agents and NSAIDs per procedural risk; implement mechanical VTE prophylaxis and consider pharmacologic prophylaxis if additional risk factors are present; intra-op: standard hemostatic technique; post-op: continue VTE prophylaxis, monitor for thrombotic symptoms, and arrange follow-up for thrombocytosis workup if reactive causes are excluded; this aligns with BSH and ESMO perioperative guidance and with plastic surgery safety principles for elective breast procedures [^1132K9ET] [^111mufjc] [^116GNRY7].

---

In general, **mastopexy can proceed safely** with a platelet count of 546,000/μL (546 × 10⁹/L) because this is only a mild thrombocytosis and does not, by itself, increase bleeding risk [^116GNRY7]. However, **evaluate for underlying causes** (e.g. reactive, myeloproliferative) and address modifiable bleeding risks (medications, coagulopathies) before surgery [^115dVSvN]. No **platelet-lowering therapy** is indicated at this level, but standard VTE prophylaxis should be used perioperatively [^113YM4KW]. If the patient has a history of thrombosis or other high-risk features, consider hematology input and individualized risk mitigation [^111mufjc].

---

## Clinical significance of platelet count 546,000/μL

A platelet count of 546,000/μL represents **mild thrombocytosis** (normal range: 150,000–450,000/μL) [^115akeYo]. Thrombocytosis is classified as mild (450,000–750,000/μL), moderate (750,000–900,000/μL), or severe (> 900,000/μL). Mild thrombocytosis is **commonly reactive** to infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, or recent surgery, and is less often due to clonal disorders such as essential thrombocythemia (ET) [^115dVSvN].

---

## Perioperative bleeding risk assessment

Bleeding risk in thrombocytosis is **complex**; while high platelet counts can cause abnormal platelet function and increase thrombotic risk, they do not inherently increase bleeding risk. In fact, **thrombocytosis may reduce bleeding risk** by enhancing clot formation. However, **platelet dysfunction** or abnormal aggregation can paradoxically increase bleeding risk even with elevated counts [^114e4Avp].

For mastopexy — a procedure with moderate bleeding risk — a platelet count of 546,000/μL alone **does not significantly increase bleeding risk**. Current guidelines emphasize assessing bleeding risk holistically, considering platelet function, coagulation profile, and patient-specific factors rather than platelet count alone [^116GNRY7] [^1166aZVa].

---

## Surgical guidelines and recommendations

There are **no specific guidelines** addressing platelet count thresholds for mastopexy. General surgical guidelines provide platelet transfusion thresholds for procedures with high bleeding risk or for patients with thrombocytopenia, not thrombocytosis:

- **Platelet transfusion** is generally recommended for major surgery when platelet count is < 50,000/μL [^111jFzqe] [^116CRuGP].
- **Neurosurgery or ophthalmic procedures** may require platelet counts > 100,000/μL [^115HKYSW].
- **Major non-neuraxial surgery** can proceed safely with platelet counts > 50,000/μL [^111yARJq].

These guidelines indicate that a platelet count of 546,000/μL is **far above any threshold** associated with increased bleeding risk or need for platelet transfusion [^111jFzqe].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

While a platelet count of 546,000/μL alone does not contraindicate mastopexy, **clinicians should consider**:

- **Underlying cause**: Evaluate for reactive or clonal causes of thrombocytosis, as clonal disorders (e.g. ET) may require specific management [^1132K9ET] [^11156vXM].
- **Platelet function**: Assess for platelet dysfunction, especially if the patient has a history of bleeding or is on antiplatelet medications [^116GNRY7].
- **Thrombotic risk**: Thrombocytosis increases thrombotic risk; consider perioperative thromboprophylaxis (e.g. low-dose anticoagulation, compression stockings) [^113YM4KW].
- **Individualized risk assessment**: Consider patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, and medication use [^1166aZVa].

---

## Clinical management strategies

If thrombocytosis is confirmed, **management strategies** include:

- **Observation**: For mild reactive thrombocytosis, no specific treatment is required beyond addressing the underlying cause [^notfound].
- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Consider low-dose aspirin if thrombotic risk is elevated, balancing bleeding risk [^notfound].
- **Cytoreductive therapy**: Reserved for high-risk clonal thrombocytosis (e.g. hydroxyurea, anagrelide) [^notfound].
- **Perioperative thromboprophylaxis**: Use standard VTE prophylaxis measures during surgery [^113YM4KW].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A platelet count of 546,000/μL **does not contraindicate mastopexy**. This mild thrombocytosis alone does not significantly increase bleeding risk. Clinicians should evaluate for underlying causes, assess platelet function, and implement standard thromboprophylaxis. Individualized risk assessment and communication with the patient are essential. If a clonal disorder is suspected or thrombotic risk is high, consider hematology consultation and targeted management [^111mufjc].

Thrombocytopenia is a common perioperative clinical problem. While global haemostasis is influenced by many patient- and procedure-related factors, the contribution of thrombocytopenia to bleeding risk is difficult to predict, as platelet count does not linearly correlate with likelihood of bleeding. Thus, the widely used definition of thrombocytopenia and grading of its severity have limited clinical utility. We present a summary and analysis of the current recommendations for invasive procedures in thrombocytopenic patients, although the platelet count at which any given procedure may safely proceed is unknown. The benefits and risks of preoperative platelet transfusions should be assessed on a patient-by-patient basis, and alternatives to platelet transfusion should be considered. In non-emergent surgeries or in postoperative thrombocytopenic patients, haematology consultation should be considered to guide diagnostics and management. We present a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of perioperative thrombocytopenia.

Special considerations — surgery and perioperative care in mastocytosis: Mast cell activation can occur in patients with mastocytosis undergoing surgical procedures and may persist for several hours after surgery; the primary goal is prevention during and immediately after the procedure. Multidisciplinary management is recommended, with careful review of prior anesthetic records and identification and avoidance of known triggers such as temperature extremes (hypothermia or hyperthermia) and unnecessary trauma, which are strongly recommended. The efficacy and safety of perioperative drugs in SM have not been fully established, though some are considered safer by anecdotal reports; nevertheless, perioperative drugs are not contraindicated. Analgesics should not be withheld, but caution should be exercised with opioids (eg, codeine or morphine).

### Postoperative bleeding after dentoalveolar surgery in patients with thrombocytopenia-are prophylactic platelet transfusions necessary? [^112Ymab5]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Karasneh et al. found no evidence in their systematic review to support the long-standing PLT count threshold of < 50 × 10⁹/L for administration of prophylactic PLT transfusion prior to dentoalveolar surgery. The 2018 clinical practice guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommended a threshold of 40–50 × 10⁹/L for prophylactic PLT transfusion before major invasive surgery on patients with no other associated coagulation abnormalities. For bone marrow aspirations, bone marrow biopsies, and the removal of central venous catheters, ASCO recommendations state that patients with a PLT count of < 20 × 10⁹/L do not require prophylactic PLT transfusions.

One unit of PLT costs approximately USD 528 in Sweden and up to USD 4,436 in the US. Over the course of our study (12 years), our cohort had received 86 units of PLT, at a cost of roughly USD 43,000 in Sweden and USD 382,000 in the US. Our data demonstrated no significant reduction in the incidence of POB when prophylactic platelet transfusions were administered prior to dentoalveolar surgery. The lack of benefit in this setting, in combination with the shortage of blood components and the high costs associated with transfusion, argue for a more restrictive PLT transfusion strategy compared with current recommendations in several international guidelines.

The clinical outcome of PLT transfusion is also unpredictable. The recent Karlström et al. study on 40 patients with severe thrombocytopenia reported the effect of PLT transfusion by measuring PLT count at three time points: before transfusion, 1 h after transfusion, and 18–24 h after transfusion. One hour after transfusion, the mean PLT count increment was 14.6 × 10⁹/L and after 18–24 h, 7.1 × 10⁹/L. Interestingly, this study showed that the increment in PLT count was less than 7.5 × 10⁹/L in over one-third (35%) of the patients. In our study, only 18.8% of the transfused patients had a post-transfusion PLT count taken so the effect on PLT count cannot be robustly evaluated.

### Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors antidepressants and bleeding risk in breast cosmetic surgery [^116noQVV]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most common antidepressant prescribed currently. Data regarding SSRI use among plastic surgery patients may differ between different populations, but the incidence could be as high as 10%. It is known that SSRIs decrease platelet serotonin storage and platelet function, and their association with postsurgical bleeding in mastectomy patients and orthopedic surgery patients is well established. An increased risk of postsurgical bleeding among plastic surgery patients may have important clinical implications, but this has not been evaluated to date. The authors therefore conducted a hospital-based study with prospectively collected data to examine the association between the use of SSRIs and postsurgical bleeding. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of SSRIs on bleeding risk in the breast cosmetic surgery population.

Methods

All patients who underwent breast cosmetic plastic surgery procedures (breast augmentation, breast reduction, or mastopexy) at our institution between January of 2001 and December of 2011 were reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups by SSRI use history: a no-use group and an active-use group. The primary end point for a bleeding event was the need for intervention. Patients were further subcategorized by type of breast surgery performed, body mass index, and age. Descriptive statistics tabulated the frequency of a bleeding event within the groups. Logistic regression was applied to evaluate the risk of a bleeding event according to the use of SSRIs. The odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associating SSRI use with postoperative bleeding were computed.

Results

During the study period, 2,285 patients had breast cosmetic surgery, and 33 of these patients (1.44%) experienced a bleeding event (hematoma requiring surgical draining). Of the 196 patients (8.58%) in the active-use group, 9 (4.59%) experienced a bleeding event. Of the 2,089 patients in the no-use group, 24 (1.15%) presented with bleeding. The patients using SSRIs had a 4.14-fold greater risk of breast hematoma needing intervention than the patients who were not users (OR, 4; 95% CI, 1.90–9.04). Logistic regression also showed that bleeding events were more common among the SSRI users regardless of the type of procedure performed, the body mass index, or the age group.

Conclusions

Use of SSRIs is associated with a fourfold increased risk of bleeding after breast cosmetic surgery (from 1.44 to 4.59%). The decision of psychologically vulnerable patients to stop SSRIs before surgery should not be made without a complete discussion of the risks and benefits.

Recommendation 2 — platelet transfusions in hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia advises: "Avoid platelet transfusion in asymptomatic children at least 1 year of age with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia and a platelet count > 10 × 10⁹/μL unless an invasive procedure is planned". Evidence cited on the page states that "attainment of higher platelet transfusion thresholds (above 10 × 10⁹/μL) has not been associated with a decreased risk of bleeding". Safety considerations are highlighted: "Platelet transfusions, although usually well tolerated, can have significant adverse effects after multiple transfusions, thus exposing children to an increased risk for acute transfusion reactions, viral and bacterial infections, and platelet alloimmunization". Scope limits are specified: "the ASH-ASPHO recommendation is not intended to include children younger than 1 year of age… and is not relevant to patients with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia".

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^111BXhts]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Bleeding disorders in prospective rhinoplasty patients — history-taking, risk assessment, and testing — should be addressed by asking about coagulation disorders that may increase the risk of perioperative blood loss or a hypercoagulable state that may result in thrombotic events, and preoperative assessments should include discussion of excessive bruising, bleeding after small injuries, epistaxis, family history of bleeding disorders, bleeding after previous surgery, current anticoagulation medications, prior need for transfusion, platelet dysfunction/thrombocytopenia, and supplements that may affect bleeding, as well as previous deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and risk factors for increased thrombosis. Coordination of care with the patient's primary care physician or hematologist should be considered to manage bleeding disorders prior to choosing elective rhinoplasty, and routine preoperative laboratory screening (eg, coagulation testing) is not supported for elective surgery without additional risk factors.

### Autologous platelet gel in plastic surgery [^115QZpBp]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Autologous platelet gel is now being used in many surgical specialties. It is appropriate for use in plastic surgery procedures that entail a significant risk of hematoma, such as breast surgery, face lifts, nasal surgery, and skin grafting. Advantages include adhesive benefits, a reduction in risk of bleeding, and the added bonus of increased leukocyte concentration. (Aesthetic Surg J 2001;21:377–379.).

### Breast reconstruction free flap failure: does platelet count matter? [^116SQhCd]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Microvascular free tissue transfer is an increasingly popular modality for autologous tissue breast reconstruction. However, flap failure remains an ominous risk that continues to plague surgeons and patients even in the setting of meticulous surgical technique and monitoring. Venous and arterial thromboses are the leading causes of free flap failure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether thrombocytosis is associated with breast free flap failure.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted of breast reconstruction with free flaps in North America between 2015 and 2020 using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Patient comorbidities and preoperative laboratory tests were used to determine risk factors for free flap failure.

Results

During the study interval, 7522 female patients underwent breast reconstruction with free flaps, and flap failure occurred in 2.7% patients (n = 203). In multivariate regression analysis, breast free flap failure was significantly higher in patients smoking cigarettes within the past year (P = 0.030; AOR, 1.7) and dyspnea on moderate exertion or at rest (P = 0.025; AOR, 2.6). Furthermore, each 50 K/mcL elevation in platelet count was independently associated with an increased odds of flap failure (P < 0.001; AOR, 1.2). Patients experienced significantly higher rates of flap failure with platelet counts greater than 250 K/mcL (P = 0.004), which remained significant through progressively increasing thresholds up to 450 K/mcL.

Conclusions

Platelet count greater than 250 K/mcL is associated with progressively increasing risk of free flap failure in breast reconstruction. Future studies of personalized patient anticoagulation protocols based on hemostatic metrics may improve free flap survival after autologous tissue breast reconstruction.

### Thrombocytapheresis: managing essential thrombocythemia in a surgical patient [^113nGecs]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A 73-year-old man presented with acute chest pain and shortness of breath suggestive of unstable angina. A detailed investigation revealed essential thrombocythemia and coronary artery pathology. With a baseline platelet count of 2,650×10³/μL, coronary artery bypass grafting became nearly impossible. Three therapeutic plateletpheresis procedures successfully lowered the platelet count to 367×10³/μL. Thereafter, surgery was performed with no complications. Although a drop and rise in platelet counts were observed postoperatively, the patient could be discharged in stable condition after 14 days. Thus, therapeutic plateletpheresis reduces platelet count rapidly in essential thrombocythemia and relieves patients of acute symptoms.

### Platelet transfusion: 2025 AABB and ICTMG international clinical practice guidelines [^111jFzqe]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Platelet transfusion is a frequent procedure with benefits and risks.

Objective

To provide recommendations in adult and pediatric populations in whom platelet transfusions are commonly performed.

Evidence Review

Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was applied to findings from 21 randomized trials and 13 observational studies in contexts of limited randomized clinical trial data. Transfusion strategies using fewer (restrictive) vs greater (liberal) amounts of platelets were compared.

Findings

Evidence demonstrated that restrictive transfusion strategies probably did not cause increases in mortality or bleeding relative to liberal strategies across predefined clinical populations. Exceedingly low incidence of spinal hematoma was identified in patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing lumbar puncture. Because definitions of restrictive strategies varied across trials, recommendations reflect practical guidance. The following recommendations are strong recommendations with high/moderate-certainty evidence. For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding patients receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10×10³/μL. For consumptive thrombocytopenia in neonates without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 25×10³/μL. In patients undergoing lumbar puncture, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20×10³/μL. In patients with consumptive thrombocytopenia due to Dengue without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is not recommended. The following recommendations are conditional recommendations with low/very low-certainty evidence. For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding adults undergoing autologous stem cell transplant or with aplastic anemia, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not recommended. In adults with consumptive thrombocytopenia without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10×10³/μL. In adults undergoing central venous catheter placement in compressible anatomic sites, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10×10³/μL. In adults undergoing interventional radiology, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20×10³/μL for low-risk procedures and less than 50×10³/μL for high-risk procedures. For adults undergoing major nonneuraxial surgery, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 50×10³/μL. For patients without thrombocytopenia undergoing cardiovascular surgery in the absence of major hemorrhage, including those receiving cardiopulmonary bypass, platelet transfusion is not recommended. For nonoperative intracranial hemorrhage in adults with platelet count greater than 100×10³/μL, including those receiving antiplatelet agents, platelet transfusion is not recommended.

Conclusions and Relevance

A consistent pattern of evidence supports the implementation of restrictive platelet transfusion strategies. Restrictive strategies reduce risk of adverse reactions, mitigate platelet shortages, and reduce costs. It is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies in the decision to perform platelet transfusion.

### Prophylactic platelet transfusions prior to surgery for people with a low platelet count [^111XqUbn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

People with thrombocytopenia often require a surgical procedure. A low platelet count is a relative contraindication to surgery due to the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusions are used in clinical practice to prevent and treat bleeding in people with thrombocytopenia. Current practice in many countries is to correct thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions prior to surgery. Alternatives to platelet transfusion are also used prior surgery.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of prophylactic platelet transfusions prior to surgery for people with a low platelet count.

Search Methods

We searched the following major data bases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), PubMed (e-publications only), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the Transfusion Evidence Library and ongoing trial databases to 11 December 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non-RCTs and controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), that met Cochrane EPOC (Effective Practice and Organisation of Care) criteria, that involved the transfusion of platelets prior to surgery (any dose, at any time, single or multiple) in people with low platelet counts. We excluded studies on people with a low platelet count who were actively bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for data collection. We were only able to combine data for two outcomes and we presented the rest of the findings in a narrative form.

Main Results

We identified five RCTs, all conducted in adults; there were no eligible non-randomised studies. Three completed trials enrolled 180 adults and two ongoing trials aim to include 627 participants. The completed trials were conducted between 2005 and 2009. The two ongoing trials are scheduled to complete recruitment by October 2019. One trial compared prophylactic platelet transfusions to no transfusion in people with thrombocytopenia in an intensive care unit (ICU). Two small trials, 108 participants, compared prophylactic platelet transfusions to other alternative treatments in people with liver disease. One trial compared desmopressin to fresh frozen plasma or one unit of platelet transfusion or both prior to surgery. The second trial compared platelet transfusion prior to surgery with two types of thrombopoietin mimetics: romiplostim and eltrombopag. None of the included trials were free from methodological bias. No included trials compared different platelet count thresholds for administering a prophylactic platelet transfusion prior to surgery. None of the included trials reported on all the review outcomes and the overall quality per reported outcome was very low. None of the three completed trials reported: all-cause mortality at 90 days post surgery; mortality secondary to bleeding, thromboembolism or infection; number of red cell or platelet transfusions per participant; length of hospital stay; or quality of life. None of the trials included children or people who needed major surgery or emergency surgical procedures. Platelet transfusion versus no platelet transfusion (1 trial, 72 participants)We were very uncertain whether giving a platelet transfusion prior to surgery had any effect on all-cause mortality within 30 days (1 trial, 72 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 1.45; very-low quality evidence). We were very uncertain whether giving a platelet transfusion prior to surgery had any effect on the risk of major (1 trial, 64 participants; RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.29 to 8.92; very low-quality evidence), or minor bleeding (1 trial, 64 participants; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.85; very-low quality evidence). No serious adverse events occurred in either study arm (1 trial, 72 participants, very low-quality evidence). Platelet transfusion versus alternative to platelet transfusion (2 trials, 108 participants)We were very uncertain whether giving a platelet transfusion prior to surgery compared to an alternative has any effect on the risk of major (2 trials, 108 participants; no events; very low-quality evidence), or minor bleeding (desmopressin: 1 trial, 36 participants; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.23; very-low quality evidence: thrombopoietin mimetics: 1 trial, 65 participants; no events; very-low quality evidence). We were very uncertain whether there was a difference in transfusion-related adverse effects between the platelet transfused group and the alternative treatment group (desmopressin: 1 trial, 36 participants; RR 2.70, 95% CI 0.12 to 62.17; very-low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Findings of this review were based on three small trials involving minor surgery in adults with thrombocytopenia. We found insufficient evidence to recommend the administration of preprocedure prophylactic platelet transfusions in this situation with a lack of evidence that transfusion resulted in a reduction in postoperative bleeding or all-cause mortality. The small number of trials meeting the inclusion criteria and the limitation in reported outcomes across the trials precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes. Further adequately powered trials, in people of all ages, of prophylactic platelet transfusions compared with no transfusion, other alternative treatments, and considering different platelet thresholds prior to planned and emergency surgical procedures are required. Future trials should include major surgery and report on bleeding, adverse effects, mortality (as a long-term outcome) after surgery, duration of hospital stay and quality of life measures.

### How I use platelet transfusions [^115kpcev]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Platelet transfusions are commonly administered for the prevention or treatment of bleeding in patients with acquired thrombocytopenia across a range of clinical contexts. Recent data, including randomized trials, have highlighted uncertainties in the risk-benefit balance of this therapy, which is the subject of this review. Hemovigilance systems report that platelets are the most frequently implicated component in transfusion reactions. There is considerable variation in platelet count increment after platelet transfusion, and limited evidence of efficacy for clinical outcomes, including prevention of bleeding. Bleeding events commonly occur despite the different policies for platelet transfusion prophylaxis. The underlying mechanisms of harm reported in randomized trials may be related to the role of platelets beyond hemostasis, including mediating inflammation. Research supports the implementation of a restrictive platelet transfusion policy. Research is needed to better understand the impact of platelet donation characteristics on outcomes, and to determine the optimal thresholds for platelet transfusion before invasive procedures or major surgery (eg, laparotomy). Platelet transfusion policies should move toward a risk-adapted approach that does not focus solely on platelet count.

CONCLUSIONS

The authors present a large, combined literature and chart review of microsurgical breast reconstruction in patients with disorders of hemostasis. Patients should be screened for increased risk of thrombosis or bleeding before undergoing microsurgical breast reconstruction, and a positive screening should prompt a complete hematologic evaluation. Awareness of disorders of hemostasis and interdisciplinary perioperative management with a hematologist are essential to ensure optimal reconstructive results.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy — anticoagulation and platelet thresholds: Before proceeding with CAR T cell therapy, patients on therapeutic anticoagulants should be switched from long-acting to short-acting formulations, where ever possible, because long-acting anticoagulants can significantly potentiate bleeding risk during CRS. For patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy, if platelet counts drop below 100,000/μL, dual-acting anticoagulants should be discontinued; if platelet counts drop below 50,000/μL, all anticoagulants should be discontinued unless a patient has a recent thrombosis. In patients with platelet counts below 50,000/μL and a recent thrombosis, anticoagulants may be continued, but the dose should be reduced or platelet transfusions should be administered.

### Evidence review: periprocedural use of blood products [^111FgHVC]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Blood product transfusion has not been subject to rigorous clinical study, and great practice variations exist. Of particular concern to hospitalists is the use of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets prior to invasive procedures to correct anemia or perceived bleeding risk. We summarize the known risks associated with periprocedural anemia, prolonged international normalized ratio (INR), and thrombocytopenia, as well as the effects of blood product administration on clinical outcomes. Clinical trial evidence argues for a restrictive red blood cell transfusion threshold (a hemoglobin level of 7–8 g/dL or symptomatic anemia) for most perioperative patients. There are no high-quality data to guide plasma and platelet transfusions around the time of procedures. Available data do not support the use of prothrombin time/INR to guide prophylactic administration of plasma, and there are scarce data to guide platelet use around the time of an invasive procedure. Therefore, we rely on current consensus expert opinion, which recommends administration of plasma in moderate- to high-risk procedures when INR is > 1.5. We recommend platelet transfusion in low-risk procedures when platelet count is < 20,000/μL, for average-risk procedures when platelet count is < 50,000/μL, and for procedures involving the central nervous system when the platelet count is < 100,000/μL.

### Getting the most out of augmentation-mastopexy [^113JF7Z2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After reviewing the article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the tenets of proper patient selection. 2. Be familiar with the assessment of patients for augmentation-mastopexy. 3. Be able to plan an operative approach and execute the critical steps. 4. Be able to recognize common complications and have a basic understanding of their management. 5. Be aware of emerging adjunctive techniques and technologies with respect to augmentation-mastopexy.

Summary

Despite being a multivariable and complex procedure, augmentation-mastopexy remains a central and pivotal component of the treatment algorithm for ptotic and deflated breasts among plastic surgeons. Careful preoperative planning, combined with proper selection of approach and implant, can lead to success. Physicians need to understand that there is a high frequency of reoperation cited in the literature with regard to this procedure, and discussions before the initial operation can help alleviate common misunderstandings and challenges inherent in this operation.

### Postoperative bleeding after dentoalveolar surgery in patients with thrombocytopenia-are prophylactic platelet transfusions necessary? [^116uQZMW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Several conditions can affect the number of platelets (PLT) in the blood, including hematological malignancies and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. PLTs are important for primary hemostasis, and a reduced PLT count could result in prolonged bleeding time at the site of injury. Thrombocytopenia is commonly defined as a PLT count of < 150 × 10⁹/L. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Guiding Document "Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)" recommends four grades of severity for thrombocytopenia.

Few studies have been published on the management of dentoalveolar surgery in patients with thrombocytopenia. Varying guidelines and recommendations have been proposed internationally. Many state that prophylactic PLT transfusions should be administered before dentoalveolar surgery if patients have a PLT count of < 50 × 10⁹/L. This threshold has been used in dental procedures; it is an extrapolation from surgical guidelines and lacks solid scientific support.

Because PLT transfusions are expensive and not without risk, it is important to evaluate whether they are needed and should be used before dentoalveolar surgery. Units of PLT are in high demand in hospital settings and their use should not be unnecessarily squandered.

Earlier studies and reviews in dentoalveolar surgery have observed no significant difference in the incidence of POB between patients who have received prophylactic PLT transfusions and those who have not. The PLT count threshold for inclusion in previous studies has generally been < 100 × 10⁹ /L, and medications that could affect hemostasis have not always been excluded.

Thus, this study retrospectively evaluated POB complications in patients with a PLT count of ≤ 75 × 10⁹/L prior to dentoalveolar surgery and had received no other anticoagulant medication that would affect hemostasis, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The primary aim was to evaluate differences in POB frequency among patients who had received prophylactic PLT transfusion and those who had not. The secondary aim was to evaluate differences and independent risks between the POB group and the non-postoperative bleeding (NPOB) group regarding hematological diagnosis, dental diagnosis, CTCAE grade, type of dentoalveolar surgery, and use of local hemostatic treatment.

### Completely autologous platelet gel in breast reduction surgery: a blinded, randomized, controlled trial [^115kDCmP]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of topical application of completely autologous platelet gel during breast surgery to reduce postoperative wound drainage. An increasing number of surgical centers are using tissue sealants to reduce postoperative drainage and improve surgical outcomes. However, there is a paucity of randomized, double-blind, controlled trials assessing the efficacy of these agents.

Methods

The authors conducted a within-patient, randomized, patient- and assessor-blinded, controlled trial assessing the use of completely autologous platelet gel in 111 patients undergoing bilateral reduction mammaplasty. Patients were randomized to receive the gel applied to the left or right breast after hemostasis was achieved; the other breast received no treatment. The primary outcome was the difference in wound drainage over 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included subjective and objective assessments of pain and wound healing.

Results

No statistically significant differences in the drainage, level of pain, size of open areas, clinical appearance, degree of scar pliability, or scar erythema were noted.

Conclusion

The authors' results do not support the use of completely autologous platelet gel to improve outcomes after reduction mammaplasty.

### Reevaluating thrombocytosis as a risk factor in free flap surgery: does timing matter? [^114WErkU]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 400,000, has been implicated as a risk factor in free flap failure. Despite proposed mechanisms of pedicle thrombosis, recent studies have suggested that thrombocytosis has no effect on free tissue transfer viability. Risk factors that may compromise successful free tissue transfer should be understood and elucidated, with particular attention to thrombocytosis and its conflicting evidence in the literature. We hypothesize that thrombocytosis has no bearing on free flap success or the rates of pedicle thrombosis.

Methods

Our institution performed a retrospective chart review on all patients who underwent free flap reconstruction over the past 6 years. Patient demographics, medical history, type and location of free tissue transfer, preoperative platelets, postoperative platelets, and flap outcomes and complications (wound dehiscence, infection, hematoma, seroma, and need for blood transfusion) were recorded. Independent t test, Mann-Whitney U tests, χ2 test, and Fisher exact tests were used to determine P values to compare flap outcomes in patients with thrombocytosis (platelet count > 400,000) and those with platelet counts less than 400,000.

Results

In our 502-patient cohort, 71 were found to have a platelet count > 400,000 (35 preoperatively and 36 postoperatively) and 431 patients had platelet counts < 400,000. There were 42 reconstructive failures (flap success rate of 91.6%) and 111 returns to the operating room (OR). For patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, 24 flaps returned to the OR (44.4%), whereas in patients without thrombocytosis, 87 flaps returned to the OR (19.4%; P < 0.001). In patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, 10 OR returns were due to pedicle venous thrombosis (18.5%), in comparison to 10 returns for venous thrombosis in those with normal platelets (2.2%; P < 0.001). There was a small difference in free flap success rates between those with postoperative thrombocytosis and normal platelets, 88.7% versus 92.11%; however, this was not statistically significant (P = 0.71). The thrombocytosis group had a higher incidence of overall postoperative complications (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Thrombocytosis has historically been cited as a risk factor for free flap reconstruction failure with recent conflicting evidence in the literature. In patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, we found an increased risk of venous thrombosis; however, this did not result in increased flap failure. There was an increase in postoperative complications, which corresponds with National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data reported in the literature. We suspect that thrombocytosis is not a harbinger of free flap failure but rather a marker for overall inflammation, which may confer a higher rate of venous thrombosis requiring reoperation and postoperative complications.

Perioperative transfusion — platelet criteria: Platelet transfusion may be indicated despite an apparently adequate platelet count or in the absence of a platelet count if there is known or suspected platelet dysfunction. In surgical or obstetric patients, platelet transfusion is rarely indicated if the platelet count is known to be greater than 100 × 10⁹/L and is usually indicated when the count is less than 50 × 10⁹/L in the presence of excessive bleeding.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^113C8ws9]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Should we treat iron deficiency without anaemia?

A normal haemoglobin level does not exclude iron deficiency. In fact, the WHO recognises that 'mild' anaemia (haemoglobin 110–119/129 g.l −1) is a misnomer, as iron deficiency is already advanced by the time anaemia is detected, and has consequences even when anaemia is not clinically apparent 18.

Non‐anaemic patients with reduced or absent iron stores may have symptoms such as fatigue or reduced exercise tolerance, as iron is required for optimal mitochondrial function, and is essential for respiration and energy production 40, 74. Current guidelines do not recommend routine iron screening in the absence of anaemia. However, the benefits of oral or i.v. iron replacement for non‐anaemic iron deficiency‐associated fatigue have been demonstrated in menstruating women, runners and blood donors 75, 76, 77, 78.

In congestive heart failure, a frequent comorbidity among surgical patients, non‐anaemic iron deficiency was independently associated with compromised physical performance and quality of life, and an increase in all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality; treatment of non‐anaemic iron deficiency with i.v. iron may improve functional status within four weeks, and reduces hospitalisations for cardiovascular reasons and mortality 79, 80. In addition, improvements are maintained after 24 and 52 weeks 79, 80, 81.

In observational studies of patients undergoing abdominal or cardiac surgery, pre‐operative non‐anaemic iron deficiency was associated with poor outcomes, including: increased rates of postoperative infection; transfusion; fatigue; and prolonged hospital stay 82, 83, 84. Although it is presently unknown whether pre‐operative correction of non‐anaemic iron deficiency may offset the excess of risk of postoperative complications, some guidelines recommend peri‐operative iron supplementation for patients with non‐anaemic iron deficiency 14, 85.

Secondary thrombocytosis can also be seen after major surgery, as platelets behave as an acute phase reactant. Iron deficiency has also been shown to induce secondary thrombocytosis in several clinical settings. Correction of iron deficiency usually lowers platelet count and platelet activation in patients with chronic kidney disease, cancer or inflammatory bowel disease‐associated secondary thrombocytosis, and may contribute to reduced risk of thrombo embolic events 86, 87, 88, 89.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^115dVSvN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE FOR THE PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF HEMORRHAGIC DISORDERS

Bleeding assessment tools for the standardization and interpretation of a bleeding history offer a complete and structured interview, but their diagnostic value for the detection of a mild bleeding disorder is limited. In contrast, laboratory screening alone cannot cover all clinically relevant hemorrhagic disorders, and specific laboratory analysis to exclude these disorders in all patients is not cost-effective. We have developed an approach that combines a standardized questionnaire, clinical examination, and laboratory screening (Fig. 1). The bleeding score was established by 10 experienced clinical hematologists. (See Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2, which shows the standardized questionnaire to determine a bleeding tendency,.) Arbitrary scores were assigned to the various bleeding symptoms. If there was a high probability of an association between a bleeding symptom and a hemorrhagic diathesis, the scores were higher than if the probability was lower. For example, increased bleeding after tooth extraction was assigned a higher score than frequent nosebleeds. In contrast to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool, there was no differentiation of the bleeding symptoms into different degrees of severity. An overall score greater than 3 indicates an elevated bleeding risk and that, after careful reexamination of the patient's history, a hematology consultation is warranted. This bleeding score was predictive of bleeding in a clinical cohort study on cardiac surgery patients. The hematologist will also be involved if basic laboratory tests including complete blood cell count, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen are abnormal. In the event of a suspicious history or suspicious screening tests, further laboratory analyses are required to exclude a hemostatic disorder. Except for vasculopathies, almost all clinically relevant hemorrhagic disorders can be excluded or detected: thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, coagulopathies including factor XIII deficiency, low von Willebrand factor levels or von Willebrand disease, and hyperfibrinolysis. For the drugs frequently used in patients with microsurgical breast reconstruction, it should be known whether they can cause platelet dysfunction. Our perioperative management strategy is outlined. (See Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3, which shows hemorrhagic disorders and appropriate perioperative management in microsurgical breast reconstruction,.)

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^115gCgEX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Recommendations — procedure-related platelet management in cirrhosis state that we do not recommend prophylactic platelet transfusions before common procedures such as routine variceal banding or paracentesis outside of significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl) or sepsis. Existing data suggest there is a somewhat tenuous relationship between bleeding risk and platelet count. In vitro studies demonstrate adequate thrombin production with platelet levels ≥ 50,000/mL. Infusion of a single adult platelet dose does not improve thrombin generation. Higher platelet levels may be more appropriate for higher risk procedures such as removal of large polyps and major surgery, but will probably require higher doses of platelet infusions; if the procedure is elective, the use of TPO agonists may be more appropriate (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

### Dental extraction in the thrombocytopenic patient is safe and complications are easily managed [^117Wr9ZT]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To characterize bleeding risk and management of bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients undergoing dental extraction.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 68 patients with hematologic disease and concomitant thrombocytopenia undergoing dental extractions. The inclusion criterion was a platelet count of 100,000/μL or less at the time of consultation or extraction. Patients using anticoagulation therapy were excluded from the study. Predictors measured were age, gender, platelet count, platelet transfusion before or during surgery, local hemostatic measurements at the time of surgery (absorbable hemostat or antifibrinolytic rinse), number of teeth extracted, diagnosis, and extraction type. The primary outcome was postoperative bleeding requiring intervention. A secondary outcome was surgical site infection. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed and the P value was set at .05. No logistic regression was used based on the distribution of outcomes.

Results

Sixty-eight patients underwent extraction of 200 teeth. Five (7.4%) had postoperative bleeding that was always controlled with routine intervention. Mean platelet count was 44,647/μL. Bleeding was more frequent with lower platelet levels (P = 0.048). Thirty-two patients received platelet transfusion and 26 received local measures. Platelet transfusion and local hemostatic measures had no effect on bleeding outcomes.

Conclusion

Surgical and routine extractions are safe procedures in patients with thrombocytopenia, and postoperative bleeding is typically well handled with simple local measures. The benefits of pre- or intraoperative platelet transfusion are unclear in this population. Likewise, the benefit of prophylactic local hemostatic measures is unclear and should be based on the surgeon's discretion and experience.

### Lobectomy for lung cancer in a myelodysplastic syndrome patient with decreasing platelet aggregation: report of a case [^114e4Avp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Platelet aggregometry assesses the aggregation of platelets in response to various platelet activators (ADP, collagen, epinephrine, ristocetin). In our case, epinephrine-, ADP-, and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was strongly decreased. Most reports could not correlate any type of defective platelet aggregation with clinical bleeding. In general, bleeding time assessment is poorly reproducible and insensitive. Our patient did not manifest bleeding at the time of cardiac catheterization and arterial blood gas testing, but did bleed during surgery. To the best of our knowledge, no reports have been published on surgery for MDS patients with defective platelet aggregation. When we perform surgery on an MDS patient with defective platelet aggregation, we should take into consideration a possible bleeding event regardless of a normal platelet count and bleeding time.

Platelet transfusion is commonly considered for patients who undergo major surgery with a platelet count of 50,000/μL or less; and besides, prophylactic use of platelet transfusions for decreasing platelet aggregation is not indicated. We can not predict how much platelet function agglutination ability will decline and how difficult it will be to stop bleeding during surgery. In this case, just before the chest was closed, oozing from the wide range of intercostal muscles was observed, and hemostasis by the energy device was unable to stop the bleeding. Therefore, we judged that coagulation factor was consumed during surgery and we could stop bleeding after platelet transfusion. Our patient underwent surgery with platelet units ordered, but it was not administered from the start of surgery. Because platelets were consumed during surgery and the half-life of platelets was short, it was thought that administration from the beginning was not efficient. We demonstrated that the preoperative request of platelet preparations might be desirable for an MDS patient with defective platelet aggregation, even if the platelet count and bleeding time are normal.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^115wm2Gc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The AABB (formerly, the American Association of Blood Banks) developed this guideline on appropriate use of platelet transfusion in adult patients.

Methods

These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized, clinical trials and observational studies (1900 to September 2014) that reported clinical outcomes on patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic platelet transfusions. An expert panel reviewed the data and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

Recommendation 1

The AABB recommends that platelets should be transfused prophylactically to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding in hospitalized adult patients with therapy-induced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. The AABB recommends transfusing hospitalized adult patients with a platelet count of 10 × 109 cells/L or less to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding. The AABB recommends transfusing up to a single apheresis unit or equivalent. Greater doses are not more effective, and lower doses equal to one half of a standard apheresis unit are equally effective. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 109 cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 × 109 cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having major elective nonneuraxial surgery with a platelet count less than 50 × 109 cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 5

The AABB recommends against routine prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients who are nonthrombocytopenic and have cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The AABB suggests platelet transfusion for patients having bypass who exhibit perioperative bleeding with thrombocytopenia and/or evidence of platelet dysfunction. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 6

The AABB cannot recommend for or against platelet transfusion for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy who have intracranial hemorrhage (traumatic or spontaneous). (Grade: uncertain recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

### Adverse reactions to drugs and biologics in patients with clonal mast cell disorders: a Work group report of the mast cells disorder committee, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^112RVGP3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Perioperative prophylactic antimediator therapy in mastocytosis — there is no true consensus, and its utility has not been evaluated in placebo‑controlled trials. Some authors recommend maintaining regularly scheduled antimediator therapy before surgery and postoperatively, and others strongly recommend prophylaxis before every anesthetic procedure based on a retrospective series managing 459 adults and 42 children who underwent 676 and 30 anesthetic procedures, respectively. The report notes insufficient evidence to recommend obligatory premedication for every patient; however, premedication is recommended by the authors for patients with previous perioperative anaphylaxis if the culprit agent is unknown. A cautious approach is to choose drugs with low capacity to elicit mast cell (MC) degranulation and those previously tolerated by the individual patient, though this strategy has not been scientifically investigated.

### Tamoxifen citrate [^1118EYeR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General:

Decreases in platelet counts, usually to 50,000 to 100,000/mm³, infrequently lower, have been occasionally reported in patients taking tamoxifen for breast cancer. In patients with significant thrombocytopenia, rare hemorrhagic episodes have occurred, but it is uncertain if these episodes are due to tamoxifen therapy. Leukopenia has been observed, sometimes in association with anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. There have been rare reports of neutropenia and pancytopenia in patients receiving tamoxifen; this can sometimes be severe.

In the NSABP P-1 trial, 6 women on tamoxifen citrate and 2 on placebo experienced grade 3 to 4 drops in platelet counts (≤ 50,000/mm³).

Information for Patients:

Patients should be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when tamoxifen citrate is dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Reduction in Invasive Breast Cancer and DCIS in Women with DCIS: Women with DCIS treated with lumpectomy and radiation therapy who are considering tamoxifen to reduce the incidence of a second breast cancer event should assess the risks and benefits of therapy, since treatment with tamoxifen decreased the incidence of invasive breast cancer, but has not been shown to affect survival (see Table 1 in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Reduction in Breast Cancer Incidence in High Risk Women: Women who are at high risk for breast cancer can consider taking tamoxifen therapy to reduce the incidence of breast cancer. Whether the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the risks depends on a woman's personal health history and on how she weighs the benefits and risks. Tamoxifen therapy to reduce the incidence of breast cancer may therefore not be appropriate for all women at high risk for breast cancer. Women who are considering tamoxifen therapy should consult their health care professional for an assessment of the potential benefits and risks prior to starting therapy for reduction in breast cancer incidence (see Table 3 in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Women should understand that tamoxifen reduces the incidence of breast cancer, but may not eliminate risk. Tamoxifen decreased the incidence of small estrogen receptor positive tumors, but did not alter the incidence of estrogen receptor negative tumors or larger tumors. In women with breast cancer who are at high risk of developing a second breast cancer, treatment with about 5 years of tamoxifen reduced the annual incidence rate of a second breast cancer by approximately 50%.

### Does prior breast irradiation increase complications of subsequent reduction surgery in breast cancer patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1121pJsu]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Complications

The surgical techniques employed for reduction mammoplasty or mastopexy have been reported to affect the occurrence of post-surgical complications. In a case series by Katie et al. a similar rate of complications was found in IB and NIB after reduction. The authors concluded that this was attributed to the surgical technique employed, i.e. central mound with minimal elevation of skin/devascularisation. Thus, the authors suggested that the central mound technique is reliable for the reduction mammoplasty or mastopexy for asymmetry/macromastia after radiation. Interestingly, in this review, two studies did not find any significant difference in post-radiation complication rates between IB and NIB.

The result of this meta-analysis indicates that the risk of minor complications post-reduction mammoplasty in the irradiated breast were more common. In a cohort of 188 patients, 51 complications were recorded in the IB and 6 in the NIB. Major complications included nipple–areola complex loss, fat necrosis requiring debridement, skin necrosis, haematoma and infections requiring debridement and drainage.

Due to the inherent risk of post-operative complications in irradiated tissue, attempts have been made to reduce these complications through prophylactic treatment. Perioperative antibiotics have been used to combat infections after breast reduction surgery. Nevertheless, it is not recommended to administer antibiotics as prolonged prophylactic treatment due to resistance issues and lack of evidence. Decreased vascularisation in irradiated breast tissue has a role in complication occurrence, and a vasoactive agent, buflomedil, has been administered to patients intravenously and then per oral for 14 days to prevent complication. However, further studies are required in this regard as this was the only study that reported the use of buflomedil in a patient undergoing breast reduction surgery.

In another study, pre- and post-operative adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy was given to the patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty or mastopexy after BCT. Apart from delayed wound healing in two irradiated and non-irradiated breasts, no other complications were reported. But the clinical use of this technique is limited owing to chamber accessibility. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy might help to reduce the risk of complications by increasing angiogenesis and vascularisation. This topic has been previously considered in a systematic review and meta-analysis by Lorentzen et al. 2021. The study concluded that reduction mammoplasty or mastopexy in the previously irradiated breast was associated with a significantly increased risk of complications, a finding that was consistent with our results.

Some patients had hemorrhagic conditions with increased risk of bleeding and compromised flap perfusion. Three patients had thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction. One patient had an uneventful reconstruction, and another developed a hematoma that needed exploration. The third patient unfortunately had total flap loss secondary to a hematoma, followed by arterial thrombosis on the right side. She underwent standard arterial thrombectomy and repeated anastomoses to the internal mammary vessels. However, the flap was not salvageable. Two patients had von Willebrand disease or low von Willebrand factor levels, and both underwent successful reconstruction without complications.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^111X3iwF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The management of bleeding ARV can be very challenging and essentially includes prompt resuscitation and correction of coagulopathy, immediate workup to localize the site/source of bleeding and then the application of a suitable treatment modality or immediate transfer to a tertiary referral center. Management options may vary with a combination of local/endoscopic, medical, radiological, and surgical methods available. In mild cases, intravenous fluid replacement, blood transfusion, correction of coagulopathy, and optimal medication for portal hypertension are usually effective.

Initial resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization are critical and patients' conditions should be optimized before endoscopic intervention. The management of comorbid conditions, including the appropriate management of anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants, requires a multidisciplinary and individualized approach.

The intravascular volume repletion is done with crystalloids and packed red blood cells. The targets of resuscitation are the restoration of hemodynamic status but avoiding over-expansion, which may exacerbate portal pressure, impair clot formation, and increase the risk of further bleeding. In fact, a certain degree of hypovolemia and hypotension promotes activation of endogenous vasoactive systems, leading to splanchnic vasoconstriction and, therefore, reducing portal blood flow and pressure. A recent randomized controlled trial showed that a restrictive packed red blood cell transfusion strategy improves survival in Child–Pugh A and B patients. The results of this study showed that patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding should be transfused when hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dl, aiming at a target level of 7–9 g/dl. Other risks related to blood product utilization are immunologic (transfusion-related lung injury and development of HLA antibodies) and can impact subsequent transplantation or impair the ability to receive further transfusions. A recent guideline from the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee suggests the following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding in advanced liver disease: hematocrit > 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dl. Exceptions to this restrictive strategy are massive bleeding, which should prompt the activation of a dedicated transfusional protocol, cardiovascular comorbidities, and any other condition that precludes adequate physiological response to acute anemia. It is important to keep in mind that an acute hypotension may decrease hepatic perfusion, which in the setting of underlying chronic liver disease can exacerbate liver injury. A helpful maneuver to slow down the bleeding rate could be the endorectal placement of a compression tube (i.e. Sengstaken-Blakemore Tube or a Linton-Nachlas balloon compression tube) held under moderate traction: this device should be left in place until the patient is sufficiently stabilized or until the patient is transferred to a center with available expertise. The placement of balloon tamponade can also give additional time to correctly study the patients with CT scans or other imaging techniques, thus enabling to tailor the management strategy to the anatomy of the bleeding vessel. Eventually, rebleeding is almost universal if another modality of treatment is not instituted.

### Is it safe to combine abdominoplasty with elective breast surgery? A review of 151 consecutive cases [^11752QSb]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

This study was designed to evaluate and compare the complication rates of patients having abdominoplasty without breast surgery with the rates of those having abdominoplasty with various types of elective breast surgery, including breast augmentation, breast reduction, mastopexy, and mastopexy combined with simultaneous augmentation.

Methods

The data collected represent a retrospective chart review of consecutive abdominoplasty procedures performed at a single outpatient facility by the senior surgeon (W.G.S.) over a 15-year period (1989 to 2004). Two groups were compared: patients who underwent abdominoplasty without breast surgery and those who had abdominoplasty with breast surgery. The second group was subdivided by the various types of breast procedures noted above. The minor complications assessed included seromas, hematomas, infections, and small (< 5 cm) wound breakdowns. Major complications evaluated included large (> 5 cm) flap necrosis, need for blood transfusion, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, and death. Additional data compiled included age, sex, tobacco use, body mass index, past medical history, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status level, and operative times.

Results

Of the 415 abdominoplasty procedures, 264 (group 1) did not include simultaneous breast surgery. One hundred fifty-one procedures (group 2) involved simultaneous breast surgery, representing 36 percent of the total. Group 2 was further subdivided into those who had breast augmentation surgery (group 2A, n = 50), those who had breast reduction surgery (group 2B, n = 31), those who had mastopexy surgery (group 2C, n = 28), and those who had simultaneous mastopexy and breast augmentation surgery (group 2D, n = 42). Removal and replacement of implants and capsulectomy/capsulotomy procedures were included in the augmentation group (group 2A). There were no major complications, including flap necrosis (open wound > 5 cm), blood transfusions, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, or death. No patients required hospitalization. No statistically significant associations with complications were noted between groups 1 and 2 (chi-square, 0.0045; p > 0.95, not significant). Furthermore, when subdivided by type of breast surgery, no statistically significant associations were noted among subgroups: group 1 versus 2A (chi-square, 0.96; p > 0.05, not significant), group 1 versus 2B (chi-square, 0.032; p > 0.9, not significant), group 1 versus 2C (chi-square, 0.003; p > 0.975, not significant), and group 1 versus 2D (chi-square, 0.83; p > 0.5, not significant).

Conclusion

The results of this retrospective review indicate that combining elective breast surgery with abdominoplasty does not appear to significantly increase the number of major or minor complications.

### How does thrombocytopenia affect outcomes in head and neck cancer surgery with free flap reconstruction? [^111otLLM]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombocytopenia is associated with a variety of medical comorbidities seen in patients with head and neck cancer. However, it remains unclear if and how thrombocytopenia affects surgical outcomes.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to measure the association between thrombocytopenia and 30-day adverse outcomes in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery with free flap reconstruction.

Study Design, Setting Sample

This was a retrospective cohort study using the 2012 to 2022 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program databases. Patients undergoing resection and free flap reconstruction for malignant pathology of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and salivary glands were included. Patients undergoing emergency surgery or with missing outcomes data were excluded.

Predictor/Exposure/Independent Variable

The predictor variable was platelet count coded as a binary variable: < 150k/μL (thrombocytopenia) or > 150k/μL.

Main Outcome Variable

The primary outcome variable was return to the operating room for free flap salvage or hematoma evacuation coded based on International Classification of Diseases diagnoses.

Covariates

Covariates were categorized into demographic (age, sex), medical (hypertension, diabetes), and perioperative (concurrent procedures, reconstructive modality).

Analyses

Descriptive, bivariate, and bootstrapped multiple logistic regression statistics were performed to evaluate the association between thrombocytopenia and adverse outcomes. Youden J analysis was used to identify a platelet value at which complications were more likely to occur. An alpha of P < .05 was significant.

Results

A total of 4,993 subjects met the inclusion criteria. There were 281 subjects with thrombocytopenia (5.63%) and 213 who underwent reoperations (4.30%). In bivariate analysis, thrombocytopenia was the only significant risk factor for reoperation, and these subjects were 1.74 times more likely to return to the operating room (P = 0.015, relative risk = 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.71). In multivariate analysis adjusting for study covariates, thrombocytopenia was independently associated with 1.82 times greater odds of return to the operating room (P = 0.026, OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.26). Cut point analysis suggested that a platelet value less than 136,000/μL was a risk factor for return to the operating room.

Conclusions and Relevance

Thrombocytopenia was independently associated with return to the operating room following ablative head and neck cancer procedures with free flap reconstruction.

### Microsurgical breast reconstruction in patients with disorders of hemostasis: perioperative risks and management [^115mJBTn]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Our indications for thrombophilia screening are based on clinical data, the patient's medical history, including family history recorded on a standardized questionnaire, and on the recommendations of an international expert committee., (See Document, Supplemental Digital Content 1, which shows the exemplary screening questionnaire for thromboembolism,.) A hematologist was involved when thrombophilia screening was indicated based on the patient's history, and when the corresponding laboratory screening had to be arranged and interpreted. One earlier study had shown that multidisciplinary care and management involving a hematologist in hypercoagulable patients had a positive correlation with improved flap outcomes, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.064).

Many study groups limit thrombophilia screening to factor V Leiden mutation; prothrombin mutation G20210A; the inhibitors antithrombin, protein C, and protein S; and possibly to the autoantibodies to detect antiphospholipid syndrome. This approach ignores several clinically relevant thrombophilic conditions that, especially in combination, may substantially increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. The prevalence of factor V Leiden; prothrombin mutation G20210A; antithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiency in the general population is low; whereas increased factor VIII levels, hyperhomocysteinemia, increased lipoprotein(a), and sticky platelet syndrome are relatively common (Table 1). – Our complete thrombophilia screening includes factor V Leiden; prothrombin mutation G20210A; antithrombin; protein C; protein S; protein Z; clottable and total fibrinogen; levels of factors VIII, IX, and XI; homocysteine; lipoprotein(a); sticky platelet syndrome; and antiphospholipid syndrome screening consisting of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin and anti–β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) antibodies types immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M (Fig. 1). The quality of thrombophilia screening depends crucially on several conditions, to which we strictly adhered, but which have been insufficiently considered in many studies or not at all. Except for the molecular genetic analysis of factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation G20210A, the assays have extremely different sensitivities and specificities for the detection of a respective deficiency, and different demands on preanalytical conditions. The prevalence of a thrombophilic condition also depends on the choice of the correct reference range. A positive result must be checked against a second examination at another point in time. If a reduced antithrombin, protein C, or protein S level is confirmed, molecular genetic analysis of the corresponding gene must be carried out to identify whether a mutation is present.

Obtaining optimum breast aesthetics can be challenging in secondary aesthetic breast surgery, particularly with poor-quality skin, when downsizing implants, and in cases where patients will not accept additional mastopexy scars. Most techniques described in these cases rely on internal suturing and capsulorrhaphy, which can lack precision in tailoring the skin over the internal pocket.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to present the authors' experience with utilizing the hemostatic net to help address a range of challenging breast cases in their practices.

Methods

A multicentre retrospective analysis of patients undergoing aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery between 2019 and 2021 was conducted. A database was established to record patient demographics, indications for surgery, surgical technique, and complications. Following capsulorrhaphy, the hemostatic net was applied in as many rows as required with monofilament sutures and removed 3 to 7 days postoperatively.

Results

Twenty-four women (aged 23–67 years) underwent aesthetic or reconstructive breast surgery with the hemostatic net. This approach optimized stabilization of the inframammary fold and redraping of lax skin or irregularities in the skin envelope. At follow-up review, only 1 instance of the net failing to successfully redrape the skin was seen.

Conclusions

The application of the hemostatic net is an option for patients who might otherwise require mastopexy but refuse to accept the scars. The technique has now been extended to primary cases where implant malposition or skin tailoring issues are anticipated, thus securing its place as a part of the surgical armamentarium.

Platelets in cirrhosis — thrombopoietin receptor agonists show that TPO-receptor agonists (eltrombopag, lusutrombopag, and avatrombopag) have demonstrated to effectively stimulate thrombopoiesis in patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia. In two large phase 3 randomized trials, the use of avatrombopag at 40–60 mg/d for 5 days significantly reduced the need for platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia and chronic liver disease undergoing a scheduled procedure. Similar results have been observed in a phase 3 placebo-controlled trial of lusutrombopag 3 mg once daily. These results led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of avatrombopag and lusutrombopag before elective medical and dental procedures in patients with cirrhosis and platelet count below 50,000/μL. However, TPO-receptor agonists may be associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events, particularly PVT, in patients with liver disease, and caution is recommended when prescribing these agents. In vitro studies have indicated adequate maximum thrombin generation at platelet levels of 50–60,000/μL.

Recommended use of platelet transfusions

The recommendations for the safe level of platelets on the occasion of hemostatic challenges derive from retrospective and observational studies, expert opinion or clinical practice reviews, and are, therefore, based on low-quality evidence. Furthermore, the only studies conducted in patients with IT are the two described above on pregnancyand surgery; however, even these are retrospective and therefore do not provide any concrete evidence. Having said that, prophylactic platelet transfusion is recommended in preparation for surgery and childbirth in IT patients with < 70 and < 50×10⁹ platelets/L, respectively. For surgeries where bleeding can have more serious consequences (e.g. neurosurgery or posterior eye surgery), it is reasonable to achieve higher platelet counts (at least 100×10⁹/L). Higher platelet counts are also required for spinal epidural anesthesia (< 70×10⁹/L) because of the theoretical risk of hematoma formation and neurological damage. On the occasion of scheduled hemostatic challenges, a platelet count much higher than 50×10⁹ /L may be indicated also in subjects with platelet functional defects associated with thrombocytopenia, such as bBSS, gray platelet syndrome (GPS), ITGA2B/ITGB3 -related thrombocytopenia (ITGA2B/ITGB3-RT), SLFN14 -related thrombocytopenia, Jacobsen syndrome/Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia, FLI1 -related thrombocytopenia, and familial platelet disorder with propensity to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML) (Table 1).

The recommendations already provided for platelet concentrates to stop bleeding also apply to preparing patients for hemostatic challenges that can be programmed. In this case, however, there is time to search for an HLA donor who offers the greatest compatibility possible to reduce the risk of alloimmunization.

Prophylactic administration of platelets is not required for the many IT patients who have platelet counts above those levels required for the invasive procedure, although it is prudent to ensure the immediate availability of platelet concentrates should unexpected excessive bleeding occur.

Platelet count is not the only parameter to consider when deciding whether to administer platelet transfusions; the patient's medical history also plays an important role. In fact, subjects who had severe bleeding in the past are more at risk of hemorrhagic complications at the programmed hemorrhagic challenge than those without. If a patient has a safe platelet level but had a major bleeding event in the past, they should be evaluated further to identify any other condition that may explain this discrepancy.

### Different platelet count thresholds to guide use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for patients with hematological disorders after myelosuppressive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation [^1162pbmq]. JAMA Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the optimal platelet count threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusions to minimize bleeding, platelet use, and adverse clinical outcomes in thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignant neoplasms?

Bottom Line

Maintaining a higher platelet count threshold (≤ 20×109/L or ≤ 30×109/L) was not associated with less bleeding than the current standard (≤ 10×109/L), but required more platelet transfusions (low-quality evidence).

Regarding specific circumstances for cancer-associated thrombosis, more specifically with respect to patients with thrombocytopenia, thromboprophylaxis, BCSH 2015 guidelines recommend to reassess thromboprophylaxis in patients with thrombocytopenia, recognizing that a platelet count of < 50, 000/mcL is a relative contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis.
