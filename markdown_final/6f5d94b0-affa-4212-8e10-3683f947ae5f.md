## Question

Is spironolactone safe to use in reproductive age females

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about spironolactone safety in reproductive-age females across non-pregnant use, pregnancy, and lactation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the population and exposure states. Then, I should evaluate mechanistic and animal data for teratogenic risk. Next, I will review human pregnancy data, followed by regulatory and guideline positions. After that, I need to assess safety requirements for non-pregnant women of childbearing potential, including contraception and monitoring. Then, I should appraise lactation safety. Finally, I will integrate indication-specific nuances and conclude with practical counseling points, verifying each claim against high-credibility sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the population and clinical states at issue: reproductive-age women include those who are non-pregnant but could conceive, those who are pregnant, and those who are lactating; safety considerations differ meaningfully across these states, so I need to keep them distinct to avoid conflating risks and recommendations.

> I will now examine the principal fetal-risk concern mechanistically; spironolactone is an anti-androgenic mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, so, wait, let me verify whether anti-androgen activity during embryogenesis impacts male genital development — FDA labeling for CaroSpir and Aldactone explicitly states spironolactone may affect sex differentiation of a male fetus, with rat studies showing feminization of male fetuses and endocrine dysfunction in females exposed in utero, and additional reproduction studies demonstrate stillbirths and ovarian effects at higher doses, which makes the biologic plausibility of anti-androgenic teratogenicity strong [^114E6Peg] [^112VM7Zm] [^116s62PS].

> Next, I should review human pregnancy data; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from animal data alone — both FDA labels note that limited published case reports and series have not demonstrated a clear association with major congenital malformations, but the numbers are insufficient to exclude risk and the potential hazard to a male fetus remains, and in the SAFA acne trial seven pregnancies occurred during treatment without reported major anomalies, yet these small numbers cannot establish safety, so I must not over-interpret absence of signal as absence of risk [^114E6Peg] [^112VM7Zm] [^112ZaghW] [^111fnaQQ].

> Let me consider the regulatory and professional stance in pregnancy; I should confirm whether avoidance is recommended — FDA labeling advises avoiding spironolactone in pregnancy or counseling about potential risk to a male fetus, the 2025 Endocrine Society primary aldosteronism guideline lists pregnancy as a contraindication and prefers eplerenone if a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is needed, and dermatology guidance in hidradenitis suppurativa states spironolactone is not compatible with pregnancy given placental transfer and anti-androgenic effects; additionally, case experience supports eplerenone use when PA is discovered in pregnancy as a bridge to surgery, reinforcing that spironolactone should generally be avoided during gestation [^114E6Peg] [^112VM7Zm] [^113RyDbB] [^113mguGK] [^113XJowA].

> Now, for non-pregnant women of childbearing potential, I need to ensure contraception guidance is explicit; I should double-check whether contraception is mandated — while U.S. spironolactone labels emphasize potential fetal risk without prescribing a contraception program, endocrine and gynecologic guidelines advise avoiding anti-androgen monotherapy unless reliable contraception is used and recommend effective contraception for any patient receiving anti-androgens due to the risk of feminization of a male fetus, and acne guidelines endorse spironolactone use with appropriate lab monitoring; taken together, reliable contraception is standard-of-care before and during therapy even if not a label mandate [^112VM7Zm] [^1163J78f] [^115FrRWw] [^114upf6y].

> Next, I should review adverse effects and monitoring in this non-pregnant group; wait, let me verify the major risks — FDA safety communications list hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, menstrual irregularities, gynecomastia, and renal dysfunction, with hyperkalemia risk amplified by renal impairment, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium supplements, or potassium-sparing agents, and real-world cardiology cohorts show manageable hyperkalemia rates with monitoring; accordingly, baseline and risk-based follow-up labs for potassium and renal function are prudent, with more intensive checks if there are comorbidities or interacting drugs, consistent with dermatology guidance and the pharmacodynamic signal of potassium elevation seen in resistant hypertension trials [^116K1ha6] [^114PFsPq] [^113THZRX] [^117DGa4T] [^114upf6y].

> I should confirm evidence of efficacy and tolerability when contraception is in place; the SAFA RCT in adult women with acne demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements at 24 weeks with 50–100 mg daily and contraceptive counseling plus baseline pregnancy testing, with tolerability similar to placebo, and older Cochrane reviews in acne and hirsutism support anti-androgen benefits albeit with low certainty; dosing ranges for acne of 50–200 mg daily are widely cited in drug references, but, hmm, wait a minute, I should verify that higher doses are balanced against side effects and lab monitoring to maintain safety [^111fnaQQ] [^112ZaghW] [^115wuSuG] [^114TJzv8] [^112Nx1To].

> I will now examine lactation; I need to check whether drug or metabolite transfer into breast milk is clinically significant — CaroSpir labeling reports spironolactone is not detected in milk, while the active metabolite canrenone appears in low amounts expected to be clinically inconsequential, with no short-term adverse infant effects reported, and HS pregnancy/lactation guidance considers spironolactone generally compatible with breastfeeding, though diuresis could theoretically suppress lactation, so using the lowest effective dose and monitoring infant growth is reasonable [^115DX6US] [^113mguGK].

> But wait, what if the indication changes the risk-benefit discussion; for acne and hirsutism related to PCOS, combined oral contraceptives remain first-line because they treat hyperandrogenism and provide contraception, while anti-androgens like spironolactone are considered adjuncts when contraception is assured, consistent with contemporary PCOS evidence syntheses and endocrine guidance; this reinforces the need to couple spironolactone with reliable contraception and to counsel on teratogenic potential in the event of conception [^112ihpNK] [^1163J78f] [^115FrRWw].

> For cardiovascular indications in reproductive-age women, let me reconsider how data generalize; PATHWAY-2 confirms efficacy for resistant hypertension at 25–50 mg daily with expected biochemical shifts, and observational HF cohorts show benefits with careful monitoring, but given pregnancy contraindication and potential for unplanned conception, eplerenone or non–anti-androgen alternatives should be preferred if pregnancy is possible or planned, aligning with endocrine guidance on PA and prudence in HF/HTN management during reproductive years [^117DGa4T] [^111J3t7t] [^112yFFjx] [^113RyDbB].

> Putting this together, I should confirm practical counseling steps: perform baseline pregnancy testing and counsel on reliable contraception prior to initiation; review drug interactions and comorbid risks for hyperkalemia; obtain baseline potassium and creatinine and repeat if risk factors or dose changes occur; avoid spironolactone in pregnancy and switch to safer alternatives if needed; during lactation, use the lowest effective dose and monitor the infant; and document explicit counseling about potential male fetal effects if conception occurs on therapy, consistent with FDA labeling and specialty guidelines [^112VM7Zm] [^114E6Peg] [^114upf6y] [^116K1ha6] [^115DX6US] [^113RyDbB] [^115FrRWw].

---

Yes, spironolactone is **safe for reproductive-age females** when used with effective contraception [^1163J78f] and appropriate monitoring [^114upf6y]. It is effective for acne [^111fnaQQ], hirsutism [^113JAwaL], and PCOS-related hyperandrogenism [^112dxxiT], but **must be avoided in pregnancy** [^112VM7Zm] due to potential fetal harm [^114E6Peg]. The main risks are hyperkalemia [^114upf6y] and menstrual irregularities; baseline renal function and potassium should be checked, with periodic monitoring if risk factors are present [^116K1ha6]. Spironolactone is compatible with breastfeeding [^115DX6US], with only low levels of the metabolite canrenone detected in milk.

---

## Clinical indications and efficacy

Spironolactone is **commonly prescribed** for reproductive-age females for the following indications:

- **Acne vulgaris**: Effective [^111fnaQQ] for moderate-to-severe acne, particularly with hormonal flares [^112ZaghW].

- **Hirsutism**: Reduces androgen-mediated hair growth in PCOS and idiopathic hirsutism [^113JAwaL] [^112ihpNK].

- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Improves hyperandrogenism symptoms such as hirsutism and acne [^112dxxiT] [^112ihpNK].

- **Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)**: Alleviates physical symptoms like bloating and breast tenderness [^1123hMJq] [^117NXckq].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Spironolactone is **generally well tolerated**, but clinicians should be aware of the following adverse effects:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Potassium-sparing effect [^116K1ha6] can cause hyperkalemia, especially with renal impairment or potassium-elevating drugs [^114upf6y].

- **Menstrual irregularities**: Amenorrhea, breakthrough bleeding, and cycle changes are common [^114PFsPq].

- **Breast tenderness and gynecomastia**: Dose-dependent breast effects can occur [^116K1ha6] [^113THZRX].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps may occur [^114PFsPq].

- **Rare serious adverse effects**: Hepatotoxicity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and agranulocytosis are rare but possible [^114PFsPq].

---

## Teratogenicity and pregnancy considerations

Spironolactone is **contraindicated in pregnancy** due to potential fetal harm, particularly feminization of male fetuses observed in animal studies [^114E6Peg]. Although human data are limited, the potential risk necessitates **strict contraception** during therapy [^1163J78f] [^115FrRWw], and **regular pregnancy testing** is advised to detect unintended pregnancies early.

---

## Impact on fertility

Spironolactone **does not significantly impair fertility** in reproductive-age females. Animal studies suggest potential effects on ovulation and implantation at high doses [^116s62PS], but clinical relevance at therapeutic doses is unclear. Menstrual irregularities may temporarily affect fertility, but these effects are generally reversible upon discontinuation.

---

## Monitoring and clinical guidelines

Clinical guidelines **recommend** the following monitoring and precautions:

- **Baseline assessment**: Renal function and serum potassium should be checked before starting therapy [^114upf6y] [^116K1ha6].

- **Periodic monitoring**: Potassium and renal function should be monitored periodically, especially in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia [^114upf6y] [^116K1ha6].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be informed about potential side effects, the importance of contraception, and the need for regular monitoring.

---

## Long-term safety

Long-term use of spironolactone is **generally safe** with appropriate monitoring. No significant increase in breast cancer risk has been observed in long-term studies [^113131c8]. Regular monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is essential to minimize risks.

---

## Alternative medications

Alternative medications for similar indications include:

| **Indication** | **Alternative medications** |
|-|-|
| Acne vulgaris | - Combined oral contraceptives <br/> - Topical retinoids <br/> - Antibiotics |
| Hirsutism | - Combined oral contraceptives <br/> - Finasteride <br/> - Flutamide |
| PCOS | - Metformin <br/> - Combined oral contraceptives <br/> - Lifestyle modifications |
| PMS | - Combined oral contraceptives <br/> - SSRIs <br/> - Lifestyle modifications |

---

## Special considerations

Breastfeeding is **generally compatible** with spironolactone [^115DX6US], with low levels of the active metabolite canrenone detected in breast milk. In **adolescents**, the medication is effective and safe for acne, with a favorable side-effect profile [^113fwhod].

---

Spironolactone is **safe and effective** [^111fnaQQ] for reproductive-age females when used with appropriate monitoring and contraception. It is effective for acne, hirsutism, and PCOS-related hyperandrogenism, but **should be avoided in pregnancy** due to potential fetal harm [^112VM7Zm].

### CaroSpir [^114E6Peg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, spironolactone may affect sex differentiation of the male during embryogenesis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Rat embryofetal studies report feminization of male fetuses and endocrine dysfunction in females exposed to spironolactone in utero. Limited available data from published case reports and case series did not demonstrate an association of major malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with spironolactone. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with heart failure, cirrhosis, and poorly controlled hypertension during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations]. Due to the potential risk to the male fetus from the anti-androgenic properties of spironolactone and animal data, it is advisable to avoid spironolactone in pregnant women or inform a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a male fetus.

The estimated background risk of major congenital anomalies and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major congenital anomalies and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Pregnant women with congestive heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester.

### Aldactone [^112VM7Zm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, spironolactone may affect sex differentiation of the male during embryogenesis [see Data]. Rat embryofetal studies report feminization of male fetuses and endocrine dysfunction in females exposed to spironolactone in utero. Limited available data from published case reports and case series did not demonstrate an association of major malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with spironolactone. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with heart failure, cirrhosis, and poorly controlled hypertension during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations]. Due to the potential risk to the male fetus arising from anti-androgenic properties of spironolactone and supporting animal data, it is advised to avoid spironolactone in pregnant women or to inform a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a male fetus.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Pregnant women with congestive heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, which in turn increases cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. The clinical classification of heart disease may worsen with pregnancy.

### Carospir [^115DX6US]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Lactation**: Spironolactone is not present in breastmilk; however, limited data from a lactating woman at 17 days postpartum reports the presence of the active metabolite, canrenone, in human breast milk in low amounts that are expected to be clinically inconsequential. In this case, there were no adverse effects reported for the breastfed infant after short-term exposure to spironolactone; however, long-term effects on a breastfed infant are unknown. There are no data on spironolactone effects on milk production. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for spironolactone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from spironolactone or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Carospir is not recommended for the treatment of hypertension in pediatric patients because of the potential risks associated with the antiandrogenic, progestogenic, and estrogenic properties of spironolactone in pediatric patients.

- **Geriatric use**: Carospir is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, monitor renal function carefully.

- **Use in renal impairment**: Carospir is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

### SPL drug information for spironolactone [^116K1ha6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of spironolactone PO (also known as Aldactone, Carospir):

- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as spironolactone may cause electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia. Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.

- **Gynecomastia**: Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia in a dose-dependent manner, with an onset varying from 1–2 months to over a year. Maintain a high level of suspicion and monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.

- **Hypotension and renal dysfunction**: Use caution in patients with salt depletion or concomitant use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs or nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs. Monitor volume status and renal function periodically and the diuretic effect when co-administered with NSAIDs.

- **Increased serum lithium levels**: Use caution in patients taking lithium preparations and monitor lithium levels periodically.

- **Increased serum potassium**: Exercise caution in patients with renal impairment or concomitant use of potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or medications increasing potassium serum levels, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Monitor serum potassium levels within 1 week of initiation or dose up-titration and regularly thereafter.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and/or acne [^115wuSuG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. Hirsutism is most often caused by increased production of male sex hormones, also known as androgens. It is also affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles and the secretory glands around the hair follicles, called sebaceous glands. Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist used to treat hirsutism. Since 1978, many studies have been conducted to determine its effectiveness.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone and/or in combination with steroids (oral contraceptive pill included) in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

- **Search strategy**: All publications of randomized controlled trials of spironolactone versus placebo and/or in combination with steroids (oral contraceptive pill included) were identified. The search strategy was developed by the Menstrual Disorder Group. All accessible electronic databases were searched. In addition, all reference lists of relevant trials were searched, and drug companies were contacted for details of unpublished trials.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus: placebo, steroids (oral contraceptive pill included), spironolactone of varying dosages, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Six trials were included in the review, while seven trials were excluded.

### Can the dextroenantiomer of the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole be useful for clinical investigation of aldosterone-synthase inhibition [^111MfGYN]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, and potassium in preventing cardiovascular damage in various experimental models of salt-induced hypertension can be dissociated from blood pressure effects and have drawn attention to the direct genomic and non-genomic actions of aldosterone at the level of the vessels, the heart, and the kidneys. Exposure to endogenous aldosterone could be decreased by direct and specific aldosterone-synthase inhibition. FAD 286A, the dextroenantiomer of the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole, might be a first candidate to investigate in humans the physiological impact and therapeutic properties of aldosterone-synthase inhibition, especially in various forms of primary aldosteronism.

### Interventions for hirsutism [^113JAwaL]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

What medical therapies are associated with the greatest efficacy and fewest adverse events for treating hirsutism? Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been associated with improvement for mild hirsutism, as has flutamide (250 mg) taken twice daily, along with spironolactone for more severe cases. Finasteride and gonadotropin-releasing analogues are associated with inconsistent results, while metformin is not associated with any benefit.

### Spironolactone in dermatology: Uses in acne and beyond [^117Cea4c]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is a synthetic aldosterone receptor antagonist, with off-label roles in various dermatological conditions. Its antiandrogenic properties make it suitable for diseases in which excess androgen production results in unwanted and psychologically distressing manifestations in susceptible females. Treatment with spironolactone aims to attenuate androgen-mediated conditions, including acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, female pattern hair loss, and hirsutism. We discuss the emerging utility of spironolactone in dermatology, its potential adverse effects, and considerations for monitoring.

### Usefulness of spironolactone in a specialized heart failure clinic [^112yFFjx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). High credibility.

Several case series published after the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) have focused on the adverse effects of spironolactone when prescribed to participants not in a trial and the appropriateness of these prescribing practices; however, there is a paucity of data on potential benefits in patients not in a trial. Therefore, we examined data from a prospective cohort study of 1,037 patients with heart failure seen at the University of Alberta Heart Function Clinic. The median age was 69 years, 66% were men, 75% had systolic dysfunction, and the mean ejection fraction was 33%. Only 40% of the 136 patients prescribed spironolactone had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms and 6 mmol/L. Cox's proportional hazards analysis confirmed the association between the use of spironolactone and an increased survival rate (relative risk 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.39), even though 78% of our patients did not fulfill the RALES eligibility criteria. Thus, although the complication rate was higher, the benefits of spironolactone seen in RALES extended to participants not in a trial who were treated with similar doses and followed closely in a clinic specializing in heart failure.

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in England as well as Wales: Pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^112ZaghW]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

Although spironolactone has been widely used in the community to treat hypertension and related disorders, it is not licensed for the management of acne. Some clinicians might be reticent to prescribe it off-license in this context. The findings from this trial show the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of spironolactone in women with acne. Adopting a combined approach using oral spironolactone and topical agents has the potential to reduce long-term prescribing of oral antibiotics, thus reducing the likelihood of emerging bacterial resistance. Treatment courses of spironolactone over three months are likely to provide greater benefits than shorter treatment durations.

Participants were given contraceptive advice at each visit, and a pregnancy test was conducted at baseline. Despite these measures, seven pregnancies were reported in the trial. Although spironolactone is cautioned against in pregnancy, its effects are probably less teratogenic than oral tetracyclines, commonly used for acne in young women. In usual practice, spironolactone would be treated with no special restriction beyond contraceptive counseling. Consensus is growing that, although baseline checks of renal function and potassium levels are advisable before starting patients on spironolactone, ongoing monitoring is unnecessary for most young women.

Overall, spironolactone provides a safe and effective alternative to oral antibiotics for adult women with persistent acne.

### Cyproterone acetate for hirsutism [^111ZPWsn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is a distressing and relatively common endocrine problem in women, which may prove difficult to manage. Cyproterone acetate, an anti-androgen, is frequently used to treat hirsutism, usually in combination with ethinyl estradiol.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of cyproterone acetate alone, or in combination with ethinyl estradiol, in reducing hair growth in women with hirsutism secondary to ovarian hyperandrogenism.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register was searched (last search - June 4, 2002). The register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE (1966 to 2002), EMBASE (1980 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to 2002), PsycINFO (1987 to 2002), and CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2002 of the Cochrane Library). It also includes handsearching of several journals and conference proceedings, as well as searches of several key grey literature sources. All publications of randomized controlled trials of cyproterone acetate with or without estrogen versus placebo or other drug therapies for hirsutism were identified.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled studies comparing:

- Cyproterone acetate to placebo
- Cyproterone acetate with ethinyl estradiol to placebo
- Cyproterone acetate with ethinyl estradiol to cyproterone acetate alone
- Cyproterone acetate (with or without estradiol) to other medical therapies for the treatment of hirsutism

- **Data collection and analysis**: Eleven studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Nine randomized studies were included in the analysis.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and/or acne [^114TJzv8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. The most common cause is increased production of male sex hormones (androgens). It is also affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles and the secretory glands around hair follicles (sebaceous glands). Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist used to treat hirsutism.

- **Objectives**: The objective was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone, alone or in combination with steroids (including oral contraceptive pills), in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) trials register was searched in April 2008. The Cochrane MDSG register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL, as well as handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. In addition, all reference lists of relevant trials were searched, and drug companies were contacted for details of unpublished trials.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus placebo, steroids (including oral contraceptive pills), spironolactone of varying dosages, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Nine trials were included in the review, eight trials were excluded, and two other trials are awaiting assessment. Only one trial studied acne.

### CaroSpir [^116s62PS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In a three-litter reproduction study in which female rats received dietary doses of 15 and 50 mg spironolactone/kg/day, there were no effects on mating and fertility, but there was a small increase in the incidence of stillborn pups at 50 mg/kg/day. When injected into female rats (100 mg/kg/day for 7 days, i.p.), spironolactone was found to increase the length of the estrous cycle by prolonging diestrus during treatment and inducing constant diestrus during a two-week post-treatment observation period. These effects were associated with retarded ovarian follicle development and a reduction in circulating estrogen levels, which would be expected to impair mating, fertility, and fecundity.

Spironolactone (100 mg/kg/day), administered i.p. to female mice during a two-week cohabitation period with untreated males, decreased the number of mated mice that conceived (an effect shown to be caused by an inhibition of ovulation) and decreased the number of implanted embryos in those that became pregnant (an effect shown to be caused by an inhibition of implantation). At 200 mg/kg, spironolactone also increased the latency period to mating.

### Antiandrogen therapy in hidradenitis suppurativa: Finasteride for females [^112P3zfJ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Given its widely accepted efficacy, androgen blockade therapy for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) has become a standard of care. Although much less frequently used than spironolactone, a small number of HS studies have reported finasteride as an alternative treatment for women. In this study, we describe the response to and perception of finasteride therapy in a diverse cohort of women with HS.

- **Aim**: To describe finasteride therapy in a diverse cohort of female patients with HS.

- **Methods**: We conducted an institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review and telephone survey of 20 female patients aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of HS. Finasteride was prescribed by a single provider at a specialized HS center.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 34.3 ± 13.5 years. Finasteride was initiated predominantly because of one or more contraindications or poor responsiveness to spironolactone. Most patients interviewed (90%; n = 18) were willing to take finasteride again or continue with therapy if indicated. Of the 20 patients, 10 (50%) reported overall satisfaction with finasteride, while 7 (35%) were neutral and 3 (15%) were dissatisfied. No patient reported worsening disease activity while on finasteride, and only one (5%) reported decreased quality of life. When asked about adverse effects of finasteride, 80% (n = 16) reported none, while 20% (n = 4) experienced ≥ 1 of the following: headache, nausea, menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, or reduced libido/sexual function.

Our study suggests that androgen blockade therapy with finasteride is an effective alternative treatment for women with HS, particularly for those unable to tolerate spironolactone.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^1135W71s]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

This systematic review, while endorsing key aspects of expert opinion with hard data and providing some new insights, has highlighted important gaps in the evidence regarding the use of oral spironolactone in managing acne in women. These gaps include clarifying the optimum dose and dosing regimen to maximize benefits and minimize the risk of side effects, identifying the lowest effective dose, determining the requirement for concomitant therapies and what these should be, defining which types of acne are likely to respond to treatment, and evaluating how effective spironolactone is compared to standard therapies.

It is noteworthy that several acne guidelines and treatment recommendations include spironolactone based on consensus and/or expert opinion. In contrast, others either do not mention spironolactone or explicitly state it is regarded as ineffective, not recommended, or cite insufficient evidence to support its use. Even those guidelines that claim to be evidence-based have failed to identify the majority of studies included in this systematic review.

Although five relevant studies were unobtainable at the time of writing — two of which were presumably duplicate publications of included case series — we are confident that all relevant RCTs evaluating spironolactone for acne in women have been retrieved, and no clinical trial evidence has been overlooked. Until higher quality evidence becomes available, guideline developers will need to rely primarily on recommendations based on expert experience or consensus from expert panels.

### Proscar [^113xcdou]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Proscar is contraindicated in the following situations:

- **Hypersensitivity**: Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.

- **Pregnancy**: Finasteride use is contraindicated in females who are or may potentially be pregnant. Due to the ability of Type II 5α-reductase inhibitors to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), finasteride may cause abnormalities of the external genitalia in a male fetus of a pregnant female receiving finasteride. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while taking this drug, the pregnant female should be advised of the potential hazard to the male fetus. This is further detailed in Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16). In female rats, low doses of finasteride administered during pregnancy have produced abnormalities in the external genitalia of male offspring.

### Primary aldosteronism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113RyDbB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of primary aldosteronism, particularly concerning mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists over epithelial sodium channel inhibitors, such as amiloride or triamterene, in patients with PA receiving specific medical therapy. This recommendation applies except in clinical conditions where spironolactone is contraindicated (such as hyperkalemia, advanced renal impairment, or pregnancy) or when a non-spironolactone mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is indicated for other non-PA conditions, such as heart failure (HF).

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^117DGa4T]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

One contributor to sodium retention could be the under-dosing of background diuretic treatment. An alternative or additional possibility is that some patients with resistant hypertension have undetected aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs). Recent studies have shown that specific somatic mutations in the adrenal gland can result in micro-APAs, which are difficult to detect by conventional imaging. Additionally, some high-renin patients will have an element of secondary aldosteronism, explaining why spironolactone retains some efficacy at the upper end of the renin distribution. Determination of whether spironolactone is a particularly effective treatment for resistant hypertension because it antagonizes the effects of aldosterone will require a head-to-head comparison of spironolactone with an increase in the dose of the background diuretic.

As well as being the most effective treatment for resistant hypertension, spironolactone was well tolerated. The doses of spironolactone used in the present study are low compared with the 200–400 mg daily used in other clinical circumstances. The 25–50 mg daily doses in PATHWAY-2 are consistent with previous studies of resistant hypertension in which 25 mg was the most common daily dose. These studies have shown that the main biochemical effects associated with spironolactone treatment are a reduction in serum sodium and an increase in potassium. We noted a magnitude of change (–1.19 mmol/L in sodium and 0.45 mmol/L in potassium) very similar to that reported in summary data from previous studies. Despite almost 14% of our patients having typical…

### Use and side-effect profile of spironolactone in a private cardiologist's practice [^113THZRX]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of spironolactone on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases are well known, but translating these benefits into private practice can be difficult because of the drug's side-effect profile.

- **Hypothesis**: When patients are monitored over the long term, spironolactone can be used safely with an acceptable side-effect profile.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively studied 762 patients taking spironolactone over a 7-year period in a cardiologist's referral-based practice and monitored them for side effects from the medication.

- **Results**: Data were available on 762 patients. The average age of our patients when started on the medication was 67.2 ± 0.5 years. Of these, 585 (76.8%) patients were treated for heart failure and 155 (20.3%) for hypertension. An average dose of 38.4 ± 1.4 mg of spironolactone was used for treatment of all conditions. Of the 762 patients, 81 (10.6%) experienced side effects while using the medication; 40 had hyperkalemia (5.3%), 14 had gynecomastia (1.8%), and 15 had gastritis (2%). Of the patients with hyperkalemia, average creatinine clearance decreased from 64.6 ± 5.8 ml/min at therapy start to 50.3 ± 5.5 ml/min at the time of onset of side effects.

- **Conclusion**: Spironolactone can be used with an acceptable side-effect profile as long as patients are monitored long-term while receiving the medication.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112ihpNK]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

While other anti-androgen pharmacological agents, such as spironolactone, may be considered for treating clinical hirsutism, first-line therapy remains the COCP. This is because the COCP can improve menstrual cyclicity while providing effective contraception, whereas anti-androgens are teratogenic since they can interfere with the external genital development of male fetuses.

Consistent with our findings, a systematic review and network meta-analysis by Barrionuevo et al. of 43 studies reported that anti-androgens in combination with the COCP may have additive benefits for hirsutism, noting important methodological limitations in the available evidence. However, Barrionuevo et al. investigated women with idiopathic hirsutism and specifically excluded women with PCOS. An earlier systematic review of 28 studies by Koulouri et al. identified improvements in hirsutism following anti-androgen treatment, which were associated with BMI. However, this review included broader hirsute populations rather than PCOS specifically and is likely outdated given that the search was conducted 17 years ago (in 2006).

Although PCOS constitutes 65–75% of hirsutism cases, other causes of hirsutism such as Cushing's syndrome, androgen-producing tumors, hyperprolactinemia, and peripheral androgen activity may necessitate different and more nuanced treatment approaches than those needed in PCOS, particularly due to the cardiometabolic implications of the latter. Here, we extend the potential benefits of anti-androgens on hirsutism to women with PCOS, while maintaining that COCP remains the first-line therapy.

### Effect of spironolactone and cyproterone acetate on breast growth in transgender people: A randomized clinical trial [^117GYZU3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

People with a female or nonbinary gender whose sex was recorded as male at birth commonly use antiandrogens with estradiol to induce physical changes such as breast development, body fat redistribution, and decreased facial and body hair. Antiandrogens decrease the effects and/or synthesis of testosterone through androgen receptor antagonism, inhibition of synthetic enzymes, and/or suppression of gonadotrophins. Common antiandrogens include spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, but the use of nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonists (e.g. bicalutamide), gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues, progestogens, and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors is well described.

Cyproterone acetate, through potent progestogenic suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and moderate androgen receptor antagonism, is associated with greater suppression of serum testosterone than spironolactone; however, the effects on feminization remain unclear. A systematic review of antiandrogens in transgender people identified low-quality studies suggesting that cyproterone acetate, progestogens, and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues resulted in greater suppression of serum total testosterone concentrations than spironolactone or estradiol alone. Subsequently, a 12-week single-blinded randomized trial in transgender people on estradiol showed that those using cyproterone acetate had lower median serum total testosterone concentrations than spironolactone (0.26 nmol/L vs. 14.23 nmol/L, P < 0.001). These findings supported cross-sectional data but unfortunately did not include clinically relevant outcomes.

### Drug treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome [^1129czrJ]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition present in approximately 5 to 10 percent of women of childbearing age. Diagnosis can be challenging because the signs and symptoms can be subtle and varied. These may include hirsutism, infertility, menstrual irregularities, and biochemical abnormalities, most notably insulin resistance. Treatment should target specific manifestations and individualized patient goals. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians must consider comorbidities and the patient's desire for pregnancy.

Lifestyle modifications should be used alongside medical treatments for optimal results. Few agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for use in polycystic ovary syndrome, and several agents are contraindicated in pregnancy. Insulin-sensitizing agents are indicated for most women with polycystic ovary syndrome because they have positive effects on insulin resistance, menstrual irregularities, anovulation, hirsutism, and obesity. Metformin has the most data supporting its effectiveness. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are also effective for ameliorating hirsutism and insulin resistance.

Metformin and clomiphene, alone or in combination, are first-line agents for ovulation induction. Insulin-sensitizing agents, oral contraceptives, spironolactone, and topical eflornithine can be used in patients with hirsutism.

### SPL drug information for fludrocortisone acetate [^112ez66P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of fludrocortisone PO in pregnant patients across all trimesters, it should only be used if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is advised to monitor neonates for signs of hypoadrenalism. Complications, including cleft palate, stillbirth, and premature abortion, have been reported when corticosteroids were administered during pregnancy. The drug fludrocortisone PO is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus observed.

### Spironolactone and risk of incident breast cancer in women older than 55 years: Retrospective, matched cohort study [^113131c8]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and about 80% of cases are hormonally dependent, usually estrogen receptor-positive. Due to the effects of spironolactone on the breast, such as tenderness in women and gynecomastia in men, and its known antiandrogenic and progestogenic actions, there has been concern that spironolactone could promote breast cancer development. Anecdotally, many doctors avoid prescribing spironolactone to patients with a history of breast cancer or those at high risk, as published reports have raised concerns that the drug could increase the risk of breast cancer and other cancers in humans. However, other studies have shown no increased risk, and overall, studies in this area have been small and limited.

Many other factors are known to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. These factors include age, sex (with only 0.5% of cases occurring in men), alcohol use, smoking, postmenopausal obesity, age at menarche, age at first childbirth, age at menopause, parity, breastfeeding, use of exogenous estrogens (such as hormone replacement therapy or combined oral contraceptive pills), family history, and in some cases, germline mutations (such as BRCA1). Patients who receive spironolactone treatment long-term for hypertension or heart failure tend to be older, which is also the group most at risk of developing breast cancer. We aimed to investigate whether exposure to spironolactone affects the risk of incident breast cancer in women over 55 years of age in the UK.

### Impavido [^114fbTGX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Impavido and for 5 months after the last dose [see Boxed Warning, and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. Women who use oral contraceptives should use an additional non-oral method of effective contraception during Impavido therapy if vomiting and/or diarrhea occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Women who become pregnant while being treated with Impavido should discontinue treatment and seek counseling from their healthcare provider about the potential risk to the fetus [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Effects on male reproductive health**: Advise male patients that semen quality and sperm parameters may be adversely affected by treatment with Impavido. The effects on spermatogenesis may persist for an unknown duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Impavido may impair fertility in both females and males of reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.3), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Male patients should be aware that diminution in ejaculate volume, including temporary absence of ejaculate, and scrotal tenderness may occur during treatment. Report any concerning genitourinary symptoms to a healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Use in Specific Popul].

### Severe hypokalaemia in primary aldosteronism during pregnancy [^113XJowA]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is rarely seen in pregnancy despite being a common cause of secondary hypertension. Spironolactone, the first-line treatment, is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential anti-androgenic effects; treatment options are thus limited. We present a case in which severe hypokalaemia associated with PA was discovered during pregnancy. Eplerenone was used as a short-term treatment without adverse effects to the fetus before unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in the second trimester after the patient was refractory to medical treatment. This case report adds to the limited literature on the management of PA in pregnancy, which could influence future risk-benefit discussions regarding surgical versus medical management of this condition.

### Testosterone therapy in women: A clinical challenge [^113GdaWk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The physiology of testosterone as a normal female hormone during reproductive years and beyond is poorly taught and understood. This lack of understanding has led to unregulated and dangerous prescribing practices by physicians and other healthcare professionals. There are data supporting the safe use of testosterone therapy, and as women's healthcare practitioners, we owe it to our patients to follow these guidelines and practices. Additionally, we must advocate for more research and the development of safer, regulated products to prescribe.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^111kApTA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Two authors of this review confirm that, based on their extensive experience of successful use of the drug to treat large numbers of women with persistent or late-onset acne, spironolactone is pivotal to their clinical practice. Such experience suggests that the important role of spironolactone in this hard-to-manage patient population has been largely underrecognized and provided the rationale for this systematic review. What the review has highlighted is a paucity of high-quality evidence for the effectiveness of oral spironolactone in the management of acne in adult females. The results should not be misinterpreted to mean that the drug is ineffective at safe dosages but rather that there is a lack of robust evidence in support of expert opinion, which currently drives treatment recommendations either for, or against more widespread use.

Every one of the 10 RCTs was at high risk of bias, with the most common reason being lack of blinding. Even in the more recent trials, sample sizes were not justified by reporting of power calculations or the assumptions on which they had been based. This lack of difference in efficacy between treatments might have been due, at least in part, to insufficient power. Moreover, as no single outcome measure had been used consistently across the trials, pooling of data from similar comparisons was not possible.

- **Trial categories**: The trials fell into two categories:
	1. Comparisons of spironolactone monotherapy versus placebo.
	2. Comparisons of mono or combination therapy versus active treatment.

### Anti-androgenic therapy using oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in Asians [^116YLPm9]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Few studies have addressed anti-androgenic therapy using oral spironolactone for acne in Asians. Obtaining this race-specific information is important because Westerners and Asians respond differently to hormone therapy. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of oral spironolactone used to treat acne in Asians.

- **Methods**: Spironolactone (initial dose, 200 mg/day) was administered orally to 139 Japanese patients (116 females and 23 males) with acne. Serum laboratory data, including various hormones and electrolytes, were examined for 25 of the subjects.

- **Results**: Most of the female patients who completed the 20-week regimen exhibited excellent improvement (evaluated by a photographic grading scale), although some discontinued treatment because of menstrual disturbances or other reasons. The treatment was less efficacious for the males than for the females, and because gynecomastia developed in three male patients, spironolactone treatment for males was stopped. Examination of the serum of 25 patients did not identify any toxicity associated with the treatment. Drug eruptions and edema in the lower extremities were each seen in three patients.

- **Conclusion**: Oral spironolactone is effective and safe for the treatment of acne in Asian females and can be a good option for severe, recurring, and widespread types of the condition.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^113TDUJC]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2, focusing on spironolactone versus placebo, was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to hypertension. The trial question was to determine the role of add-on spironolactone in patients with drug-resistant hypertension. The study was designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The population included 335 patients, consisting of 105 females and 230 males. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of three antihypertensive drugs for at least three months. Key exclusion criteria were secondary or accelerated hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 mL/min, sustained atrial fibrillation (AF), and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment.

- **Interventions**: 285 patients received spironolactone at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, with forced up-titration to 50 mg/day through week 12. Meanwhile, 274 patients received a matching placebo daily for 12 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: The study reported a significant increase in the reduction of home SBP from week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 4.1 mmHg; absolute difference [AD] 8.7 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.69 to 9.72).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant increase in the reduction of home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 4.2 mmHg; AD 10.2 mmHg, 95% CI 8.74 to 11.7).

### Spironolactone in adolescent acne vulgaris [^111y6w6P]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (AV) is the most common skin condition affecting adolescents, most likely due to elevated androgen levels during puberty. Androgens stimulate and enlarge the sebaceous glands and keratinocytes, resulting in increased production of sebum and abnormal hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, which leads to the formation of acne lesions. Standard care for AV includes topical therapies for mild cases and antibiotics or oral retinoids for severe cases.

In recent years, spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist and diuretic, has been applied to the treatment of AV due to its anti-androgen effects. Spironolactone is currently recommended for women who use oral contraceptives, are refractory to or contraindicated for standard treatment, show clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, or present with late-onset or persistent acne beyond the teenage years. It is not prescribed to adolescents due to potential side effects; however, data studying adults indicate that most side effects are mild and that potential associations with hyperkalemia and increased risk of cancer are not sufficiently supported. Hence, we believe that spironolactone may be a safe and effective therapy for adolescent AV.

### A guide to the management of hidradenitis suppurativa in pregnancy and lactation [^113mguGK]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

- **Spironolactone**: Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, is frequently used in female patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) to counteract hormonal influences on disease activity. It is not compatible with pregnancy due to its antiandrogen properties and ability to cross the placenta, which can interfere with the sexual development of a male fetus. A 2019 systematic review evaluating exposure to spironolactone in utero did not find significant evidence of feminization of male individuals; however, human data were limited to case reports. Of note, spironolactone is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding despite a potential risk of lactation suppression from diuresis.

- **Oral contraceptive pills**: Combined oral contraceptive pills are used as monotherapy or in combination with spironolactone for female patients with HS but are contraindicated during pregnancy. In terms of compatibility with breastfeeding, oral contraceptive pills may suppress lactation, and there are some reports of infants experiencing breast enlargement while being breastfed by exposed mothers. Thus, it is generally recommended to wait until at least 6 weeks after delivery to start oral contraceptive pills.

Regarding the use of spironolactone PO (also known as Aldactone, Carospir) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. The drug spironolactone PO is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Pipeline for contraceptive development [^116mooRo]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

The high rates of unplanned pregnancy reflect an unmet need for effective contraceptive methods for women, especially for individuals with health risks such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other conditions that may contraindicate the use of an estrogen-containing product. Improvements in safety, user convenience, acceptability, and availability of products remain important goals of the contraceptive development program. Another important goal is to minimize the impact of the products on the environment.

Development of new methods for male contraception has the potential to address many of these issues of safety for women who have contraindications to effective contraceptive methods but want to protect against pregnancy. It would also address a huge unmet need for men who want to control their fertility. Products under development for men would not introduce ecotoxic hormones into the water system.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116Rog1a]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Limitations in the review process should also be noted. Due to being poorly reported or presented in a format which was not amenable to meta-analysis, some data were excluded, leading to missing or incomplete information for some comparisons. Although exclusion of these data was necessary to ensure consistency and rigor in the review process, this meant that sample sizes were small for many comparisons, and it is possible that their inclusion may have impacted our results, urging caution in the interpretation of these findings.

We addressed this limitation to some extent via sensitivity analysis by RoB; however, this was not possible for all comparisons or outcomes due to the small number of included studies. Moreover, studies in languages other than English were excluded due to resource and time constraints, and some full texts were not found; hence, potentially relevant results may have been excluded from the review. Lastly, publication bias cannot be ruled out given that this could not be adequately judged by inspection of funnel plots (since fewer than ten studies were assessed in each analysis) and grey literature (unpublished work) was not sourced or included in the review.

In summary, anti-androgens may have possible benefits on clinical hyperandrogenism (i.e. hirsutism) in combination with effective contraception; but, per guideline recommendations, should be used in circumstances where COCP (and/or cosmetic options including mechanical, laser, and light therapies for hair reduction) are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or have been ineffective for a minimum period.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^115yRv3M]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the somewhat limited evidence available, some tentative conclusions can still be drawn. At a daily dose of 200 mg, spironolactone was found to be significantly superior to placebo versus inflamed lesions in a crossover trial, in which 21 of 29 women completed 3 months of treatment. Baseline imbalance and a possible carryover effect of spironolactone into the second phase would have reduced the magnitude of the difference in efficacy between spironolactone and placebo, which was already large. This statistically significant result was not reported by the authors of a frequently cited Cochrane review, which evaluated the effects of spironolactone for hirsutism and acne. The Cochrane review may have also inadvertently misled authors of subsequent reports by stating that "there was no evidence for effectiveness [of spironolactone] for the treatment of acne vulgaris".

In contrast to the crossover trial, no conclusions can be drawn from the two parallel group comparisons versus placebo regarding the absolute efficacy of lower doses of spironolactone. Spironolactone appeared to be more effective than placebo, but by how much was not quantified, and indeed, the difference may not have been clinically significant. The very low-quality evidence provided by the case series consistently shows that lower doses do have a measure of anti-acne activity, but they contributed no information on relative efficacy.

The trials that assessed comparative efficacy versus the anti-androgens flutamide, finasteride, cimetidine, ketoconazole, and various COCs consistently found no differences.

### Anti-androgenic effects comparison between cyproterone acetate and spironolactone in transgender women: A randomized controlled trial [^114NKQVZ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Spironolactone and cyproterone acetate are commonly used in feminizing hormone therapy to achieve female-range testosterone levels; however, data comparing the efficacy of these two anti-androgens are scarce.

- **Aim**: To compare the anti-androgenic effects between spironolactone and cyproterone acetate as components of feminizing hormone therapy among the transgender women population.

- **Methods**: The study was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial involving 52 transgender women from two transgender health clinics. Each participant received oral estradiol valerate 4 mg/day combined with either spironolactone 100 mg/day or cyproterone acetate 25 mg/day, depending on their randomized group. Clinical and biochemical variables were obtained at baseline and at 12 weeks of feminizing hormone therapy.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary measure was the change in testosterone levels from baseline. Other changes included free testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, and lipid profile after therapy.

- **Results**: After 12 weeks of feminizing hormone therapy, the change in testosterone level in the cyproterone acetate group [558.0 ng/dL (IQR 352.0 to 783.3)] was significantly higher than in the spironolactone group [226.2 ng/dL (IQR -4.3 to 480.1)] (p value < 0.001). Testosterone and calculated free testosterone in the cyproterone acetate group were significantly lower than in the spironolactone group. Consequently, a significantly higher proportion of participants in the cyproterone acetate group (90%) achieved the female-range testosterone level (< 50 ng/dL).

They are often clinically indistinguishable from women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Importantly, women with non-classic CAH may show a polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) appearance on transvaginal ultrasound in 30%–40% of cases. Women with CAH are less likely to have oligomenorrhea than those with PCOS (17%–30% vs. 80%), whereas raised luteinizing hormone (LH), insulin resistance, and higher body weight are more common in PCOS.

A family history of CAH is an important clue to the diagnosis. Identifying women with non-classic CAH highlights the selective use of glucocorticoids as a treatment option for hirsutism, alongside other measures such as the combined oral contraceptive pill. It also has wider implications, for example, for fertility and pre-pregnancy genetic counseling. Therefore, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) should be included in the initial evaluation of women with suspected androgen excess. A raised 17OHP level above 30 nmol/L is considered diagnostic for CAH. In contrast, a mildly raised 17OHP level > 5–7 nmol/L, taken in the early follicular phase, should alert clinicians to the possibility of underlying CAH and trigger a synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated 17OHP measurement. It should be noted that 17OHP levels may also be significantly elevated in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma; therefore, adrenal imaging is recommended at diagnosis in adulthood.

### Benefit-risk of colchicine and spironolactone in acute myocardial infarction: a prespecified generalised pairwise comparisons analysis of the CLEAR trial [^113GDfbs]. Heart (2025). High credibility.

Composite outcomes in cardiovascular trials often group events of unequal clinical importance. Conventional analyses may obscure treatment trade-offs. Generalised pairwise comparisons (GPC), expressed as a win ratio (WR), allow for hierarchical ranking of events and incorporation of outcomes, providing a potentially more intuitive assessment of benefit-risk.

- **Methods**: In a prespecified exploratory analysis of the 2×2 factorial, randomised CLEAR (Colchicine and Spironolactone in Patients with Myocardial Infarction) trial, 7062 patients within 72 hours of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and percutaneous coronary intervention were included. We applied both time-to-first and recurrent-event GPC to reassess low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) and spironolactone (25 mg daily) versus placebo. For the colchicine comparison, the hierarchical benefit-risk outcome included all-cause death, stroke, reMI, unplanned ischaemia-driven revascularisation, serious infection, or diarrhoea. For the spironolactone comparison, the outcome included all-cause death, stroke, MI, new or worsening heart failure, significant ventricular arrhythmia, hyperkalaemia, or gynaecomastia/gynaecodynia. GPC results were compared with Cox, logistic, and Andersen-Gill models.

- **Results**: For colchicine, the time-to-first event GPC showed a 12% lower proportional win rate compared with placebo (WR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98; win difference -2.10%, 95% CI -3.84 to -0.37), driven largely by excess diarrhoea. For spironolactone, patients experienced a 14% lower win rate (WR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99).

### Topamax [^113EJ9iV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider the benefits and risks of topiramate when prescribing this drug to women of childbearing potential, particularly when topiramate is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death. Because of the risk of oral clefts to the fetus, which occur in the first trimester of pregnancy, all women of childbearing potential should be informed of the potential risk to the fetus from exposure to topiramate. Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks and benefits of topiramate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients.

Although the effect of Topamax on labor and delivery in humans has not been established, the development of topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis in the mother and/or in the fetus might affect the fetus's ability to tolerate labor. Topamax treatment can cause metabolic acidosis. The effect of topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis has not been studied in pregnancy; however, metabolic acidosis in pregnancy (due to other causes) can cause decreased fetal growth, decreased fetal oxygenation, fetal death, and may affect the fetus's ability to tolerate labor. Pregnant patients should be monitored for metabolic acidosis and treated as in the nonpregnant state. Newborns of mothers treated with Topamax should be monitored for metabolic acidosis because of the transfer of topiramate to the fetus.

### Otrexup [^113HPvZg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Advise females of reproductive potential that Otrexup can cause fetal harm and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential should not start Otrexup until pregnancy is excluded. They should be fully counseled on the serious risk to the fetus if pregnancy occurs during treatment. Inform patients to contact their physician if they suspect pregnancy [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during Otrexup therapy and for six months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during Otrexup therapy and for three months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

- **Infertility**: Advise patients of reproductive potential that Otrexup may impair fertility, cause oligospermia, and result in menstrual dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

- **Lactation**: Advise females not to breastfeed during treatment with Otrexup and for one week after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

### Animal models to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114jhm1d]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Transgenerational perspectives of androgen exposure

Pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the impact of prenatal androgen (PNA) exposure on their female offspring, as it has been demonstrated that daughters of women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing PCOS. While there is no safe and ethical way to accomplish this directly in humans, PNA and prenatal anti-Müllerian hormone (PAMH) animal models offer translatable alternatives. Animal models, such as PNA and PAMH mice, with or without diet-induced obesity (DIO) to mimic key maternal PCOS conditions, are crucial for investigating transgenerational effects. This research explores whether exposed lineages have increased susceptibility to a PCOS-like reproductive and metabolic phenotype in first to third-generation (F1 to F3) offspring. These studies are analogous to those examining maternal metabolic syndrome in mice and the transgenerational transmission of metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction in F1 to F3 offspring.

Recently, it was demonstrated for the first time that PNA mice derived from F0 dams exposed to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) during late pregnancy, but not maternal DIO, exhibit both reproductive and metabolic PCOS-like phenotypes that are transmitted across generations, known as transgenerational transmission. Specifically, the PNA lineage, but not the DIO lineage, displays a longer anogenital distance, irregular cycles, increased fat mass, enlarged adipocytes, and higher liver triglyceride content, as well as a lower respiratory exchange ratio and energy expenditure. Female mice from the PNA lineage may therefore exhibit constrained switching between lipids and other carbon sources for energy metabolism during fasting.

### Spironolactone in dermatology [^111nzxoU]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is a drug similar in structure to aldosterone and acts as an aldosterone receptor antagonist with an anti-androgenic effect. This drug has proven to be useful in several dermatological conditions; however, its use has not been fully explored. Its application in diseases such as acne has opened the door to new therapies, depending on the clinical manifestations of the patients. It is also possible to use it as a first-line treatment. Other conditions associated with the use of spironolactone, where its effects have been shown to be beneficial, include hidradenitis suppurativa, hirsutism, and female pattern androgenetic alopecia.

In this review, we discuss the use of spironolactone in various skin diseases prevalent in our environment, the dosage according to different studies, treatment recommendations, and adverse effects. All these aspects are considered in order to incorporate this drug into daily clinical practice.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111J3t7t]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The PATHWAY-2 study investigated the effectiveness of spironolactone compared to doxazosin as an add-on treatment for patients with drug-resistant hypertension. It utilized a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, involving 335 participants (105 female, 230 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite receiving maximally tolerated doses of three antihypertensive drugs for at least three months.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Secondary/accelerated hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 mL/min, sustained atrial fibrillation, and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment.

- **Interventions**
- **Spironolactone group (n = 285)**: 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12.
- **Doxazosin group (n = 282)**: 4 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 8 mg/day through week 12.

The primary outcome was the reduction in home SBP from week 6 to week 12, showing a significant decrease (12.8 mmHg for spironolactone vs. 8.7 mmHg for doxazosin; adjusted difference 4.03 mmHg, 95% confidence interval 3.02 to 5.04).

Secondary outcomes also demonstrated a similar trend in SBP reduction at week 12.

### Use of spironolactone to treat acne in adolescent females [^113fwhod]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Studies assessing the utility of spironolactone for treating acne in adolescent females are lacking; thus, we sought to examine spironolactone's role in treating this patient population.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was performed to determine the efficacy of spironolactone treatment in adolescent females seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, from 2007 to 2017.

- **Results**: In a cohort of 80 pediatric patients with a median age of 19 years (range, 14–20 years), 64 patients (80%) experienced improvement of acne on treatment with spironolactone (median dose, 100 mg daily) with a favorable side effect profile. Approximately a quarter of patients (22.5%) had a complete response; more than half (58.8%) had a complete response or a partial response greater than 50%. Initial and maximal responses were observed at a median of 3 months and 5 months, respectively. Patients received treatment with spironolactone for a median duration of 7 months (range, 3–45 months) with limited side effects.

- **Conclusions**: Spironolactone demonstrated efficacy in treating acne in adolescent females and is a safe long-term alternative to systemic antibiotics in these patients.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and/or acne [^111xVCSq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. It is most often caused by increased production of male sex hormones, also known as androgens. Additionally, it is affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles and the secretory glands around them, called sebaceous glands. Spironolactone, an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist, is used to treat hirsutism.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone alone or in combination with steroids (including oral contraceptives) in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched 12 June 2003). This register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL, handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. Additionally, all reference lists of relevant trials were searched, and drug companies were contacted for details of unpublished trials.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus placebo, steroids (including oral contraceptives), varying dosages of spironolactone, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone were considered when assessing their use in reducing hair growth and acne in women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Seven trials were included in the review, with a total of eight trials initially identified.

### Nikki [^113wUtrr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue with anti-mineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity. The estrogen in Nikki is ethinyl estradiol.

- **Contraception**: Two studies evaluated the effect of 3 mg DRSP / 0.02 mg EE combinations on the suppression of ovarian activity as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound and serum hormone (progesterone and estradiol) analyses during two treatment cycles (21-day active tablet period plus a 7-day pill-free period). More than 90% of subjects in these studies demonstrated ovulation inhibition. One study compared the effect of 3 mg DRSP / 0.02 mg EE combinations with two different regimens (24-day active tablet period plus a 4-day pill-free period vs. 21-day active tablet period plus a 7-day pill-free period) on the suppression of ovarian activity during two treatment cycles. During the first treatment cycle, there were no subjects (0/49, 0%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 1 subject (1/50, 2%) using the 21-day regimen. After intentionally introduced dosing errors (3 missed active tablets on Days 1 to 3) during the second treatment cycle, there was 1 subject (1/49, 2%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 4 subjects (4/50, 8%) using the 21-day regimen.

- **Acne**: Acne vulgaris is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of EE and DRSP increases sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and d

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in England as well as Wales: Pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^111fnaQQ]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

The SAFA study was published by Miriam Santer and colleagues in 2023 in the BMJ. This study addresses acne vulgaris. The trial questioned the effect of spironolactone in female patients with acne vulgaris. It employed a multicentre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial design. The study population consisted of 410 female patients. Inclusion criteria were adult female patients with facial acne for at least six months, deemed to require oral antibiotics. Key exclusion criteria included an Investigator's Global Assessment acne score of 0–1, previous spironolactone use, oral isotretinoin use in the past six months, and the use of oral antibiotics for more than one week for acne within the previous month.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Spironolactone group**: 201 patients, receiving 50 mg/day until week 6, increasing to 100 mg/day until week 24.
	- **Placebo group**: 209 patients, receiving a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- A significant increase in improvement in the Acne-Specific Quality of Life (QoL) symptom subscale score at week 12 (19.2 points vs. 17.8 points; AD 1.27 points, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.46) was observed.

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in improvement in the Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 24 (21.2 points vs. 17.4 points; AD 3.45 points, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.75).
	- Significant increase in self-assessed overall improvement score of 3–6 at week 24 (82% vs. 63%; OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.93).
	- Significant increase in Investigator's Global Assessment for treatment success at week 12 (19% vs. 6%; OR 5.18, 95% CI 2.18 to 12.28).

### Slynd [^112NRQjC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Slynd contains drospirenone, a progestin, known for its anti-mineralocorticoid activity, which includes the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk females, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. It is contraindicated in females with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia, such as renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency.

Females receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium levels checked prior to starting treatment and during the first treatment cycle. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in females at increased risk for hyperkalemia, such as those who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term in conjunction with Slynd. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include:

- Azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole)
- HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g. indinavir, boceprevir)
- Clarithromycin

Monitor females taking Slynd who later develop medical conditions and/or begin medication that increases the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Most females with hyperkalemia in the clinical development studies of Slynd experienced mild potassium elevations and/or isolated increases that returned to normal while still on study medication. No adverse reactions were attributed to hyperkalemia. In the pivotal trial, two females (0.2%) with persistent potassium elevations discontinued Slynd.

### The hirsute woman: Challenges in evaluation and management [^117Ah3uj]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To review the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic approach, and management of hirsutism, we discuss its clinical course and provide our recommendations on various treatment options available.

Hirsutism is a common clinical problem characterized by increased terminal hair growth in androgen-dependent areas of the skin. The development of hirsutism depends on the presence of the pilosebaceous unit, which is genetically determined, as well as the presence of the androgen receptor and intracellular 5α-reductase activity, which converts testosterone to its more active metabolite, dihydrotestosterone.

A detailed history and physical examination, complemented by the following laboratory tests, can diagnose most causes of hirsutism: early-morning follicular phase measurement of total testosterone, testosterone not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, prolactin, and thyrotropin levels.

Oral contraceptive preparations may be effective monotherapy for mild hirsutism. For the treatment of more severe hirsutism, oral contraceptive pills combined with spironolactone are as effective as oral contraceptive pills containing cyproterone acetate, which are not available in the United States. Due to its teratogenicity, spironolactone should be used with caution in premenopausal women if administered without an oral contraceptive pill.

Metformin serves as an alternative therapy for hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who have additional indications for its use.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112dxxiT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may mitigate hyperandrogenism-related symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, all EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to June 28th, 2023, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age with PCOS. Diagnosis followed Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health, or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and participants were using a form of contraception. Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months' duration, or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in all groups, were excluded to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework.

- **Critical outcomes**: Prioritised during guideline development for GRADE purposes, these included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where applicable.
