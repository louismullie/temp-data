## Question

temiflu being metabolized by what cyp450?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which CYP450 enzyme metabolizes Tamiflu (oseltamivir). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the labeled metabolic pathway for oseltamivir. Then, I should verify whether any CYP450 isoenzyme is involved or whether the drug bypasses CYP metabolism entirely. Next, I will identify the actual enzyme responsible for bioactivation if it is non-CYP. Finally, I should consider clinically relevant interaction mechanisms to ensure I am not missing a CYP-mediated exception and then synthesize the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the labeled pharmacokinetics and metabolism. Oseltamivir is a prodrug that is extensively converted to its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver; the active metabolite is not further metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in urine, which already suggests a non-CYP pathway for both activation and clearance [^112Wdk6B] [^112B21Gr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about CYP involvement just because many drugs use CYP pathways. At first glance one might suspect CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 given their prominence in drug metabolism, but I should verify this against authoritative sources; the FDA labeling explicitly states that neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, inhibitor of, or inducer of cytochrome P450 isoforms, and in vitro work corroborates that they are not good substrates for P450 mixed-function oxidases, which effectively rules out CYP450 enzymes as meaningful contributors to oseltamivir disposition [^112b5BZC] [^112Wdk6B] [^111CUuGt].

> Wait, let me verify the exact enzyme responsible for the bioactivation step. The conversion of oseltamivir to oseltamivir carboxylate is catalyzed by hepatic carboxylesterases, with carboxylesterase 1 (CES1, also called HCE-1) identified as the primary enzyme mediating this hydrolysis; pharmacogenetic data show that CES1 variants can measurably reduce bioactivation, reinforcing that this step is non-CYP and esterase-dependent [^115E1iaR] [^115gyFAN].

> I should double-check potential drug interaction mechanisms to ensure there is no indirect CYP angle. The principal interaction signal is with probenecid, which increases exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate by inhibiting renal tubular secretion via organic anion transport, not by affecting CYP activity; additionally, clinical evaluations show no meaningful CYP-mediated PK interactions with several coadministered agents, consistent with the non-CYP disposition profile of oseltamivir and its active metabolite [^111CUuGt] [^112b5BZC].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the final statement is precise. Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is not metabolized by any CYP450 enzyme; it is a prodrug hydrolyzed predominantly by hepatic carboxylesterases, chiefly CES1, to the active oseltamivir carboxylate, and neither the prodrug nor the active metabolite are CYP substrates, inhibitors, or inducers [^112b5BZC] [^115E1iaR].

---

Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is **not metabolized by any CYP450 enzyme** [^112b5BZC] [^112Wdk6B]. It is converted to its active metabolite by hepatic esterases [^111CUuGt], and neither oseltamivir nor its active metabolite is a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of CYP450 isoforms [^112Wdk6B]. Thus, there is **no clinically significant CYP450 interaction risk** with Tamiflu [^112b5BZC].

---

## Metabolic pathway of oseltamivir

Oseltamivir is a **prodrug** [^112B21Gr] that requires metabolic activation to exert its antiviral effects. The primary pathway is hydrolysis by hepatic esterases — predominantly **carboxylesterase 1 (CES1)** [^115E1iaR] — which converts oseltamivir to its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate [^112b5BZC]. This active metabolite inhibits influenza virus **neuraminidase** [^111CUuGt], thereby preventing the release of viral particles from infected cells.

## Role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in oseltamivir metabolism

Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated [^112Wdk6B] that neither oseltamivir nor its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, is **a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer** of cytochrome P450 enzymes [^112b5BZC]. The relationship between oseltamivir and CYP450 enzymes can be summarized as follows:

- **No CYP450 involvement**: Oseltamivir is not metabolized by any CYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, or CYP2B6 [^114Vsn6K] [^111CUuGt].

- **No inhibition or induction**: Oseltamivir does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes, minimizing the risk of drug-drug interactions mediated by these enzymes [^112b5BZC] [^114q9FBA].

- **Primary metabolism by esterases**: The conversion of oseltamivir to its active metabolite is exclusively mediated by hepatic esterases, predominantly CES1 [^115gyFAN] [^112B21Gr].

---

## Clinical implications of CYP450-independent metabolism

The **absence of CYP450 involvement** in oseltamivir metabolism has several important clinical implications:

- **Minimal drug-drug interactions**: Oseltamivir's metabolism is unlikely to be affected by co-administered drugs that inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes, reducing the risk of clinically significant drug interactions [^111CUuGt] [^112Wdk6B].

- **Consistent pharmacokinetics**: Oseltamivir exhibits consistent pharmacokinetic properties across different patient populations, including pediatric, adult, and geriatric patients, due to the lack of CYP450-mediated variability [^112A4T6o] [^114Vsn6K].

- **No dose adjustment required**: Since oseltamivir is not metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, no dose adjustments are necessary when co-administered with CYP450 inhibitors or inducers [^112b5BZC] [^112yzM8N].

## Summary of oseltamivir metabolism

| **Metabolic pathway** | **Enzyme involved** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary metabolism | Hepatic esterases (CES1) [^112b5BZC] [^115E1iaR] | Conversion to active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate) [^112B21Gr] |
| CYP450 metabolism | None | No involvement; no drug-drug interactions [^114Vsn6K] |
| Excretion | Renal elimination | Oseltamivir carboxylate eliminated unchanged in urine [^112b5BZC] |

---

## Conclusion

Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is **not metabolized by any CYP450 enzyme** [^112Wdk6B]. Its metabolism is exclusively mediated by hepatic esterases, specifically **carboxylesterase 1 (CES1)** [^115E1iaR] [^112B21Gr]. This CYP450-independent metabolism significantly reduces the risk of drug-drug interactions and ensures consistent pharmacokinetic properties across patient populations [^114q9FBA] [^112A4T6o].

### Carboxylesterase 1 polymorphism impairs oseltamivir bioactivation in humans [^115E1iaR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Bioactivation of the antiviral agent oseltamivir to active oseltamivir carboxylate is catalyzed by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). After screening 860 healthy Finnish volunteers for the CES1 c.428G > A (p. Gly143Glu, rs121912777) polymorphism, a pharmacokinetic study with 75 mg oseltamivir was conducted in c.428G > A carriers and noncarriers. Heterozygous c.428GA carriers (n = 9) had 18% larger values of oseltamivir area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0–∞)) (P = 0.025) and a 23% smaller carboxylate-to-oseltamivir AUC(0–∞) ratio (P = 0.006) compared to noncarriers (n = 12). This demonstrates that the CES1 c.428G > A polymorphism impairs oseltamivir bioactivation in humans.

### Tamiflu [^112b5BZC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Elimination**: Absorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90%) eliminated by conversion to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir declined with a half-life of 1 to 3 hours in most subjects after oral administration. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in urine. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate declined with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects after oral administration.

- **Metabolism**: Oseltamivir is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized. Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms.

- **Excretion**: Oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated entirely (> 99%) by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 L/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/h), indicating that tubular secretion (via organic anion transporter) occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20% of an oral radiolabeled dose is eliminated in feces.

### Worldwide distribution of cytochrome P450 alleles: A meta-analysis of population-scale sequencing projects [^1133DR2V]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Drug response is highly variable between individuals, resulting in 40–70% of patients exhibiting a lack of efficacy of pharmacological treatment or adverse drug reactions. Importantly, it is estimated that 15–30% of this variability is caused by genetic polymorphisms. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and their roles in drug metabolism have been extensively studied and constitute major determinants of drug response, as they are responsible for 80% of phase 1 drug metabolism and 65–70% of drug clearance. Furthermore, metabolism by polymorphic phase 1 enzymes, primarily CYPs, has been implicated in an increased risk of drugs to cause adverse drug reactions.

The human CYP supergene family consists of 57 genes; however, 12 of the encoded enzymes are responsible for more than 75% of all phase 1 drug oxidation reactions. Importantly, these CYP genes are highly polymorphic and harbor a large repertoire of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations. This diversity is primarily based on low evolutionary constraints due to the lack of essential endogenous functions of the encoded gene products and genetic drift. Yet, although the vast majority of such polymorphisms are rare, with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) < 1%, pharmacogenetic testing in the clinics is currently restricted to validated and experimentally characterized variants for the derivation of qualified predictions about phenotypic consequences of the observed genetic variation patterns.

### Tamiflu [^114Vsn6K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug with activity against the influenza virus [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Absorption and bioavailability**: Oseltamivir is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of TAMIFLU (oseltamivir phosphate) and is extensively converted predominantly by hepatic esterases to oseltamivir carboxylate. At least 75% of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation as oseltamivir carboxylate, and less than 5% of the oral dose reaches the systemic circulation as oseltamivir (see Table 6). Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate are proportional to doses up to 500 mg given twice daily (about 6.7 times the maximum recommended TAMIFLU dosage) [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Coadministration with food had no significant effect on the peak plasma concentration (551 ng/mL under fasted conditions and 441 ng/mL under fed conditions) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (6218 ng∙h/mL under fasted conditions and 6069 ng∙h/mL under fed conditions) of oseltamivir carboxylate.

- **Distribution**: The volume of distribution (Vss) of oseltamivir carboxylate, following intravenous administration in 24 subjects (TAMIFLU is not available as an IV formulation), ranged between 23 and 26 liters. The binding of oseltamivir carboxylate to human plasma protein is low (3%). The binding of oseltamivir to human plasma protein is 42%, which is insufficient to cause significant displacement-based drug interactions.

### Bench to bedside: Pharmacogenomics, adverse drug interactions, and the cytochrome P450 system [^116eB4UF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

As physicians attempt to improve the quality of health care, one area of particular concern has been preventable medical errors from adverse drug interactions. The cytochrome P450 family of enzymes has been implicated in a large number of these preventable, adverse drug interactions. This report reviews the basic biochemistry and pharmacogenomics underlying the reactions catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. An emphasis is placed on the phenotypic variations within a population and the resulting clinical effects. In addition, six members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily that are responsible for the metabolism of the majority of pharmaceutical agents are profiled in detail. These enzymes, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2, are reviewed with regard to their phenotypic variation in the population and the resulting clinical and therapeutic implications.

### Cytochrome p450: a target for drug development for skin diseases [^1153dF73]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) superfamily constitute the most versatile and important class of drug-metabolizing enzymes induced in mammalian skin in response to xenobiotic exposure. Simultaneously, CYP plays numerous significant roles in the metabolism of both endogenous and exogenous substrates within the skin. For instance, they are involved in the metabolism of therapeutic drugs, fatty acids, eicosanoids, sterols, steroids, vitamin A, and vitamin D, among others. Moreover, in certain skin diseases, such as psoriasis, many CYP enzymes are elevated.

CYP is a target of keen interest in drug development for skin diseases because nearly all drugs available to dermatologists are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of this enzyme family. Understanding drug metabolism in the skin and the role of CYP in skin pathology and therapy is an essential area for future research. Gaining a detailed insight into the mechanisms of action of various cutaneous CYP, which are capable of modulating drug bioavailability, will assist in devising improved strategies for novel therapies for the increasing array of skin disorders. This brief review explores some of these perspectives and suggests additional research concerning the expression and modulation of CYP in mammalian skin, as well as their implications for dermatological disorders and skin disease therapy.

### Prostaglandins and inflammation [^1118XiMo]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

Prostaglandins are lipid autacoids derived from arachidonic acid. They both sustain homeostatic functions and mediate pathogenic mechanisms, including the inflammatory response. They are generated from arachidonate by the action of cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, and their biosynthesis is blocked by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including those selective for inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2. Despite the clinical efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prostaglandins may function in both the promotion and resolution of inflammation. This review summarizes insights into the mechanisms of prostaglandin generation and the roles of individual mediators and their receptors in modulating the inflammatory response. Prostaglandin biology has potential clinical relevance for atherosclerosis, the response to vascular injury, and aortic aneurysm.

### Genome-wide discovery of drug-dependent human liver regulatory elements [^114zXvP7]. PLoS Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions to drug treatment constitute a substantial health problem that is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The differential expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters is a major determinant of inter-individual drug response variability. By sequestering and metabolizing drug compounds in the liver and intestine, these enzymes and transporters effectively determine whether target organs and tissues are exposed to optimal drug dosages. Several coding mutations in these proteins have been detected, which lead to adverse outcomes and reduced drug activity. Regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancers, also likely play an important role that has so far been largely uncharacterized. The systematic identification of drug-responsive regulatory elements would thus provide a unique resource to discover novel genetic variants that lead to differences in drug response.

The vast majority of pharmaceutical compounds are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family (CYP) of enzymes. Of these, CYP3A4 is the most abundantly expressed in sites of drug disposition in the liver and is thought to be responsible for the metabolism of at least 50% of prescribed pharmaceuticals. CYP3A4 activity can vary 5–20 fold between individuals, and its mRNA expression can vary as much as 120-fold. Only a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the immediate CYP3A4 locus have been found to be associated with CYP3A4 hepatic expression, suggesting that its variable expression could be caused by other genes.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of oseltamivir phosphate PO (also known as Tamiflu):

- **Bacterial infections**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as bacterial infections may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza.

- **Gastrointestinal adverse events**: Use caution in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, as oral suspension of oseltamivir contains sorbitol and can cause dyspepsia and diarrhea.

- **Neuropsychiatric adverse events**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as oseltamivir has been associated with an increased risk of abnormal behavior and delirium.

- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as oseltamivir has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and erythema multiforme.

### Genital chlamydia trachomatis: An update [^116KSji4]. The Indian Journal of Medical Research (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Chlamydia trachomatis infection:

- **Definition**: C. trachomatis infection is a common bacterial STI characterized primarily by urethritis in males and endocervicitis in females.

- **Pathophysiology**: The obligate intracellular bacteria C. trachomatis is responsible for the disease and may be transmitted through oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

- **Disease course**: The most common manifestations include urethritis in men and mucopurulent cervicitis, urethritis, and endometritis in women. Disease progression may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which, in pregnancy, results in premature delivery and puerperal and neonatal infections.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: C. trachomatis infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15–2.94).

### Tremfya [^1136bVbp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **CYP450 substrates**: The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, interferon) during chronic inflammation. Results from an exploratory drug-drug interaction study in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis suggested a low potential for clinically relevant drug interactions for drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, but the interaction potential cannot be ruled out for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. However, the results were highly variable because of the limited number of subjects in the study.

Upon initiation of Tremfya in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and consider dosage adjustment as needed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Fluvoxamine maleate [^112ETPWA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Fluvoxamine's interaction with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes is significant. Multiple hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative biotransformation of various structurally different drugs and endogenous compounds. Most knowledge about the relationship between fluvoxamine and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system is derived from pharmacokinetic interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers; some preliminary in vitro data are also available. Substantial interactions of fluvoxamine with certain drugs have been found, along with limited in vitro data for CYP3A4. This evidence suggests that fluvoxamine inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of other drugs, such as:

- **CYP1A2**: Examples include warfarin, theophylline, propranolol, and tizanidine.
- **CYP2C9**: Example includes warfarin.
- **CYP3A4**: Example includes alprazolam.
- **CYP2C19**: Example includes omeprazole.

In vitro data suggest that fluvoxamine is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Approximately 7% of the normal population has a genetic code that results in reduced activity levels of the CYP2D6 enzyme. Such individuals are commonly referred to as "poor metabolizers" (PM) of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and tricyclic antidepressants. Although none of the drugs studied for drug interactions significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine, an in vivo study of fluvoxamine single-dose pharmacokinetics in 13 PM subjects demonstrated altered pharmacokinetics.

### Mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate accounting for physiological changes to predict exposures in neonates and infants [^112A4T6o]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Estimates of structural parameters and covariate effects for the final population PK model, including interindividual variability parameters and residual model parameters, were determined. Oseltamivir clearance, central volume, intercompartment clearance, peripheral volume, and metabolism rate increased with weight, with the power coefficients (RSE%) of 1.03 (3.2%), 0.65 (13.2%), 1.58 (4.7%), and 1.95 (5.8%), respectively. Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) clearance and central volume also increased with weight, with power coefficients (RSE%) of 0.75 (fixed) and 1.44 (7.9%), respectively. These parameters increased with weight up to 43 kg (4.2%) and were independent of weight for heavier subjects. Sex had no influence on model parameters.

The intersubject variability of oseltamivir absorption rate, clearance, metabolism rate, and OC clearance was moderate, ranging from 30.4–34.5%, with shrinkage of these random effects estimated at 17.5%, 11.9%, 26.0%, and 3.9%, respectively. The residual variability of oseltamivir concentrations was high (45.4%), whereas the residual variability of OC concentrations was low (16.2%). Models that incorporated a hepatic maturation function were tested but were not superior to the final model, indicating that the dependencies of oseltamivir clearance and metabolism rate on weight fully describe the developmental changes in hepatic function in the pediatric population.

### Clinical importance of the cytochromes P450 [^114MZyGf]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily comprises 57 genes. These genes code for enzymes that play roles in the metabolism of drugs, foreign chemicals, arachidonic acid, and eicosanoids; cholesterol metabolism and bile-acid biosynthesis; steroid synthesis and metabolism; vitamin D(3) synthesis and metabolism; retinoic acid hydroxylation; and various functions that are still unknown. Initially believed to be mainly a hepatic drug detoxication system, cytochrome P450 is now understood to conduct myriad enzymic reactions implicated in vital life processes. Mutations in many CYP genes can cause inborn errors of metabolism and contribute to numerous clinically relevant diseases.

### Interpretation of cytochrome P-450 inhibition and induction effects from clinical data: Current standards and recommendations for implementation [^114q9FBA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Agents that modify cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzyme activity are characterized as strong, moderate, or weak inhibitors or inducers based on the magnitude of their impact on substrate exposure in clinical studies. Criteria for these classifications are simple and semiquantitative. However, the assignment of a given agent to a CYP inhibitor or inducer category is often complicated by limitations of the published data, inconsistent study findings, and other factors.

CYP inhibitor and inducer categories are commonly used as a basis for differentiating drug interaction management recommendations. For example, product labeling for a CYP substrate may recommend avoidance in combination with strong inhibitors and dose reduction in combination with moderate inhibitors. When such recommendations exist, ambiguity or variability in placement of inhibitors or inducers into categories can introduce potentially harmful variations in clinical drug interaction management.

Failure to adequately reflect the drug interaction potential of an agent by under-categorizing it (e.g. calling it weak when data point to moderate effects) may lead clinicians to respond inadequately to real risks or to ignore potential interactions altogether. Over-categorization may lead to actions such as over-adjustment of substrate doses or unnecessary avoidance of optimal treatments. This review describes the criteria for assignment of CYP inhibitor and inducer categories, summarizes common circumstances leading to ambiguous or variable CYP inhibitor and inducer categorizations, and proposes an approach to address these issues.

### Clinical studies on drug-drug interactions involving metabolism and transport: Methodology, pitfalls, and interpretation [^112EFdgL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

There are multiple potential pitfalls in the design and conduct of drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies that can lead to inaccurate results, ethical problems, false alerts, or, in the worst case, failure to identify relevant DDI risks. Particularly, deficiencies in preclinical data or lack of understanding of the importance of specific pharmacokinetic pathways have led to failures to identify clinically hazardous DDIs. Past cases that have led to market withdrawals, such as those of cerivastatin, cisapride, and terfenadine as victim drugs and sorivudine as a perpetrator, have been caused mainly by failure to understand basic mechanistic issues, together with dose-dependent toxicity of the victim drugs. Notably, we are not presenting an exhaustive review of all possible pitfalls but instead describe three case examples of pitfalls that can lead to inappropriate conclusions of the DDI risk.

In the late 1990s, a lack of understanding of the importance of the enzyme CYP2C8 in drug metabolism was evident. Eventually, the gemfibrozil-cerivastatin interaction revealed the potential significance of the enzyme following a series of in vitro and clinical studies that were needed to understand the mechanisms of this DDI. Initially, cerivastatin was introduced to the market with arguments of a favorable interaction potential due to its metabolism by both CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. However, it was shortly thereafter withdrawn from the market in 2001 owing to multiple cases of rhabdomyolysis. In about half of the cases, the patients had been using gemfibrozil and cerivastatin concomitantly.

### Prediction of the impact of cytochrome P450 2C9 genotypes on the drug-drug interaction potential of siponimod with physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling: A comprehensive approach for drug label recommendations [^117Nj9EM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

The predicted geometric mean AUC inf ratios of siponimod (0.25 mg, single dose at day 5) with a coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (100 mg b.i.d.) in CYP2C9✱1/✱2 (1.18) and CYP2C9✱1/✱3 genotypes (1.29) were different from the clinical observations (0.90, 0.76, respectively; unpublished data 13), indicating an apparent induction potential of itraconazole on the PK of siponimod rather than an inhibition effect.

A potential explanation for the miss-predictions would be the involvement of another metabolizing enzyme of siponimod (i.e. CYP1A1), which was identified in the in vitro enzyme phenotyping study as a minor pathway. CYP1A1 was not considered for the PBPK model due to its low abundance in the noninduced state. However, additional investigations indicated that the potential involvement of CYP1A1 was not likely to be the root cause of the decreased siponimod exposure in the presence of itraconazole (unpublished data 13), as the itraconazole in vitro CYP1A1 inhibition effect is stronger than its induction potential.

The underlying mechanism leading to these clinical observations is currently unknown. However, it is considered that the effect observed was specific to itraconazole. It is concluded that other CYP3A4 inhibitors, without the effect observed with itraconazole (e.g. clarithromycin), should act as strong and selective CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in increased AUCRs of siponimod > 1 when coadministered. The basis for this assumption is the good correlation between observed and predicted DDI results of the dual perpetrators (CYP2C9/CYP3.

### Tamiflu [^116UU1TR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cell culture studies have shown that influenza A virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate can be recovered through the serial passage of the virus in cell culture with increasing concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate. Reduced susceptibility of the influenza virus to inhibition by oseltamivir carboxylate may be conferred by amino acid substitutions in the viral neuraminidase and/or hemagglutinin proteins.

### Prediction of the impact of cytochrome P450 2C9 genotypes on the drug-drug interaction potential of siponimod with physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling: A comprehensive approach for drug label recommendations [^1169va7J]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Effect of inhibitors**: In the presence of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, predicted siponimod AUC inf inhibition ratios tended to increase with reduced CYP2C9 metabolic activity in the different genotypes. The AUCRs increased from 1.24 in CYP2C9✱1/✱1 up to 1.49 in CYP2C9✱2/✱3. The CYP2C9✱3/✱3 genotype population showed a significantly higher drug-drug interaction (DDI) risk, with a predicted AUCR of 4.20.

In the presence of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin, an increase in predicted siponimod AUC inf inhibition ratios was observed, increasing from 1.14 in CYP2C9✱1/✱1 to 1.30 in CYP2C9✱2/✱3. The AUCR was larger for the CYP2C9✱3/✱3 genotype (2.42), suggesting a higher DDI risk.

In the presence of the weak CYP3A4/2C9 inhibitor fluvoxamine, the predicted AUCRs ranged between 1.42 in CYP2C9✱1/✱1 and 1.31 in CYP2C9✱2/✱3. A further decrease in the AUCR was predicted in the CYP2C9✱3/✱3 genotype (1.12) due to the dual inhibition of the metabolic pathways.

- **Effect of inducers**: In the presence of strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C9 inducer rifampin, the predicted AUCR ranged between 0.32 (CYP2C9✱1/✱1) and 0.21 (CYP2C9✱3/✱3), and the C max ratios ranged between 0.5 and 0.27, respectively. Both metabolic pathways of siponimod were impacted, and only a small difference in the induction effect was predicted between CYP2C9 genotypes.

### Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: Systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^1154zUsR]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

- **Selection of studies**: We included randomized controlled trials testing the effects of oseltamivir for treatment, prophylaxis, and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. Treatment was the use of oseltamivir in people showing signs of influenza-like illness that might be caused by influenza A and B viruses. Prophylaxis referred to the use of oseltamivir when there was an expectation of potential exposure to influenza in the near future. Post-exposure prophylaxis was defined as the use of oseltamivir after probable exposure to influenza but before symptoms developed. Studies that were open-label and those not involving naturally occurring influenza were excluded.

	- Because of discrepancies between published and unpublished reports of the same trials, we decided to include only those trials for which we had unabridged clinical study reports. Two authors (PD and TJ) reapplied inclusion criteria for the full clinical study reports received in 2013 and resolved disagreements through discussion.

- **Types of participants**: Randomized controlled trials had to be in children and adults who either were healthy before exposure to respiratory agents or had a chronic illness (such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension), excluding people whose immune systems had been affected by diseases such as malignancy or HIV infection. Exposure had to be naturally occurring influenza, with or without symptoms.

	- We analyzed the intention-to-treat and safety populations, as our previous review had discovered compelling evidence that the intention-to-treat influenza-infected subpopulation was deemed to be in…

### Clinical studies on drug-drug interactions involving metabolism and transport: Methodology, pitfalls, and interpretation [^112yzM8N]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Properties of suitable index substrates of drug-metabolizing enzymes**: The most important property of an index substrate for drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies is sensitivity for the specific pharmacokinetic pathway investigated. In the context of drug-metabolizing enzymes, the fraction metabolized by the enzyme should optimally be greater than 80%, allowing for an over fivefold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) when the enzyme is completely inhibited. Furthermore, other disposition mechanisms of the index substrate should be known in detail, particularly when the perpetrator has the potential to cause interactions via other mechanisms. The properties of the substrate should also be suitable for thorough characterization of its pharmacokinetic parameters in a clinical study.

Most importantly, the elimination half-life (t 1/2) of the probe should be sufficiently short to avoid unnecessarily long sample collection needed to cover 80–90% of its total AUC and washout period. From this point of view, efavirenz, warfarin, and desipramine are far from ideal index substrates. Particularly if it is important to quantify a transient effect on enzyme activity, an index drug with extensive first-pass metabolism and a short t 1/2 should be preferred. An optimal index substrate exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and has no effects on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. Tolerability and lack of toxicity are also key issues, and the safety margin should be large enough to cover changes of several folds in exposure. Other desirable qualities for an index…

### Mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate accounting for physiological changes to predict exposures in neonates and infants [^115gyFAN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir is a prodrug, which is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized to its active form, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), via high‐capacity human carboxylesterase‐1 (HCE‐1), located predominantly in the liver. After hydrolysis of oseltamivir, the poorly permeable active form OC is released slowly from the liver into the systemic circulation, leading to a relatively long OC plasma half‐life. OC is a potent, stable, and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase enzymes and is excreted unchanged by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion by the organic anion transport (OAT) system.

The pharmacokinetics (PKs) of oseltamivir and OC are linear and dose‐proportional over a dose range of 50–500 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) oseltamivir. Twice‐daily administration of 75 mg oseltamivir in adolescents and adults, and 2 mg/kg oseltamivir in children aged 1–12 years, led to an area under the curve from 0–12 hours (AUC 0‐12h) at steady‐state of approximately 3,000 hour*ng/mL. Oseltamivir was well tolerated at doses up to and including 500 mg b.i.d. in healthy adult volunteers. Gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea and vomiting, occurred more frequently, and in a dose‐related fashion in healthy volunteers exposed to high unit doses (≥ 200 mg) of oseltamivir.

### Frequencies of clinically important CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 alleles are graded across Europe [^113HD9NJ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Interindividual variability in therapeutic drug response can result in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or lack of efficacy, constituting a key challenge for health care systems. Notably, 40–70% of patients experience insufficient drug response or drug toxicity, and ADRs account for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, with up to 30% being life-threatening in at-risk subpopulations. Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or drug targets explain around 20–30% of these interindividual differences.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes constitute a polymorphic superfamily, consisting of 57 functional members in humans, that metabolize over 80% of all clinically used medications. Among these, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are of particular clinical relevance, as they are highly polymorphic and implicated in the metabolism of numerous widely prescribed drugs. CYP2C19 substrates include the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, and imipramine; the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram and sertraline; the antifungal voriconazole; as well as the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel. CYP2C19✱2 (rs4244285) is the most common allelic variant in Caucasians and results in aberrant splicing and loss-of-enzyme activity. In contrast, the regulatory polymorphism rs12248560 defining CYP2C19✱17 increases transcriptional activity and causes ultrarapid CYP2C19 metabolism.

### Relationship between drug-induced interstitial lung diseases and cytochrome P450 polymorphisms [^1172um45]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Interstitial lung disease, particularly drug-induced varieties, can arise due to drugs or drug-drug interactions. This review explores the possible role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in such diseases.

The CYP enzyme family is pivotal in metabolizing various ingested, injected, or inhaled xenobiotic substances. Though the liver is the primary site for CYP enzyme metabolism, recent discoveries have detected more CYP isoforms in lung tissue. Polymorphisms in CYP genes can alter the metabolic activity of these enzymes, potentially causing localized toxic reactions and tissue damage.

Drug toxicity may result from absent or minimal enzyme activity, especially if no other metabolic routes exist. In cases of reduced enzyme activity, it is advised to reduce the dosage or prescribe an alternative drug metabolized by a different, unaffected CYP enzyme to prevent toxic side effects. Therefore, understanding a patient's CYP profile prior to drug prescription could prevent drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Furthermore, it might explain severe adverse effects from inhaled, injected, or ingested xenobiotic substances.

### Cytochrome P450 2c8: Substrates, inhibitors, pharmacogenetics, and clinical relevance [^116UFsZt]. Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 has been a relatively neglected member of the human CYP2C family. Over the period from 2000 through 2003, PubMed searches with the keyword CYP2C8 returned only 10% to 15% of the citations obtained for all of the CYP2C enzymes combined. However, in the past year, a crystal structure for CYP2C8 has been described. New inhibitors and probe substrates for the enzyme have been in development, the first case study was published linking CYP2C8 genetic polymorphisms to a disease state, and there has been increasing awareness of the role that CYP2C8 plays in the disposition of therapeutic agents, especially from the pharmacogenetic and drug-drug interaction perspectives. This report discusses baseline characteristics of the enzyme and summarizes recent developments in these areas and their clinical relevance.

### The importance of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP2D6 in palliative medicine [^113rE3LQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

The enzymes in the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system (CYP) are the major enzymes responsible for metabolizing medications. The CYP2D6 isomer is responsible for metabolizing certain opioids, neuroleptics, antidepressants, and cardiac medications. Owing to CYP2D6's low capacity and high affinity, it is easily saturated by substrate and/or inhibited, resulting in pharmacokinetic interactions. Polymorphisms of the structural gene are common, leading to wide inter-individual and ethnic differences in drug metabolism. Clinically important drug interactions, which may be anticipated in the palliative medicine population, are reviewed.

### Mice as clinically relevant models for the study of cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism [^112ni9SK]. Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

The cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene superfamily comprises a large group of hemoproteins with diverse functions in steroid, lipid, and xenobiotic metabolism. The human genome is estimated to contain 57 genes that encode functional CYP proteins, a number of which are important for the metabolism of foreign chemicals, including carcinogens and most therapeutic drugs. Given that metabolic interactions are a major source of adverse drug interactions, a comprehensive understanding of CYP function is critically important for the development and safe clinical application of drugs. While some cross-species genetic conservation of CYPs exists, drug metabolism can differ between humans and other mammalian species. The development of humanized mice that replicate many aspects of human drug metabolism has provided invaluable experimental models that circumvent this limitation to a considerable degree. This brief review focuses on the value and limitations of mouse models for the study of drug metabolism in humans.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^113nd9Kf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

It should not be surprising that treatment for uncomplicated influenza will only produce a modest effect because influenza virus replication precedes symptoms by 1–2 days. This means that the viral load in the patient may have peaked by the time the patient begins antiviral treatment. Given that most antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir, act by reducing viral replication, the effect of treatment will therefore be minimal in otherwise healthy persons when immune responses are already reducing viral titers. It is therefore plausible that community-based randomized controlled trials are not capturing critical information about the mode of action of oseltamivir that is beneficial to severely ill patients.

It is possible that the benefit to severely ill patients may be related to the increased duration of viral shedding and higher viral loads found in this group of patients. Elevated cytokine levels, sometimes referred to as a cytokine storm, have been detected for patients infected with highly pathogenic A(H5N1) virus and for severely ill patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza viruses. A randomized controlled trial study of 117 healthy adults experimentally infected with seasonal influenza virus A(H1N1) reported that oseltamivir treatment significantly reduced interleukin-6, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α cytokine responses in patients compared with responses in placebo-treated patients. Although these results do not clarify whether the decreased cytokine response was the result of effective viral treatment or a (postulated) immune modulation.

### The systems biology of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters: Relevance to quantitative systems pharmacology [^114L2GXE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Since their discovery, cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes — heme proteins that catalyze numerous so‐called phase I chemical reactions, such as hydroxylation, oxidation, and reduction — have been often described as drug and toxicant metabolizing enzymes (phase I DMEs). The growth of information regarding CYP450‐mediated drug metabolism, coupled with knowledge of phase II conjugation pathways, including the UDP‐glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) that catalyze the covalent linkage of glucuronic acid to substrates, has allowed for the prediction of drug interactions at the level of metabolism, leading to greater safety in the prescription of certain drugs. Further individualization of drug therapy is achieved through understanding genetic polymorphisms in DMEs that affect drug metabolism and are thereby linked to response or toxicity. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to synthesize the huge amount of data regarding phase I and phase II DMEs in physiology, particularly as it pertains to links with transporters, we will highlight some examples of how the endogenous roles of these enzymes connect to SLC and ABC transporters in certain physiological contexts.

### Baraclude [^1124E9Ki]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The metabolism of entecavir was evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Entecavir is neither a substrate, inhibitor, nor inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system. At concentrations up to approximately 10,000-fold higher than those obtained in humans, entecavir inhibited none of the major human CYP450 enzymes including 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, 2B6, and 2E1. Additionally, at concentrations up to approximately 340-fold higher than those observed in humans, entecavir did not induce the human CYP450 enzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 3A5, and 2B6. The pharmacokinetics of entecavir are unlikely to be affected by coadministration with agents that are either metabolized by, inhibit, or induce the CYP450 system. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of known CYP substrates are unlikely to be affected by coadministration of entecavir.

The steady-state pharmacokinetics of entecavir and coadministered drugs were not altered in interaction studies with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Mechanism of action**: Entecavir, a deoxyguanosine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV reverse transcriptase (rt), is efficiently phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form, which has an intracellular half-life of 15 hours. By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir triphosphate functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV reverse transcriptase: (1) base priming, (2) reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and (3) synthesis of the positive strand.

### Tamiflu [^112Wdk6B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Elimination**: Absorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90%) eliminated by conversion to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir declined with a half-life of 1 to 3 hours in most subjects after oral administration. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in urine. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate declined with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects after oral administration.

- **Metabolism**: Oseltamivir is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized. Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms.

- **Excretion**: Oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated entirely (> 99%) by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 L/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/h), indicating that tubular secretion (via organic anion transporter) occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20% of an oral radiolabeled dose is eliminated in feces.

### Xofluza [^115V6CWB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Drug interaction studies: No clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil and its active metabolite, baloxavir, were observed when coadministered with itraconazole (a combined strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor), probenecid (UGT inhibitor), or oseltamivir. Similarly, no clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs were observed when coadministered with baloxavir marboxil: midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), digoxin (P-gp substrate), rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate), or oseltamivir.

- **Animal studies**:
	- **Polyvalent cations**: In monkeys, a 48% to 63% decrease in baloxavir exposure was observed when Xofluza was coadministered with calcium, aluminum, magnesium, or iron. No study has been conducted in humans.

- **In vitro studies**:
	- **Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes**: Both baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 and do not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4.
	- **Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) enzymes**: Both baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir do not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, or UGT2B15.
	- **Transporter systems**: Both baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Baloxavir does not inhibit organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, or MATE2K.

Mechanism of action: Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted by hydrolysis to baloxavir, the active form.

### Tamiflu [^111kiNij]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Lactation risk summary**: Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tamiflu and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Treatment of influenza**: The safety and efficacy of Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)] and is based on:
	- **13 to 17 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age was supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents and younger pediatric patients and safety data in adolescents treated with Tamiflu in a study of treatment and prophylaxis.
	- **1 year to 12 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age was supported by results of one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 452 pediatric patients with influenza in whom Tamiflu 2 mg per kg twice daily or placebo was administered within 48 hours of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Tamiflu [^111CUuGt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Oseltamivir is extensively converted to oseltamivir carboxylate by esterases, located predominantly in the liver. Drug interactions involving competition for esterases have not been extensively reported in the literature. The low protein binding of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate suggests that the probability of drug displacement interactions is low.

In vitro studies demonstrate that neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a good substrate for P450 mixed-function oxidases or for glucuronyl transferases.

- **Drug interaction with probenecid**: Coadministration of probenecid results in an approximate two-fold increase in exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate due to a decrease in active anionic tubular secretion in the kidney. However, due to the safety margin of oseltamivir carboxylate, no dose adjustments are required when coadministering with probenecid.

- **Coadministration with other drugs**: No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions have been observed when coadministering oseltamivir with amoxicillin, acetaminophen, aspirin, cimetidine, antacids (magnesium and aluminum hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine, amantadine, or warfarin.

Oseltamivir phosphate is an ethyl ester prodrug requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase, affecting the release of viral particles. The median IC50 values of oseltamivir against influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2, and influenza B clinical isolates were 2.5 nM (range 0.93–4.16 nM, N = 74), 0.96 nM (range 0.13–7.95 nM, N = 774), and 60 nM, respectively.

### Decoding the selective chemical modulation of CYP3A4 [^114QDm7t]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

In this work, we embarked on the challenging undertaking to develop selective CYP3A4 inhibitors and uncovered the structural basis of such selectivity. Our findings provide much-needed understanding in the design of chemicals that can be used to lessen drug-drug interactions. A growing number of patients take multiple medications concurrently to treat various and unrelated illnesses.

The higher prevalence of polypharmacy can increase health risks due to drug-drug interactions, leading to unintended and potentially fatal consequences. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are main players in drug metabolism, responsible for the chemical modification and degradation of the majority of FDA-approved drugs. It is estimated that more than 90% of common chemicals, 66% of carcinogens, and more than half of currently marketed drugs are metabolized by CYPs. Hence, CYP3A4/5 can affect the plasma concentration of drugs or alter their chemical structure to generate toxic metabolites.

### Tamiflu [^112B21Gr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug with activity against the influenza virus [see Microbiology (12.4)]. It is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of TAMIFLU (oseltamivir phosphate) and is extensively converted predominantly by hepatic esterases to oseltamivir carboxylate. At least 75% of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation as oseltamivir carboxylate, and less than 5% reaches the systemic circulation as oseltamivir.

Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate are proportional to doses up to 500 mg given twice daily, which is about 6.7 times the maximum recommended TAMIFLU dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Coadministration with food had no significant effect on the peak plasma concentration (551 ng/mL under fasted conditions and 441 ng/mL under fed conditions) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (6218 ng∙h/mL under fasted conditions and 6069 ng∙h/mL under fed conditions) of oseltamivir carboxylate.

- **Distribution**: The volume of distribution (Vss) of oseltamivir carboxylate, following intravenous administration in 24 subjects (TAMIFLU is not available as an IV formulation), ranged between 23 and 26 liters. The binding of oseltamivir carboxylate to human plasma protein is low (3%). The binding of oseltamivir to human plasma protein is 42%, which is insufficient to cause significant displacement-based drug interactions.

### Mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate accounting for physiological changes to predict exposures in neonates and infants [^1132ycws]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of this modeling work was to describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of oseltamivir, including formation rate kinetics of oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), administered to subjects from birth to 40 years old, to detail the developmental physiological changes occurring during the first 2 years of life, and to identify the covariates that influence oseltamivir PK in the target population. All available PK data from 317 pediatric patients enrolled in 13 studies were included in the dataset, alongside data from 119 young adults (aged 18–40 years) with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL/minutes/1.73 m²).

Different population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models have been developed previously. The same structural model as applied to adult patients with and without renal impairment was used, as it accounts for physiological aspects of the PK of oseltamivir. The absorption part of the model includes three first-order processes and a compartment that describes the oseltamivir to OC conversion. From this compartment, representing the liver, OC is relatively slowly released into the systemic circulation, leading to a prolonged half-life (flip-flop kinetics). This model was modified to address maturational changes.

The metabolism of oseltamivir to OC is mediated via the HCE-1 enzyme, located predominantly in the liver and at low levels in the intestine. A surge occurs in the expression of HCE-1 during the postneonatal stage, such that the hydrolytic capacity of HCE-1 is gained rapidly after birth. Age-dependent hydrolysis via the HCE-1 enzyme could, in theory, affect exposure to oseltamivir.

### Influenza virus polymerase inhibitors in clinical development [^117522gw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Formulations in development include tablets for oral administration and a solution for intravenous administration (NCT02659735). Oral pimodivir demonstrates dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, with a mean terminal plasma T 1/2elim of about 24 h, such that steady-state levels are reached between days 3–4 of dosing. It is metabolized by CYP 3A4 but has no effect on cytochrome P450 activity. The low renal elimination (∼5%) suggests that pimodivir does not require dose adjustments for renal insufficiency. No meaningful pharmacokinetic differences were found in hospitalized influenza patients between younger (aged 18–64 years) and elderly (65–85 years) adults. In a drug–drug interaction study, oseltamivir increased pimodivir C max by 31% with no change in C min or AUC 12 h; pimodivir had no effect on oseltamivir.

### Mini-series: II. Clinical aspects. Clinically relevant CYP450-mediated drug interactions in the ICU [^1175bE9p]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

In the critically ill, multiple drug therapies for acute and chronic conditions are often used at the same time, and adverse drug events occur frequently. Many pharmacological and disease-related factors, such as altered renal and hepatic function, catecholamine-related circulatory changes, altered drug volume of distribution, enteral versus parenteral feeding, and morbid obesity, along with concomitant multiple drug regimens, may account for the wide inter-individual variability in drug exposure and response in critically ill patients and the high risk for drug-drug interactions to occur. The practicing intensivist must remain aware of the major mechanisms for drug-drug interactions, among which the drug-metabolizing enzyme inhibitory or induction potential of associated chemical entities are paramount.

Metabolism-based drug-drug interactions are largely due to changes in levels of drug-metabolizing enzymes caused by one drug, leading to changes in the systemic exposure clearance of another. Among the numerous drug-metabolizing enzymes identified at the time of writing, the activity of cytochrome P450s (CYP450) is a critical determinant of drug clearance and appears to be involved in the mechanism of numerous clinically relevant drug-drug interactions observed in critically ill patients.

- **Discussion**: This manuscript will cover a practical overview of clinically relevant CYP450-mediated drug-drug interactions. Medications frequently used in the intensive care unit, such as benzodiazepines, immunosuppressive agents, opioid analgesics, certain anticonvulsants, the azoles, and macrolides, are highlighted in this context.

### Rapivab [^115ifmZu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Peramivir is an antiviral drug with activity against influenza virus [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: At twice the maximum recommended dose, Rapivab did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The pharmacokinetics of Rapivab was evaluated in Phase 1 trials in adults. The pharmacokinetic parameters following intravenous administration of Rapivab (0.17 to 2 times the recommended dose) showed a linear relationship between dose and exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC). Following intravenous administration of a single dose of Rapivab 600 mg over 30 minutes, a maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of 46,800 ng/mL (46.8 μg/mL) was reached at the end of infusion. AUC0-∞ values were 102,700 ng
- hr/mL.

	- **Distribution**: In vitro binding of peramivir to human plasma proteins is less than 30%. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the central volume of distribution was 12.56 L.

	- **Metabolism and elimination**: Peramivir is not a substrate for CYP enzymes, does not affect glucuronidation, and is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein mediated transport. Peramivir is not significantly metabolized in humans. The elimination half-life of Rapivab following IV administration to healthy subjects of 600 mg as a single dose is approximately 20 hours. The major route of elimination of Rapivab is via the kidney. Renal clearance of unchanged peramivir accounts for approximately 90% of total clearance. Negligible accumulation was observed following multiple doses, either once or twice daily.

### The role of cytochrome P450 in tumour development and progression and its potential in therapy [^117Km5aW]. The Journal of Pathology (2000). Low credibility.

The cytochromes P450 (P450) are a large group of constitutive and inducible haem-containing enzymes, which have a central role in the oxidative metabolism of a diverse range of xenobiotics. Many P450 substrates are carcinogenic, while other substrates are anti-cancer drugs; the P450s thus have various potentially important roles in tumour biology. Several P450 genes are polymorphic and are associated with the increased risk of cancer development in specific tissues. Individual P450s, especially CYP1B1, are overexpressed in different types of tumours. The increased expression of P450s in tumours is highly significant and is important for understanding tumour development and progression. The tumour-specific expression of P450 provides the basis for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

### Decoding the selective chemical modulation of CYP3A4 [^114MWxNm]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Drug-drug interactions are associated with the concurrent use of multiple medications. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolizes a large portion of marketed drugs. To maintain the efficacy of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, pan-CYP3A inhibitors, such as ritonavir, are often co-administered. Although selective CYP3A4 inhibitors offer greater therapeutic benefits by avoiding unintended CYPs and undesirable clinical consequences, the high homology between CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 has hindered the development of such selective inhibitors. A series of selective CYP3A4 inhibitors with scaffolds identified by high-throughput screening are reported here. Structural, functional, and computational analyses reveal that the differential C-terminal loop conformations and two distinct ligand binding surfaces disfavor the binding of selective CYP3A4 inhibitors to CYP3A5. Structure-guided design of compounds validates the model and yields analogs that are selective for CYP3A4 versus other major CYPs. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of selectively inhibiting CYP3A4 and provide guidance for designing better CYP3A4 selective inhibitors.

### Identification of genetic variants of human cytochrome P450 2D6 with impaired mitochondrial targeting [^116pDqv3]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is responsible for the metabolism of approximately 20% of drugs in common clinical use. The CYP2D6 gene locus is highly polymorphic, and many of the polymorphisms have been shown to be clinically relevant, accounting for inter-individual differences in the metabolism of specific drugs. In addition to the established sources of variability in CYP2D6-dependent drug metabolism, a recent study in our laboratory identified CYP2D6 in the mitochondria of human liver samples and found that it is metabolically active in this novel location.

In the present study, we show that mutations are present in the targeting signal region of CYP2D6, potentially accounting for the inter-individual variability previously observed in the level of the mitochondrial enzyme in human liver samples. These mutations were identified within the ER targeting domain, the proline-rich domain, as well as the putative protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC)-specific phosphorylation sites. In vitro studies demonstrate that the mutations identified in the targeting signals affect the efficiency of mitochondrial targeting of CYP2D6. Since the mitochondrial enzyme has been shown to be active in drug metabolism, this pharmacogenetic variation could play a role in modulating an individual's response to drug therapy.

### Briviact [^111D7CJn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Elimination**: Brivaracetam is primarily eliminated by metabolism and by excretion in the urine. More than 95% of the dose, including metabolites, is excreted in the urine within 72 hours after intake. Fecal excretion accounts for less than 1% of the dose. Less than 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Thirty-four percent of the dose is excreted as the carboxylic acid metabolite in urine. The terminal plasma half-life (t1/2) is approximately 9 hours.

- **Metabolism**: Brivaracetam is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis of the amide moiety to form the corresponding carboxylic acid metabolite, and secondarily by hydroxylation on the propyl side chain to form the hydroxy metabolite. The hydrolysis reaction is mediated by hepatic and extra-hepatic amidase, while the hydroxylation pathway is mediated primarily by CYP2C19. In human subjects possessing genetic variations in CYP2C19, production of the hydroxy metabolite is decreased 2-fold or 10-fold, while the blood level of brivaracetam itself is increased by 22% or 42%, respectively, in individuals with one or both mutated alleles. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and patients using inhibitors of CYP2C19 may require dose reduction. An additional hydroxy acid metabolite is created by hydrolysis of the amide moiety on the hydroxy metabolite or hydroxylation of the propyl side chain on the carboxylic acid metabolite (mainly by CYP2C9). None of the three metabolites are pharmacologically active.

### Akeega [^111tU7fs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Drug interactions:

- **Strong CYP3A4 inducers**: Avoid coadministration. Coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased abiraterone concentrations, thus potentially reducing its effectiveness [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **CYP2D6 substrates**: Avoid coadministration of Akeega with CYP2D6 substrates for which minimal changes in concentration may lead to serious toxicities. If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate. Akeega, being a CYP2D6 moderate inhibitor, increases the concentration of CYP2D6 substrates, which may elevate the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **CYP2C8 substrates**: Monitor patients for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate, as minimal changes in plasma concentration may lead to serious or life-threatening adverse reactions. Akeega, a CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases the concentration of CYP2C8 substrates, raising the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Systematic and quantitative assessment of the effect of chronic kidney disease on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 [^117SHQ5f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Selection of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 model drugs. The University of Washington Metabolism and Transport Drug Interaction Database (DIDB) and the FDA's new drug application (NDA) reviews (Drugs@FDA) were searched in order to identify a comprehensive list of potential model drugs for individual elimination pathways. For our purposes, a model drug was defined as one predominantly cleared by a specific CYP isozyme in vivo based on experimentally derived area under the concentration–time curve ratio (AUCR) from DDI or pharmacogenetics studies.

The DIDB was first curated for in vitro or in vivo substrates of major CYP enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4/5. To include newly developed drugs that were not incorporated in the DIDB at the time of data curation (17 Dec. 2014), NDA reviews of recently approved small molecule drugs (approved between 2014 and July 2015) were also surveyed. In total, 937 drugs were collected as potential model drugs.

For each of the 937 drugs, available DDI studies with typical inhibitors for a specific pathway and CYP2D6 pharmacogenetic studies were examined. Typical inhibitors used in this study were fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, and terbinafine for CYP2D6; and clarithromycin, cyclosporine, erythromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, troleandomycin, and voriconazole for CYP3A4/5. If a drug showed a predefined criterion of AUCR of ≥ 3 between the presence and absence of one of the typical inhibitors, the drug was identified as a model drug.

### Tamiflu [^116RXGzo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cell culture studies reveal that influenza A virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate have been recovered by serial passage of the virus in cell culture with increasing concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate. Reduced susceptibility of the influenza virus to inhibition by oseltamivir carboxylate may be caused by amino acid substitutions in the viral neuraminidase and/or hemagglutinin proteins.

### Reduced sensitivity of influenza A (H5N1) to oseltamivir [^113geqkR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Two different strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) have been circulating since 2003. Clade 1 has been found in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Malaysia. Clade 2 subsequently emerged and spread from the People's Republic of China to Indonesia, Europe, and Africa in 2004–2005. Because of its systemic availability, oseltamivir is the drug of choice for treating infected persons.

### Pharmacogenetics affects dosing, efficacy, and toxicity of cytochrome P450-metabolized drugs [^1148xMJP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Drug-metabolizing enzyme activity is one of many factors affecting patient response to medications. The objective of this review is to highlight the potential for genetic variability in cytochrome P450 enzyme activity that can lead to interpersonal differences in response to drugs. Awareness and application of this knowledge will improve drug use in clinical practice and provide the physician with further appreciation that standard drug dosing may not be appropriate in all patients.

### The role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in endogenous signalling pathways and environmental carcinogenesis [^115Rgp45]. Nature Reviews Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Some cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme-thiolate enzymes participate in the detoxication and, paradoxically, the formation of reactive intermediates of thousands of chemicals that can damage DNA, as well as lipids and proteins. CYP expression can also affect the production of molecules derived from arachidonic acid and alters various downstream signal-transduction pathways. Such changes can be precursors to malignancy. Recent studies in mice have changed our perceptions about the function of CYP1 enzymes. We suggest a two-tiered system to predict an overall inter-individual risk of tumorigenesis based on DNA variants in certain 'early defence' CYP genes, combined with polymorphisms in various downstream target genes.

### 2020 European guideline on the management of syphilis [^11666zWP]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for syphilis, specifically concerning cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend considering CSF assessment in asymptomatic patients to exclude asymptomatic neurosyphilis under the following conditions:

- **HIV-positive patients**: Late syphilis with CD4 cells ≤ 350/mm³ and/or a serum VDRL/RPR titer > 1:32.

- **Serological results**: Failure, defined as less than a 4× decrease in the antibody titer of a non-treponemal test 6–12 months after early syphilis treatment, or serofast, indicated by the persistence of a low antibody titer (i.e. ≤ 4) of a non-treponemal test 1–2 years after early syphilis treatment.

- **Alternative treatment**: Patients who have received alternative treatments, such as doxycycline, for late syphilis.

### Mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate accounting for physiological changes to predict exposures in neonates and infants [^116FN7vg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Orally administered oseltamivir has been approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in adults and children. The treatment of influenza includes infants from 2 weeks of age onward according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and from birth onward according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) summary of product characteristics. However, dosing recommendations are not intended for premature infants (i.e. those < 38 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) due to insufficient data availability. Different dosing may be required for these patients due to the immaturity of physiological functions.

Acosta et al. collected data in premature infants and the results suggested that an oseltamivir dose of 1 mg/kg b.i.d. produced oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) exposures similar to those observed in older infants and children receiving a 3 mg/kg b.i.d. dose. To make exposure predictions for infants, including neonates, and for untested doses, consideration should be given to developmental physiological changes affecting the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of oseltamivir and OC. Key factors include HCE‐1 levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and tubular secretion.

The expression of HCE‐1 increases rapidly until the end of the first year of life. Analysis of liver samples from three different age groups indicated that adults (≥ 18 years) expressed significantly higher HCE‐1 levels than children (0–10 years) or fetuses (82–224 gestational days). Furthermore, adult (≥ 18 years) liver microsomes were approximately 4 times more active than child (0–10 years) microsomes and 10 times more active than fetal (82–224 gestational days) microsomes.

### The effect of cytochrome P450 metabolism on drug response, interactions, and adverse effects [^113WsG6s]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are essential for the metabolism of many medications. Although this class has more than 50 enzymes, six of them metabolize 90% of drugs, with the two most significant enzymes being CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Genetic variability (polymorphism) in these enzymes may influence a patient's response to commonly prescribed drug classes, including beta blockers and antidepressants.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes can be inhibited or induced by drugs, resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse reactions or therapeutic failures. Interactions with warfarin, antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and statins often involve the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Knowledge of the most important drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, as well as the most potent inhibiting and inducing drugs, can help minimize the possibility of adverse drug reactions and interactions. Although genotype tests can determine if a patient has a specific enzyme polymorphism, it has not been determined if routine use of these tests will improve outcomes.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115Q8gE9]. Chest (2022). Low credibility.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is an enzyme that plays a fundamental role in the metabolism of medications. Drugs with CYP450 activity may be inhibitors, inducers, substrates, or a combination thereof for a specific CYP450 enzymatic pathway that can change the metabolism of concurrently administered medications. Inhibitors are substances that reduce an enzymatic pathway of CYP450 and may cause increased concentrations of other drugs metabolized by the same pathway, resulting in drug toxicity. Inducers are substances that induce an enzymatic pathway of CYP450, which may increase the metabolism of other drugs by the same pathway, leading to subtherapeutic drug levels and treatment failure. Although more than 50 isoforms of CYP450 have been discovered, six of them (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19) metabolize 90% of drugs, with the two most significant enzymes being CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.

As our understanding of CYP450 metabolism continues to grow, new agents undergo extensive drug interaction studies performed before becoming available. However, not all agents have been tested in combination, and at times drug interactions are hypothesized based on known metabolic pathways. As a result, drug-drug interactions may include the magnification of known potential adverse effects. Not all cytochrome P450-mediated drug interactions are clinically significant, and thus may or may not require dosage adjustments. Active drug transporters, P-glycoprotein, and human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) also play an important role in drug elimination and affect the bioavailability.
