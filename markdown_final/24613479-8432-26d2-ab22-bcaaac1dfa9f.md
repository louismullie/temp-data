## Question

5. A triangular playground has sides, in metres, measuring 7,24 and 25. Inside the playground, a lawn is designed so that the distance from each point on the edge of the lawn to the nearest side is 2 metres. What is the area of the lawn?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the area of a lawn inside a triangular playground with sides 7, 24, and 25 meters, where every point on the lawn's edge is exactly 2 meters from the nearest side of the triangle. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the triangle's geometry and whether it is a right triangle. Then, I should calculate the inradius and confirm whether the lawn can exist as a 2-meter offset. Next, I will determine the scaling factor for the inner triangle and compute its area. Finally, I will double-check the logic and state the answer clearly with units.

> Let me first confirm the triangle's shape. With sides 7, 24, and 25, I should check if 7² + 24² equals 25², because that would make it a right triangle. 7² is 49, 24² is 576, and 49 + 576 is 625, which equals 25², so yes, this is a right triangle with the right angle opposite the 25-meter side, and its area is (1/2) × 7 × 24 = 84 square meters [^notfound].

> Now, I need to find the inradius, since the lawn's edge is defined by a constant distance of 2 meters from each side, which implies the lawn is bounded by a smaller triangle parallel to the original and inset by 2 meters. The inradius r of a right triangle is given by r = (a + b − c)/2, where c is the hypotenuse, so r = (7 + 24 − 25)/2 = 6/2 = 3 meters. Wait, let me verify that formula; yes, for a right triangle, the inradius simplifies to (leg1 + leg2 − hypotenuse)/2, so the inradius is indeed 3 meters [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the lawn's existence. The lawn requires a uniform 2-meter offset inward from all sides, which is only possible if the offset distance is less than the inradius. Since 2 meters is less than 3 meters, such an inner triangle exists, and its boundary is precisely 2 meters from the nearest side everywhere, which matches the problem statement [^notfound].

> Next, I should determine the scaling factor. The inset triangle is similar to the original, and the distance from each side to the corresponding inset side is 2 meters, so the inset distance equals the inradius minus the offset, which is 3 − 2 = 1 meter. Therefore, the linear scale factor k for the inset triangle is the ratio of the inset inradius to the original inradius, which is 1/3. Let me double-check that logic: if the original inradius is 3 and the inset inradius is 1, then the inset triangle is scaled by 1/3 relative to the original, which is correct [^notfound].

> I will now examine the area calculation. Because area scales with the square of the linear factor, the area of the inset triangle is k² times the area of the original triangle. So, (1/3)² × 84 = 1/9 × 84 = 84/9 = 28/3 square meters. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 84/9 simplifies to 9.33, but that would be a decimal approximation; the exact fractional form is 28/3, which is approximately 9.33 square meters, so I should keep the exact fraction for precision [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the overall logic to ensure there are no gaps. The key steps are: confirm the right triangle and compute its area, calculate the inradius, verify that the offset 2 m is less than the inradius so the inset triangle exists, determine the linear scale factor from the inradii, and square the scale factor to get the area ratio. All of these steps align and lead to the same conclusion, so I am confident in the result [^notfound].

> Final answer: The area of the lawn is 28/3 square meters, which is approximately 9.33 square meters [^notfound].

The lawn is the **inner triangle** formed by moving each side of the playground inward by 2 meters. The original triangle is a right triangle with area 84 m² and inradius 3 m. The lawn's area is the area of the original triangle minus the area of the three trapezoidal strips and the three corner sectors, which together equal the area of the original triangle minus the area of the inner triangle. The inner triangle is similar to the original with a linear scale factor of 1/3, so its area is (1/3)² × 84 = 28/3 m². Therefore, the area of the lawn is **28/3 m²** (approximately 9.33 m²).

---

## Step 1: verify the triangle type and calculate the area

The triangle has sides 7, 24, and 25 meters. Check if it is a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem:

- 7² + 24² = 49 + 576 = 625
- 25² = 625

Since 7² + 24² = 25², the triangle is a **right triangle** with the right angle between the 7 m and 24 m sides. The area of a right triangle is (1/2) × base × height:

Area = (1/2) × 7 × 24 = 84 m²

---

## Step 2: calculate the inradius of the triangle

The inradius (r) of a right triangle is given by:

r = (a + b - c) / 2

where a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse. Substituting the values:

r = (7 + 24–25) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3 m

---

## Step 3: determine the inner triangle (lawn)

The lawn is the set of points 2 meters from the nearest side, which forms a smaller triangle inside the original. This inner triangle is **similar to the original**, with sides parallel and a uniform offset of 2 m. The inradius of the inner triangle is the original inradius minus the offset:

r_inner = 3–2 = 1 m

The linear scale factor (k) of the inner triangle relative to the original is the ratio of inradii:

k = r_inner / r = 1 / 3

---

## Step 4: calculate the area of the lawn

The area of similar triangles scales with the square of the linear scale factor. Thus, the area of the inner triangle (lawn) is:

Area_lawn = k² × Area_original = (1/3)² × 84 = 84 / 9 = 28/3 m²

---

## Final answer

The area of the lawn is **28/3 m²**, which is approximately 9.33 m².

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Acute canopy deficits in global cities exposed by the 3-30-300 benchmark for urban nature [^6d6e5c44]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Therefore, the analysis converted each building into a centroid, and each park into a set of points at 2 m intervals. Nearest neighbour analysis used the building centroid as a base, and identified only the nearest park point, thereby avoiding duplication. With each building centroid now equipped with a set of coordinate attributes for its nearest park, generation of the 'from-to' line (linking an origin-destination pair) became possible. The 'from-to' line and the road layer were then fed into the 'shortest path' analysis for routing. This effectively measured a walking route along the road network for each from-to pair. However, testing a prototype of the analysis, we found that the tool calculates distances between intersections, sometimes routing a walker to an intersection some distance from their actual park destination. Therefore, a 'chopper' tool was created to break every road into 10 m segments, ensuring that routing calculated routes that start and finish as close as possible to the relevant park and building points. Even with this improvement added, the shortest path tool struggled at times to find routes between buildings and parks where one end of the trip was that were slightly distant from a road, so we added a 'snapping distance' to the shortest path calculator, which automatically brought origin and destination vertices onto the network at a maximum distance of 100 m. This introduces a level of approximation to estimates of walking distance but avoids producing a high proportion of 'path not found' responses. Even with the snapping tool active, a portion of legitimate paths was not solved by the tool, and on inspection, these were often in locations where buildings closely abutted parks with no interceding road – an example of this problem is included in Supplementary 6.

This posed a risk of underestimating the accessibility of parks to these properties because recording the '300' test result for these properties as 'path not found' would fail to recognise that these are often places that have very convenient park access. Accordingly, we added a final step which analysed any 'path not found' properties and determined whether they were in a crow-flies distance of under 50 m. We replaced any 'path not found' attributes for these buildings with the measured distance, thereby recognising these locations as likely 'pass' results for the 300 test.

### Improved human greenspace exposure equality during 21century urbanization [^84df8e6c]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

There are also some levels of limitations that should be acknowledged in this study. First, although the integration of 30-m-resolution Landsat satellite with a spectral unmixing approach can help resolve the sub-pixel greenspace mapping, our method is still unable to explicitly identify certain greenspace types in small and fragmented patches at the Landsat's resolution, such as street plantation, lawns, and pocket gardens and parks, given the heterogeneous landscape of cities. Therefore, satellites with a higher spatial resolution such as 10-m Sentinel-2, 3-m PlanetScope, and sub-meter WorldView imageries can be incorporated to offer advanced observational opportunities for urban greenspace mapping, but one of the key challenges is how to develop robust spatiotemporal reconstruction algorithms for generating high-quality historical archives. Second, the spatial distributions of greenspace and population footprints within each year of this study are static without modeling spatiotemporal interactions between greenspace and humans dynamically. On the one hand, people living in cities are spatially moving in their daily routines, being exposed to different nearby green environments beyond those near to their place of residence. On the other hand, seasonal changes in urban greenspace that reflect different phenological phases will influence the greenspace availability over time. Therefore, a promising open topic for follow-up research is to integrate a human mobility dataset with dynamic greenspace observations to enable a spatially and temporally explicit human-greenspace interaction framework and move toward real-time greenspace exposure assessment. Third, a global sample of 1028 cities is adopted to investigate urban greening and greenspace exposure inequality across a large geographical spectrum, allowing us to make conclusions that transcend the local observations that limit many greenspace studies. We acknowledge, however, that the area criterion of 100 km 2 excludes small and medium-sized cities, which are home to millions of people. It will be of interest to compare our results for spatially large cities with a replicated study of smaller cities, since cities of different sizes use space distinctly and have different socio-economic functions and greenspace scales with city size in predictable ways. These unique processes, in turn, influence the greenspace supply-demand relationship and associated temporal development trajectory, further underscoring the importance of this analysis. One future research direction is to explore the associations of a wider spectrum of urban characteristics (e.g. size, shape, density, function, and socio-economic structure) with greenspace, and measure specific human-centric exposures. Clearly, another important factor in assessing the degree and distribution of access or exposure to greenspace is demographic structure such as gender, age, income, and race. In the present study, greenspace exposure differences across population groups are not considered, since their measurement and a technical consideration of between-group equity is beyond the scope of our methods in this study. We therefore talk in terms of equality, rather than equity of exposure and our measurements relate to human population counts abstracted from specific population sub-groups. A deeper understanding of greenspace exposure and demographic structure is becoming socially and politically urgent, which will help identify 'hotspot' areas with less greenspace that disproportionately affect certain vulnerable populations, and potentially help quantify the variations in health outcomes.

### Danger zone assessment in small-sided recreational football: providing data for consideration in relation to COVID-19 transmission [^8d1dcd0a]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Design

Positional data were retrieved from various recreational SSGs that took place before the COVID-19 lockdown (table 1). Positional data were collected using GPS units (MinimaxX S4, Catapult Innovations, Canberra, Australia) sampling at 10 Hz on all participants in various SSGs using different game formatting. Data were retrieved from various groups of recreationally trained adult men aged 18–43 years and U10 boys aged 8–9 years playing SSGs, as described in table 1.

Table 1
Game ID and game format characteristics for the included game formats

DZ calculation

X and Y coordinates from the tracking data were retrieved, and data were filtered using a Butterworth fifth-order low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.08 Hz using a built-in MatLab function (The MathWorks, Inc, New York, USA). To evaluate the risk of being infected, a DZ was constructed as a circle with a radius of 1.5 m around each player's position. In addition to the circular zone, a tail followed each player as an area of the player's position up to 6 s ago. The tail that follows a player is modelling the decline in the amount of virus that stay airborne. Gravity pulls the droplets towards the ground, and air resistance opposes this motion. This is modelled as an exponential decline in exposure score, and our function is based on the studies by Wells (1934)and Wang et al (2020). The danger value of this tail exponentially declines with a half-life of 2 s. Thus, being within the area of 1.5 m from the other player returns a danger score of 1, while being in the area where the other player was 2 and 4 s ago equates to danger scores of 0.5 and 0.25, respectively.

If a player is within multiple zones at the same time, the score is determined as the maximal score of the zones. Accordingly, the maximal danger score at any time and position is 1. An exposure score is calculated based on the sum of all danger scores divided by the sample frequency (10 Hz), which is then translated to how much time a player spent in DZ throughout the game. The calculations were performed with one infected player in each game and repeated until all participants had acted as the infected player, as previously described. Moreover, number of contacts was evaluated as the number of times a player entered in DZ, and the time of each entry was noted.

Action levels for lead — current action levels identified by HUD and EPA define thresholds for lead in paint, dust, and soil. For paint, lab analysis thresholds are 5,000 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 5,000 parts per million (ppm) 0.5% lead by weight, and x-ray fluorescence is 1 milligram per square centimeter (mg/cm²). For dust, floors are 40 micrograms per square foot (μg/ft²); window sills are 250 μg/ft² and window troughs are 400 μg/ft² (clearance only). For soil, high-contact bare play areas are 400 ppm and other yard areas are 1,200 ppm. Lead is considered a potential hazard if above the following levels, but can be a hazard at lower levels if improperly handled.

### Painted playgrounds for preschoolers' physical activity and fundamental motor skill improvement: a randomized controlled pilot trial of effectiveness [^3d0d2629]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The "Painted Playgrounds" was a randomized controlled trial study occurring in four ECE centers (two intervention; two waitlist control). The centers were identified using a public list assembled by the state Department of Education comprised of licensed ECE centers within a metropolitan county of a southeastern U.S. state. ECE centers were eligible if they were currently licensed, enrolled at least 20 children between the ages of three to six years, and had available concrete area within their outdoor play environment to allow for stenciling three designs. Trained researchers reviewed the outdoor play setting and assessed eligibility of available area for stenciling (i.e. square footage and surface substrate). If ECE centers were eligible, written approval and consent were obtained from the ECE center's director/administrator to allow for the playground stenciling and playground observations.

Preschoolers at these ECE centers were eligible if they were between the ages of three to six years, enrolled full-time (at least six hours/day, five days/week), and planned to attend the same ECE center for the study duration (the following eight to nine weeks). Parents/guardians of preschoolers provided written consent for the child measurements (i.e. height, weight, accelerometry) and were provided with an opt-out letter as passive consent for the playground observation. The study was also explained in a child-friendly manner to participants, and preschoolers were given the opportunity to refuse measurements. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Pennington Biomedical Research Center.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^7c40204d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Real-world cities

In this section, we study the properties of the subway systems in Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto under the lens of our framework. We choose monocentric cities, fairly isolated from other major urban centers, with a tree-like subway structure. We identify the intersection point of the real subway lines in all three cases as the city center. We see that this point corresponds to the downtown area in the three cities.

First, we incorporate real population data in our model. We rely on a two-dimensional triangular lattice multiplex model; we use the population data and the appropriate coordinates reference systems to impose the triangular lattice structure onto the city landscape. Details on the data and modeling of the city population distribution can be found in the Methods section. We denote all quantities relative to the real physical system using the same notation as for the multiplex model, but we add a tilde on top of the corresponding symbol. For example, R indicates the radius of the lattice model, anddenotes the radius of the city. Overlaying a city on top of the triangular lattice allows us to associate a weightto each node n in the slow layer that reflects the real population density within the city. We use those weights in the objective function of Eq. (6), and then take advantage of the greedy algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to the optimization problem of Eq. (4). Similar to the previous sections, we obtain two classes of optimal fast-layer configurations for all the considered parameters. Results for the city of Toronto are displayed in Fig. 4, where we see that optimal configurations comprise k ✱ = 1 (Fig. 4 a) or k ✱ = 2 (Fig. 4 b) branches. Similar results are valid for Atlanta and Boston, where we observe optimal configurations with k * ≤ 3 branches (see Supplementary Information Figure 11). For k * > 1, we note that the branches have no identical length; this is caused by the fact that the weight associated with the various nodes of the system is not constant. A typical phase diagram for Toronto is displayed in Fig. 4 c, where we fix η = 0.5, but vary L and c. The diagram is qualitatively similar to the one of Fig. 3 e. For fixed c, k * increases as L grows; however, for fixed L, k * decreases as c grows. The values of the parameters where the transitions between the various phases emerge differ from those of Fig. 3 e; this is due to the non-homogeneous density of the population used in the model of the city. Similar results for Atlanta and Boston can be found in the Supplementary Information Figure 11.

### Activity mapping of children in play using multivariate analysis of movement events [^c05391b0]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 5 A shows an expanded view of the PCA plot (shaded area in Fig. 4 A). The raw traces, from two children juxtaposed in the PCA plot, indeed confirm that their acceleration profiles are highly correlated across the whole of the play duration (Fig. 5 C and D). Dendrogram plots provide an alternative to PCA for identifying hierarchical clustering of children based on their activity profiles. Figure 5 B shows the dendrogram for all traces, sorted into 30 clusters using a weighted method with arithmetic mean (WPGMA), operating on the pairwise distance matrix between all points in the multivariate space (Euclidean distance). This provides information on groups of children with similar activity, for example, cluster 17 encompasses the children shown in the red square on the PCA plot. It also allows quantitative assessment of similarity/dissimilarity using the cluster separation metric.

FIGURE 5
A, Expanded view of the gray shaded area in PCA plot of Figure 4, with similar pair (black line) and similar group (red dash line) of children highlighted. B, dendrogram plot showing cluster relationships, cluster 17 corresponds to the red-dash highlighted area of the PCA plot. C and D, Acceleration magnitude plots for the pair of children highlighted by the black outline in the PCA plot.

Longitudinal study of the PCA plot provides insight on the daily activity patterns of the children. As an example, two children with differing patterns of play are shown highlighted in Figure 6. Child A exhibits highly varied activity profiles with large day-to-day variance in the level and the time pattern of physical motion, whereas child B displays a tight cluster of points from consistent daily activity patterns. Analysis of the varying activity profiles across a week also point to social influences on play. The extremely consistent play pattern of child B is disrupted on the Friday of the study week, and they have a much reduced activity level on this day. Inspection of the PCA plot shows that the upper left region, in which the Friday play data of child B sits, is dominated by a cluster of other data points from Friday activity traces for children from the same class. The time-dependent acceleration traces for all of this group show an extended period of inactivity between the 15- and 25-min points of the play session (see additional figures, Supplemental Digital Content 1, Appendix — supplementary information). Thus, there is strong circumstantial evidence that the altered play pattern of child B is due to the influence of their peer group.

### Activity mapping of children in play using multivariate analysis of movement events [^9df454b1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

where δ t i and δ d i are the time and amplitude differences, respectively (see Fig. 2 C), t motif is the duration of the motif signal, and n DTW is the total number of samples in the time warped signals. These event parameters can be displayed for a complete activity session in the form of a simple scatter plot. The plot obtained from the sample trace in Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2 D. This provides an individualized, contextual map of movement, and a ready visualization of the child's activity during play. Each point identifies a movement event, thus their density quantifies the amount of activity undertaken and corresponds to the information gathered in a traditional approach, where activity counts are recorded. Here, however, there is also information on the form of each movement, captured in the x and y coordinate values. The Δ d value gives an immediate indication as to the intensity of the movement with the zero point being the reference level of walking (~3 MET·h for the 4 km·h −1 motif). The Δ t value informs on how close the time phasing of acceleration is to a walk step. Values of Δ t > 0 indicate the magnitude of the fractional difference in duration of each movement event to that of the walking stride motif. This is an absolute number and so does not differentiate between shorter or longer duration. Comparison to the motif standard also allows benchmarking of the child's activity to that undertaken in a controlled environment. The areas outlined in red in Figure 2 B indicate the range of values obtained when the motif is compared with other events in the treadmill-study acceleration signal, from which it is extracted. This shows the evolution from walk areas (low Δ t, 3–5 km·h −1) to running (high Δ t, 9–13 km·h −1). The red shaded area centered at zero Δ d is the parameter state space covered by multiple step events acquired at 4 km·h −1 (i.e. stride-to-stride variability in the motif itself). The overlay of data from a staged walk to run exercise of the treadmill (red sections) onto the map of the child's movement (black circles) provides an immediate visual assessment of their activity in the 40 min of play. The spread of data shows the range of activity intensity and indicates the degree of variability compared with the controlled movement on a treadmill running through a sequence of set speeds. A number of features are evident in the child's movement map: (i) a majority of low-intensity events have greater Δ t values than the motif sequence (3–5 km·h −1 section), this reflects the shorter stride duration relative to the adult walk motif; (ii) there is a wide range of movement profile with events (black circles) spanning a continuous area that encompasses the 3- to 13-km·h −1 treadmill reference set; (iii) there are ultrahigh intensity outlier events, which reflect movement for which the sum acceleration is well above that within a gait step produced by an adult running at high speed (13 km·h −1).

### Playground design and physical activity [^3c018545]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study compares traditional post-and-platform playgrounds with innovatively designed playgrounds to assess the degree to which design influences use and physical activity. Innovative playgrounds are defined as having (1) a variety of surface types; (2) naturalized and planted areas designed for play; (3) open-ended structures that do not dictate play sequences; (4) loose, movable equipment; and (5) not comprised solely of traditional post-and-platform structures. This study also examines how neighborhood contextual factors contribute to playground use and physical activity.

Methods

The authors selected 30 traditional and 30 innovative playgrounds in 10 U.S. cities and used the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities to document the number and characteristics of users during 19 hourly observations over 1 week at each playground in the summer of 2021. Data were analyzed to identify the factors associated with the number of users and the amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity within each playground.

Results

Innovative playgrounds attracted 2.5 times more users and generated almost 3 times as much moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. After controlling for playground size, population density, neighborhood poverty, and destination location, innovative playgrounds still attracted 43% more visitors than traditional playgrounds. Whereas playgrounds in high-poverty neighborhoods saw less overall use, innovatively designed playgrounds mitigated the difference by 60% compared with traditional playgrounds.

Conclusions

Playground characteristics that attract more users and are associated with more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, such as design, size, and the number of unique features, should be integrated into future playground designs and renovations, with innovative designs prioritized for low-income neighborhoods.

### Playground safety and access in Boston neighborhoods [^f7311440]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Youth physical activity is partly influenced by access to playgrounds and recreational opportunities. Playgrounds in disadvantaged areas may be less safe.

Methods

Investigators assessed safety at 154 playgrounds in Boston between July 2000 and July 2001. Playgrounds were geocoded and safety scores assigned to census block groups (CBGs). For each of Boston's 591 CBGs, investigators calculated the total number youth and proportions of black residents, adults without a high school degree, and youth living in poverty. Investigators assigned each CBG a safety score, and calculated distance from the CBG centroid to the nearest playground and nearest "safe" playground (top safety quartile). Statistical analyses were completed using SAS PROC GENMOD by October 2002.

Results

In bivariate analysis, playground safety was inversely associated with total CBG youth population (p = 0.001) and proportions of black residents (p < 0.001), youth in poverty (p = 0.003) and residents with no high school degree (p < 0.002). The proportion of black residents in the CBG was inversely associated with safety (p = 0.013), independent of CBG educational attainment and numbers of youth. The average distance was 417 meters to the nearest playground and 1133 meters to the nearest "safe" playground. Distance to the nearest playground was inversely associated with the proportion of residents with no high school degree (p < 0.0001) after controlling for numbers of youth and proportion of black residents. CBGs with more youth had greater distances to the safest playgrounds (p = 0.04).

Conclusions

In Boston, playground safety and access to playgrounds varied according to indicators of small-area socioeconomic and racial/ethnic composition.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^7c3febb5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Due to the asymmetrical shape of the trapezoid environment, the procedure for generating a movement trajectory above leads to a slightly biased sampling of the wide part of the trapezoid, and less exploration of the middle and top parts of the shape. To deal with this, we made a slight change to the possible steps after generating a step that brings the agent out of the environment, described below. For each trial, the step was generated as before. If the generated step was out of the environment, the step was cancelled, and the next step was determined as follows. If the step generated would have brought the agent out of the bottom of the trapezoid, the next step was sampled from [0, 0, 1, 1] (stay or up). If the step brings the agent out to the top, the next step was sampled from [−1, −1, 0, 0] (down or stay). When the step takes the agent out of the left of the trapezoid, then the next step to be sampled on the horizontal axis were [0, 1, 1, 2, 4], towards the inner portion of the environment. If the step took the agent out of the right side of the trapezoid, the next step was generated as before, from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4]. This is because when the agent is out of the trapezoid on the horizontal (left-right) axis, the agent could still be in the middle of the shape on the vertical axis, since the shape becomes more narrow as it reaches the right. Finally, when it lands exactly in the middle of the horizontal axis, but is out of the shape (on the horizontal axis), the next step to be sampled from on the vertical axis is [−1, 0, 1].

### Painted playgrounds for preschoolers' physical activity and fundamental motor skill improvement: a randomized controlled pilot trial of effectiveness [^f26631bf]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, 190 ECE centers were contacted, 101 ECE centers completed phone screening, and ultimately four ECE centers participated (two ECE centers/group). The ECE centers that did not enroll were unwilling to participate (n = 4), did not offer full-time enrollment (n = 2), did not have enough preschoolers (< 20) enrolled (n = 39), and 56 ECE centers did not have adequate concrete space to paint at least three stencils within their ECE center.

The four centers that enrolled included two Head Start centers, one church-affiliated center, and one hospital-affiliated center. One Head Start was randomly assigned to each condition. The centers averaged 184 children enrolled ages zero to five (range: 90–300) and 104 in the target age range of three to five year olds (range: 30–180). Directors reported 100% of children received state funding for meals in three of the four centers, with the fourth center reporting no state funding for meals. All four centers reported being in operation for 10 years or more and being active participants in the state star (i.e. quality) rating system for ECE centers. Two of the four centers also participated in additional accreditation, with one in each condition.

During the baseline interview, directors of all four centers reported providing at least two hours of free play each day and at least 60 min of active play time per day. Two directors reported allowing "no more than 15 minutes at a time" of continuous seated time each day and two allowed "15–30 minutes but only 1 occasion" per day. All four center directors reported providing "multiple play areas, open space for running, and a track/path for wheeled toys" with "good" or "lots of" variety both indoors and outdoors. Two of the four centers offered structured programs/field trips for PA and three offered community organizations who came to the center to provide PA. All four directors reported not withholding active play time for misbehavior. Directors reported providing one or two trainings per year for teachers and one or two trainings per year for parents on PA education, and all four directors reported having a written PA policy. There were no appreciable differences in the directors' responses to questions at the end of the study period.

### Navigating the landscape of multiplayer games [^d67155a6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 10
Visualization of procedural game structure generation projected in the games landscape.

Each figure visualizes the generation of a game of specified size, which targets a pre-defined game (or mixture of games) of a different size. The three payoffs in each respective figure, from left to right, correspond to the initial procedural game parameters, intermediate parameters, and final optimized parameters. a 5 × 5 generated game with the target game set to Rock–Paper–Scissors (3 × 3). b 13 × 13 generated game with the target game set to Elo (1000 × 1000). c 13 × 13 generated game with the target game set to the mixture of Rock–Paper–Scissors (3 × 3) and Elo game (1000 × 1000). d 19 × 19 generated game with the target game set to the mixture of AlphaStar League and Go (board size = 3). Strategies are sorted by mean payoffs in b and c to more easily identify transitive structures expected from an Elo game.

Next, we consider generation of games that exhibit properties of mixtures of several target games. For example, consider what happens if 3 × 3 Rock–Paper–Scissors were to be combined with the 1000 × 1000 Elo game above; one might expect a mixture of transitive and cyclical properties in the payoffs, though the means of generating such mixed payoffs directly is not obvious due to the inherent differences in sizes of the targeted games. Using our workflow, which conducts this optimization in the low-dimensional graph-based landscape, we demonstrate a sequence of generated games targeting exactly this mixture in Fig. 10 c. Here, the game generation objective is to minimize Euclidean distance to the mixed principal components of the two target games (weighted equally). The payoffs of the final generated game exhibit exactly the properties intuited above, with predominantly positive (blue) upper-triangle of payoff entries establishing a transitive structure, and the more sporadic positive entries in the lower-triangle establishing cycles.

### Children strategically decide what to practice [^36b02577]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 4
Illustration of the procedure of Experiment 2. Children were presented with two games, in which they had to construct towers using blocks. They first familiarized themselves with each game. The easy game (in this example presented on the right) featured three easy‐to‐assemble cuboid blocks, while the difficult game (in this example presented on the left; sides and colors were counterbalanced across participants) included three oddly shaped and difficult‐to‐build blocks. The order and color of the two games were counterbalanced across participants. After the familiarization phase, we told children that they would eventually be tested on the easy game (Test‐Easy condition), on the difficult game (Test‐Difficult condition), or on a randomly chosen game (Test‐Random condition), and that they could win stickers depending on the height of the tower they built. Children were told that if they managed to build a tower out of three blocks at test, they would win one sticker; if they managed to build a tower out of six blocks, they would win two stickers (indicated with stars). If the tower collapsed, children would not win anything. We then asked the children to decide which of the two games they wanted to practice before being tested. At test, children in the Test‐Easy condition were given 6 easy blocks. Children in the Test‐Difficult condition were given 6 difficult blocks. In the Test‐Random condition, children were given a randomly chosen box containing 6 blocks of either the easy or difficult‐to‐stack blocks. A golden star on the level of three stacked blocks indicated that children won 1 sticker; two golden stars on the level of 6 stacked blocks indicated that children won 2 stickers.

We ensured through extensive pilot testing (N = 125) that our instructions were clear, and that young children could perform the tasks. All materials used in the experiment were novel and specifically built for the experiment. To ensure that building a tower with regular blocks was indeed easier than with oddly‐shaped blocks, we measured how long it took children to build a tower with each set of blocks. To avoid a bias towards larger objects, the blocks used in both games were built to have the exact same height (63 mm; for details see Supporting Information).

### Playground features and physical activity in U.S. neighborhood parks [^9544a944]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

All people need to engage in routine physical activity and children require it daily. Playgrounds are settings designed for children to be physically active, yet there has been little research assessing which play elements and structures are associated with more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among both youth and adults. We conducted a national study of neighborhood parks with the goal of identifying factors that promote more MVPA. We selected a nationally representative sample of 162 parks between 3 and 22 acres in 25 U.S. cities with a population > 100,000. We used direct observation to measure MVPA in 147 playgrounds during spring and summer of 2016, documented playground characteristics and assessed hours of use and MVPA by age group and gender. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and generalized linear models. The most common play elements and structures were slides and ladders (92% of parks) and swings (81%); elements supporting balancing, crawling, spinning, sand and water play were in < 30% of playgrounds. Each additional play element was associated with about 50% more users and 50% more MVPA. Spinning structures and splash pads were associated with more playground use and more MVPA. Playgrounds with signage advertising park programs and on-site restrooms had more person-hours of use, but only half the parks had restrooms and < 30% had signage. To address insufficient physical activity, upgrades to playgrounds should include restrooms, structures that support a wide variety of movements, and elements that also encourage adults to be active.

### Two-edge-resolved three-dimensional non-line-of-sight imaging with an ordinary camera [^4fae72db]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Through simple geometric calculations, the azimuth and elevation angles of a hidden scene point can be estimated from the slope and height of the illuminated right trapezoidal region of the observation. However, spatially extended hidden scenes do not create sharp shadows. They instead produce a superposition thereof, that is dependent on the geometry of the scene from the vantage of the observed ceiling portion, appearing as a region of highly informative penumbra(see Fig. 2 a for an example photograph of penumbra). The penumbra region encodes information about the geometry of the hidden scene from the perspective of the ceiling, along two dimensions (i.e. in azimuth and elevation angles). Efficiently extracting this information for reconstructing a general spatially extended scene is achievable through a computational algorithm presented later on.

### Are our actions aligned with our evidence? The skinny on changing the landscape of obesity [^1a0303e0]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Recent debate about the role of food deserts in the United States (i.e., places that lack access to healthy foods) has prompted discussion on policies being enacted, including efforts that encourage the placement of full-service supermarkets into food deserts. Other initiatives to address obesogenic neighborhood features include land use zoning and parks renovations. Yet, there is little evidence to demonstrate that such policies effect change. While we suspect most researchers and policymakers would agree that effective neighborhood change could be a powerful tool in combating obesity, we desperately need strong and sound evidence to guide decisions about where and how to invest.

### Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging guidelines: instrumentation, acquisition, processing, and interpretation [^a7f3127f]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

SPECT camera uniformity testing — intrinsic and extrinsic methods — states that uniformity testing is performed to verify that the camera's sensitivity response is uniform across the detector's face, and may be performed intrinsically by using a point source or extrinsically using a sheet source, usually of Cobalt-57. For intrinsic testing, a radioactive point source is positioned at a distance at least five times the crystal's UFOV from the center of the detector, and the test is usually performed immediately following verification of the energy calibration of the detector. The point source should be a small volume (approximately 0.5 mL) with activity yielding a measured count rate between 10 and 20 kilo counts per second (kcps) (7 to 11 megabecquerel [MBq]); for large rectangular cameras where the point is 7 to 8 feet [2 to 2.5 meters] away, 20 to 25 MBq may yield a similar count rate. For some older systems, a lead ring should be used to shield the outermost tubes from the radiation to prevent edge packing.

### Paediatric elbow fractures and public play spaces: adherence to standards for children's playground equipment and surfacing [^53531ff6]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Children aged 6–12 years who sustained SCHF between April 2017 and October 2019 were recruited from the paediatric orthopaedic clinic at BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which serves the entire province. Parents of eligible children were approached for recruitment and consent during their regular postinjury clinic appointments. Children from this cohort who sustained their injury playing in a public playground within a 50 km radius of the clinic were included in the study and the site was visited by a research assistant. Site of injury and exact play structure were identified either from the geotagged photographs of play structures taken by the children or as identified by the children on Google Maps at the time of recruitment into the study. At the start of the study, recruited children and families were required to go back to the site of injury to take photographs of the play structures involved in the fall and participate in multiple research visits at the 3, 6 and 12-week postinjury appointments at the orthopaedic clinic. However, this was found to be a rate-limiting step for recruitment. Hence, the methodology was revised to allow for a single interview with the children to identify the exact play structure using Google Maps' satellite view. Details of the modifications in the study methodology are published separately.

Because it was not practical to send a research assistant to measure play structures located on private property, only injuries that occurred at a public playground located in a park or at a public school were included in the present study. The play structure type and dimensions, height of the equipment at the point from which the child fell and the type and depth of the surface material were measured at each site and compared with the 2016 CSA standard, which was the most current at the time of the study (CAN/CSA-Z614-14; approved February 2015, revised September 2016). Age and sex of the child and fracture classification were also noted. Gartland 1 fractures (type 1) were classified as those with no displacement and treated with an above-elbow cast. Gartland 2 fractures (type 2) were classified as those with mild displacement and intact posterior cortex. These fractures were treated with closed reduction and taping or casting in the emergency department. Gartland 3 fractures (type 3) were classified as those with complete displacement, requiring either closed or open reduction and percutaneous pinning.

### Environmental determinants ofAbundance at a Northern limit of its range in the United States [^82416f62]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Aedes albopictus abundance was highest in areas with low- and medium-intensity development (composed of 20–49% and 50–79% impervious cover, respectively). However, high-intensity development (80–100% impervious cover), consisting of apartment complexes, row houses, and commercial or industrial buildings, did not have increased abundance. This may be because of greater availability of artificial breeding containers associated with peri-domestic human behaviors (e.g. lawn maintenance) in low- and medium-intensity development areas. Inconclusive results for high-intensity development may reflect a lack of artificial containers and suitable breeding habitat when vegetation and landscaping are sparse.

Investigations of Ae. albopictus abundance across temperate land cover types often use different definitions of "urban". A field study in Suffolk, Rockland, and Westchester counties, NYS, found that Ae. albopictus abundance increases linearly from 10% to 60% impervious cover. Whereas a field experiment examining microclimate and Ae. albopictus abundance in the southeastern United States suggested that larvae in urban areas (defined as 50–100% impervious cover) experienced lower survival rates, emerged as smaller adults, and had lower growth rates than mosquitoes at suburban sites (5–50% impervious cover). These findings indicate that Ae. albopictus abundance may have a nonlinear association with impervious cover because of microclimate influences on mosquito fitness and/or breeding habitat availability and requires study across more nuanced gradients of urbanization than is typically conducted. For researchers who are closely examining Ae. albopictus along an urbanization gradient, we find it is warranted to use finer-scale cutoffs in impervious cover that are either 1) based on datasets external to NLCD (e.g. 100-m resolution impervious surface, U.S. Geological Survey) or 2) based on their own land cover classifications of remotely sensed images.

### The effect of moving to east village, the former london 2012 olympic and paralympic games athletes' village, on physical activity and adiposity (ENABLE london): a cohort study [^d95cc13f]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Residential built-environment characteristics were derived with Geographic Information Systems data at baseline and at follow-up for those households in the Greater London area. These characteristics included street-path network distance (as opposed to straight line distance) from home to the closest park (with data from the London Development Database), public transport access, and measures of neighbourhood walkability, which is a relative index derived from a composite score of land use mix (the distribution of residential, commercial, office, entertainment, and institutional building footprints in the area), street connectivity (from the number of junctions with three or more branch roads), and residential density within a km 2 street network of the home address (appendix pp 1–2). Questionnaires and physical activity and adiposity protocols were identical at baseline and follow-up, and these were administered during home visits by a team of trained fieldworkers.

### Probable psittacosis outbreak linked to wild birds [^fba279aa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Reported symptoms of the probable psittacosis case-patients in this outbreak were similar to those described elsewhere. One other community-wide outbreak of psittacosis has been reported to be potentially associated with contact with free-ranging birds. In 1995, 16 cases of psittacosis among residents of a rural town in a forested area in southern Australia were linked to trimming and mowing lawns and time spent in a yard, which are thought to be proxies for exposure to infectious particles shed by free-ranging birds with chlamydiosis. While this 1995 study did not find a significant relationship between illness and handling of dead birds (OR 2.4, 95% CI 0.25–21.05), the OR supports the positive association between illness and handling live or dead free-ranging birds (adjusted OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.5–22, p < 0.001) found in our study. The 1995 study reported the risk of illness associated with lawn mowing was not linked to use of a grass catcher, though whether the authors differentiated between those who never used a catcher and those who sometimes used a catcher is not clear. Previous studies have linked lawn mowing with psittacosis and with primary pneumonic tularemia. In our case-control study questionnaire, we differentiated between persons who mowed only with, with and without, and only without a grass catcher. We found this probable psittacosis outbreak to be linked to lawn mowing only without the use of a grass catcher. We could find no evidence in the literature suggesting that the use of a grass catcher provides lawn mower operators some protection from inhaling infectious particles, though grass catcher marketing materials of lawn mower manufacturers in Australia suggest that grass catchers reduce the generation of dust and hence the amount of dust expelled into the operator's breathing zone.

Table 1
Mean surface area and coefficient of variation (CV) for early visual field maps

The mean surface area is calculated as the combined left and right hemispheres of the map defined from 0 to 7° eccentricity. The CV reflects the variability of surface area of a field map relative to its mean and is calculated as the standard deviation of surface area/mean surface area.

We assessed sex differences in the surface area of the maps and found little difference in the surface area of V1, V2, or V3 when comparing between male and female adults, male and female children, or when the surface area of each individual's map was normalized to the total surface area of their cortex for adults and children (all p > 0.100, two-tailed independent t-tests).

### Wildfire as a major driver of recent permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands [^e2e0bfcd]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Peat depth at each site was measured at the nearest peat plateau edge using a 3 m peat sampler (Eijkelkamp, the Netherlands) (Supplementary Table 1). Air and soil temperature at 40 cm was recorded hourly at each site for a year starting in September 2015. Two soil temperature loggers (HOBO 8k Pendant, Onset, US) were installed at 40 cm depth within each site under areas covered by lichen or char and away from any distinct hollows, in order to ensure consistent and comparable locations within all sites. Air temperature loggers were installed within a white temperature shield at ~1 m height.

Vegetation surveys were completed at each site by delineating a 50 m baseline transect along a randomly chosen geographic bearing. Three 30 m transects were established perpendicular to the 50 m transect: one at the center at the 25 m mark and two on either side of the center at randomly generated distances greater than 5 m away from the center point. Understory species abundance was estimated using the point intercept methodalong all three transects with a pin being dropped every meter. The number and type of species that touched the pin was recorded in each spot and species abundance was calculated using the following formula: Species abundance (% cover) = (number of hits per species/ total number of hits) × 100. Tree heights were visually estimated for all trees within 1 m of either side of each 30 m transect for a total sampling area of 180 m 2.

### Public parks and physical activity among adolescent girls [^3a0a4420]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Physical activity may be constrained or facilitated by local environments. The availability of neighborhood facilities for physical activity may be particularly relevant for youth, who are unable to drive and whose activity is often limited to the immediate distance they are able to walk or bicycle. Several studies have shown that proximity to recreational facilities and parks is one of the most important predictors of physical activity. Because the United States already has an extensive infrastructure of parks, with 70% of adults indicating that they live within walking distance of a park or playground, parks may be a potential venue for increasing physical activity. This might be particularly important for adolescent girls, whose physical activity levels decline substantially as they go through puberty. The goal of this study was to examine the association between park proximity, park type, and park features and physical activity in adolescent girls.

Patients and Methods

This was a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls. It included 1556 grade 6 girls who were randomly selected from 6 middle schools in each of the following 6 field site areas: Washington, DC, and Baltimore, Maryland; Columbia, South Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New Orleans, Louisiana; Tucson, Arizona; and San Diego, California. Girls wore accelerometers for 6 days to measure metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, a measure accounting for the volume and intensity of activity. Metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was calculated for the hours outside of school time using 2 different cutpoints, activity levels ≥ 3.0 metabolic equivalents and ≥ 4.6 metabolic equivalents, the latter indicating activity at the intensity of a brisk walk or higher. We mapped all of the parks within 1 mile of each girl's home. Trained staff used a checklist to document the presence of facilities and amenities at each park, including passive amenities, such as drinking fountains, restrooms, and areas with shade, as well as active amenities like basketball courts, multipurpose fields, playgrounds, and tennis courts.

Results

Mean nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity, using the 4.6 metabolic equivalent cutoff, was 611.1 minutes (range: 49.7–4718.6 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days) and 1704.8 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days (range: 276.2–5792.6 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days) when using the 3.0 metabolic equivalent cutpoint. Many girls had multiple parks within a 1-mile radius of their homes: 57% had ≥ 1 type of park, the majority being neighborhood or community parks; 42% had between 1 and 3 parks, 37% had ≥ 4 parks, and 14% had ≥ 8 parks. The type, number, and specific parks features were associated with girls' nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity. At the 4.6 metabolic equivalent cutpoint, higher levels of nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity were associated with both neighborhood and community parks (22 metabolic equivalent minutes) and miniparks (40 metabolic equivalent minutes). Each park, regardless of type, in the half-mile around each girl's home was associated with an increase in nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity by 2.8% or 17.2 nonschool minutes of metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity per 6 days. Beyond a half-mile, each park increased nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity by 1.1% or 6.7 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days. For the average girl with 3.5 parks within a 1-mile radius of home, the presence of parks accounted for 36.5 extra nonschool metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days, approximately 6% of total nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity. Using the 3.0 metabolic equivalent cutpoint, this sums to an additional 68 metabolic equivalent minutes of nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity over 6 days, or 4% of the total. The most common amenities in the parks were playgrounds, multipurpose fields, and picnic areas. Slightly more than one third of girls lived within a half-mile of a park with a basketball court, and > 20% had access to walking paths and tennis courts in their local park. Higher levels of nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity per 6 days were associated with walking paths (13 metabolic equivalent minutes), running tracks (82 metabolic equivalent minutes), playgrounds (28 metabolic equivalent minutes), and basketball courts (30 metabolic equivalent minutes). Parks with streetlights and floodlights were also associated with an increase of 18 and 22 minutes of nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity, respectively. With the 3.0 metabolic equivalent cutoff for metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity, additional nonschool metabolic equivalent minutes more than doubled when girls had miniparks (92 metabolic equivalent minutes), natural resource areas (36 metabolic equivalent minutes), walking paths (59 metabolic equivalent minutes), and running tracks (208 metabolic equivalent minutes) within a half-mile of their homes. Skateboard areas and special-use parks were negatively associated with nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity in adolescent girls.

Conclusions

Adolescent girls who live near more parks, particularly near those with amenities that are conducive to walking and with active features, engage in more nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity than those with fewer parks. Whether this is because of actual use of the parks or neighborhood choice could not be determined. Although the magnitude of the association between parks and additional minutes of metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity was small for an individual, amounting to an average of 4%-6% of a girl's total nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity, it is likely to have a large population-level association. Because of the potential population level impact, the use of parks to promote physical activity should be further studied.

### Green and lean: is neighborhood park and playground availability associated with youth obesity? Variations by gender, socioeconomic status, and race / ethnicity [^fb5f5636]. Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Parks and park features are important for promoting physical activity and healthy weight, especially for low-income and racial/ethnic minority youth who have disproportionately high obesity rates. This study 1) examined associations between neighborhood park and playground availability and youth obesity, and 2) assessed whether these associations were moderated by youth race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). In 2013, objectively measured height and weight were collected for all 3rd-5th grade youth (n = 13.469) in a southeastern US county to determine body mass index (BMI) percentiles. Enumeration and audits of the county's parks (n = 103) were concurrently conducted. Neighborhood park and playground availability were calculated as the number of each facility within or intersecting each youth's Census block group. Multilevel linear regression models were utilized to examine study objectives. For boys, no main effects were detected; however, SES moderated associations such that higher park availability was associated with lower BMI percentile for low-SES youth but higher BMI percentile for high-SES youth. For girls, the number of parks and playgrounds were significantly associated with lower BMI (b = -2.2, b = -1.1, p < 0.05, respectively) and race/ethnicity and SES moderated associations between playground availability and BMI percentile. Higher playground availability was associated with lower BMI percentile for White and high-SES girls but higher BMI percentile for African American and low-SES girls. Considerable variation was detected in associations between park and playground availability and youth obesity by SES and race/ethnicity, highlighting the importance of studying the intersection of these characteristics when exploring associations between built environment features and obesity.

### Simple spatial scaling rules behind complex cities [^23b5e063]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Spatial scaling

Our simple rules produce the AP, road network, and socioeconomic interaction distributions (see Fig. 1b, c). The AP distribution and its morphology are in good agreement with the real city of Greater London (see Fig. 1d).

The model allows us to quantify these predictions. According to the SA mechanism, when t is sufficiently large the spatial distribution of AP is approximatelywhere ρ (r, t) is the average density at distance r from the city centre, i.e. the seed node at position (0, 0), R (t) is the radius of the entire city at time t (see Fig. 2b and further details of the explicit form of ρ (r, t) are in Supplementary Note 1), and β is a parameter derived from C. The dependence of β on C (see Fig. 2a) can be derived by the non-linear fitting, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 2b. Figure 2c shows that the collected data validate Eq. (4). The AP in the real data is defined as a mixture of working and residential populations according to their active duration in that region (see Methods). In the downtown area (i.e. when r / R (t) → 0), the AP density decays following the power law shown in Eq. (4) (see Fig. 2c). In contrast, residential population density decays exponentially as we move from city centre to urban fringe, as verified in previous researchand our data (see Supplementary Fig. 8). This reconciles the conflict between area-size allometry and the exponential decay of population from city centre to urban fringe found in the literature. To eliminate the influence of noise in the empirical data and allow an unbiased comparison of different quantities, we study the cumulative quantities in terms of the distance from the central area instead of the local density (see Fig. 3). Integrating Eq. (4) we obtainwhere P (r, t) is the cumulative AP within the concentric circle of the central area with radius r (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7 for detailed derivations). This expression is approximately a power law with an exponent 2 − β when. This is consistent with the fractal city hypothesis, and the fractal dimension is 2 − β if the distributions of APs and buildings are similar. We can similarly calculate the cumulative road length and socioeconomic interactions asandTherefore the exponents of the cumulative length of the road network and socioeconomic interactions within the circle of radius r are 2 − β /2 and 2 − 3 β /2. These predictions are consistent with the data from Beijing and London shown in Fig. 3. Due to the need for high-resolution data, we use nighttime light as the proxy for socioeconomic interactions –. Although nighttime light data has some intrinsic disadvantages when representing high-resolution interactions (e.g. at a community level, because luminosity is also associated with road density and type of land use), it remains the best candidate among open-source data. We show that as long as the spatial resolution is not excessively high it is a good proxy (see Methods, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 12–14 and Supplementary Note 6 for further discussion). Thus based on Eqs. (5)–(7) we can obtain all the other spatial scaling exponents from any single observation.

### Long-term carbon sink in borneo's forests halted by drought and vulnerable to edge effects [^2257f0ba]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Measuring edge distance

We defined forest edge as the interface of what we considered original forest vegetation and any anthropogenically modified habitat of minimum 1 ha, including active anthropogenic land uses such as inhabited areas, plantations, clear cut logging, as well as regenerating forests from past major anthropogenic disturbances. In selectively logged forests, the exact boundary between unlogged and logged forests was difficult to determine and we considered the nearest logging road as forest edge. We used Google Earth Pro 7.1.7, Landsat imagery from, and additional GIS data on Borneo's logging roads. Because some plots were near to dynamic anthropogenic processes, we always selected historical Landsat imagery corresponding to the majority of the plot monitoring period. From each plot's centre point, we searched for the nearest forest edge on remotely sensed imagery using the built-in circle tool of Google Earth Pro, the distance to which was then measured using the software's built-in line tool.

Establishing edge distance threshold

To investigate the impact of edge effects without having to define plots as 'edge' or 'interior', we first used an incremental edge distance threshold from 100 m, in 100 m steps, to 1000 m, to generate explorative AGB change estimates for 'edge' and 'interior' plots employing linear mixed effects (LME) models described below. We then tested two models on individual plot AGB change as a function of distance to forest edge: a non-linear asymptotic model y = a − be − cx and a hockey-stick model consisting of two linear segments, the second of which had a zero slope, implemented in the R package SiZer. The asymptotic model is more ecologically meaningful whereas the hockey-stick model is useful in identifying the optimal edge distance threshold. We compared these with a simple linear model (non-asymptotic relationship) and an intercept-only model (no relationship) based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to test if the hypothesized models better represent the relationship with the given data. We first limited this analysis to plots with edge distance < 2,000 m (n = 50) because most reported edge effects penetrate only a few hundred metres, and then repeated the analysis on all plots to test the robustness of the result. The edge distance threshold identified by the hockey-stick model was then used to divide all plots into two categories, interior and edge plots.

### Features of public open spaces and physical activity among children: findings from the CLAN study [^c43993ca]. Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine associations between features of public open spaces, and children's physical activity.

Participants

163 children aged 8–9 years and 334 adolescents aged 13–15 years from Melbourne, Australia participated in 2004.

Methods

A Geographic Information System was used to identify all public open spaces (POS) within 800 m of participants' homes and their closest POS. The features of all POS identified were audited in 2004/5. Accelerometers measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) after school and on weekends. Linear regression analyses examined associations between features of the closest POS and participants' MVPA.

Results

Most participants had a POS within 800 m of their home. The presence of playgrounds was positively associated with younger boys' weekend MVPA (B = 24.9 min/day; p ≤ 0.05), and lighting along paths was inversely associated with weekend MVPA (B = -54.9 min/day; p ≤ 0.05). The number of recreational facilities was inversely associated with younger girls' MVPA after school (B = -2.6 min/day; p ≤ 0.05) and on the weekend (B = -8.7 min/day; p ≤ 0.05). The presence of trees providing shade (5.8 min/day, p ≤ 0.01) and signage regarding dogs (B = 6.8 min/day, p ≤ 0.05) were positively associated with adolescent girls' MVPA after school.

Conclusion

Certain features of POS were associated with participants' MVPA, although mixed associations were evident. Further research is required to clarify these complex relationships.

### Painted playgrounds for preschoolers' physical activity and fundamental motor skill improvement: a randomized controlled pilot trial of effectiveness [^55e72ba2]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The primary endpoints were change in school-day PA (light, moderate, and vigorous) and sedentary time measured by accelerometry. The secondary outcome was change in FMS percentile scores. Feasibility outcomes include stencil engagement observations to assess which stencils encouraged the most PA for boys and girls and director satisfaction and planned sustainment of the stencils. Statistical analyses were performed with the latest version of SAS, version 9.4. Due to the nature of this pilot study, the statistical focus will primarily be on confidence intervals. The level of significance for statistical analyses was 0.05 for demographic related variables and 95% confidence intervals not containing zero (CIs ∉ 0) for outcome related variables. The repeated measure linear model estimates the least square means for each time and group combination, no other covariates included. These least square means are used to determine whether changes in outcome variables were different between the intervention and control ECE centers across time. The models are used on dependent continuous variables including light PA, moderate PA, vigorous PA, MVPA, sedentary behavior, ball skill percentiles, locomotor skill percentiles, and total TGMD-3 percentiles. The linear model were used to determine whether changes in outcome variables were different between the intervention and control ECE centers. For all outcomes that used statistical models, all participants with at least baseline values were included in analyses; therefore, sample size varied based on the analysis. Directors' satisfaction survey was presented in frequency and responses of open-ended questions were examined to identify common themes. For this pilot study, we set power to 80% and alpha = 0.05. With a sample size of 40 total participants, this study would need to observe effects sizes of at least 0.91 to obtain statistically significant results.

Fig. 1
Schematic of the continuous action MCTS algorithm applied for exploration of high-dimensional potential parameter surfaces.

a Top: Simplistic representation of an objective landscape for a two-parameter search problem. In-plane axes correspond to (two) independent model parameters. The out-of-plane axis corresponds to objective values, which is defined as the weighted sum of the error in model predicted energies of clusters with respect to target energies. This objective is minimized by our c-MCTS algorithm. The spheres represent candidates of different model parameters within an MCTS run, where differences in their vertical positions indicate differences in their objective values. Bottom: Slightly tilted view of the above with the surface represented as a contour map below the spheres. The numbering on the spheres corresponds to their node positions in the MCTS tree shown in b. These numbers roughly correspond to the order that the candidates are explored. b Schematic showing the root, parent, child nodes, and their relationship within an MCTS tree structure. A typical MCTS search involves node selection, expansion, simulation (playout), and back-propagation. Different coloring of the nodes indicates different depths in the MCTS tree. The algorithm balances between exploration (lateral expansion of nodes) and exploitation (depth expansion of nodes). As shown in a, the objective value of an MCTS run is expected to decrease quickly along with the depth of the tree. c Search space of a traditional MCTS algorithm, e.g. game board, is discrete. In the context of parameter optimization, for two discrete parameters each of 19 possible values, the search space consists of a finite 361 search positions. d The problem of parameter search, such as the objective surface illustrated in a, generally involves parameters that are continuous, which corresponds to infinite possible search positions. We handle this challenge by applying a range-funneling technique to the MCTS algorithm where the search neighborhood at each tree-depth becomes smaller and smaller such that the algorithm can converge to the optimal solutions.

### Non-line-of-sight snapshots and background mapping with an active corner camera [^d8856234]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Data acquisition

For our demonstrations, we set up a hidden room 2.2 m wide, 2.2 m deep and 3 m high, as shown in Fig. 4 A. Assuming the coordinate system origin is at the bottom of the occluding edge, the left wall is at x = − 1.20 m, the right wall is at x = 1 m, the back wall is at y = 2.2 m, and the ceiling is at z = 3 m. The walls are made of white foam board and the ceiling is black cloth. The SPAD array is positioned on the side of the wall, looking down at the occluding edge origin, allowing half of the array to be occluded. The laser is positioned so that it shines close to the origin. To reject the strong ballistic contribution (first bounce) of light reflected from the origin, we punched a hole in the occluding wall and shined the laser through the hole. The true location of the laser spot on the floor is slightly off the origin, by 6 cm to the right side. The latter was found by cross-checking and minimizing the number of ballistic photons measured by the SPAD array. More recent SPAD arrays incorporate a fast hard gate to rapidly enable and disable the detector with few hundreds picoseconds width, which can be tuned to censor the ballistic photons.

Two test scenarios were analyzed. For the first, we used two rectangular white foam board facets of size 20 × 110 cm as our moving objects. For the second, we used four different targets: a white foam board facet (of size 20 × 110 cm), a gray foam board facet (white foam board painted with a gray diffuse spray paint), a fabric mannequin of size 30 × 80 cm, and a stair-like facet of size 75 × 75 cm. These objects were used to test our method on targets of different shape, height and albedo. All tests were conducted with the objects facing the occluding edge. Before moving objects enter the hidden room, a 30 s acquisition was collected to form an estimate of b, the response of the stationary scene. Then, new measurement frames were collected with moving objects fixed at discrete points along their trajectories during 0.4 s. In Supplementary Note 4, we demonstrate that these measurements can be acquired over a much shorter period of time with little effect on the reconstruction quality.

### Mice identify subgoal locations through an action-driven mapping process [^ab066e62]. Neuron (2023). Medium credibility.

(D) All trip-wire crossings, with and without laser stimulation, ordered by time of arrival to the left obstacle edge. Note that mice must be moving toward the shelter area (i.e. southward) to trigger the trip wire.

(E) Spatial efficiency is the ratio of the straight-line path to the length of the path taken. White horizontal lines, median; black dots, mean; gray boxes, first and third quartiles; gray vertical lines, range. Each dot represents one mouse/session. p = 5 × 10 −5, one-tailed permutation test.

(F) Distance explored on the threat half: p = 0.5, one-tailed permutation test; n = 8 mice in each group.

We divided injected and implanted animals into a laser-on and a control, laser-off group. Both groups explored a circular platform with a shelter and an obstacle for 20 min (n = 8 mice/sessions; Figures S2 A and S2B). During this time, all mice located the shelter and visited the entire platform, including the obstacle (Figures S3 F and S3H). In agreement with previous results, all mice in the laser-off group executed continuous running movements from the threat area toward the shelter area ("homing runs"; No. per session: 6 [5, 8.25], median [IQR]; Figures 1 A, S3 G, and S3I). These included at least one homing run that directly targeted an obstacle edge ("edge-vector runs"; No. per session: 1.5 [1, 2.25], median [IQR]); Figures 1 A and S3 J; Video S1). Mice in the laser-on group triggered 3.5 [2.75, 6] (median [IQR]) laser stimulation trials, lasting 20 [16, 26] s in total and interrupting all potential edge-vector runs (Figures 1 D, S3 G, and S3J). While mice in the laser-off group executed nearly direct paths between the threat area and the left obstacle edge, the paths taken by mice in the stimulation group were twice as long, reflecting the inaccessibility of edge-vector runs (Figure 1 E). Exploratory behavior, however, was not reduced. Mice in the stimulation condition explored the obstacle, the edge, the threat area, and the entire arena as much as the control group (Figures 1 F, S3 F, and S3H).

### Observation of frustrated chiral dynamics in an interacting triangular flux ladder [^642e8656]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Understanding the interplay of interactions and gauge fields is an outstanding task in contemporary physics. From the emergence of fundamental particles to the fractional quantum Hall effects, such an interplay proves essential in the description of physical phenomena with ranging energy and temperature scales –. The implementation of synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms offers a flexible playground where both the interaction and gauge field are highly tunable in a quantum many-body environment –. This opens up rich possibilities for exploring, for instance, interaction-induced chiral dynamics, and the quantum simulation of strongly interacting topological systems. While cold atoms are charge neutral, different forms of synthetic gauge fields can be engineered through rapidly rotating atomic gases, Raman transitions, lattice shaking, or laser-induced hopping –.

The recently developed momentum-lattice technique further facilitates the quantum simulation of gauge fields with ultracold atoms. Therein, the synthetic lattice dimension is encoded in the atomic momentum states, and the lattice hoppings are generated by parametric laser couplings whose amplitudes and phases are tunable in a site-resolved manner –. Moreover, momentum lattices also provide a direct access to exotic lattice geometry and hopping pattern. For instance, both square and triangular flux ladders were experimentally implemented, and the flux-dependent atomic transport and chiral dynamics were observed with single-site resolution –. These experiments, however, are mostly restricted to the non-interacting or weakly interacting regime, leaving the interplay between interaction and synthetic flux largely unexplored. Such an interplay is particularly intriguing in lattices with frustrated geometry, where nontrivial ground states and correlated transport are expected to emerge.

### Defining a safe player run-off zone around rugby union playing areas [^595cf743]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify the circumstances in which international rugby players exit the playing area during match activities and to define a safe run-off distance around the playing area.

Method

An observational study using video recordings of 102 matches associated with the Rugby World Cup (2011), Rugby Championship (2013, 2014) and Six Nations Championship (2013, 2014) were used to analyse every event in which one or more players exited the playing area during normal match activities. The circumstances in which a player exited the playing area were categorised using a range of parameters: playing position, location, out-of-play region, match activity, distance travelled over the touchline, contacts made with pitchside fixtures and fittings.

Results

Ninety-five per cent of player-excursions took place within 5.2m of the touchline. Players exiting the playing area were nearly three times more likely to be a back than a forward (p < 0.001) and the event was more likely to take place when a team was defending than attacking (p < 0.001). Being forced out of play during a contact event (70%) was the major reason for players exiting the playing area. Most players (88%) exiting the playing area only made contact with the perimeter area surface; a small proportion of players contacted touchline flags (6.1%), advertising boards (2.3%) and TV cameras/equipment (1.0%).

Conclusions

A minimum hazard-free distance of 5m around a Rugby pitch is proposed based on the 95% percentile frequency distribution of player-excursion events into the areas contiguous with the playing area.

### Soil contamination in nearby natural areas mirrors that in urban greenspaces worldwide [^0de05816]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Field survey and soil sampling

Soil samples were collected from paired urban greenspaces and adjacent natural areas (i.e. natural and semi-natural ecosystems near cities that are not subjected to management) from 56 municipalities of 17 countries and six continents (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B and Supplementary Table 1). Natural areas were about 20 km from the urban greenspaces, which include forests, grasslands, shrublands, or relict forests with their original vegetation. Urban greenspaces were mainly public parks and large residential gardens, and comprised a mixture of open areas with lawns, scattered trees, patches of shrubs, and associated flowerbeds. All the selected urban greenspaces were well-established and many decades old. Our findings indicate that soils in urban and natural ecosystems were similar in their levels of contamination. A total of 112 ecosystems (56 paired urban vs natural areas) were investigated in this study. The mean annual precipitation and temperature ranged from 210 to 1577 mm and 3.1 °C to 26.4 °C, respectively. These natural areas are locations with no historically documented or evident human impact. The selected cities have a wide range of socio-economic development indices, representing different development levels of cities worldwide. For example, region population density and human development index (HDI, a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development)ranged from 7.7 to 16 people/km 2 and 0 to 0.89, respectively. We did not sample agricultural soils, and the selected sites were remote from any mining areas. We also considered soil contamination attributes and sampling feasibility when choosing sampling sites across such a broad range of environmental gradients worldwide.

### A microenvironment approach to reducing sedentary time and increasing physical activity of children and adults at a playground [^62ed2ac7]. Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Test whether a micro-environment park intervention in Grand Forks, North Dakota, movement of seating away from a playground, would increase the physical activity and length of stay of park users.

Method

Study 1, summer 2012: physical activity of children and adults was assessed during baseline (A1) with seating in usual, standardized locations; with seating removed from the playground (B); and with seating returned to original locations (A2). Study 2, summer 2013: the study was repeated with the inclusion of a daily 2-hour assessment during which activity of each family member was recorded every 15-min and length of stay was recorded.

Results

For both studies, the MET (metabolic equivalent) intensity was greater (p < 0.02) during condition B than during A1 and A2. For adults, the odds of being in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity than sitting during condition B were 4.1 to 22.7 greater than those during conditions A1 and A2. During the 2-hour serial observations, MET intensities during condition B were greater (p < 0.005) than those during A1 and A2. The duration families stayed at the park did not differ across conditions.

Conclusion

### A second-generation (44-channel) suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis: a single-arm clinical trial of feasibility [^53721872]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

For the motion discrimination task, the participant used a keypad to indicate direction-of-movement of a single 5° wide bar moving perpendicularly across the screen in 1 of 4 cardinal directions. Twenty-four trials per device condition were administered in 8 trial blocks as above. This task was repeated at up to 3 speeds; 7, 15, and 30°/sec, with participants progressing to the next speed if their score significantly exceeded chance (25%) and they consented to continue. All trials were completed within 30 seconds.

Spatial discrimination was assessed using the Basic Grating Acuity test program (Fig 1 B). The participant was required to identify the line orientation of evenly spaced horizontal or vertical black stripes (2 alternative forced choice, 24 trials per condition), firstly at 0.033 cycles-per-degree (cpd) and then repeated at a higher spatial frequency (0.1 cpd), if the participant exceeded the passing criterion (75% accuracy), or at a lower spatial frequency (0.01 cpd) if they did not. If a trial exceeded 30 seconds, it was scored as "incorrect" by the test program.

Modified Door Task

This orientation and mobility taskassessed whether participants could detect, walk toward, and touch a black, high-contrast target (54 × 70 cm) on the far wall of a white-walled room measuring 3.8 × 4.8 meters (Fig 2 B). The required traversal distance between start position (1, 2, 3) and target location (A, B, C) varied between 4 and 4.6 m (Fig 2 A). The participant announced "stop" when they thought they were within arms-reach of the target prior to actually reaching for the target. Participants were scored across 10 randomized trials per condition for the time to complete each trial and the distance from finger-tip to nearest edge of the target. If the participant successfully touched the target, the outcome was ascribed a distance of zero.

### Assessment of resident performance using entrustable professional activities… [^a2126fb9]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The beginning of the white bar indicates the point at which 25% of residents achieved a given supervision level, with the end of the white bar indicating the point at which 75% achieved the level. The end of the blue bar indicates where 90% of residents achieved the supervision level. See Table 1 for full description of EPAs and supervision level scales. The CCCs were asked to determine levels of supervision using their usual, local CCC decision-making process for assigning milestones. For feasibility purposes, each site was assigned 2 EPAs in common and randomly assigned to a block with an additional 4 of the 17 general pediatrics EPAs; blocks were balanced to ensure that each EPA other than EPA 5 and EPA 15 was assigned to as near the same number of sites as possible.

We then modeled the transformed levels for all EPAs together using a linear mixed growth model with fixed effects of resident year and year squared, and a random intercept and slope-over-year for the resident, program, and EPA. Statistical significance was set at 2-tailed P <.
05. Analyses were conducted using R statistical software version
3. 4 and the lme4 package.
42. The EPA Developmental Progression Scales are shown in Figure 2 and Figure
3. The beginning of the white bar indicates the point at which 25% of residents achieved a given supervision level, with the end of the white bar indicating the point at which 75% achieved the level. In these instances, the percentage of residents achieving the highest level is indicated on the right-hand side of the figure.

For example, for EPA 9, level 7 ends at 58% of residents and level 8 ends at 4% of residents. However, we believe these scales provide the opportunity to view a dashboard of the rate of progression of a learner against a peer group that may be helpful for providing trainee feedback about strengths and needed areas of focus for improvement. This study sought to understand overall resident performance for the purposes of determining EPA developmental trajectories across a cohort of residents. However, future work should consider individual residents as the unit of analysis.

### Impact of medication adherence on virologic failure in A5202: a randomized, partially blinded, phase 3B study [^c03a69aa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Analysis

We analyzed 2 groups (Supplementary Figure 1). The analysis of short-term VF through week 24 was based on self-reported adherence at the week 8 visit. For the analysis of VF after 24 weeks, we used the following 3 categories: adherent (reported never or missing their last dose more than 1 month ago on both the week 8 and week 24 reports), not adherent (reported missing their last dose within the past month on the available week 8 and week 24 reports or missing both reports), or inconsistent (reported adherence on either the week 8 or week 24 report and either not adherent on the other report or missing the other report). Analysis was limited to those who could have VF after week 24 by excluding participants who had VF or discontinued study follow-up by week 24.

Baseline characteristics (age, gender, race or ethnicity, viral load, CD4 count, hepatitis B or hepatitis C, history of AIDS) between groups were compared using a Wilcoxon rank sum test or Fisher exact test. Proportions with VF were Kaplan-Meier estimates. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards model.

### Grid cell symmetry is shaped by environmental geometry [^b4e91865]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Grid cells represent an animal's location by firing in multiple fields arranged in a striking hexagonal array. Such an impressive and constant regularity prompted suggestions that grid cells represent a universal and environmental-invariant metric for navigation. Originally the properties of grid patterns were believed to be independent of the shape of the environment and this notion has dominated almost all theoretical grid cell models. However, several studies indicate that environmental boundaries influence grid firing, though the strength, nature and longevity of this effect is unclear. Here we show that grid orientation, scale, symmetry and homogeneity are strongly and permanently affected by environmental geometry. We found that grid patterns orient to the walls of polarized enclosures such as squares, but not circles. Furthermore, the hexagonal grid symmetry is permanently broken in highly polarized environments such as trapezoids, the pattern being more elliptical and less homogeneous. Our results provide compelling evidence for the idea that environmental boundaries compete with the internal organization of the grid cell system to drive grid firing. Notably, grid cell activity is more local than previously thought and as a consequence cannot provide a universal spatial metric in all environments.

### Simple spatial scaling rules behind complex cities [^4ffab980]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Although most of wealth and innovation have been the result of human interaction and cooperation, we are not yet able to quantitatively predict the spatial distributions of three main elements of cities: population, roads, and socioeconomic interactions. By a simple model mainly based on spatial attraction and matching growth mechanisms, we reveal that the spatial scaling rules of these three elements are in a consistent framework, which allows us to use any single observation to infer the others. All numerical and theoretical results are consistent with empirical data from ten representative cities. In addition, our model can also provide a general explanation of the origins of the universal super- and sub-linear aggregate scaling laws and accurately predict kilometre-level socioeconomic activity. Our work opens a new avenue for uncovering the evolution of cities in terms of the interplay among urban elements, and it has a broad range of applications.

### Public health assessments&health consultations… [^7569d11d]. archive.cdc.gov (1997). Low credibility.

This category is used for sites that pose a public health hazard due to the existence of long-term exposures to hazardous substance or conditions that could result in adverse health effects. This determination represents a professional judgement based on critical data which ATSDR has judged sufficient to support a decision. This does not necessarily imply that the available data are complete; in some cases additional data may be required to confirm or further support the decision made. Criteria: Evaluation of available relevant information suggests that, under site-specific conditions of exposure, long-term exposures to site-specific contaminants have had, are having, or are likely to have in the future, an adverse impact on human health that requires one or more public health interventions.

Such site-specific exposures may include the presence of serious physical hazards, such as open mine shafts, poorly stored or maintained flammable/ explosive substances, or medical devices which, upon rupture, could release radioactive materials. Such as environmental and demographic data; health outcome data; exposure data; community health concerns information; toxicologic, medical, and epidemiologic data. * ATSDR Actions: ATSDR will make recommendations in the health assessment to mitigate the health risks posed by the site. The recommendations issued in the health assessment should be consistent with the degree of hazard and temporal concerns posed by exposures to hazardous substances at the site. Actions on the recommendations may have occurred before the actual completion of the public health assessment.

Based on the degree of hazard posed by the site and the presence of sufficiently defined current, past, or future completed exposure pathways, one or more of the following public health actions can be recommended:

- biologic indicators of exposure study
- biomedical testing
- case study
- disease and symptom prevalence study
- community health investigations
- registries
- site-specific surveillance
- voluntary residents tracking system
- cluster investigation
- health statistics review
- health professional education
- community health education
- substance-specific applied research. and the rationale for the decision. ATSDR Actions: ATSDR will make recommendations in the health assessment to identify the data or information needed to adequately assess the public health risks posed by the site. Public health actions recommended in this category will depend on the hazard potential of the site, specifically as it relates to the potential for human exposure of public health concern.

Actions on the recommendations may have occurred before the actual completion of the public health assessment.

### Painted playgrounds for preschoolers' physical activity and fundamental motor skill improvement: a randomized controlled pilot trial of effectiveness [^ea62b48a]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedures

ECE center directors were asked to complete surveys related to their ECE center characteristics. Informational materials were distributed to parents about the study and to obtain written consent. The full purpose of the study was not disclosed to the director, teachers, parents, or preschoolers at the ECE centers until after the completion of all measurements and observations to minimize the alteration of the teachers' and preschoolers' behaviors. Once parents provided consent, they were asked to complete and return a child demographic questionnaire. After consent and parent survey were obtained, the four centers were randomized to condition by a biostatistician. At the baseline visit, a trained researcher measured preschooler height, weight, and assessed FMS. Preschoolers were asked to wear accelerometers continuously for 24 h/day over seven days.

Time spent in the outdoor play setting was video recorded at all four ECE centers. Observations were rescheduled in inclement weather. One week after the baseline visit, playground stencils were painted at the two intervention ECE centers. The follow-up visit occurred approximately six to eight weeks after the baseline visit at all four centers. All measures were repeated including the seven day accelerometry protocol. Stenciling was conducted at the two wait-list control centers after the follow-up visit. Follow-up surveys were administered to ECE directors to examine satisfaction and perceived usefulness of the stencils. Process measures (e.g. time and cost of stenciling) were used to examine feasibility.

### Quantifying the contribution of neighborhood parks to physical activity [^fd1273eb]. Preventive Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify the contribution of U.S. neighborhood parks to the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) by the local population.

Methods

Observational data on the use of 10 parks in five US cities collected during summer and fall 2008 were analyzed by a model-averaging approach. Estimated MVPA time accrued in parks was compared to estimated total MVPA time accrued by the local population, based upon national estimates.

Results

On average, parks provided roughly 4000hours of use and 1500 MVPA hours per week. Park use accounted for approximately 50% of the vigorous physical activity (VPA) time of those living within 0.5 miles of the park and 16% of those living within 1.0 miles of the park. Parks accounted for a modest proportion of moderate physical activity (MPA) time, about 14% and 4% for those living within 0.5 miles and 1.0 miles of the park, respectively.

Conclusion

Parks have significant roles in supporting vigorous physical activity of the local population. Because they are underutilized and vigorous activity is critical to child development and adult physical fitness, efforts should be made to promote vigorous activity within local parks.

### Evidences for a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19 [^871324c7]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should have baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations measured and must be supplemented at least to a level ≥ 30 ng/mL (optimal 40–60), especially when the baseline level is < 10 ng/mL and such deficiency is significantly more present in male patients.

In conclusion, we might suggest in COVID-19 patients with 25(OH)D serum levels under 20 ng/mL that the usual recommended dose for correction of deficiency should be 6000–7000 oral IU/day for the first 6–8 weeks. For maintenance, the dose should varies from 2000 to 3000 oral IU/day depending on the age and clinical condition of the patient up to achieve the suggested concentrations.

### Feasibility and safety of a novel in vivo model to assess playground falls in children [^a8cf5e9c]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal unintentional injuries among hospitalized children with playground equipment accounting for more than 50%. National standards for playground rung and rail design exist, but there a lack of in vivo models available to test these standards. We developed a novel in vivo model to test rung and rail design. We report the feasibility and safety of the model.

Methods

A device was built to simulate children hanging onto a playground bar until their hand slips off. This was defined as breakaway strength. The handle unit was mounted on a vertical cable that was mechanically raised and lowered using a linear actuator controlled by the experimenter. The unit was padded and contained a video camera that recorded the posture of the hand during each trial. Breakaway force and torque were recorded as they held onto the handle by LabView software. In addition, standard anthropometrics and grip strength were recorded.

Results

Biomedical engineering approved the device. There were 425 eligible students aged 5 years to 11 years. Of these, 93% (397) participated (212 males and 185 females). Ninety-nine percent (396 of 397) completed all three experimental stations, one declined because of fear. There were no injuries and no falls. Average time to complete the study was 22 ± 0.5 minutes. Ninety-one percent of participants were right handed; the ethnicity was representative of the local area with 79% being white. Mean ± SD height, weight, and body mass index for the 397 participants were 1.28 ± 0.11 m, 28.0 ± 8.12 kg, and 16.31 ± 2.59 kg/m², respectively. Hand size, grip strength, and maximum breakaway force increased with age.

Conclusion

This model is safe and feasible and maybe a viable method to assess rung and rail design for playgrounds.

### Local chiral symmetry breaking in triatic liquid crystals [^5d40c4eb]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Understanding the behaviour of thermally excited many-particle systems, composed of a single particle type having a well-defined shape and size, is important in condensed matter, notably protein crystallization. Here we observe and explain the origin of local chiral symmetry breaking in a surprisingly simple system of hard Brownian particles: achiral regular triangles confined to two dimensions. Using enhanced optical video particle-tracking microscopy, we show that microscale lithographic triangular platelets form two different triatic liquid crystal phases. Above a particle area fraction φ(A)≈0.55, the simple triatic phase is spatially disordered, yet has molecular orientational characteristics that distinguish it from a hexatic liquid crystal. At higher φ(A) ≥ 0.61, we find a second triatic phase exhibiting local chiral symmetry breaking; rotational entropy favours laterally offsetting the positions of nearest-neighbouring triangles. By contributing to spatial disordering, local chiral symmetry breaking can limit the range of shapes that can be entropically crystallized.
