## Question

Latuda for irritability

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lurasidone (Latuda) should be used for irritability, particularly in autism spectrum disorder, and how it compares with evidence-based options along with safety and dosing considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about FDA-labeled indications and whether "irritability" is an approved target for lurasidone. Then, I should review ASD-focused guidelines and meta-analyses to see what works for irritability and whether lurasidone is included. Next, I will evaluate indirect evidence from bipolar depression where irritability can be a feature, to see if any signal supports lurasidone for irritability. After that, I should compare lurasidone with established agents for ASD irritability, especially risperidone and aripiprazole, including dosing and outcomes. Finally, I need to ensure safety, monitoring, and special-population cautions, and then synthesize a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the labeling, because I should not assume indications; lurasidone is FDA-approved for schizophrenia and for bipolar I depression as mono- or adjunctive therapy with lithium/valproate, but "irritability" per se is not a labeled indication and is not listed as a treatment target in the SPL [^116zWZzS] [^115eVA5H] [^115SjZZs] [^111KtMyp]. Wait, let me verify something I almost glossed over — earlier I thought schizoaffective disorder was an approved indication; hold on, I should verify the SPL: schizoaffective disorder appears as an off-label use rather than an FDA-approved indication, so I need to correct that misstatement and keep the focus on the actual approved uses only [^111KtMyp] [^111KtMyp].

> Next, I should review what ASD guidelines actually recommend for irritability, because jumping to an off-label antipsychotic without guideline support would be premature; BAP 2018 emphasizes behavioral/educational approaches first and, when medication is needed for pediatric ASD irritability, recommends risperidone or aripiprazole — lurasidone is not included in these recommendations, and for adults they suggest aripiprazole, risperidone, or an SSRI on a case-by-case basis after alternatives are considered [^111unrnh] [^116GLwfM]. I need to check more recent practice proposals: an ASD pharmacologic pathway highlights functional behavioral assessment, parent training, and objective tracking with the ABC-Irritability subscale; when medication is used, alpha-2 agonists such as guanfacine may be considered early for safety, again with no role for lurasidone described for irritability in ASD [^1159tE8e] [^111rt4pm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions yet; I will now examine the quantitative evidence for irritability reduction across youth populations, because a broad meta-analytic signal for antipsychotics might tempt off-label extrapolation; a 2023 meta-analysis shows the largest pooled effect for antipsychotics on irritability, but efficacy at the individual drug level is consistently demonstrated for risperidone and aripiprazole, not lurasidone, and lurasidone trials for ASD irritability were not identified in these systematic reviews [^112QRa49] [^111xo1M8]. I should double-check this inference: the absence of lurasidone-specific ASD irritability data in these comprehensive reviews supports that there is insufficient direct evidence for lurasidone targeting irritability in ASD at this time [^112QRa49] [^111xo1M8].

> Let me think about indirect evidence where irritability can present as part of mixed states in bipolar depression, because sometimes clinicians conflate improvement in depressive symptoms with improvement in irritability; lurasidone is effective for bipolar I depression as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with lithium/valproate, and post hoc analyses suggest benefit in mixed features, yet irritability was not a predefined, validated primary endpoint like ABC-I, making any anti-irritability inference indirect and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^115eVA5H] [^115SjZZs] [^113AtcCp] [^113YzVTW]. I should confirm pediatric data as well: in youth with bipolar depression, lurasidone reduced depressive symptoms, but again, this does not establish efficacy for "irritability" as a discrete target symptom in ASD or other pediatric irritability syndromes [^115QH82f].

> Now, I will compare lurasidone with the agents that actually have ASD irritability evidence, because clinical decision-making should privilege treatments with replicated, label-supported outcomes; risperidone is FDA-approved for irritability associated with autistic disorder in children and adolescents and demonstrated significant improvements on ABC-I across two 8-week placebo-controlled RCTs, with labeled dosing guidance allowing weight-based titration in the 0.5 to 3 mg/day range and explicit pediatric labeling for ASD irritability, which is absent for lurasidone [^113iqRsq] [^115zG33A] [^114R8FhC] [^1133pH1i]. Aripiprazole has consistent RCT evidence and Cochrane reviews supporting efficacy and safety for ASD irritability, and although I should note we are not citing its SPL here, contemporary ASD guidelines also recommend it, whereas lurasidone is not recommended for this indication [^112hAqTV] [^116tW6oo] [^111unrnh].

> I need to ensure safety and tolerability are weighed carefully, especially when considering off-label use; lurasidone commonly causes akathisia and other EPS, along with somnolence, nausea, and metabolic changes, and rare but serious risks such as tardive dyskinesia and suicidal ideation are reported, with boxed warnings for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis and suicidality in younger populations, underscoring that off-label use for "irritability" requires a compelling justification and close monitoring [^111ePkak] [^115R7xq6] [^115a9EEs] [^111KtMyp]. Hold on, I should verify comparative EPS risk; CANMAT/ISBD notes higher EPS propensity among some atypicals including lurasidone, particularly at higher doses, which matters if agitation or motor restlessness could worsen an already irritable presentation [^117Vzyec]. I should also review dose adjustments: cap dosing in moderate renal impairment and moderate hepatic impairment, no adjustment with CrCl > 50 mL/min or Child-Pugh A, all of which becomes relevant if one were still considering lurasidone for its approved indications in a patient who also has irritability [^114RJger] [^1117nPj8] [^1138ep3g] [^1117pzT5].

> But wait, what about special populations where irritability is prominent, like dementia or neurodegenerative disorders; I should confirm that antipsychotics carry increased mortality risk in dementia and are generally to be avoided for agitation/aggression per EAN/AAFP guidance, which further cautions against broad off-label antipsychotic use for "irritability" unless the benefit clearly outweighs risk and nonpharmacologic strategies have failed [^117VrDS6] [^117LCQVH]. Let me reconsider ASD practice flow: guidelines emphasize identifying medical or psychiatric drivers of irritability, using behavioral interventions and parent training, and employing ABC-I to track change, which again situates risperidone or aripiprazole after these steps rather than favoring lurasidone, which lacks ASD irritability evidence [^1159tE8e] [^111rt4pm].

> I should synthesize a practical approach now; for primary irritability in ASD, first address medical/psychiatric contributors and implement behavioral strategies with ABC-I monitoring, then consider pharmacotherapy with evidence-based agents such as risperidone or aripiprazole if needed, while reserving lurasidone for its labeled indications like bipolar depression or schizophrenia when clinically indicated, rather than as a treatment for irritability per se [^111unrnh] [^1159tE8e] [^112hAqTV] [^1133pH1i]. If irritability arises in the context of bipolar depression, I should confirm the mood diagnosis and treat according to bipolar guidelines — lurasidone can reduce depressive symptoms and is guideline-supported in combination with lithium or valproate in acute bipolar depression — yet I should not over-interpret this as established efficacy for a distinct irritability endpoint [^117HSYZq] [^115eVA5H] [^115SjZZs].

> In conclusion, I need to be precise: lurasidone is not FDA-approved for irritability, is not recommended by ASD guidelines for this target, and lacks direct RCT evidence using validated irritability measures such as ABC-I in ASD; by contrast, risperidone and aripiprazole have robust evidence and, in the case of risperidone, specific labeling for ASD irritability, so lurasidone should not be a first- or second-line choice for "irritability", particularly in ASD, and any off-label use should be exceptional, risk-mitigated, and justified by the broader diagnostic context rather than by irritability alone [^111KtMyp] [^111unrnh] [^111xo1M8] [^114R8FhC] [^1133pH1i] [^112hAqTV].

Latuda (lurasidone) is not FDA-approved [^111KtMyp] for irritability in any condition, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or dementia-related agitation [^111KtMyp]. It is approved for schizophrenia and bipolar depression [^111KtMyp], where it may indirectly reduce irritability as part of overall symptom improvement. For irritability in ASD, risperidone [^113iqRsq] and aripiprazole [^112hAqTV] are first-line, evidence-based options [^111unrnh]. Lurasidone is generally well tolerated with minimal metabolic effects [^113AtcCp], but akathisia [^116wiGQn] and extrapyramidal symptoms can occur [^111ePkak] [^117Vzyec]. Use lurasidone for irritability only when first-line treatments fail or are contraindicated, and monitor closely for side effects [^111ePkak].

---

## Clinical evidence for lurasidone in irritability

### Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

- **FDA approval**: Lurasidone is not approved for irritability in ASD [^111KtMyp].

- **Clinical trials**: No published RCTs support lurasidone for irritability in ASD.

- **Guidelines**: Risperidone and aripiprazole are first-line for irritability in ASD after behavioral interventions fail [^111unrnh] [^116GLwfM].

---

### Dementia-related agitation

- **FDA approval**: Lurasidone is not approved for agitation or irritability in dementia.

- **Clinical evidence**: No RCTs support lurasidone for irritability in dementia.

- **Guidelines**: Atypical antipsychotics are generally avoided [^117VrDS6] in dementia due to increased mortality and stroke risk.

---

### Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia

In bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, lurasidone is **FDA-approved** for schizophrenia [^111KtMyp] and bipolar depression [^117HSYZq]. Evidence indicates it may indirectly reduce irritability as overall symptoms improve, but it is **not specifically indicated for irritability**.

---

## Safety and tolerability profile

Lurasidone is generally well tolerated, with **minimal metabolic effects** compared with other antipsychotics [^1167zkKq]. Notable **adverse effects** include:

| **Adverse effect** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Akathisia | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] [^116wiGQn] |
| Extrapyramidal symptoms | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] [^117Vzyec] |
| Somnolence | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] |
| Nausea | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] |
| Weight gain | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] [^1167zkKq] |
| Hyperprolactinemia | Common (1–10%) [^115R7xq6] |
| Orthostatic hypotension | Common (1–10%) [^115R7xq6] |

---

## Comparison with other antipsychotics

Compared with other antipsychotics, **risperidone and aripiprazole** have strong evidence and FDA approval for irritability in ASD [^111unrnh] [^113iqRsq], whereas **lurasidone** lacks FDA approval or robust evidence for irritability and is generally reserved for cases in which first-line treatments fail or are contraindicated [^111KtMyp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

In ASD, risperidone and aripiprazole are **first-line** [^111unrnh] for irritability after behavioral interventions fail [^112hAqTV]. In dementia, atypical antipsychotics are **generally avoided** [^117VrDS6] due to increased mortality and stroke risk [^117LCQVH]. For bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, lurasidone is approved for these conditions but is **not specifically indicated for irritability**.

---

## Practical considerations for clinicians

- **Patient selection**: Consider lurasidone for irritability only when first-line treatments (risperidone, aripiprazole) fail or are contraindicated.

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic changes, and prolactin levels [^111ePkak].

- **Dosing**: Start at 20 mg/day [^115eVA5H], titrate based on response and tolerability, with a typical range of 20–120 mg/day [^115SjZZs].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Lurasidone is **not FDA-approved for irritability** [^111KtMyp] in any condition, including ASD and dementia-related agitation [^115N4mSX]. It may indirectly reduce irritability in schizophrenia and bipolar depression but is not specifically indicated for this symptom. Risperidone and aripiprazole remain first-line for irritability in ASD [^113iqRsq], while atypical antipsychotics are generally avoided in dementia due to safety concerns [^117VrDS6]. Use lurasidone for irritability only when first-line treatments fail or are contraindicated, with close monitoring for side effects.

### Aripiprazole for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [^112hAqTV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Antipsychotics have been used as a medication intervention for irritability related to ASD. Aripiprazole, a third-generation atypical antipsychotic, is a relatively new drug that has a unique mechanism of action different from that of other antipsychotics. This review updates a previous Cochrane review on the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole for individuals with ASD, published in 2011 (Ching 2011).

- **Objectives**: To assess the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole as a medication treatment for individuals with ASD.

- **Search methods**: In October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and seven other databases, as well as two trial registers. We sought records published in 1990 or later, as this was the year aripiprazole became available.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of aripiprazole (administered orally at any dosage) versus placebo for treatment of individuals with a diagnosis of ASD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently collected, evaluated, and analyzed data. We performed meta-analysis for primary and secondary outcomes when possible. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence.

- **Main results**: We included three trials in this review.

### Lurasidone as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the treatment of bipolar I depression: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113AtcCp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Few studies have been reported that support the efficacy of adjunctive therapy for patients with bipolar I depression who have had an insufficient response to monotherapy with mood-stabilizing agents. The authors investigated the efficacy of lurasidone, a novel antipsychotic agent, as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the treatment of bipolar I depression.

- **Method**: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of double-blind adjunctive treatment with lurasidone (N = 183) or placebo (N = 165), added to therapeutic levels of either lithium or valproate. Primary and key secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week 6 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and depression severity score on the Clinical Global Impressions scale for use in bipolar illness (CGI-BP), respectively.

- **Results**: Lurasidone treatment significantly reduced mean MADRS total score at week 6 compared with the placebo group (-17.1 versus -13.5; effect size = 0.34). Similarly, lurasidone treatment resulted in significantly greater endpoint reduction in CGI-BP depression severity scores compared with placebo (-1.96 versus -1.51; effect size = 0.36) as well as significantly greater improvement in anxiety symptoms and in patient-reported measures of quality of life and functional impairment. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 6.0% and 7.9% in the lurasidone and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events most frequently reported for lurasidone were nausea, somnolence, tremor, akathisia, and insomnia. Minimal changes in weight, lipids, and measures of glyc.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^113spm3N]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment-emergent mania, as prespecified in the protocol, occurred in 1.3% of patients in the monotherapy group and in 3.8% of patients in the adjunctive group. There was a small decrease in mean YMRS total score from open-label baseline to extension study month 6 for the lurasidone to lurasidone and placebo to lurasidone groups, respectively, among patients taking monotherapy (−0.6, −1.1) and patients taking adjunctive therapy (−0.5, −0.5).

The proportion of patients who received treatment with anticholinergic medication for acute extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) was 4.4% in the monotherapy group and 9.5% in the adjunctive group. Both monotherapy and adjunctive treatment with lurasidone were associated with negligible mean changes in the BARS global score (≤ 0.1) and SAS 10-item mean score (≤ 0.04 at LOCF endpoint). Categorical worsening in the AIMS global score occurred at low rates in the monotherapy (1.8%) and adjunctive therapy (1.2%) groups. The proportion of patients treated with as-needed doses of anxiolytics was 7.0% in the monotherapy group and 15.7% in the adjunctive therapy group. The proportion of patients treated with concomitant antidepressants was 5.4% in the monotherapy group and 7.8% in the adjunctive therapy group.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: Pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for persistent nonepisodic irritability [^112QRa49]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

This meta-analysis examined the efficacy of available pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for irritability among youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), and/or severe mood dysregulation (SMD).

Literature searches were conducted in October 2020, resulting in 564 abstracts being reviewed to identify relevant papers, with 387 articles being reviewed in full. A random effects model was used for the meta-analysis, with subgroup meta-regressions run to assess effects of study design, intervention type, medication class, and clinical population.

A total of 101 studies were included: 80 pharmacological, 13 nonpharmacological, and 8 combined. Despite high heterogeneity in effects (I² = 94.3%), the pooled post-treatment effect size for decreasing irritability was large (Hedges' g = 1.62). Large effects were found for pharmacological (g = 1.85) and nonpharmacological (g = 1.11) interventions. Moderate effects were found for combined interventions relative to monotherapy interventions (g = 0.69). Antipsychotic medications provided the largest effect for reducing irritability relative to all other medication classes and nonpharmacological interventions. A large effect was found for youth with ASD (g = 1.89), whereas a medium effect was found for youth with ADHD/DMDD/DBD/SMD (g = 0.64).

This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive review of interventions targeting persistent nonepisodic irritability among diverse youth populations.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^1159tE8e]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Behavioral and educational strategies can be implemented to assist in the management of irritability. A functional behavioral assessment from a school behavioralist can offer helpful insight into the function of disruptive behaviors, such as escaping aversive stimuli like a loud room or accessing rewarding or soothing stimuli like getting caregiver attention. When the function of a behavior can be determined, a behavioral team can develop a plan to reduce the frequency of maladaptive behaviors through adjustments to the environment and caregiver response patterns that aim to decrease the persistence of the behavior. Parent training, namely targeted skill development for caregivers in addressing maladaptive behavior, has shown potential to reduce irritability. The RUBI Parent Training for Disruptive Behavior was specifically endorsed by Lurie Center providers, and preliminary efficacy findings in recent feasibility studies are promising.

When behavioral options are ineffective, or irritability is in the moderate to severe range, providers may turn to pharmacological treatments for non-specific irritability. The ABC-Irritability subscale is important to obtain at baseline and throughout the course of treatment of irritability in ASD.

- **Medication options and dosing for irritability in patients with ASD**:

	- When pharmacological treatments are appropriate, α2-adrenergic agonists such as guanfacine are a good option to begin with based on their safety.

- **Neurological effects, including EPS**: Tremor can be a significant cause of frustration for many patients and is experienced by up to 10% of those treated with lithium or divalproex. New onset neurological symptoms in patients on divalproex should raise suspicion of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, which, while rare, can be potentially fatal; hence, early detection and discontinuation of divalproex is critical to prevent morbidity and mortality. Sustained release formulations and dose reductions may limit symptoms. While conventional antipsychotics such as haloperidol are often associated with EPS (including pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia, acute dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia), this risk is either absent or low with atypical antipsychotic agents. Among the atypical agents, risperidone, aripiprazole, cariprazine, ziprasidone, and lurasidone are more likely to cause EPS, particularly at higher doses. In older patients, impaired swallowing function and dysphagia have also been linked to atypical agents, particularly at higher doses.

Although rare, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially life-threatening adverse event associated with antipsychotic agents. The risk with atypical agents was considered negligible initially; however, while the risk is very low, several atypical agents have nevertheless been associated with NMS. While generally unpredictable, the risk is greatest during the initial phase of treatment or change of dosage, with intravenous or intramuscular administration, and with high doses.

### Lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia: A randomized, double-blind, placebo- and olanzapine-controlled study [^116wiGQn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

The study was designed to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of lurasidone in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. Participants, who were recently admitted inpatients with schizophrenia experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, were randomly assigned to six weeks of double-blind treatment with 40 mg of lurasidone, 120 mg of lurasidone, 15 mg of olanzapine (included to test for assay sensitivity), or placebo, dosed once daily. Efficacy was evaluated using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of the change from baseline to week 6 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, as the primary efficacy measure, and the Clinical Global Impressions severity (CGI-S) score, as the key secondary efficacy measure.

Treatment with both doses of lurasidone or with olanzapine was associated with significantly greater improvement at week 6 on PANSS total score, PANSS positive and negative subscale scores, and CGI-S score compared with placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in mean PANSS total or CGI-S change scores for the lurasidone groups compared with the olanzapine group. With responders defined as those with an improvement of at least 20% on the PANSS, endpoint responder rates were significant compared with placebo for olanzapine only. The incidence of akathisia was higher with 120 mg of lurasidone (22.9%) than with 40 mg of lurasidone (11.8%), olanzapine (7.4%), or placebo (0.9%). The proportion of patients experiencing ≥ 7% weight gain was 5.9% for the lurasidone groups combined and 34.4% for the olanzapine group.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: Efficacy of pharmacological interventions for irritability and emotional dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder and predictors of response [^111xo1M8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Emotional dysregulation and irritability are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study conducted the first meta-analysis assessing the efficacy of a broad range of pharmacological interventions for these symptoms in ASD, along with predictors of response.

Following a preregistered protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42021235779), multiple databases were systematically searched until January 1, 2021. Placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological interventions and predictors of response for emotional dysregulation and irritability. Heterogeneity was assessed using Q statistics, and publication bias was evaluated. Subanalyses and meta-regressions were conducted to identify predictors of response. The primary effect size was the standardized mean difference, and the quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB2).

A total of 2,856 individuals with ASD participated in 45 studies, among which 26.7% of RCTs had a high risk of bias. Compared to placebo, antipsychotics (standardized mean difference = 1.028, 95% CI = 0.824–1.232) and medications used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (0.471, 0.061–0.881) were significantly more effective in improving emotional dysregulation and irritability. However, efficacy was not evident for other drug classes (p > .05). Within individual medications, efficacy was observed for aripiprazole (1.179, 0.838–1.520) and risperidone (1.074, 0.818–1.331). Increased rates of comorbid epilepsy were also noted.

### Clinical assessment of lurasidone benefit and risk in the treatment of bipolar I depression using number needed to treat, number needed to harm, and likelihood to be helped or harmed [^113NxEUK]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Prior to the recent FDA approval of lurasidone for the treatment of bipolar depression, there were only two approved treatments for this condition: quetiapine and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination. These treatments were as likely to provide therapeutic benefits as adverse effects. We assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lurasidone for major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, using the number needed to treat (NNT, for benefits), number needed to harm (NNH, for harms), and likelihood of being helped or harmed (LHH, ratio of NNH to NNT, for trade-offs between benefits and harms).

- **Methods**: Data was collected from two 6-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexibly-dosed acute bipolar I depression studies. One study used lurasidone monotherapy at 20–60 mg/d or 80–120 mg/d, and the other used lurasidone 20–120 mg/d adjunctive to lithium or valproate. The NNT or NNH was calculated for lurasidone vs. placebo for the following dichotomous outcomes: response (≥ 50% reduction from baseline on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score), remission (final MADRS total score ≤ 12), discontinuation due to an adverse event (AE), weight gain ≥ 7% from baseline, the incidence of spontaneously reported AEs, and incidence of total cholesterol ≥ 240 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dl, fasting triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dl, and glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl post-baseline.

- **Results**: The NNT vs. placebo for response was 5 for lurasidone monotherapy (both dose ranges) and 7 for adjunctive therapy. The NNT vs. placebo for remission for lurasidone monotherapy was [data missing in the original text].

### Paliperidone extended-release as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate in the treatment of acute mania: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^112Avm8Y]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Combination treatment with atypical antipsychotics and a mood stabilizer is often recommended for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.

- **Methods**: Eligible patients (n = 300) with a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score ≥ 20 were randomly allocated (1:1) to continue mood stabilizer monotherapy or receive flexibly-dosed paliperidone ER (3–12 mg/day) in addition (combination treatment) for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to endpoint in the YMRS total score.

- **Results**: The mean (SD) YMRS total score at baseline was 26.7 (5.26); 33% of patients presented with a mixed (as distinct from a manic) episode, and 62% were on valproate, while 38% were on lithium. The mean (SD) change from baseline to endpoint in the YMRS total score was not significantly different for combination treatment (-14.3 [10.0]) compared with mood stabilizer monotherapy (-13.2 [10.9]; p = 0.16). Combination treatment also failed to separate from mood stabilizer monotherapy for the secondary efficacy measures. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was higher with combination treatment (70%) than with mood stabilizer monotherapy (54%); insomnia was the most common adverse event in both treatment groups (11%).

- **Limitations**: The relatively low doses of paliperidone ER used in this study and the conduct across different countries may have contributed to the failure to differentiate combination treatment from mood stabilizer monotherapy for the primary and secondary efficacy measures.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of lurasidone for the maintenance of efficacy in patients with schizophrenia [^114E3ipb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of the double-blind phase was to assess the efficacy of continued treatment with lurasidone versus switching to placebo for preventing relapse in patients who had maintained clinical stability with lurasidone for at least 12 weeks. Patients who met the criteria for clinical stability during the open-label stabilization phase were randomized at the baseline of the double-blind phase via an interactive voice/web response system to receive lurasidone or identically-matched placebo (in a 1:1 ratio) for up to 28 weeks. None of the investigators, study staff, or patients had access to the randomization assignment. The initial dose of lurasidone in the double-blind phase of the study was the same as the final open-label dose; adjustments within the range of lurasidone 40 mg/d–80 mg/d were then permitted (dose increase at weekly intervals and dose reduction as needed for tolerability).

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to relapse (based on Kaplan–Meier survival analysis), with relapse defined as one or more of the following during the double-blind phase:

- **25% increase from baseline in PANSS total score and CGI-S worsening**: An increase of 25% or more from the double-blind baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and a Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) worsening of one or more points for two consecutive visits no more than ten days apart.

- **PANSS item score criteria**: At any single visit, a PANSS item score of 5 or more (moderately severe) on hostility or uncooperativeness, or a PANSS item score of 5 or more on two or more items of unusual thought content, delusions, conceptual disorganization, or hallucinatory behavior.

- **Initiation of supplemental treatment**: Initiation of supplemental treatment with an antipsychotic agent other than lurasidone.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^115RLhKM]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

The primary limitation of the study was its open-label, uncontrolled design and lack of an active comparator or placebo control group. Although the percentage of adverse effects in the study was low, precise determination of drug-specific rates of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was not possible due to the absence of a control group. In addition, patients who received lurasidone in the acute treatment study may represent a more lurasidone-tolerant group. The absence of random assignment to placebo in the study precludes making inferences about relapse prevention effectiveness associated with maintenance lurasidone treatment. Additional limitations include the sample size and the 6-month duration of the trial, which may be insufficient to adequately assess rare or very gradually developing safety issues. Future controlled trials are warranted to confirm the effectiveness and safety of long-term treatment with lurasidone in this population.

### Treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and irritability: Results from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD (MTA) [^116T7Eq6]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Clinically impairing irritability affects 25% to 45% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); yet, we know little about what interventions are effective in treating children with ADHD and co-occurring irritability. We used data from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD (MTA) to address three aims: to establish whether irritability in children with ADHD can be distinguished from other symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD); to examine whether ADHD treatment is effective in treating irritability; and to examine how irritability influences ADHD treatment outcomes.

- **Method**: Secondary analyses of data from the MTA included multivariate analyses, and intent-to-treat random-effects regression models were used.

- **Results**: Irritability was separable from other ODD symptoms. For treating irritability, systematic stimulant treatment was superior to behavioral management but not to routine community care; a combination of stimulants and behavioral treatment was superior to community care and to behavioral treatment alone, but not to medication alone. Irritability did not moderate the impact of treatment on parent- and teacher-reported ADHD symptoms in any of the four treatment groups.

- **Conclusion**: Treatments targeting ADHD symptoms are helpful for improving irritability in children with ADHD. Moreover, irritability does not appear to influence the response to treatment of ADHD.

- **Clinical trial registration information**: Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA).

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^112QDSgk]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

The mean (SD) daily dose of lurasidone during the study was 64.1 (14.4) mg and was similar in the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups. The modal daily dose of lurasidone was 20 mg for 4.2% of patients, 40 mg for 7.4% of patients, 60 mg for 61.5% of patients, 80 mg for 17.6% of patients, 100 mg for 6.3% of patients, and 120 mg for 3.1% of patients.

Among patients entering the open-label extension study from the acute adjunctive therapy studies, 39.4% continued treatment with lithium and 60.6% were treated with valproate. Among adjunctive therapy patients, the mean dose of lithium was maintained in the range of 905–958 mg/day throughout the 6 months of extension study treatment, and the mean dose of valproate was maintained in the range of 1026–1107 mg/day. Mean serum lithium concentrations ranged from 0.61 to 0.70 mEq/L, and mean serum valproate concentrations ranged from 66.3 to 69.3 μg/mL.

### Lurasidone dose escalation in early nonresponding patients with schizophrenia: A randomized, placebo-controlled study [^1142QuhP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

To assess the effect of dose increase in adult patients with schizophrenia who demonstrate inadequate initial response to standard-dose lurasidone and to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose lurasidone in adult patients with schizophrenia, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted between May 2013 and June 2014. Hospitalized patients with acute schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with lurasidone 20 mg/d (n = 101), lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 199), or placebo (n = 112). Nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] score decrease < 20%) at 2 weeks were re-randomized to lurasidone 80 mg/d or 160 mg/d for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 6 in PANSS total score.

In nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 95), dose increase to 160 mg/d at week 2 significantly reduced PANSS total score at week 6 study endpoint compared with continuing 80 mg/d (-16.6 vs. -8.9; P < .05 [effect size = 0.52]). While a comparable magnitude of improvement was observed in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score from week 2 to week 6 endpoint for lurasidone 160 mg/d versus 80 mg/d (-1.0 vs. -0.6; effect size = 0.44), the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.052). Patients receiving lurasidone 20 mg/d did not demonstrate significant improvement compared with placebo at week 6 in PANSS total (-17.6 vs. -14.5; p = 0.26) or CGI-S (-0.93 vs. -0.73; p = 0.17) scores.

### Antipsychotic use trends in youth with autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability: A meta-analysis [^111xMDGW]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Although irritability and aggression are relevant treatment targets in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disability (ID) that may prompt antipsychotic use, antipsychotic prescribing patterns in such youth have not been systematically reviewed.

We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE/PsycInfo until March 2015 for studies reporting data on the frequency of youth diagnosed with ASDs and/or ID among antipsychotic-treated youth, as well as antipsychotic use in youth with ASD/ID. We conducted a meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis of potential moderators, including publication year, study time point, country, setting, sample size, age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

A total of 39 studies were meta-analyzed (n = 365,449, age = 11.4 ± 6.2 years, males = 70.0% ± 10.0%). Among 27 studies (n = 273,139, age = 11.9 ± 8.0 years, males = 67.0% ± 12.9%) reporting on antipsychotic-treated youth, 9.5% (95% CI = 7.8%-11.5%) were diagnosed with ASD/ID. In 20 studies (n = 209,756) reporting data separately for ASD, 7.9% (95% CI = 6.2%-9.9%) had an ASD diagnosis. In 5 longitudinal studies, the proportion of antipsychotic-treated youth with ASD did not change significantly from 1996 to 2011 (6.7% to 5.8%, odds ratio = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8–1.0, p = .17). However, later study time points moderated greater ASD/ID proportions (β = 0.12, p < .00001).

In 13 studies (n = 96,688, age = 9.8 ± 1.2 years, males = 78.6% ± 2.0%) reporting on antipsychotic use in ASD samples, 17.5% (95% CI = 13.7%-22.1%) received antipsychotics. Again, later study time points moderated higher ASD/ID proportions.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111Vz1W6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, monotherapy with divalproex (level 2) is included as a second-line option.

- **Adjunctive use of antidepressant therapy**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or bupropion with lithium/divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic may also be considered as a second-line add-on treatment. While some individual studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy, a recent meta-analysis (level 1) supports efficacy, albeit with a small effect size. This is a key aspect of decision-making regarding antidepressants, since historically much of the focus has been on the risk of manic switch or rapid cycling, with an underappreciation of the relatively weak efficacy data.

This new appreciation, exemplified by the small benefit seen in the above meta-analysis, led to the change from the last CANMAT guidelines, which previously gave add-on SSRI/bupropion antidepressants a first-line recommendation. As per the ISBD Antidepressant Task Force recommendations, antidepressants should ideally be avoided, or used cautiously if necessary, in patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania or hypomania, predominant mixed features, or recent rapid cycling.

Patients and caregivers, as appropriate, should receive education regarding early warning symptoms of mood switching or cycle acceleration, and antidepressants should be discontinued if these emerge. Antidepressant monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of bipolar I depression.

- **ECT (level 3)**: Use this as a consideration in treatment plans.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^113YzVTW]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

- **Lurasidone**: A post hoc analysis of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted by McIntyre et al, evaluating the efficacy of lurasidone treatment in 485 participants with BD-I, of which 272 had mixed features (defined as having a YMRS score ≥ 4). The lurasidone dosage groups were 20–60 mg/day (starting dose: 20 mg/day for 7 days) and 80–120 mg/day (20 mg/day on days 1–2, 40 mg/day on days 3–4, 60 mg/day on days 5–6, and 80 mg/day on day 7). After day 7, doses were adjusted to optimize efficacy and tolerability. The study assessments included MADRS, CGI-BP-S, YMRS, QIDS-SR, SDS, and Q-LES-Q-SF.

	- Lurasidone treatment was associated with a significantly greater LS mean change in MADRS total score from baseline to week 6 compared to placebo (–15.7 vs. –10.9; p = 0.001; effect size, 0.48). Superiority in MADRS score compared to placebo was seen in the lurasidone group from week 2 to endpoint. The differences between lurasidone dosage groups were nonsignificant (p = 0.127). There was a significantly greater percentage of responders (≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total at LOCF endpoint) in the lurasidone group compared to placebo (51.1% vs. 32.2%; p = 0.003; NNT = 6; LOCF endpoint). Similarly, the percentage of remitters (MADRS total ≤ 12 at LOCF endpoint) was significantly greater in the lurasidone group than the placebo group (39.6% vs. 24.4%; p = 0.014; NNT = 7; LOCF endpoint).

### Aripiprazole for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [^116tW6oo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Irritability related to ASD has been treated with antipsychotics. Aripiprazole, a third generation atypical antipsychotic, is a relatively new drug that has a unique mechanism of action different from other antipsychotics.

- **Objectives**: To determine the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole for individuals with ASD.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases on 4th May 2011: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to April Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 17), PsycINFO (1887 to current), CINAHL (1937 to current), WorldCat, ZETOC, Autism Data, Conference Proceedings Index-S, Conference Proceedings Index-SSH, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. We searched for records published in 1990 or later, as this was the year aripiprazole became available.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of aripiprazole versus placebo for the treatment of individuals with a diagnosis of ASD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently collected, evaluated, and analyzed data. We performed meta-analysis for primary and secondary outcomes when possible.

- **Main results**: Two randomized controlled trials with similar methodology have evaluated the use of aripiprazole for a duration of eight weeks in 316 children with ASD. The included trials had a low risk of bias. Although we searched for studies across age groups, only studies in children and youth were found.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^112rMypq]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Baseline characteristics and patient disposition**: A combined total of 941 patients completed the three double‐blind, 6‐week, acute‐phase studies and were potentially eligible for entry in the open‐label extension study. Of this total, 817 patients (86.8%) provided informed consent and entered the extension study. This included 319 patients who completed the double‐blind acute monotherapy study (lurasidone, N = 212; placebo, N = 107), and 498 patients who completed the two double‐blind acute adjunctive therapy studies (lurasidone, N = 254; placebo, N = 244). The safety population consisted of 316 patients from the monotherapy study (two patients in the lurasidone continuation group and one in the placebo‐to‐lurasidone switch group discontinued before receiving extension study medication); and 497 patients from the adjunctive therapy studies (one patient in the placebo‐to‐lurasidone switch group discontinued before receiving extension study medication).

- **Additional medication changes**: Among acute monotherapy patients, only 2.2% (n = 7) newly initiated lithium or valproate during the extension study. One adjunctive study patient permanently discontinued mood stabilizer therapy during the extension study.

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar for patients who completed the acute monotherapy and adjunctive therapy studies, respectively. Five hundred fifty‐nine patients (68.4%) completed the extension study. The proportion of extension study completers was similar for each acute study treatment group: 71.2% in the lurasidone continuation group.

### Effectiveness of lurasidone in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder switched from other antipsychotics: A randomized, 6-week, open-label study [^113qKT3o]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of switching patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to lurasidone using three different dosing strategies.

The method involved randomizing adults diagnosed with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, in a nonacute phase of illness, into one of three lurasidone dosing regimens for the initial two weeks of the study. The dosing strategies were:

1. 40 mg/d for two weeks,
2. 40 mg/d for one week, increasing to 80 mg/d on day eight for week two (up-titration group), and
3. 80 mg/d for two weeks.

After the initial two weeks, lurasidone was flexibly dosed at 40–120 mg/d for the subsequent four weeks. The preswitch antipsychotic agent was tapered by day seven to 50% of the original dose and discontinued by the end of week two. Subjects were stratified based on whether the primary preswitch antipsychotic was classified as "sedating" (olanzapine or quetiapine) or "nonsedating" (all other antipsychotics). The primary outcome measure was time to treatment failure, defined as any occurrence of insufficient clinical response, exacerbation of underlying disease, or discontinuation due to an adverse event. The study was conducted from June 2010 to May 2011.

Regarding the results, of the 240 subjects treated in this study, 86 (35.8%) were treated with an antecedent sedating antipsychotic, and 154 (64.2%) were treated with an antecedent nonsedating antipsychotic. Nineteen (7.9%) of the 240 patients experienced treatment failure. No clinically relevant differences were observed when the three randomized switch groups were compared. Treatment failure rates were 10/86 (11.6%) versus 9/154 (5.8%) among subjects who had been receiving a preswitch sedating versus nonsedating antipsychotic, respectively.

### Ziprasidone [^116qfTYs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical trials in adults for oral ziprasidone included approximately 5,700 patients and/or normal subjects exposed to one or more doses of ziprasidone. Of these 5,700, over 4,800 were patients who participated in multiple-dose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 1,831 patient-years. These patients include 4,331 patients who participated in multiple-dose trials, predominantly in schizophrenia, representing approximately 1,698 patient-years of exposure as of February 5, 2000. This also includes 472 patients who participated in bipolar mania trials representing approximately 133 patient-years of exposure. An additional 127 patients with bipolar disorder participated in a long-term maintenance treatment study, representing approximately 74.7 patient-years of exposure to ziprasidone. The conditions and duration of treatment with ziprasidone included open-label and double-blind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and short-term and longer-term exposure.

Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by collecting voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^1168Qirm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

What are my pharmacological choices for the management of aggression in a child with ASD when standard options seem to have failed?

For some children, behavioral interventions combined with 'first line' medications, such as those suggested above, fail to alleviate symptoms. There may be several reasons for this, and it is crucial at the outset that these are explored. The diagnostic formulation may have missed an important etiological factor, or previously identified triggers or perpetuating factors may have been inadequately managed. For example, an environment with certain characteristics, such as routine, predictability, and an appropriate level of stimulation, may not be available. Additionally, there may be an absence of adequately trained support staff, and staff may fail to follow behavioral recommendations. In these circumstances, it is crucial that medication does not become the perceived 'solution'. It is unethical for the psychiatrist to be expected to medicate where services are unable to meet needs.

On the other hand, there are situations where challenging behavior continues despite attention to all identified etiological factors. Such situations are most likely to arise in the context of non-verbal autistic children who are severely or profoundly cognitively impaired. While it remains important to continue to work towards a greater understanding of the behavior's underpinning, this is often very challenging. Medication may thus be considered as a least restrictive, best interest option in consultation with decision-makers.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^111rt4pm]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In individuals with ASD, determining the underlying cause of irritability is a crucial first step for appropriate treatment. Unrecognized or untreated medical or physical issues, such as headaches, oral abscesses, ear infections, constipation, or GERD, may contribute to irritability. Proper medical attention in these cases can alleviate symptoms. Irritability may also signify an additional psychiatric condition, requiring targeted treatment. Typically, such cases involve more symptoms than irritability alone, including changes in sleep, appetite, or concentration.

For example, mood disorders like depression or bipolar disorder, as well as anxiety disorders, may present as irritability in ASD. Similarly, ADHD-related impulsivity might drive emotional dysregulation manifesting as irritability. A study of 123 psychiatrically referred youth with ASD indicated that complaints of irritability might primarily signal depression in this population. Early assessment is crucial to determine whether physical, psychiatric, behavioral, or communicative factors contribute to irritability, enabling treatment of the root cause.

Given the complexity of potential underlying causes of irritability, an ideal assessment pathway includes multidisciplinary, expert input. An extensive practice pathway for addressing irritability was described by McGuire et al. (2016).

### Risperdal [^115zG33A]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The dosage of Risperdal should be individualized according to the response and tolerability of the patient. The total daily dose of Risperdal can be administered once daily, or half the total daily dose can be administered twice daily.

- **Irritability associated with autistic disorder – Pediatrics (children and adolescents)**: For patients with a body weight less than 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.25 mg per day. For patients with a body weight greater than or equal to 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.5 mg per day. After a minimum of four days, the dose may be increased to the recommended dose of 0.5 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg and 1.0 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. Maintain this dose for a minimum of 14 days. In patients not achieving sufficient clinical response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 2 weeks or greater, in increments of 0.25 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg, or increments of 0.5 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. The effective dose range is 0.5 mg to 3 mg per day. No dosing data are available for children who weigh less than 15 kg. Once sufficient clinical response has been achieved and maintained, consider gradually lowering the dose to achieve the optimal balance of efficacy and safety. The physician who elects to use Risperdal for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from a once-daily dose administered at bedtime or administering half the daily dose twice.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^1162Fhdg]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

The safety profile for both monotherapy and adjunctive treatment groups combined indicated that the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were Parkinsonism (10.7%; a combined term comprising bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, drooling, hypokinesia, muscle rigidity, Parkinsonism, psychomotor retardation, and tremor), akathisia (8.1%), somnolence (8.0%; a combined term including hypersomnia, sedation, and somnolence), headache (7.7%), nausea (7.6%), insomnia (6.4%), and anxiety (5.8%). The incidence of Parkinsonism, akathisia, somnolence, and anxiety was higher in the lurasidone adjunctive therapy group compared to the monotherapy group by 2.3% to 7.7%, with a marginal increase in insomnia by 0.2%. No consistent trend was observed for other adverse events.

For patients treated with lurasidone as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, the majority of adverse events were classified as mild (44.9% and 52.3%, respectively) or moderate (29.1% and 37.2%) in severity. In the combined treatment groups, the most frequently rated severe TEAEs were akathisia (1.4%), depression (1.1%), and insomnia (0.5%). Among patients discontinuing due to a TEAE, akathisia (1.1%) was the most commonly cited reason, while other TEAEs were reported by less than 0.5% of patients.

### Efficacy and safety of lurasidone in children and adolescents with bipolar I depression: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115QH82f]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lurasidone in children and adolescents with bipolar depression.

- **Method**: Patients aged 10 to 17 years with a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar I depression were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with flexible doses of lurasidone, ranging from 20 to 80 mg/day. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 6 in the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score, evaluated by a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 347 patients were randomized and received at least one dose of lurasidone (n = 175; mean age 14.2 years; mean dose 33.6 mg/day) or placebo (n = 172; mean age 14.3 years). At week 6, treatment with lurasidone was associated with a statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in the CDRS-R total score (-21.0 versus -15.3; p < .0001; effect size 0.45). Lurasidone also was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Severity depression score, a key secondary measure, and in measures of anxiety, quality of life, and global functioning. Study completion rates were 92.0% in the lurasidone group and 89.7% in the placebo group; discontinuation rates due to adverse events were the same for both groups (1.7%). The two most common adverse events with lurasidone were nausea and somnolence. Treatment with lurasidone was associated with few effects on weight and metabolic parameters.

- **Conclusion**: In this placebo-controlled study, monotherapy with lurasidone, in the dose range of 20 to 80 mg/day, significantly decreased depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with bipolar I depression.

### Long-term safety and effectiveness of open-label lurasidone in antipsychotic-naïve versus previously treated adolescents with schizophrenia: A post-hoc analysis [^116KT235]. Schizophrenia Research (2022). Low credibility.

There is a relative lack of long-term, prospective data evaluating the safety and effectiveness of treatment in early-onset adolescent patients with schizophrenia who are treatment-naïve. The aim of this post-hoc analysis was to examine the long-term safety and effectiveness of lurasidone in adolescents with schizophrenia who were antipsychotic treatment-naïve (TN; at the time of enrollment in the initial study) compared to adolescents treated previously (TP) with an antipsychotic.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 13–17 who completed 6 weeks of double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled treatment with lurasidone were enrolled in a 2-year, open-label (OL), flexible-dose (20–80 mg/day) lurasidone study.

- **Results**: The long-term analysis sample consisted of 50 TN and 221 TP patients, of whom 40% and 43%, respectively, discontinued prematurely. The three most common adverse events for TN and TP patients, respectively, were headache (26.0%, 23.5%); schizophrenia (14.0%, 12.2%); dizziness (16.0%, 4.1%); and nausea (16.0%, 11.8%). At endpoint, the mean increase in weight was similar to expected weight gain based on growth charts for both TN (+4.5 kg vs. +5.7 kg) and TP (+4.6 kg vs. +6.6 kg) patients. Minimal changes were observed for each group in metabolic parameters and prolactin. Mean improvement was consistently greater in the TN vs. TP group (-19.2 vs. -15.9; effect size of 0.33) for between-group change in PANSS total score at Week 104.

- **Conclusions**: In both TN and TP adolescents with schizophrenia, long-term treatment with lurasidone was associated with minimal effects on body weight.

### The status of irritability in psychiatry: A conceptual and quantitative review [^113vjpiE]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

There is indirect evidence from the adult literature that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be effective in the treatment of irritability, aggression, and explosive outbursts in the context of mood disorders (depression, dysthymic disorder, premenstrual syndrome, or anxiety), and intermittent explosive disorder. However, none of these trials has targeted irritability in itself. Trials of SSRIs following a stimulant lead-in phase are ongoing at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), but no other research in young people has been published.

Antipsychotics may be effective in decreasing irritability and aggression in children with sub-average IQ and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the extent to which irritability in those trials (typically measured by observation using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist) corresponds to irritability as defined in most studies quoted in this article remains unclear.

For psychological interventions, parent training may be effective in reducing irritability in children with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and ASD. In addition, individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated effectiveness in youth with excessive anger and Tourette syndrome. Individual CBT also reduced temper outbursts in a clinical sample of young people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depressive symptoms, but this was not a trial design. Group CBT has been shown to be effective in one trial of youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) plus severe mood dysregulation (SMD).

Recently, and based on the work of Penton-Voak et al, Stoddard et al. tested whether the judgment of ambiguous faces as angry could be modified, with implications for treatments targeting irritability.

### Psychopharmacology management in autism spectrum disorder [^114hMvKh]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

Persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have other psychiatric conditions that warrant treatment. Symptoms may not be easy to discern from rigidity or irritability, which are sometimes considered to be constituent parts of ASD. Pathophysiology involving hyperexcitable neurons and anomalous connectivity may justify the use of psychopharmacologic agents, although nonmedical strategies may also be effective. Hyperactivity, irritability, and tantrums, with or without aggression, may be rational targets for psychopharmacological intervention. The best-studied drug class at the time of writing has been the second-generation antipsychotics targeting irritability.

### Acute treatment of mania: an update on new medications [^111bWgC1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Acute mania often presents as a medical emergency requiring hospitalization to manage behavioral control, irritability, agitation, mood escalation, and risk-taking behavior. Lithium's efficacy in managing acute mania was reported in 1949 and later approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1970. Chlorpromazine, a typical antipsychotic, was approved for treating bipolar disorder in 1973 and was commonly used as monotherapy or as an adjunct for bipolar mania treatment over the subsequent two decades.

Divalproex gained FDA approval for acute mania treatment in 1994. Since the approval of olanzapine in 2000, five atypical antipsychotics have been approved by the FDA for managing acute mania: risperidone (2003), quetiapine (2004), ziprasidone (2004), and aripiprazole (2004). Notably, clozapine remains the only atypical antipsychotic not approved by the FDA for any phase of bipolar disorder.

This article aims to systematically review major studies, randomized controlled monotherapy, and adjunct therapy trials involving five atypical antipsychotics and newer anticonvulsants for treating acute bipolar mania.

### Irritability and elation in a large bipolar youth sample: Relative symptom severity and clinical outcomes over 4 years [^115sbZDR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to assess whether the relative severity of irritability symptoms versus elation symptoms in mania is stable and predicts the subsequent illness course in youth with DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder or operationally defined bipolar disorder not otherwise specified.

Investigators utilized the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children to assess the most severe lifetime manic episode in bipolar youth aged 7–17 years. These youth were recruited from 2000 to 2006 as part of the Course and Outcomes of Bipolar Youth prospective cohort study (N = 361), conducted at university-affiliated mental health clinics. Subjects with at least 4 years of follow-up (N = 309) were classified as irritable-only (n = 30), elated-only (n = 42), or both irritable and elated (n = 237) at baseline. The primary outcome was the stability of this categorization over follow-up. Additionally, the course of mood symptoms and episodes, risk of suicide attempt, and functioning over follow-up were compared between baseline groups.

Most subjects experienced both irritability and elation during the follow-up. The agreement between baseline and follow-up group assignments did not exceed that expected by chance (κ = 0.03; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.12). Subjects classified as elated-only were most likely to report the absence of both irritability and elation symptoms at every follow-up assessment (35.7%, as opposed to 26.7% of irritable-only subjects and 16.9% of those with both irritability and elation; p = 0.01). All baseline groups experienced mania or hypomania for a similar proportion of the follow-up period.

### Treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and irritability: Results from the multimodal treatment study of children with ADHD (MTA) [^115CW1BS]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). High credibility.

Clinically impairing irritability affects 25% to 45% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); yet, we know little about what interventions are effective in treating children with ADHD and co-occurring irritability. We used data from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA) to address three aims:

- **To establish whether irritability in children with ADHD can be distinguished from other symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)**: Secondary analyses of data from the MTA included multivariate analyses, and intent-to-treat random-effects regression models were used.

- **To examine whether ADHD treatment is effective in treating irritability**: Irritability was separable from other ODD symptoms. For treating irritability, systematic stimulant treatment was superior to behavioral management but not to routine community care. A combination of stimulants and behavioral treatment was superior to community care and to behavioral treatment alone, but not to medication alone.

- **To examine how irritability influences ADHD treatment outcomes**: Irritability did not moderate the impact of treatment on parent- and teacher-reported ADHD symptoms in any of the four treatment groups.

Treatments targeting ADHD symptoms are helpful for improving irritability in children with ADHD. Moreover, irritability does not appear to influence the response to treatment of ADHD.

### Efficacy and acceptability of lurasidone for bipolar depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^1167zkKq]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

In terms of acceptability, this meta-analysis found no significant association between lurasidone dosage and the incidence of critical issues such as dropout, mania, or suicide. These findings suggest that increasing doses of lurasidone remain relatively safe, mitigating concerns about their usage in clinical practice. However, our results indicate that with increasing doses, the risk of side effects, such as akathisia or parkinsonism, does increase. This highlights the need for clinicians to be aware of these non-urgent adverse effects when adjusting lurasidone dosage.

Additionally, we observed a trend of protective efficacy against manic switch at daily doses above 50–60 mg. This may be explained by lurasidone's role as a full antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor.

- **Metabolic and endocrine effects**: Lurasidone has three broad categories of metabolic and endocrine effects.
	- Certain dose ranges significantly increase the risk of adverse effects such as weight gain. Below 60 mg, weight increased significantly. Interestingly, a trend towards weight reduction was observed at higher doses of lurasidone (greater than 70–80 mg). This effect may be attributed to lurasidone's 5-HT7 receptor inverse agonism, which suppresses adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling in a concentration-dependent manner, thereby mitigating the risk of weight gain compared with other antipsychotics.
	- Another outcome measure was an increase in fasting blood glucose levels. Our findings suggested a significant risk at doses above 70 mg, although HbA1c was not assessed.

### Ziprasidone [^116F6mM1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Titration within the range of 40 to 80 mg twice daily (in 20 mg twice daily increments) was permitted for the duration of the study (beginning on Day 2). Ziprasidone was significantly more effective than placebo in the reduction of the MRS total score and the CGI-S score. The mean daily dose of ziprasidone in this study was 112 mg.

- **Maintenance therapy**: The efficacy of ziprasidone as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in a placebo-controlled trial in patients who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. The trial included patients whose most recent episode was manic or mixed, with or without psychotic features. In the open-label phase, patients were required to be stabilized on ziprasidone plus lithium or valproic acid for at least 8 weeks in order to be randomized. In the double-blind randomized phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or valproic acid and were randomized to receive either ziprasidone (administered twice daily totaling 80 mg to 160 mg per day) or placebo. Generally, in the maintenance phase, patients continued on the same dose on which they were stabilized during the stabilization phase. The primary endpoint in this study was time to recurrence of a mood episode (manic, mixed, or depressed episode) requiring intervention, which was defined as any of the following: discontinuation due to a mood episode, clinical intervention for a mood episode (e.g. initiation of medication or hospitalization), or Mania Rating Scale score > 18 or a MADRS score > 18 on two consecutive assessments.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^112jAD3b]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

In the monotherapy group, the proportion reporting at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was somewhat lower for patients switching from acute study placebo to lurasidone compared to patients continuing on lurasidone (58.5% vs. 63.8%); in the adjunctive therapy group, the proportion was higher (70.4% vs. 63.8%).

During the extension study, serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 3.0% of patients, including 2.2% in the monotherapy group and 3.4% in the adjunctive therapy group. The following serious adverse events were reported in the overall safety population: worsening depression (n = 8; 1.0%), suicidal ideation (n = 3; 0.4%), bone fractures (n = 3; 0.4%), suicide attempt (n = 2; 0.2%), mania (n = 2; 0.2%), and one each of pancreatitis, appendicitis, a hypersensitivity reaction, skin neoplasm, and lumbar spinal stenosis.

In addition, two deaths were reported during the study; each was judged by the investigator to be unrelated to study medication. One involved a motor vehicle accident in a patient who completed 6 weeks of double-blind adjunctive therapy with lurasidone 60 mg and 11 days of open-label adjunctive therapy with lurasidone 60 mg. The other was a suicide by hanging, occurring 7 days after taking a single extension study dose of lurasidone in a patient who had previously received placebo in the acute monotherapy study. Based on C-SSRS results, treatment with lurasidone was associated with the emergence of suicidal ideation or behavior at some point during the 6-month study in 5.0% of patients in the monotherapy group.

### Risperdal [^1133pH1i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Risperdal in the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder was established in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents (aged 5 to 16 years) who met the DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder. Over 90% of these subjects were under 12 years of age and most weighed over 20 kg (16–104.3 kg).

Efficacy was evaluated using two assessment scales: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Clinical Global Impression - Change (CGI-C) scale. The primary outcome measure in both trials was the change from baseline to endpoint in the Irritability subscale of the ABC (ABC-I). The ABC-I subscale measured the emotional and behavioral symptoms of autism, including aggression towards others, deliberate self-injuriousness, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods. The CGI-C rating at endpoint was a co-primary outcome measure in one of the studies.

The results of these trials are as follows:

- **In the first 8-week, placebo-controlled trial**: Children and adolescents with autistic disorder (n = 101), aged 5 to 16 years, received twice daily doses of placebo or Risperdal 0.5–3.5 mg/day on a weight-adjusted basis. Risperdal, starting at 0.25 mg/day or 0.5 mg/day depending on baseline weight (< 20 kg and ≥ 20 kg, respectively) and titrated to clinical response (mean modal dose of 1.9 mg/day, equivalent to 0.06 mg/kg/day), significantly improved scores on the ABC-I subscale and on the CGI-C scale compared with placebo.

- **In the second 8-week, placebo-controlled trial**: Children with autistic disorder (n = 55), aged 5 to…

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^115NwNwo]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of six months of open-label, uncontrolled extension treatment with lurasidone in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar depression who completed six weeks of acute treatment.

- **Methods**: Patients who completed six weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment with either lurasidone monotherapy (one study) or adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (two studies) were treated for six months with flexible doses of lurasidone, 20–120 mg/day, in an open-label, uncontrolled extension study. The study included a total of 813 patients, with 38.9% receiving monotherapy and 61.1% receiving adjunctive therapy. Changes in safety parameters were calculated from the double-blind, acute-phase baseline to month six of the extension phase, using a last observation carried forward (LOCF endpoint) analysis.

- **Results**: Five hundred fifty-nine of 817 patients (68.4%) completed the extension study. In the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups, 6.9% and 9.0% of the patients, respectively, discontinued due to an adverse event. For the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups, changes from the double-blind baseline to month six were observed as follows: weight increased by +0.8 and +0.9 kg (mean), total cholesterol changed by 0.0 and +2.0 mg/dL (median), triglycerides increased by +5.0 and +5.0 mg/dL (median), and glucose changed by −1.0 and 0.0 mg/dL (median). A decrease was noted in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), with scores reducing by −22.6 and −21.7 (mean). Compared to the open-label baseline, changes at month six were +0.85 and +0.88 kg for weight (mean), and −6.9 and −6.5 for MADRS (mean).

- **Conclusions**: Six months of treatment with open-label lurasidone was found to be safe and well tolerated in this study.

### Ziprasidone [^116qw4JP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Lactation**: Limited data from a published case report indicate the presence of ziprasidone in human milk. Although there are no reports of adverse effects on a breastfed infant exposed to ziprasidone via breast milk, there are reports of excess sedation, irritability, poor feeding, and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements) in infants exposed to other atypical antipsychotics through breast milk [see Clinical Considerations]. There is no information on the effects of ziprasidone on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ziprasidone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ziprasidone or from the mother's underlying condition.

- **Clinical considerations**: Infants exposed to ziprasidone should be monitored for excess sedation, irritability, poor feeding, and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements).

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**:
	- **Infertility**:
		- **Females**: Based on the pharmacologic action of ziprasidone (D2 antagonism), treatment with ziprasidone may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible reduction in fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of ziprasidone have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric information is approved for Viatris Specialty LLC's Geodon (ziprasidone HCl) capsules.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^117LqWFq]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Although treatment guidelines have commonly recommended maintenance therapy with lamotrigine or quetiapine as first-line treatments in bipolar disorder patients at risk for depressive episode recurrence, there clearly is a need for additional options that are safe, well-tolerated, and effective for the maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder patients at risk for depression recurrence.

Lurasidone has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Three randomized, double‐blind, 6‐week trials have been completed: a monotherapy trial comparing two flexible-fixed doses of lurasidone (20–60 mg/day; 80–120 mg/day), and two flexible dose trials of lurasidone (20–120 mg/day) administered adjunctively with lithium or valproate. We report here the results of the 6-month, open-label, uncontrolled extension of the three 6-week studies, designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of lurasidone in patients with bipolar depression. A secondary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of lurasidone in maintaining improvement in depressive symptoms.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^116fJj1v]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Mean changes in weight from the double-blind baseline at 6 months (observed cases) were modest and similar for both the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups, with values of 0.85 kg and 0.88 kg, respectively. The proportion of patients with a ≥ 7% increase in weight at month 6 was lower in the monotherapy group compared to the adjunctive therapy group, with percentages of 8.2% and 14.9%, respectively. Mean changes in BMI at month 6 were low (+0.3) in both the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups.

Small median changes from the double-blind baseline were observed at month 6 for both the monotherapy and adjunctive groups in total cholesterol (0.0 and +2.0 mg/dL), triglycerides (+5.0 and +5.0 mg/dL), and glucose (−1.0 and 0.0 mg/dL; observed cases). There were no changes in HbA1c greater than +2.4% in either the monotherapy or adjunctive therapy groups. Modest median increases in prolactin, in the range of 0.5–2.7 ng/mL, were observed for both groups.

No clinically significant changes were observed for heart rate, orthostatic blood pressure changes (systolic or diastolic), respiratory rate, or body temperature. No patient in either the monotherapy or adjunctive groups had a QTcB value > 500 ms after the open-label baseline. One patient (0.4%) in the monotherapy group and two patients (0.5%) in the adjunctive therapy group had an increase from the double-blind baseline in QTcB value ≥ 60 ms.

### Lurasidone for the treatment of acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia: a 6-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^113pVwUG]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of established antipsychotic agents for the treatment of schizophrenia, unmet needs remain for effective medications with lower adverse-effect burdens. This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the atypical antipsychotic lurasidone in patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Patients were randomized for six weeks of double-blind treatment with lurasidone at doses of 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, or 120 mg/day, or with placebo. Changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores were evaluated using mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis. Vital signs, laboratory parameters, extrapyramidal symptoms, and electrocardiograms were assessed.

- **Efficacy**: Treatment with lurasidone 80 mg/day resulted in significantly greater improvement in PANSS total score compared with placebo (-23.4 versus -17.0; p < 0.05) at study endpoint (MMRM). Lurasidone 40 mg/day and 120 mg/day achieved clinically meaningful overall PANSS score reductions from baseline (-19.2 and -20.5), but not significant separation from placebo.

- **Safety and adverse effects**: Differences between all lurasidone groups and placebo for changes in laboratory parameters and electrocardiographic measures were minimal. Weight gain ≥ 7% occurred in 8.2% of patients receiving lurasidone compared to 3.2% receiving placebo. Modest increases in prolactin (median increase, 0.7 ng/mL) and extrapyramidal symptoms were observed following treatment with lurasidone compared with placebo. Akathisia was the most commonly reported adverse event with lurasidone (17.6% versus 3.1% with placebo).
