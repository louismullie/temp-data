## Question

What is the USPSTF recommendation for mammogram

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current USPSTF mammography screening recommendations, including what changed from prior guidance, the evidence basis, key exceptions, and how to contextualize this for practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative source and confirm the exact recommendation language. Then, I should verify the grade and certainty language. Next, I will review what changed from the 2016 recommendation and why. After that, I need to check the evidence basis, including modeling and equity considerations. Then, I should confirm the scope and exclusions, including high-risk populations. Finally, I will examine the I statements for ages 75 and older and dense breasts, and close with practical clinical implications and a concise summary statement [^111v445a] [^111w79wY].

> Let me first confirm the primary source and the exact recommendation. The 2024 USPSTF Recommendation Statement in JAMA is the definitive source and states that the USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years, assigning a Grade B recommendation, which means there is moderate certainty of moderate net benefit in this population [^111v445a] [^111w79wY].

> Wait, let me verify the grade definitions so I don't misstate certainty. The USPSTF grading framework defines Grade B as recommending the service when there is high certainty of moderate benefit or moderate certainty of moderate to substantial benefit, which aligns with the panel's conclusion here for ages 40 to 74 years [^114PF5kp].

> Hold on, I should verify what changed from the prior recommendation. In 2016, the USPSTF recommended routine biennial screening for ages 50 to 74 years and advised individualized decision-making for ages 40 to 49 years; the 2024 update now recommends routine biennial screening beginning at age 40 years, extending the routine recommendation down to 40 while keeping the upper bound at 74 years, reflecting a shift from individualized to routine screening in the 40 to 49 age group [^115rr2g8] [^1161ZMKt].

> I need to check the evidence basis for this change. The Task Force cites rising incidence in women aged 40 to 49 years and modeling that shows additional mortality benefit from starting at 40, with collaborative modeling estimating approximately 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted per 1000 women screened over a lifetime when screening starts at 40 versus 50, and a greater absolute benefit for Black women, which informed the equity-focused update [^116Z9RwC] [^1173MPhP].

> Let me consider the balance of benefits and harms so I don't overstate the net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening in 40 to 74 year olds has a moderate net benefit, acknowledging harms including false positives, overdiagnosis, and radiation exposure, and modeling suggests that biennial screening yields a more favorable benefit-to-harm ratio than annual screening in this population [^114RsHpK] [^1143wjeU] [^114S3M89].

> I should confirm the scope and applicability so I don't misapply the recommendation. These recommendations apply to cisgender women and all other persons assigned female at birth aged 40 years or older at average risk of breast cancer, and importantly, they do not apply to persons with high-risk genetic markers or syndromes, prior chest radiation at a young age, or a history of breast cancer or high-risk breast lesions, who may require different strategies [^1132Uq9r].

> Next, I should review the I statements and make sure I get the nuance right. For women aged 75 years or older, the USPSTF issues an I statement, concluding that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography, so decisions should be individualized based on health status and preferences; similarly, for women with dense breasts who have an otherwise negative mammogram, evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against supplemental ultrasound or MRI, so shared decision-making is appropriate while recognizing that dense breasts reduce mammographic sensitivity and are associated with increased cancer risk [^112XMF5M] [^111Dn8gi] [^116Lbqt3].

> But wait, what about screening intervals and modality — did the Task Force endorse annual screening or a specific technology here. I should double-check that. The 2024 recommendation specifies biennial screening and notes that both digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are effective primary screening modalities; it also highlights that modeling and indirect comparisons suggest biennial screening achieves a better benefit-to-harm balance than annual screening in average-risk populations, which is why the interval remains every 2 years rather than annually [^112XMF5M] [^114S3M89].

> I will now examine the equity framing to ensure I capture the intent. The update explicitly addresses disparities, noting that Black women experience higher breast cancer mortality and that modeling demonstrates greater absolute mortality reduction for Black women when screening begins at 40, which was a key driver for lowering the routine starting age to 40 in the current recommendation [^116Z9RwC] [^114PxDUQ].

> Let me reconsider whether any major organization has diverged from this stance since 2024, and I should confirm alignment. The American Academy of Family Physicians has endorsed the 2024 USPSTF recommendation, supporting biennial screening from ages 40 to 74 years, while other societies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Radiology continue to support starting at 40 with annual or biennial intervals, underscoring that practice variation persists but the USPSTF now provides a unified, evidence-based starting point for average-risk screening [^113vd65N] [^1164hhhG].

> In summary, I need to ensure the final clinical takeaway is crisp and accurate. The current USPSTF recommendation is: offer biennial screening mammography for all average-risk women aged 40 to 74 years, with a Grade B rating indicating moderate certainty of moderate net benefit; for women 75 and older and for average-risk women with dense breasts considering supplemental imaging, use shared decision-making given insufficient evidence, and tailor screening for high-risk individuals outside this average-risk framework [^111w79wY] [^111Dn8gi] [^1132Uq9r].

---

The USPSTF recommends **biennial screening mammography for women aged 40–74 years** at average risk [^111v445a] [^111w79wY], concluding with moderate certainty that this strategy has a moderate net benefit [^114RsHpK]. For women aged 75 years or older, the USPSTF finds **insufficient evidence** to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography [^111v445a] [^112fHv1Z]. The USPSTF also concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend supplemental screening with ultrasound or MRI for women with dense breasts [^111v445a] [^111Dn8gi] [^116Lbqt3]. These recommendations apply to cisgender women and all persons assigned female at birth at average risk, and do not apply to individuals with a high-risk genetic marker or syndrome, a history of chest radiation at a young age, or previous breast cancer or high-risk breast lesions [^1132Uq9r].

---

## Current USPSTF recommendations (2024)

The USPSTF issued updated breast cancer screening recommendations in 2024, reflecting new evidence and modeling data [^111v445a]. The key recommendations are:

- **Biennial screening mammography**: Recommended for women aged 40–74 years at average risk [^111v445a] [^111w79wY].

- **Insufficient evidence**: For women aged 75 years or older, the USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography [^111v445a] [^112fHv1Z].

- **Supplemental screening**: The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend supplemental screening with breast ultrasound or MRI for women with dense breasts [^111v445a] [^111Dn8gi] [^116Lbqt3].

---

## Rationale for current recommendations

The USPSTF's recommendations are based on a comprehensive review of evidence, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and collaborative modeling analyses [^111EN7pj]. The rationale for recommending biennial screening mammography for women aged 40–74 years includes:

- **Mortality reduction**: Biennial screening mammography has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality, particularly in women aged 50–74 years [^114LAP2V] [^114RsHpK].

- **Moderate net benefit**: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening mammography in women aged 40–74 years has a moderate net benefit, balancing the benefits of early detection with the harms of false positives, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary biopsies [^111v445a] [^114RsHpK].

- **Equity considerations**: The updated recommendations emphasize addressing disparities in breast cancer mortality, particularly among Black women, who have higher mortality rates despite similar or higher screening rates compared to other racial and ethnic groups [^111v445a] [^115CmTN4].

---

## Comparison with previous recommendations

The 2024 USPSTF recommendations represent a significant shift from the 2016 guidelines, which recommended biennial screening mammography for women aged 50–74 years and advised individualized decision-making for women aged 40–49 years [^115rr2g8]. The 2024 update lowers the recommended starting age to 40 years for all average-risk women, reflecting new evidence on incidence trends and modeling analyses demonstrating additional mortality benefits from earlier screening [^116Z9RwC].

---

## Controversies and criticisms

The USPSTF recommendations have sparked ongoing debate and criticism, particularly regarding:

- **Age of initiation**: Critics argue that starting screening at age 40 may lead to increased false positives, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary biopsies, particularly in younger women [^1143wjeU] [^114S3M89].

- **Screening interval**: The USPSTF's recommendation of biennial screening has been criticized by some organizations, such as the American College of Radiology, which advocates for annual screening to maximize mortality reduction [^1164hhhG].

- **Supplemental screening**: The USPSTF's conclusion that evidence is insufficient to recommend supplemental screening for dense breasts has been criticized by advocacy groups and clinicians who argue that additional imaging can improve detection in this high-risk population [^111Dn8gi] [^116Lbqt3].

---

## Impact of USPSTF recommendations on clinical practice and public health

The USPSTF recommendations significantly influence clinical practice and public health policy in the United States. Because the Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates coverage of preventive services graded "A" or "B" by the USPSTF without cost-sharing, the 2024 recommendation for biennial screening mammography for women aged 40–74 years is expected to increase access and utilization of screening services [^113Fo1A9]. However, **implementation challenges remain**, including disparities in access to care, follow-up after abnormal results, and the need for patient education about the benefits and harms of screening [^116Z9cvr].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

The USPSTF identifies several **research gaps and future directions**, including:

- **Benefits and harms of screening in women aged 75 years or older**: Further research is needed to determine the optimal screening strategies for this age group [^113P15Rv].

- **Supplemental screening for dense breasts**: Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound, MRI, and other modalities in women with dense breasts [^113P15Rv].

- **Personalized screening strategies**: Research on risk-based screening approaches, incorporating genetic risk, family history, and other factors, is ongoing and may inform future guidelines [^1158yLjG].

---

The USPSTF recommends **biennial screening mammography for women aged 40–74 years** at average risk, concluding with moderate certainty that this strategy has a moderate net benefit [^111v445a]. For women aged 75 years or older, evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography [^112fHv1Z]. The USPSTF also concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend supplemental screening with breast ultrasound or MRI for women with dense breasts [^111Dn8gi].

Mammography screening is one of the major medical accomplishments of the past 40 years. In light of the downstream consequences of any screening test, it was critical that mammography screening be challenged. There have been many legitimate challenges, as well as many challenges that are not scientifically based but have gained credibility because of repetition. The latter have led to a great deal of confusion among women and their physicians. The aim of this review is to dispel many of the misunderstandings that have developed in the past 4 decades and, hopefully, reduce the confusion that has occurred. Mammography screening does not find all breast cancers and does not find all cancers early enough to result in a cure, but it is a major advance, and women should not be denied access to its benefits.

### The recent US preventive services task force guidelines are not supported by the scientific evidence and should be rescinded [^113USqxK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The recent US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on mammographic screening ignore the scientific evidence and should be rescinded. There are no data to support the age of 50 years as a threshold for screening. There are no data to support screening women aged 40 to 49 years on the basis of risk. The USPSTF failed to understand the randomized controlled trials and used the lowest possible benefit in its calculations. The death rate from breast cancer has decreased by 30%, primarily because of screening. The agency ignored direct data with regard to decreasing deaths in real populations in favor of computer models. The USPSTF admits that its guidelines will result in unnecessary deaths from breast cancer that could be avoided by screening annually beginning at the age of 40 years.

### Mammography rates after the 2009 US preventive services task force breast cancer screening recommendation [^115abdrY]. Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To measure the impact of the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) breast cancer screening recommendation, which recommended against routine screening for women aged 40 to 49 and stated that there was "insufficient evidence" to recommend screening for women aged 75 and older, on mammography rates.

Methods

Self-reported mammography rates were calculated using the 2006–2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (n = 29,857). The paper reports mammography rates by age group (40 to 49, 50 to 74, and 75 and older), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and region. The study was performed at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, USA in 2012.

Results

Differences in mammography rates between 2010 and earlier years were not significant. Among women aged 40–49, biennial mammography rates declined by -0.5 percentage points between 2006 to 2009 and 2010 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.0 to 1.9; p = 0.67). Among women aged 50–74, rates declined by -0.07 percentage points (95% CI: -1.8 to 1.7; p = 0.93). Among women aged 75 years and older, rates declined by -0.1 percentage points (95% CI: -4.2 to 3.9; p = 0.94).

Conclusion

The revision to the USPSTF breast cancer screening recommendation did not affect screening patterns.

### Trends in breast cancer screening: impact of U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations [^112spL68]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although there is general agreement among various guidelines on benefits of routine screening mammography, the age of screening initiation and the optimal frequency of the test remain controversial. In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against routine breast cancer screening in women aged younger than 50 years. In this study, screening mammography guideline adherence among U.S. women is explored by examining patterns in rates of mammography age of initiation and utilization in years prior to and following the 2009 USPSTF guideline implementation.

Methods

U.S. population-based data from the 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys were used to measure the overall proportion and rate of change in the proportion of women who underwent screening mammography within the last year, by age and survey year. Data were accessed and analyzed in July 2014.

Results

Rates of mammography screening were lower in 2010 and 2012 compared with 2007 and 2008 (p < 0.0001). The rate of screening initiation at age 40 years increased over time and was the highest in the years following USPSTF guideline changes (p = 0.012).

Conclusions

These data support no perceptible change in U.S. women's patterns of screening mammography age at initiation within 3 years of the USPSTF guideline revision. Whether this finding reflects a delayed effect of guideline revision in population trends or rather health provider practice and patient preference for more frequent screening is unclear and requires further investigation.

### Screening for breast cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MthJP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for breast cancer in the general population.

Methods

The USPSTF examined the evidence on the efficacy of 5 screening modalities in reducing mortality from breast cancer: film mammography, clinical breast examination, breast self-examination, digital mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging in order to update the 2002 recommendation. To accomplish this update, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review of 6 selected questions relating to benefits and harms of screening, and 2) a decision analysis that used population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of starting and ending mammography screening at different ages and using annual versus biennial screening intervals.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends against routine screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years. The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take into account patient context, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms. (Grade C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women between the ages of 50 and 74 years. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography in women 40 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against clinicians teaching women how to perform breast self-examination. (Grade D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess additional benefits and harms of either digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging instead of film mammography as screening modalities for breast cancer. (I statement).

### Mammography use and physician recommendation after the 2009 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force breast cancer screening recommendations [^115KCuYQ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) no longer recommended routine mammography for women aged 40–49 and ≥ 75 years (younger and older women, respectively). Whether mammography usage and physician recommendation among younger and older women changed in response to these recommendations is unclear.

Methods

Cross-sectional data from women aged ≥ 40 years in the 2008 and 2013 National Health Interview Surveys were used (n = 4,942 younger and 3,047 older women) and were analyzed in 2015. Changes between 2008 and 2013 in self-reports about having undergone mammography in the past 2 years and physician recommendation for mammography were expressed as adjusted prevalence difference (PD) and 95% CI.

Results

Overall, adjusted prevalence of mammography among younger women was similar in 2008 (62.2%) and 2013 (58.5%) (p = 0.05), but significantly declined in high-income (PD = -6.1%, 95% CI = -11.2, -1.0); non-Hispanic white (PD = -5.5%, 95% CI = -10.2, -0.8); and privately insured (PD = -5.7%, 95% CI = -9.8, -1.6) younger women. For older women, there was no change in adjusted mammography prevalence overall (2008, 56.2%; 2013, 54.2%; p = 0.473) or by SES. Physician mammography recommendation declined in younger (PD = -5.0%, 95% CI = -8.7, -1.3) and older (PD = -5.8%, 95% CI = -10.5, -1.1) women.

Conclusions

Four years after publication of USPSTF mammography recommendations, mammography prevalence for younger and older women did not significantly decrease except for higher-SES younger women. The significant decrease in physician recommendation of mammography in younger and older women may reflect a change in practice patterns by some physicians in response to USPSTF recommendations.

### Change in breast cancer screening intervals since the 2009 USPSTF guideline [^114jkQf5]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended biennial mammography for women aged 50–74 years and shared decision-making for women aged 40–49 years for breast cancer screening. We evaluated changes in mammography screening interval after the 2009 recommendations.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of women aged 40–74 years who received 821,052 screening mammograms between 2006 and 2012 using data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We compared changes in screening intervals and stratified intervals based on whether the mammogram at the end of the interval occurred before or after the 2009 recommendation. Differences in mean interval length by woman-level characteristics were compared using linear regression.

Results

The mean interval (in months) minimally decreased after the 2009 USPSTF recommendations. Among women aged 40–49 years, the mean interval decreased from 17.2 months to 17.1 months (difference -0.16%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.30 to -0.01). Similar small reductions were seen for most age groups. The largest change in interval length in the post-USPSTF period was declines among women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer (difference -0.68%, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.54) or a 5-year breast cancer risk ≥ 2.5% (difference -0.58%, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.44).

Conclusions

The 2009 USPSTF recommendation did not lengthen the average mammography interval among women routinely participating in mammography screening. Future studies should evaluate whether breast cancer screening intervals lengthen toward biennial intervals following new national 2016 breast cancer screening recommendations, particularly among women less than 50 years of age.

### USPSTF recommendations and overdiagnosis [^114BobXk]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Overdiagnosis is the concept that some cancers detected at screening would never have become clinically apparent during a woman's lifetime in the absence of screening. This could occur if a woman dies of a cause other than breast cancer in the interval between mammographic detection and clinical detection (obligate overdiagnosis) or if a mammographically detected breast cancer fails to progress to clinical presentation. Overdiagnosis cannot be measured directly. Indirect methods of estimating overdiagnosis include use of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate breast cancer mortality, population-based screening studies, or modeling. In each case, estimates of overdiagnosis must consider lead time, breast cancer incidence trends in the absence of screening, and accurate and predictable rates of tumor progression. Failure to do so has led to widely varying estimates of overdiagnosis. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) considers overdiagnosis a major harm of mammography screening. Their 2024 report estimated overdiagnosis using summary evaluations of 3 RCTs that did not provide screening to their control groups at the end of the screening period, along with Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network modeling. However, there are major flaws in their evidence sources and modeling estimates, limiting the USPSTF assessment. The most plausible estimates remain those based on observational studies that suggest overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening is 10% or less and can be attributed primarily to obligate overdiagnosis and nonprogressive ductal carcinoma in situ.

### Lack of impact of the 2009 USPSTF guidelines on rates of mammography screening [^114c8JFA]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In November 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed their mammography screening guidelines from recommending a screen every 1–2 years for women older than 40 years. The revised guideline recommends against regular screening for women aged 40–49 and recommends biennial screening for women aged 50–74.

Research Design

We used autoregressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA) time series modeling to estimate the effect of the USPSTF 2009 guidelines on trends in screening rates. Enrollment and encounter files from the PharMetrics LifeLink+ commercial insurance claims database, years 2006–2014, were linked to determine monthly screening rates. The main outcome measure was mammography screening rates per 1,000 commercially insured women aged 40–49 or aged 50–64.

Results

The study sample included 493,347 women aged 40–49 years with at least 1 month of eligibility and 658,052 women aged 50–64 years with at least 1 month of eligibility. There were 1,305,375 total screening mammograms from 2007 to 2014. Average monthly mammography screening rates from 2007 to 2014 were 40.4 per 1,000 women aged 40–49 and 54.8 per 1,000 women aged 50–64. There was a temporary decline in monthly screening rates of 11.8% and 11.2% for the 40–49 and 50–64 age groups, respectively, in the 2-month period after the guideline change (January and February 2010), but the rates quickly returned to pre-USPSTF trend levels afterward.

Conclusion

Implementation of the USPSTF 2009 guidelines was not associated with a persistent long-term change in mammography screening rates over the next 5 years, despite a temporary decline of 2 months immediately following the guidelines.

### Breast cancer screening: common questions and answers [^113AKxYP]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and accounts for 30% of all new cancers in the United States. The highest incidence of breast cancer is in women 70 to 74 years of age. Numerous risk factors are associated with the development of breast cancer. A risk assessment tool can be used to determine individual risk and help guide screening decisions. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend against teaching average-risk women to perform breast self-examinations. The USPSTF and AAFP recommend biennial screening mammography for average-risk women 50 to 74 years of age. However, there is no strong evidence supporting a net benefit of mammography screening in average-risk women 40 to 49 years of age; therefore, the USPSTF and AAFP recommend individualized decision-making in these women. For average-risk women 75 years and older, the USPSTF and AAFP conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society state that screening may continue depending on the woman's health status and life expectancy. Women at high risk of breast cancer may benefit from mammography starting at 30 years of age or earlier, with supplemental screening such as magnetic resonance imaging. Supplemental ultrasonography in women with dense breasts increases cancer detection but also false-positive results.

### The effect of the controversial US preventive services task force recommendations on the use of screening mammography [^1134oHMC]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The 2009 release of updated US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on screening mammography differed sharply from those of the American Cancer Society, the ACR, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of these recommendations on the utilization of screening mammography in the Medicare population.

Methods

The Medicare Part B Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files from 2005 through 2010 were used to determine the annual utilization rate of screening mammography from 2005 to 2010. A utilization trend line was plotted for those years.

Results

The utilization rate of screening mammography per 1,000 women in the Medicare population was 311.6 in 2005 and increased gradually each year to 322.9 in 2009 (a compound annual growth rate of 0.9%). However, after the USPSTF recommendations were issued in late 2009, this rate decreased abruptly to 309.1 (-4.3%) in 2010.

Conclusions

The abrupt decrease in the utilization of screening mammography in 2010 was in sharp contrast to the previous slow annual increases in its utilization from 2005 to 2009. Because there are no other factors to explain a decrease of this magnitude, it would seem that the USPSTF recommendations and the ensuing publicity resulted in a decrease in the utilization of screening mammography in the Medicare population in the first year after issuance of the new recommendations.

### Mammography rates 3 years after the 2009 US preventive services task force guidelines changes [^115bGRoq]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

In November 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed its mammography recommendations from every 1 to 2 years among women age ≥ 40 years to personalized screening decisions for women age 40 to 49 years and screening every 2 years for women age 50 to 74 years.

Methods

We studied mammography trends among 5.5 million women age 40 to 64 years enrolled in a large national health insurer. We used 2005 to 2009 mammography trends to predict 2012 rates. Our primary measure was the estimated difference between observed and predicted 2012 annual and biennial mammography rates. We stratified results by age group and race/ethnicity.

Results

Among women age 40 to 49 years, 2012 mammography rates declined by 9.9% (95% CI, -10.4% to -9.3%) relative to the predicted 2012 rate. Decreases were lowest among black women (-2.3%; 95% CI, -6.3% to 1.8%) and highest among Asian women (-17.4; 95% CI, -20.0 to -14.8). Annual mammography rates among women age 50 to 64 years declined by 6.1% (95% CI, -6.5% to -5.7%) by 2012. Regarding biennial mammography rates, women age 40 to 49 years experienced a 9.0% relative reduction (95% CI, -9.6% to -8.4%). White, Hispanic, and Asian women age 40 to 49 years demonstrated similar relative reductions of approximately 9% to 11%, whereas black women had no detectable changes (0.1%; 95% CI, -4.0% to 4.3%). Women age 50 to 64 years had a 6.2% relative reduction (95% CI, -6.6% to -5.7%) in biennial mammography that was similar among white, Hispanic, and Asian women. Black women age 50 to 64 years did not have changes in biennial mammography (0.4%; 95% CI, -2.6% to 3.5%).

Conclusion

Three years after publication of the 2009 USPSTF guidelines, mammography rates declined by 6% to 17% among white, Hispanic, and Asian women but not among black women. Small reductions in biennial mammography might be an unintended consequence of the updated guidelines.

### Inclusion of the US preventive services task force recommendation for mammography in state comprehensive cancer control plans in the US [^1133jtej]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The recommendations for the age and frequency that women at average risk for breast cancer should undergo breast cancer mammography screening have been a matter of emotional, political, and scientific debate over the past decades. Multiple national organizations provide recommendations for breast cancer screening age and frequency. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for state comprehensive cancer control (CCC) planning requires compliance with stated objectives for attaining goals. US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on cancer prevention and control are currently used to require coverage of prevention services.

Objectives

To evaluate the consistency of state CCC plan objectives compared with the most current (2016) USPSTF recommendations for the age and frequency that individuals should undergo mammography screening and to make recommendations for improvement of state CCC plans.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used a descriptive, point-in-time evaluation and was conducted from November 1, 2019, to June 30, 2021. In November 2019, the most recent CCC plans from 50 US states and the District of Columbia were downloaded from the CDC website. The recommended ages at which to begin and end mammography examinations and the frequency of mammography examinations were extracted from plan objectives.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The recommendations found in CCC plan objectives regarding the ages at which to begin and end mammography examinations and the frequency of mammography examinations for women with average risk for breast cancer were compared with USPSTF recommendations.

Results

Of the 51 CCC plans, 16 (31%) were consistent with all USPSTF recommendations for age and frequency that women at average risk should undergo mammography. Twenty-six plans (51%) were partially consistent with recommendations, and 9 plans (18%) were not consistent with any of the 3 guideline components.

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with the USPSTF recommendation, state CCC plans are not homogenous regarding the age and frequency that women at average risk for breast cancer should undergo mammography. This variation is partially due to differences in state-specific planning considerations and discretion, variations in recommendations among national organizations, and publication of plans prior to the most current USPSTF recommendation (2016). Specifying the concept that high-risk populations need different age and frequency of screening recommendations than the general population may reduce heterogeneity among plans.

### Factors associated with mammography screening choices by women aged 40–49 at average risk [^1158Mz3M]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend routine mammogram screening for women aged 40–49 years at average risk for breast cancer. We aimed to assess the extent to which women were following guideline recommendations and to examine whether guideline awareness and other individual-level factors were associated with adherence. Materials and Methods: We surveyed a nationally representative panel of 383 U.S. women aged 40–49 years at low risk for hereditary breast cancer in October 2019. Results: Only 29% of women reported not having initiated screening mammography. Most women (80%) were unaware of the USPSTF screening guideline related to age of initiation and frequency of mammography. Being aware of the recommendation to initiate screening at age 50 increased the odds of not initiating screening (odds ratio [OR] = 6.70, p < 0.001), whereas being older than 45 years (OR = 0.22, p < 0.001) and having a primary care doctor decreased the odds of not initiating screening (OR = 0.25, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Mammogram screening in excess of USPSTF recommendations is prevalent among U.S. women aged 40–49 years. Efforts are needed to increase women's awareness of the rationale for guidelines and the opportunities to discuss with providers whether delaying mammograms is appropriate.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111v445a]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Among all US women, breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death. In 2023, an estimated 43 170 women died of breast cancer. Non-Hispanic White women have the highest incidence of breast cancer and non-Hispanic Black women have the highest mortality rate.

Objective

The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different mammography-based breast cancer screening strategies by age to start and stop screening, screening interval, modality, use of supplemental imaging, or personalization of screening for breast cancer on the incidence of and progression to advanced breast cancer, breast cancer morbidity, and breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortality, and collaborative modeling studies to complement the evidence from the review.

Population

Cisgender women and all other persons assigned female at birth aged 40 years or older at average risk of breast cancer.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 74 years has a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older and the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer with breast ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of breast density.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram. (I statement).

### United States preventive services task force screening mammography recommendations: science ignored [^111QYd9c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to examine the scientific evidence considered by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in recommending against screening mammography in women 40–49 years old and against annual screening mammography in women 50 and older. We use evidence made available to the USPSTF to estimate the benefits and "harms" of screening mammography in women 40 years old and older. We use Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network modeling to compare lives saved by different screening scenarios and the summary of evidence prepared for the USPSTF to estimate the frequency of harms of screening mammography by age.

Conclusion

Averaged over the six Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network models of benefit, screening mammography shows greatest benefit — a 39.6% mortality reduction — from annual screening of women 40–84 years old. This screening regimen saves 71% more lives than the USPSTF-recommended regimen of biennial screening of women 50–74 years old, which had a 23.2% mortality reduction. For U.S. women currently 30–39 years old, annual screening mammography from ages 40–84 years would save 99,829 more lives than USPSTF recommendations if all women comply, and 64,889 more lives with the current 65% compliance rate. The potential harms of a screening examination in women 40–49 years old, on average, consist of the risk of a recall for diagnostic workup every 12 years, a negative biopsy every 149 years, a missed breast cancer every 1,000 years, and a fatal radiation-induced breast cancer every 76,000–97,000 years. Evidence made available to the USPSTF strongly supports the mortality benefit of annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years, whereas potential harms of screening with this regimen are minor.

### Evidence to support screening women annually [^111MkTCD]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Radiology, American Cancer Society, and US Preventive Services Task Force agree that mammography screening beginning at age 40 saves more lives than any other strategy. Despite these seemingly concordant summaries of the benefits of screening mammography, there are persistent debates regarding when to start and how often women should participate. Costs of screening, both monetary and personal, comprise the foundation of arguments against screening. This article specifically explores the evidence related to screening intervals and attempts to answer the question: should women be screened annually or biennially?

### Effectiveness of breast cancer screening: systematic review and meta-analysis to update the 2009 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation [^114LAP2V]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended biennial mammography screening for women aged 50 to 74 years and selective screening for those aged 40 to 49 years.

Purpose

To review studies of the effectiveness of breast cancer screening in average-risk women.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Cochrane databases to 4 June 2015.

Study Selection

English-language randomized, controlled trials and observational studies of screening with mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography that reported breast cancer mortality, all-cause mortality, or advanced breast cancer outcomes.

Data Extraction

Investigators extracted and confirmed data and dual rated study quality; discrepancies were resolved through consensus.

Data Synthesis

Fair-quality evidence from a meta-analysis of mammography trials indicated relative risks (RRs) for breast cancer mortality of 0.92 for women aged 39 to 49 years (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.02) (9 trials; 3 deaths prevented per 10,000 women over 10 years); 0.86 for those aged 50 to 59 years (CI, 0.68 to 0.97) (7 trials; 8 deaths prevented per 10,000 women over 10 years); 0.67 for those aged 60 to 69 years (CI, 0.54 to 0.83) (5 trials; 21 deaths prevented per 10,000 women over 10 years); and 0.80 for those aged 70 to 74 years (CI, 0.51 to 1.28) (3 trials; 13 deaths prevented per 10,000 women over 10 years). Risk reduction was 25% to 31% for women aged 50 to 69 years in observational studies of mammography screening. All-cause mortality was not reduced with screening. Advanced breast cancer was reduced for women aged 50 years or older (RR, 0.62 [CI, 0.46 to 0.83]) (3 trials) but not those aged 39 to 49 years (RR, 0.98 [CI, 0.74 to 1.37]) (4 trials); less evidence supported this outcome.

Limitations

Most trials used imaging technologies and treatments that are now outdated, and definitions of advanced breast cancer were heterogeneous. Studies of effectiveness based on risk factors, intervals, or other modalities were unavailable or methodologically limited.

Conclusion

Breast cancer mortality is generally reduced with mammography screening, although estimates are not statistically significant at all ages and the magnitudes of effect are small. Advanced cancer is reduced with screening for women aged 50 years or older.

### Socioeconomic and geographic differences in mammography trends following the 2009 USPSTF policy update [^114nKRBA]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Although disparities persist, breast cancer mortality in the US has been decreasing for decades. This decrease has been attributed to earlier detection and improved therapies. The empirical evidence, however, suggests that the association between mammograms, the reference standard for breast cancer screening, includes a tradeoff that balances the benefits of reducing advanced-stage cancers with the harms of identifying potentially nonfatal tumors. Confronted by this cost-benefit assessment, clinicians and patients have relied on the recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The USPSTF is an independent panel of experts who synthesize evidence to provide guidance on who should and should not complete specific health care services. Policymakers also rely on the USPSTF guidance, as federal law requires insurance providers to fully cover preventive services recommended by the USPSTF. Prior to 2009, the USPSTF recommended that all females older than 40 years complete a mammogram every 2 years. More than 70% of American females adhered to this recommendation.

In December 2009, the USPSTF updated their mammogram policy to recommend that, beginning in 2010, females between ages 50 and 74 years complete a biennial mammogram. This updated guidance further recommended that screening in females aged 40 to 49 years be considered on a case-by-case basis. For females older than 75 years, the 2009 update stated that the "evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography". This policy update was met with confusion by patientsand controversy from clinicians, who continued recommending biennial mammograms given the conflicting guidance from the USPSTF and other public health advocacy groups. After 15 years, the USPSTF has reversed their 2009 mammography recommendation, issuing guidance extending the biennial mammography recommendation to females aged 40 to 49 years.

### Changes to the US preventive services task force screening guidelines and incidence of breast cancer [^111HiRnQ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) made controversial changes to their breast cancer screening guidelines for women at average risk of developing breast cancer. Before this change, women older than 40 years were recommended to undergo screening mammography every 1 to 2 years. The 2009 changes recommended an individualized decision to undergo biennial screening for women aged 40 to 49 years, routine biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years, and no screening recommendation (insufficient evidence) for women older than 75 years. These changes were recommended to minimize psychological distress, false-positive imaging results and biopsy recommendations, and overdiagnosis.

Since 2009, numerous publications, have reported reductions in the use of breast cancer screening in the US. Decreases in screening use raise concern about potential increases in late-stage disease. Some studies, have shown that women diagnosed with breast cancer on biennial, as opposed to annual, mammographic screening have more poor prognostic factors, later-stage cancers, larger tumor sizes, and more interval cancers. However, few studies to date have reported changes in stage distribution or the incidence of regional or advanced cancers after the 2009 screening guidelines. If delays in diagnoses due to less intensive screening result in larger tumor sizes, this could also lead to more extensive surgical management, particularly among women with larger tumors, which if diagnosed sooner could have been eligible for breast-conserving therapy as opposed to a total mastectomy. We sought to investigate trends in breast cancer stage at diagnosis and surgical treatment before and after the 2009 USPSTF guideline changes.

Key Points

Question

Are the objectives of US state comprehensive cancer control (CCC) plans consistent with the current US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for mammography for women at average risk for breast cancer?

Findings

This cross-sectional study found that the objectives of CCC plans from 50 US states and the District of Columbia do not universally suggest that USPSTF-recommended screening should start at the age of 50 years for women at average risk for breast cancer. Many state CCC plan objectives do not include an age for ending screening, and a few do not include frequency of screening.

Meaning

This study suggests that specifying that women at high risk require different screening age recommendations may reduce the heterogeneity in mammography guidance that is present in state CCC plans.

Conclusions

Despite great public interest in detectingbreast cancer early, when it may be more effectively treated, state CCC plans are not uniformly providing complete USPSTF recommendations for mammography examinations for women at average risk. State plans may be improved by (1) emphasizing a single, consistent public health message for the general population (women at average risk, 50–74 years of age, and biennial screening) and (2) explicitly distinguishing women at average risk from various high-risk populations of women who may be screened at younger ages after discussion with their physician. The former will require national organization consensus building. The latter will enable more appropriate, evidence-based use of mammography and other breast cancer prevention tools.

### Disparities and gaps in breast cancer screening for women aged 40 to 49 years [^111dt2iU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently released recommendations for breast cancer screening, advising biennial mammography screening for all women aged 40 to 74 years. This marks a substantial shift from the previous recommendation for women in their 40s, transitioning from an individual decision to begin screening. This adjustment aims to advance early breast cancer detection and address inequity in breast cancer mortality, particularly among Black women. This study aimed to examine disparities and gaps in breast cancer screening among women aged 40 to 49 years.

### Inclusion of the US preventive services task force recommendation for mammography in state comprehensive cancer control plans in the US [^113GbPNj]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

All of the organizations with recommendations agree on the benefits of breast cancer screening for women at average risk. However, the ages at which women should start and end mammography examinations and the frequency of mammography examinations have been a matter of political, emotional, and scientific debate for 3 decades. In particular, the recommended age at which to start screening has changed over the years based on accumulated scientific evidence. Apart from the USPSTF, differences in recommendations arise from the different studies used for evidence to support the recommendations and the organizational criteria for weighing evidence, membership advocacy, and methods of harm as well as the benefit to harm ratio threshold calculations. Some health system concerns are overdiagnosis, false-positive results, and radiation harm caused by the increased number of mammography examinations for women who receive a diagnosis at a younger age. The calculation of benefits and harms varies based on age group and evidence for individual preferences and values, leading to more emphasis on shared decision-making between patients and clinicians, especially for those aged 40 to 49 years. The CDC expects state CCC plans to stay up to date with current recommendations, although, in practice, the periodicity of plan updates may preclude inclusion of the most current recommendations.

The most current USPSTF recommendation statement (grade B) issued in 2016 states that women aged 50 to 74 years with average risk (no signs, symptoms, or prior diagnosis of breast cancer; no history of a high-risk breast lesion; no history of chest irradiation at a young age; and no predisposing genetic or family history profile) for developing breast cancer should undergo biennial mammography. Prior to 50 years of age, the decision to start mammography is an individual one. The USPSTF recommendation statements prior to 2009 recommended beginning biennial mammography at 40 years of age. The objective of this study is to evaluate the inclusion of the B-rated, USPSTF-recommended frequency of mammography examinations and the ages at which women at average risk should start and end mammography examinations in state CCC plans.

### Inclusion of the US preventive services task force recommendation for mammography in state comprehensive cancer control plans in the US [^113EDy6G]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, comprehensive cancer control (CCC) plans are unique documents that include overall goals, measurable objectives, and evidence-based strategies to address the most common and most intervenable types of cancer in in each US state. These state CCC plans are often developed with multisector stakeholders for 4- to 6-year periods and should be updated on a regular basis. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding requires the inclusion of state cancer screening prevalence rates and specific objectives and strategies for cancer screening in CCC plans, in addition to other statistics that are aimed at improving cancer outcomes and motivating effort.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second-highest cause of cancer death among women in the US. Breast cancer can be detected by mammography at early stages, when fatality is lowest. A program of routine, high-quality screening has been shown to reduce mortality by 25% to 31% for women aged 50 to 69 years, and thus it is an effective intervention for this age-targeted group. Several organizations have evaluated the evidence and have sought consensus in guidelines for the use of mammography by women at average risk for breast cancer; these organizations include the American Cancer Society (2021; annual screening at 45–55 years of age and biennial screening at 55 years or older), the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2016; biennial screening at 50–75 years of age), and at least 2 medical associations, the American College of Physicians (2019; biennial screening starting at 50 years until 10 years of life expectancy)and the American Academy of Family Physicians (2016; biennial screening at 50–75 years of age). The US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 stipulates required coverage of prevention services that are graded by the USPSTF as an "A" or "B" recommendation. Other federal legislation further ensures that there is no copay associated with mammography for screening among women aged 40 to 49 years.

Discussion

This analysis shows that incorporation of the current USPSTF recommendation into state CCC plans is incomplete regarding the the ages at which women should start and end mammography examinations and the frequency of mammography examinations. For a recommendation tied to service coverage, this is a serious gap in public health policy. It may also indicate a lack of consensus among agencies, such as state health departments and their partners in cancer prevention and control. There are several potential reasons for the lack of consensus.

First, CCC plans are written by and for the state, with the primary audience being state policy makers, individual residents, and organizations operating in the state. Comprehensive cancer control plans are expected to reflect the state's unique burden of cancer. We evaluated the expectation that state plans follow the CDC's advice to include a complete breast cancer screening objective using the current USPSTF recommendation, which is also tied to insurance coverage without cost sharing. Raising awareness among states of the importance of evidence-based guidelines may be needed.

Second, the frequency of plan updates was periodic but still not often enough to always be relatively up to date on the most recently issued recommendations. Twenty percent (n = 10) of CCC plans were at least 5 years or more out of date at the time of abstraction relative to the 2016 USPSTF recommendation. State attention to CCC plan updates is imperative to maintain currency with emerging recommendations, although plan updates may not be enough. One solution is that plans point to the USPSTF recommendation with a hyperlink and state that, at any point in time, the current USPSTF recommendation may be updated.

Third, controversies about breast cancer screening recommendations arising from debates dating back to the early 1980s have not abated, despite the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's use of the USPSTF recommendations. The different rules for Medicareand Medicaidmay also contribute to our inability to settle on a consensus recommendation across payers. Several cancer organizations also promote different recommendations. This lack of 1 message nationally may be replayed at the state level with advocates, program managers, policy makers, and scientists being at odds regarding use of 1 national, albeit evidence-based, recommendation put forth by the USPSTF. We would argue for the use of the USPSTF recommendation because it is tied to payment and thus improves screening access.

Results

The Table aggregates CCC plans based on the recommended ages at which women should start and end mammography examinations and the frequency of mammography examinations. Of 51 plans, 16 (31%) referenced the complete recommendation of conducting biennial mammography for women 50 to 74 years of age, meeting the recommendations for the ages at which women should start and end mammography examinations and the frequency of screening examinations. Just over half of all plans (26 of 51 [51%]) were partially consistent with recommendations, while 18% of the plans (9 of 51) were not consistent with any part of the USPSTF recommendation.

Table.
Frequency of State Comprehensive Cancer Control Plans Meeting US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation for Breast Cancer Screening (Aged 50–74 Years, Biennially), 50 US States and the District of Columbia

Among the plans that were partially consistent with USPSTF recommendations, 73% (19 of 26) recommended starting mammography at 40 years of age, and 31% (8 of 26) recommended starting mammography at 50 years of age. Most plans (85% [22 of 26]), did not specify the age at which women should stop getting mammography examinations. Fifteen percent of plans (4 of 26) did not specify the frequency of mammography examinations, and 15% (4 of 26) used another age at which women should start getting mammography examinations (3 plans specified 40 and 50 years, and 1 plan specified 40, 50, and 52 years). Among those plans that were only partially consistent with the USPSTF recommendation, the biennial frequency of mammography examinations was included in the objectives of 22 plans (85%).

Fifty-nine percent of plans (30 of 51) used the recommended starting age of 50 years, 37% of plans (19 of 51) used a starting age of 40 years (as aligned with the 2009 USPSTF recommendation), 8% of plans (4 of 51) included starting mammography examinations at both 40 and 50 years of age, and 1 plan (2%) included an additional starting age. In all, 20% of plans (10 of 51) did not specify an age at which women should begin undergoing mammography.

### Inclusion of the US preventive services task force recommendation for mammography in state comprehensive cancer control plans in the US [^1177pJ9e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Fourth, the lack of completeness in mammography recommendations in state plans means that neither the general population nor any high-risk subpopulation is benefitting from the current knowledge base for age and frequency of appropriate screening. The current USPSTF recommendation defines "high-risk" status as women with a family history of breast cancer or BRCA1/2 (OMIMand) gene variants or chest radiation at younger than 30 years of age. Thus far, however, there is no 1 toolto determine high-risk status that may have a different benefit to harm ratio and that may lead to a more frequent number of examinations and narrower age range. Given the presumption that early age at screening is of a greater benefit than later age at screening for women at high risk, the decision to screen thus becomes an informed clinical decision (after discussion) for women 40 to 49 years of age who possess certain characteristics, such as BRCA1/2 gene variants, family history of breast cancer, or chest radiation at younger than 30 years of age. Specifying the concept that a high-risk population needs a different age and frequency of screening recommendations may reduce heterogeneity in plans. A substantial proportion of breast cancer mortality is due to the quality and timing of treatment and obesity, in addition to screening. Maximal reduction in breast cancer mortality can be achieved by focusing on optimized treatment followed by high-quality, timely mammography and obesity prevention.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. This study was conducted at 1 point in time, although the timeline for writing state CCC plans occurred with state-determined and varying periodicity. Under the evaluation design, we did not contact CCC plan authors to understand the decision-making process regarding the objectives for breast cancer screening, and we did not account for CDC CCC plan guidance evolving over time. Every state in the US produced a plan in a unique context. Because coverage of prevention services without cost sharing is based on the USPSTF recommendation with grades A or B, we evaluated CCC plans against the USPSTF recommendation for breast cancer screening for average-risk populations. We recognize that implementation of population-based screening should be state and health care system specific.

Methods

This cross-sectional study used a descriptive, point-in-time evaluation and was conducted from November 1, 2019, to June 30, 2021. The CCC plans from 50 US states and the District of Columbia were downloaded from the CDC websitein November 2019. The recommended frequency of mammography examinations and the recommended ages at which to begin and end mammography examinations in relevant CCC plan objectives were extracted. The recommended ages at which to start and end mammography examinations that are contained in the CCC plans were compared with the most current USPSTF (2016) recommendation. The number of states that recommended each screening age category was quantified in Excel (Microsoft Corp); the District of Columbia also had recommendations. The numbers and percentages of all of the US states and the District of Columbia are presented. Institutional review board review was not sought because this was not human participants research, as the observations were conducted among state CCC plans. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Statistical Analysis

The numbers and percentages of the plans were derived using Excel, version 2018 (Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise). No statistical tests were performed.

Recommendations of other organizations for breast cancer screening — The American Cancer Society "recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years" and "suggests that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually", that those "55 years or older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually", may "begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years", and should continue "as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer". The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists "recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 years", and if not initiated in their 40s, "by no later than age 50 years", with screening "every 1 or 2 years" and continued "until at least age 75 years", with decisions "Beyond age 75 years" based on shared decision-making. The American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging "recommend annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years for women at average risk", advise continuing "past age 74 years, without an upper age limit, unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy", and the American College of Radiology "also recommends breast cancer risk assessment by age 25 years for all individuals". The American Academy of Family Physicians "supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for breast cancer".

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114RsHpK]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF breast cancer screening rationale — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 74 years has a moderate net benefit, supported by adequate evidence that biennial screening reduces breast cancer mortality and that harms in women aged 40 to 74 years are small. Evidence is inadequate on the benefits of screening mammography in women 75 years or older and on supplemental screening with breast ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after a negative screening mammogram, regardless of breast density, and inadequate on the harms of such supplemental screening. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older and of supplemental screening with ultrasonography or MRI in women with a negative screening mammogram result, regardless of breast density.

USPSTF breast cancer screening — implementation details — Screen women aged 40 to 74 years with a mammogram every 2 years. Both digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (or "3D mammography") are effective mammographic screening modalities. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for breast cancer in women 75 years or older, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against supplemental screening breast ultrasonography or MRI in women who have dense breasts. Clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for breast cancer in women 75 years or older and whether to use supplemental screening in women who have dense breasts and an otherwise normal mammogram.

Age to start screening — Collaborative modeling estimated that compared with biennial screening from ages 50 to 74 years, biennial screening starting at age 40 years until 74 years would lead to 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 6.7 vs 8.2, respectively, across 6 models) per 1000 women screened over a lifetime for all women. Models also estimated that for Black women, biennial screening starting at age 40 years would result in 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 9.2 deaths averted for screening from ages 50 to 74 vs 10.7 deaths averted, across 4 models) per 1000 women screened. Epidemiologic data show that in women aged 40 to 49 years the incidence rate of invasive breast cancer increased at an average of 2.0% annually between 2015 and 2019, and these factors led the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to conclude that screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years has a moderate benefit by reducing the number of breast cancer deaths.

USPSTF breast cancer screening — screening interval and starting age effects are quantified as follows: Biennial screening led to a 5% absolute decrease in 10-year cumulative false-positive biopsy rate compared with annual screening. Collaborative modeling estimates that a strategy of screening annually from ages 40 to 74 years would result in about 50% more false-positive results and 50% more overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer compared with biennial screening. Modeling also estimated that lowering the age to start screening to 40 years from 50 years would result in about a 60% increase in false-positive results and 2 additional overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer (range, 0 to 4) per 1000 women over a lifetime of screening. In contrast, screening biennially from ages 40 to 74 years would lead to 14 overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer per 1000 persons screened over the lifetime of screening, with a very wide range of estimates (4 to 37 cases) across models.

Inclusion required studies to report detection and stage distribution over more than 1 round of screening, and studies reporting only performance characteristics or detection rates were not eligible.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117ENUM6]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Response to public comment — The USPSTF notes that no trials of breast cancer screening enrolled women 75 years or older and an emulated trial showed no benefit to screening women aged 75 to 79 or 80 to 84. The USPSTF found no evidence on the benefits or harms of individualized breast cancer screening based on risk factors. Regarding screening interval, it did not identify any randomized trials directly comparing annual vs biennial screening, and two trials conducted in the 1980s to 1990s reported no difference in breast cancer mortality or features when comparing annual vs triennial screening; modeling found that biennial screening results in greater life-years gained and mortality reduction per mammogram and has a more favorable balance of benefits to harms compared with annual screening. For dense breasts, the USPSTF clarified that the I statement is not a recommendation for or against supplemental screening in women with dense breasts and that it fundamentally means there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms, or to recommend for or against supplemental screening. The USPSTF clarified that this recommendation applies to women with a family history of breast cancer but not those who have a genetic marker or syndrome or chest radiation exposure at a young age associated with a high risk of breast cancer, and stated that current evidence shows that screening for breast cancer starting at age 40 years will be of significant benefit to Black women.

### Breast cancer screening: women's attitudes and beliefs in light of updated United States preventive services task force and American cancer society guidelines [^1143RQBC]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In recently updated breast cancer screening guidelines, the American Cancer Society (ACS) and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended increasing mammography screening intervals for various age groups. In addition, ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination (CBE) for routine screening among average-risk women. Our study explores women's attitudes regarding screening mammography and CBE and evaluates the impact of the updated USPSTF and ACS guidelines on these attitudes.

Materials and Methods

Six hundred fourteen patients presenting to Mayo Clinic, Arizona and Minnesota, in July 2016 completed a self-administered survey, which included a summary of the updated guidelines.

Results

A majority of the 555 women who fit the inclusion criteria reported that CBE and mammogram are useful in detecting breast cancer and should be performed annually, and 51% of participants were unaware of the updated guidelines. Before reviewing the guidelines, 77% believed yearly CBE and 76% believed yearly mammogram was needed for routine screening. After reviewing the guidelines, the percentage of women who planned to continue with yearly CBE and mammogram decreased significantly to 61% and 64%, respectively (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). Nearly half the participants (48%) believed the most influential reason for the guideline change was to decrease healthcare spending.

Conclusion

Breast cancer screening is well received among patients, and a majority of surveyed women were unaware of recent guideline changes. After reviewing the guidelines, there was a significant downward shift in intended screening frequency, although the majority still planned to undergo annual screening. Informing women about updated evidence-based guidelines may influence their knowledge, preferences, and opinions.

### Breast cancer screening with mammography [^115cRB7Z]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a great deal of controversy regarding the change in breast cancer screening recommendations released by the US Preventive Services Task Force in November 2009. Despite limited new data, the Task Force changed their previous recommendations delaying initial screening of asymptomatic women from age 40 to age 50 and recommending biennial rather than annual breast cancer screening. It is important to fully understand the nuances of the analysis and modeling upon which the revisions were based in order to accurately inform patients of the risks and benefits of breast cancer screening. Several new studies as well as additional guidelines have also been released over the past year which further inform the debate, and a number of commentaries have helped to place the risks and benefit in clinical and societal context.

### Potential impact of USPSTF recommendations on early diagnosis of breast cancer [^111m2pr2]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Current US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend against routine screening mammography in women aged 40–49 years. However, diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer relies on mammographic screening for detection. We hypothesized that screening at younger age may be important for detecting earlier and more treatable cancers for women in different demographic groups.

Methods

All women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or T1N0 breast cancer between 2004 and 2008 in the California Cancer Registry were evaluated. Patients were divided into: (1) women aged 40–49 years, who would be excluded from USPSTF recommendations for screening, and (2) women aged 50–74 years, who are recommended for screening. Patients in the two age groups were compared by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and hormone receptor (HR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and triple-negative (TN) status.

Results

Of 46,691 patients identified, 22.6% were aged 40–49 years, and 77.4% were aged 50–74 years. Younger women with DCIS had statistically higher odds of being HR positive and having higher SES, and Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander (PI) race/ethnicity, while younger women diagnosed with T1N0 breast cancer had higher odds of being HR positive, HER-2 positive, and triple negative and of having higher SES and non-white race/ethnicity.

Conclusions

Young Hispanic, Asian/PI, and non-Hispanic (NH) Black women in California have greater odds of being diagnosed with early breast cancer than their older counterparts. Excluding 40–49-year-old women from screening could impact early diagnosis of HR-positive, HER-2-positive, and TN tumors. Implementation of USPSTF recommendations could disproportionately impact non-white women and potentially lead to more advanced presentation at diagnosis.

### Changes in U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations: effect on mammography screening in olmsted county, MN 2004–2013 [^113Fmw6Q]. Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We assessed changes in adherence to screening mammography recommendations with the introduction of the new U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations in 2009.

Methods

Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project data linkage system, we examined mammography screening from 2004 to 2013 in 31,377 women 40years of age and older residing in Olmsted County, MN before and after the 2009 change in recommendations. Chi-square was used to compare screening rates before and after changes in recommendations overall, by age group, and by baseline adherence.

Results

Among women 40 years and older, declines in screening were observed: 69% of the population was adherent in 2004–2005, 61% in 2006–2009 and 53% in 2010–2013. Absolute decreases in screening were observed from pre- to post-change for those ages 40–49 (4%), 50–74 (9%), and those 75+ (19%, all p < 0.0001). Relative declines in screening rates were observed among women aged 70–74 years who were non-adherent at baseline and among women who were adherent at baseline, overall, and in each age group (all p < .001).

Conclusions

Declines in screening, both absolute and relative, were most pronounced among women who were adherent at baseline. Research is needed to assess factors that influence screening in the context of evolving recommendations.

### Mammography use among women ages 40–49 after the 2009 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation [^113roXr3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force changed its recommendation regarding screening mammography in average-risk women aged 40–49 years.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of the 2009 recommendation on reported mammogram use in a population-based survey.

Design

Secondary data analysis of data collected in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys.

Participants

Women ages 40–74 years in the 50 states and Washington, DC who were not pregnant at time of survey and reported data on mammogram use during the 2006, 2008, or 2010 survey.

Main Measures

Mammogram use was compared between women ages 40–49 and women ages 50–74 before and after the recommendation. We performed a difference-in-difference estimation adjusted for access to care, education, race, and health status, and stratified analyses by whether women reported having a routine checkup in the prior year.

Key Results

Reported prevalence of mammogram use in the past year among women ages 40–49 and 50–74 was 53.2% and 65.2%, respectively in 2008, and 51.7% and 62.4% in 2010. In 2010, mammography use did not significantly decline from 2006–2008 in women ages 40–49 relative to women ages 50–74.

Conclusion

There was no reduction in mammography use among younger women in 2010 compared to older women and previous years. Patients and providers may have been hesitant to comply with the 2009 recommendation.

### Changes to the US preventive services task force screening guidelines and incidence of breast cancer [^115mWDGW]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, the SEER registries provide a large, diverse sample population that broadly represents the country, but they do not capture the entire US population. Second, as an observational, retrospective study, this study could not directly assess the effect of screening use on disease stage at diagnosis or surgical treatment patterns. Other temporal patterns could contribute to the observed patterns and obscure the impact of screening changes. For example, decreases in cancer detection via reduced screening mammography use may have been offset by enhanced cancer detection using digital breast tomosynthesis technology in mammography examinations. Digital breast tomosynthesis has disseminated widely since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011and has elevated cancer detection compared with conventional digital mammography. In addition, increased uptake of supplemental screening modalities (eg, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging) in response to mandated dense breast disclosures, may have also ameliorated the impact of reduced screening mammography use. Similarly, improvements in available surgical treatments (eg, cosmesis after oncoplastic reductions for large amounts of breast tissue removed), increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and other factors have likely influenced trends in surgical management. Third, we evaluated patterns in stage at diagnosis as characterized by SEER Summary Stage but did not investigate American Joint Committee on Cancer stage at diagnosis or tumor size and nodal status subcomponents of staging criteria. Fourth, mode of detection is unavailable in this dataset, so we were unable to evaluate screen-detected vs symptom-detected cases. Fifth, our analysis covers a 10-year follow-up period from the 2009 USPSTF guidelines; given the slow progression of some in situ disease, it is possible that increases in invasive breast cancer incidence may occur after 10 years of follow-up.

In April 2024, the USPSTF released updated breast cancer screening guidelines that expanded routine biennial screening to include women aged 40 to 49 years rather than starting at 50 years of age in response to the increase in invasive breast cancer incidence in this age group. Future studies will be required to evaluate the effect of these new recommendations on breast cancer screening use and incidence patterns.

### Changes to the US preventive services task force screening guidelines and incidence of breast cancer [^111Pz7DR]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, the incidence of in situ breast cancer decreased with the decrease in use of screening mammography dating back to the 2009 USPSTF guideline change. However, to date, there does not appear to be evidence that reductions in screening and in situ breast cancer diagnoses have translated to increases in the incidence of more advanced-stage breast cancer. Since 2012, there has been a shift away from total mastectomies to partial mastectomies, likely reflecting surgical de-escalation literature and the increase in oncoplastic reconstruction options. Although the 2009 guideline changes did not appear to cause an inflection in the incidence of localized, regional, or distant breast cancer, further research is needed to understand the long-standing increase in localized invasive breast cancers and the decrease in regional invasive breast cancers observed during the past 20 years in the context of decreased breast cancer screenings.

### Socioeconomic and geographic differences in mammography trends following the 2009 USPSTF policy update [^114iCf3o]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The USPSTF updated their mammography recommendation to align with current evidence and maximize potential benefit from early detection while minimizing potential harms in populations with limited expected benefit from screening. However, to maximize benefits of earlier detection and minimize harms from overdiagnosis and higher health care costs, the guidance must change behavior. There is limited evidence that patients actually change their behavior following updated USPSTF guidance, and the evidence specific to the USPSTF mammography guidance has been mixed. One problem within the existing literature stemmed from the analysis of claims-based data or convenience sample cohorts from which findings cannot be generalized to subpopulations outside the system. Additionally, studies on the existing evidence examining mammography trends have focused on short-term changes and have not attempted to account for unobserved factors unrelated to the USPSTF policy update that potentially impacted mammography screening. Moreover, existing population-level research often modeled trends of females who were not affected by the policy update (aged 50–74 years) as a single group, ignoring considerable differences in health care access and breast cancer risk within this broad age range. A more fundamental problem with the existing evidence (ie, evidence that has informed the latest USPSTF mammography policy update) is the limited attention to individual risk heterogeneity. Failing to understand how different subpopulations change their mammography trends in response to new policy guidance could have major implications for cancer disparities.

Despite the reversal of the most recent USPSTF mammography guideline, controversy remains. To inform the ongoing debate and future updates, our study aimed to evaluate whether the 2009 USPSTF policy update impacted biennial mammogram trends. Prior evidence had limited generalizability and typically relied on research designs that may not have accounted for dynamic mammography trends or selection bias, but the more pressing matter was the lack of attention to breast cancer risk heterogeneity. Until we understand how populations at different risks of adverse breast cancer outcomes differentially change their behavior in light of new preventive care guidance, policymakers have limited ability to design effective public health guidance. Our goal is to contribute such evidence and inform efforts to leverage public health guidance as a tool for advancing health equity.

### Personalizing breast cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family history [^1158yLjG]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

Routine mammography screening starting at age 45 or 50 years has been shown to reduce population breast cancer mortality for women at average risk. It remains uncertain whether the current screening guidelines are optimal for individual women considering the variability in breast cancer risk at any given age. The American Cancer Society (ACS) and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that women discuss their individual risk and screening options with their healthcare providers before the age of 45 or 50 years, yet there are limited data to inform such discussions. Risk-based screening has been proposed as a way to inform decisions about the starting age and frequency of screening for women at different levels of risk. Recent discoveries in the field of breast cancer genetics may hold the potential to guide risk-based screening strategies. The risk of developing breast cancer approximately doubles for women with a first-degree family member with breast cancer. Approximately 20% of the familial risk is attributable to high or moderate penetrance mutations in genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, and CHEK2. The remaining 80% is due to a combination of more common variations in the DNA sequence (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]). Currently, about 313 common SNPs have been identified as being associated with breast cancer risk. Although these individual variants are associated with small to modest increased risk, their combined effects considered as a polygenic risk score (PRS) could be useful in targeting screening strategies based on risk.

Two ongoing trials, My Personal Breast Screening and the Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures of Risk trial, are presently testing age-based vs risk-based screening approaches that include genetic markers and family history information, but results are not expected until 2024–2025. A recent study in the United Kingdom modeled the use of PRS to determine the cost-effectiveness of screening women triennially above a certain risk threshold. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies that have compared the impact of screening strategies tailored to risk based on family history of breast cancer and polygenic risk combined. To fill this clinical gap, 2 established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network models that were used to inform the current USPSTF breast cancer screening guidelines were used to estimate the lifetime effects of screening based on family history status and polygenic risk. The results are intended to support conversations between women and their healthcare providers about the benefits and harms of starting screening before the age of 50 years. The findings could also provide data to inform policy discussions about risk-tailored screening guidelines.

### Mammography screening: a new estimate of number needed to screen to prevent one breast cancer death [^116JMBRN]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to estimate the number of women needed to screen (NNS) to prevent one breast cancer death and the number needed to screen per life-year gained (NNS/LYG) with annual or biennial screening mammography and to compare NNS to the number needed to invite (NNI) to a screening trial to prevent one breast cancer death.

Materials and Methods

Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) modeling results commissioned by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for their 2009 update of breast cancer screening recommendations were used to estimate NNS and NNS/LYG with annual or biennial screening mammography. NNS values were compared with NNI as reported by USPSTF, which used the CISNET results to aid their 2009 recommendation of starting age and screening interval.

Results

For women between the ages of 40 and 49 years undergoing annual screening mammography, CISNET modeling results estimate an NNS of 746, 39% of the NNI of 1904 estimated by USPSTF on the basis of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. The NNS based on CISNET results for women between 50 and 59 years is 351 (26% of the NNI of 1339 estimated by USPSTF from RCT data), for women between 60 and 69 years is 233 (62% of the NNI of 377 estimated by USPSTF from RCT data), and for women between 70 and 79 years is 377. Annual screening of women between 40 and 84 years yields an NNS of 84 and an NNS/LYG of 5.3. Biennial screening of women ages 50–74 yields an NNS of 144 and an NNS/LYG of 9.1.

Conclusion

The NNS based on CISNET modeling results is much smaller than the NNI based on RCT data. Eighty-four women need to be screened annually between 40 and 84 years to save one life from breast cancer and 5.3 need to be screened annually to gain 1 life-year from breast cancer.

### Modeling strategies to optimize cancer screening in USPSTF guideline-noncompliant women [^117CDb47]. JAMA Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

In 2018, only half of US women obtained all evidence-based cancer screenings. This proportion may have declined during the COVID-19 pandemic because of social distancing, high-risk factors, and fear.

Objective

To evaluate optimal screening strategies in women who obtain some, but not all, US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)-recommended cancer screenings.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This modeling study was conducted from January 31, 2017, to July 20, 2020, and used 4 validated mathematical models from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network using data from 20 million simulated women born in 1965 in the US.

Interventions

Forty-five screening strategies were modeled that combined breast, cervical, colorectal, and/or lung cancer (LC) screenings; restricted to 1, 2, 3 or 4 screenings per year; or all eligible screenings once every 5 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Modeled life-years gained from restricted cancer screenings as a fraction of those attainable from full compliance with USPSTF recommendations (maximum benefits). Results were stratified by LC screening eligibility (LC-eligible/ineligible). We repeated the analysis with 2018 adherence rates, evaluating the increase in adherence required for restricted screenings to have the same population benefit as USPSTF recommendations.

Results

This modeling study of 20 million simulated US women found that it was possible to reduce screening intensity to 1 carefully chosen test per year in women who were ineligible for LC screening and 2 tests per year in eligible women while maintaining 94% or more of the maximum benefits. Highly ranked strategies screened for various cancers, but less often than recommended by the USPSTF. For example, among LC-ineligible women who obtained just 1 screening per year, the optimal strategy frequently delayed breast and cervical cancer screenings by 1 year and skipped 3 mammograms entirely. Among LC-eligible women, LC screening was essential; strategies omitting it provided 25% or less of the maximum benefits. The top-ranked strategy restricted to 2 screenings per year was annual LC screening and alternating fecal immunochemical test with mammography (skipping mammograms when due for cervical cancer screening, 97% of maximum benefits). If adherence in a population of LC-eligible women obtaining 2 screenings per year were to increase by 1% to 2% (depending on the screening test), this model suggests that it would achieve the same benefit as USPSTF recommendations at 2018 adherence rates.

Conclusions and Relevance

This modeling study of 45 cancer screening strategies suggests that women who are noncompliant with cancer screening guidelines may be able to reduce USPSTF-recommended screening intensity with minimal reduction in overall benefits.

### The politics of prostate cancer screening [^111koSPy]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The controversial recent recommendation by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for early-stage prostate cancer has caused much debate. Whereas USPSTF recommendations against routine screening mammography in younger women resulted in fierce public outcry and eventual alteration in the language of the recommendation, the same public and political response has not been seen with PSA screening for prostate cancer. It is of paramount importance to ensure improved efficiency and transparency of the USPSTF recommendation process, and resolution of concerns with the current USPSTF recommendation against PSA screening for all ages.

### Socioeconomic and geographic differences in mammography trends following the 2009 USPSTF policy update [^115SjyeZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Did female biennial mammography screening rates change after the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2009 policy update?

Findings

This cross-sectional study of 1.6 million females found reduced mammography rates after the USPSTF 2009 update for those no longer recommended to complete a biennial mammogram. These decreases varied by age, race and ethnicity, binge drinking status, and state of residence.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that patient-level variables related to breast cancer risk are associated with differences in how women responded to the 2009 USPSTF mammography guidance.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113P15Rv]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Research needs and gaps in breast cancer screening — Key gaps include determining benefits and harms of screening "in women 75 years or older", optimizing strategies for "women found to have dense breasts on a screening mammogram, which occurs in more than 40% of women screened", and evaluating "the benefits and harms of supplemental screening (eg, ultrasonography, MRI, or contrast-enhanced mammography) compared with usual care (DBT or digital mammography alone) for women with dense breasts", with studies reporting advanced cancer and health outcomes. Additional priorities are to "understand and address the higher breast cancer mortality among Black women", to "identify approaches to reduce the risk of overtreatment of breast cancers that are detected through screening that may not be destined to cause morbidity and mortality", and to study "the natural history of DCIS and to identify promising strategies to distinguish DCIS that is unlikely to progress to invasive breast cancer"; abbreviations are defined as "DBT, digital breast tomosynthesis; DCIS, ductal carcinoma in situ".

### Impact of age-specific recommendation changes on organized breast screening programs [^116qD3E5]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent changes in recommendations for mammography screening for women in their forties could have an impact on organized screening programs, as these require clear definition of target and eligible populations.

Current Status

Internationally, a majority of programs target women fifty and over, and so the recent USPSTF age recommendations for screening are quite consistent with this practice. However, there is a good deal of variability in the availability of population-based screening programs to women in their forties should they choose to participate.

Future Impact

Several programs are reviewing recommendations regarding the eligibility of women in their forties; as guidelines indicate women in this age group should be eligible for screening, even if not targeted, there is discussion as to whether they should be allowed in programs so that they benefit from the same programmatic quality assurance afforded to the target population of women over 50. Clear communication of the evidentiary basis for the eligibility criteria and target populations is required, so that the public is aware that programs are designed to deliver maximal population impact, while minimizing population risk.

### Mammography screening preferences among screening-eligible women in their 40s: a national U.S. survey [^113npP78]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently changed its recommendation for mammography screening from informed decision making to biennial screening for women aged 40 to 49 years. Although many women welcome this change, some may prefer not to be screened at age 40 years.

Objective

To conduct a national probability-based U.S. survey to investigate breast cancer screening preferences among women aged 39 to 49 years.

Design

Pre-post survey with a breast cancer screening decision aid (DA) intervention. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05376241).

Setting

Online national U.S. survey.

Participants

495 women aged 39 to 49 years without a history of breast cancer or a known BRCA1/2 gene mutation.

Intervention

A mammography screening DA providing information about screening benefits and harms and a personalized breast cancer risk estimate.

Measurements

Screening preferences (assessed before and after the DA), 10-year Gail model risk estimate, and whether the information was surprising and different from past messages.

Results

Before viewing the DA, 27.0% of participants preferred to delay screening (vs. having mammography at their current age), compared with 38.5% after the DA. There was no increase in the number never wanting mammography (5.4% before the DA vs. 4.3% after the DA). Participants who preferred to delay screening had lower breast cancer risk than those who preferred not to delay. The information about overdiagnosis was surprising for 37.4% of participants versus 27.2% and 22.9% for information about false-positive results and screening benefits, respectively.

Limitation

Respondent preferences may have been influenced by the then-current USPSTF guideline.

Conclusion

There are women in their 40s who would prefer to have mammography at an older age, especially after being informed of the benefits and harms of screening. Women who wanted to delay screening were at lower breast cancer risk than women who wanted screening at their current age. Many found information about the benefits and harms of mammography surprising.

### Socioeconomic and geographic differences in mammography trends following the 2009 USPSTF policy update [^116qLsj9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In 2009, the USPSTF updated their mammogram policy from recommending biennial screening for all women older than 40 years to biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years. This policy update has since been reversed. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the 2024 mammography update may increase breast cancer screening rates differently across the population of females aged 40 to 49 years. Within each age group exposed to the 2009 policy update, we identified differences in the mammogram trends by age, race and ethnicity, health behaviors, and state of residence. When the USPSTF revisits their mammography recommendations, we encourage considering risk assessments in future guidance.

### Changes to the US preventive services task force screening guidelines and incidence of breast cancer [^1179ZxRp]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

We examined patterns in stage-specific breast cancer incidence and surgical treatments for breast cancer in relation to the timing of the 2009 USPSTF guideline changes. Our results provide evidence of a decrease in in situ breast cancer incidence across all age groups since 2009, consistent with previously reported decreases in the use of breast cancer screening. Patterns in the rates of localized, regional, and distant breast cancer did not change markedly in relation to the timing of the guideline changes. Patterns in the rate of partial vs total mastectomies did not correlate temporally to the timing of the guideline change, and the patterns in surgical treatments after 2012 suggest a trend toward less invasive surgical procedures.

In situ breast cancer is predominantly detected on mammography screening. The decreases we observed in in situ breast cancer incidence are consistent with the decreases in screening use observed after the 2009 USPSTF screening guideline changes. With this decrease in in situ breast cancer diagnoses since 2009, we anticipated that a proportion of undetected in situ breast cancer would progress, potentially contributing to an increasing incidence of localized breast cancers starting after 2009. However, we observed no discrete shifts in localized cancer incidence trends after 2009; rather, there was a steady continued increase in localized breast cancer consistent with the pattern observed before 2009. A possible exception was observed in women aged 75 years or older, among whom localized invasive cancer incidence increased beginning in 2017 after a period of decreasing in situ breast cancer incidence and stable localized invasive cancer incidence. However, this would require a long sojourn time (≥ 9 years) to progression to be attributed to the decrease in in situ breast cancer incidence that began in 2008.

### Changes to the US preventive services task force screening guidelines and incidence of breast cancer [^1169paFW]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How have trends in breast cancer stage at diagnosis and surgical management changed since the controversial changes to the US Preventive Services Task Force mammography screening guidelines in 2009?

Findings

This cohort study of 2 022 250 women with breast cancer demonstrated that in situ breast cancer incidence decreased among women aged 40 years or older since 2009, whereas findings for other breast cancer stages and surgical treatment did not correlate with the 2009 guideline changes.

Meaning

Although rates of in situ breast cancer have decreased since 2009, there did not appear to be evidence that this has translated to more advanced breast cancer incidence or more invasive operations.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112MA68U]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance — epidemiology and disparities: Among all US women, breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death, with an estimated 43 170 women dying of breast cancer in 2023; non-Hispanic White women have the highest incidence (5-year age-adjusted incidence rate, 136.3 cases per 100 000 women) and non-Hispanic Black women have the second highest incidence (5-year age-adjusted incidence rate, 128.3 cases per 100 000 women), incidence among women aged 40 to 49 years increased more noticeably from 2015 to 2019 with a 2.0% average annual increase, and Black women are approximately 40% more likely to die of breast cancer compared with White women.

Table 2 — Biennial screening mammography with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) for cohorts of 1000 women shows modeled lifetime benefits and harms by starting age and population: for all women (across 6 models), starting at 40 to 74 years yields 16 116 mammograms, 8.2 breast cancer deaths averted, 165.2 life-years gained, 1376 false-positive results, and 14 overdiagnosis events, whereas starting at 50 to 74 years yields 11 208 mammograms, 6.7 deaths averted, 120.8 life-years gained, 873 false-positive results, and 12 overdiagnosis events; for Black women (across 4 models), starting at 40 to 74 years yields 15 801 mammograms, 10.7 deaths averted, 228.9 life-years gained, 1253 false-positive results, and 18 overdiagnosis events, whereas starting at 50 to 74 years yields 10 905 mammograms, 9.2 deaths averted, 176.7 life-years gained, 814 false-positive results, and 16 overdiagnosis events.

### Obstetrician-gynecologists' knowledge and opinions about the United States preventive services task force (USPSTF) committee, the women's health amendment, and the affordable care act: national study after the release of the USPSTF 2009 breast cancer screening recommendation statement [^115Nkhrw]. Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Investigate the knowledge and opinions of obstetrician and gynecologists (ob-gyns) regarding the USPSTF committee and statement, and to assess their reactions to healthcare legislation.

Methods

A national cross-sectional survey study of ob-gyns was conducted six months after a controversial USPSTF recommendation statement was released in November 2009. Ob-gyns' opinions about the Women's Health Amendment (WHA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were also assessed.

Results

A total of 54% of ob-gyns knew that the USPSTF recommendations do not represent the position of the U.S. government and 40% knew that the USPSTF is not comprised of federal employees. A majority (60%) thought that the USPSTF was influenced by potential costs more than guidelines should be. When examining ob-gyns opinions about new national health policies, 88% support the mammography coverage provided by the WHA but support for the ACA varied.

Conclusion

This study provides a snapshot of ob-gyns' knowledge and opinions about the USPSTF and breast cancer screening guidelines at a controversial point in time. Our findings are a unique contribution to larger efforts to understand health and political policy as the culture of medicine continues to evolve.

### A synthesis of evidence for cancer-specific screening interventions: a preventive medicine golden jubilee review [^112TiekT]. Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The goal of cancer screening guidelines is to inform health practitioners to practice evidence-based cancer prevention. Cancer screening aims to detect treatable precancerous lesions or early-stage disease to enable actions aimed at decreasing morbidity and mortality. Continuous assessment of the available evidence for or against screening interventions by various organizations often results in conflicting recommendations and create challenges for providers and policymakers. Here we have summarized the current cancer screening recommendations by five leading organizations in North America and Europe: the National Cancer Institute's Physician Data Query (PDQ), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and the UK National Screening Committee for the National Health Service (UK NSC). All organizations assess evidence based on strength, quality, and quantity, and recommendations are similar although with differences with respect to screening start and stop ages. Recommendations are consistent for colorectal cancer screening with fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, cervical cancer screening with Pap-test, HPV-test, or co-testing, and breast cancer screening with mammography. However, guidelines vary with respect to age to start and end screening and testing frequency. Tests that have proven to be inefficient or whose use is capable of causing harm are routinely recommended against. Continuous review of screening guidelines is necessary to evaluate the many promising screening tests currently under investigation.

### Evidence to support screening women in their 40s [^116yGJ2V]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

A large body of evidence demonstrates a 30% to 50% mortality benefit of screening mammography for women aged 40 to 49. Because of more rapid cancer growth rates in younger women, annual screening is more effective than biennial. Studies indicate that selective screening of women aged 40 to 49 would miss the majority of breast cancers. If implemented, recent US Preventive Services Task Force breast cancer screening guidelines, which recommend against routine screening of women in their 40s, could result in thousands of preventable breast cancer deaths per year. Vigilance is needed to safeguard younger women's access to screening mammography.

### Towards a transformative health humanities approach in teaching the sustainable development goals (SDGs) [^1175iNpt]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

The evidence for and against mammography screening has been inconsistently interpreted and applied globally. This discrepancy has fostered a sense of ambiguity, disjointedness and scepticism towards both sets of recommendations and their scientific basis, further complicating the dialogue surrounding breast cancer screening practices. For example, in the UK, women aged 50–69 years are invited for mammography screening every 3 years by the National Health Service. In contrast, women aged 50–74 years in Australia are advised to undergo biennial screening while Uruguay mandates biennial mammograms for women aged 40–59 years. Even within the same country, the United States, conflicting mammography recommendations persist. The American Cancer Society (ACS) suggests annual screening from age 45 years and biennial screening from age 55 years, while the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends biennial screening from age 50–74 years. These divergent guidelines leave physicians and women with the complex task of deciding which advice to follow. Ultimately, the question is whether it is justifiable to recommend a test that results in false positives for approximately half of the participants. Is it acceptable to risk potentially harming hundreds of women to potentially preventing a few breast cancer deaths? Policies adopted by both the ACS and USPSTF suggest that it is acceptable to harm a large number of women in order to prevent the deaths of an equally large number; this decision is based on a value judgement rather than simply scientific fact.

### Effect of individualized preventive care recommendations vs usual care on patient interest and use of recommendations: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^1174qjYK]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Preventable risk factors contributed to an estimated 61% of US deaths in 2019, and health risks increase with age. Prior work suggests that optimal preventive care use could add over 2 million healthy life-years nationwide. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends 25 preventive services for middle-aged adults aged 50 to 64 years, but in 2015 only 8% of adults 35 years or older received all high-priority services. A recent study found that adherence to hypertension control, a highly effective intervention, declined over the past decade.

National prevention guidelines present several challenges. First, they scarcely account for individuals' unique characteristics, such as comorbid conditions, which affect 70% of middle-aged adults. This standardized approach hinders physicians' ability to identify which preventive services provide maximum benefit for a specific patient. Second, few guidelines consider patient preferences, including views about side effects, convenience, lifestyle, and cost. This generic approach may contribute to low attainment of prevention targets. Third, clinical time is limited, forcing physicians to prioritize among recommended guidelines without having tools to do so. For example, a physician may know that both mammograms and colonoscopies are "life-saving", but not understand their relative benefits.

In this pilot study, we evaluated the potential of an individualized decision tool to help patients and physicians better understand the net benefits of all major, USPSTF-recommended preventive services and improve preventive care delivery.

### U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations and cancer screening among female Medicare beneficiaries [^114XmuXg]. Journal of Women's Health (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Medicare covers several cancer screening tests not currently recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force). In September 2002, the Task Force relaxed the upper age limit of 70 years for breast cancer screening recommendations, and in March 2003 an upper age limit of 65 years was introduced for cervical cancer screening recommendations. We assessed whether mammogram and Pap test utilization among women with Medicare coverage is influenced by changes in the Task Force's recommendations for screening.

Methods

We identified female Medicare beneficiaries aged 66–80 years and used bivariate probit regression to examine the receipt of breast (mammogram) and cervical (Pap test) cancer screening reflecting changes in the Task Force recommendations. We analyzed 9,760 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey responses from 2001 to 2007.

Results

More than two-thirds reported receiving a mammogram and more than one-third a Pap test in the previous 2 years. Lack of recommendation was given as a reason for not getting screened among the majority (51% for mammogram and 75% for Pap). After controlling for beneficiary-level socioeconomic characteristics and access to care factors, we did not observe a significant change in breast and cervical cancer screening patterns following the changes in Task Force recommendations.

Conclusions

Although there is evidence that many Medicare beneficiaries adhere to screening guidelines, some women may be receiving non-recommended screening services covered by Medicare.

### Screening history, stage at diagnosis, and mortality in screen-detected breast cancer [^116FvjkX]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Routine screening mammography is the most effective means to promote early detection of breast cancer. Biannual screening is recommended for women aged 40 to 74 years by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as it has been shown to reduce the mortality associated with estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancer and the incidence of late-stage diagnosis.

However, for the 22 million women in the US aged 75 years and older, there is conflicting evidence as to the benefits of biannual screening. While older women face a reduced survival benefit from early detection due to higher mortality risks from other causes, some benefits of screening extend to them: when breast cancers are detected through a routine mammography, these cancers are often diagnosed at an earlier stage, require less intensive treatment, and have better disease-specific survival. Due to these conflicting findings, the USPSTF notes that there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for screening among women aged 75 years and older and cites this as a research need.

One factor that may impact the effectiveness of screening for early detection is screening history, defined by the number and frequency of mammograms received prior to the detection of cancer. Mammography at routine intervals increases the likelihood of identifying any anomalies or changes in breast tissue as soon as they occur. It may also indicate proactive health behaviors, such as regular engagement with health care services, that further promote the early detection of breast cancer and improved survival. Identifying this potential difference in health outcomes based on screening history may facilitate a more accurate evaluation of screening effectiveness. Previous investigations of the impact of screening history on early detection have been limited in that they included both screen-detected and non–screen-detected cancers, which are known to exhibit differences in stage at diagnosis and prognosis.

This study uses the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) and Medicare linked dataset to investigate the association between screening history and the breast cancer outcomes among screen-detected cancers within the older US population. We restricted our sample to women with screen-detected breast cancer so that we could isolate the association between screening history and breast cancer outcomes. We hypothesized that women who had received at least 1 screening mammogram within 5 years prior to screening-based detection of breast cancer have a lower risk of being diagnosed with later-stage cancer and have a better survival outcome compared with women with no prior mammogram within the previous 5 years.

### Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114PF5kp]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades and certainty — definitions and practice suggestions: Grade A states, "The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial", with the suggestion, "Offer or provide this service". Grade B states, "The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial", with the suggestion, "Offer or provide this service". Grade C states, "The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small", with the suggestion, "Offer or provide this service for selected patients depending on individual circumstances". Grade D states, "The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits", with the suggestion, "Discourage the use of this service". An I statement says, "The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined", and advises, "Read the Clinical Considerations section of the USPSTF Recommendation Statement. If the service is offered, patients should understand the uncertainty about the balance of benefits and harms". Levels of certainty regarding net benefit are described as High — "The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies". Moderate — "The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as the number, size, or quality of individual studies; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice; lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low — "The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of the limited number or size of studies; important flaws in study design or methods; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; gaps in the chain of evidence; findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice; lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes". The USPSTF defines certainty as the "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct", and net benefit as "benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population".

### Developing recommendations for evidence-based clinical preventive services for diverse populations: methods of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^116nipsC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) summarizes the principles and considerations that guide development of its recommendations for diverse U.S. populations. It uses these principles through each step in the evidence-based guideline process: developing the research plan, conducting the evidence review, developing the recommendation, and communicating to guideline users. Three recent recommendations provide examples of how the USPSTF has used these principles: the 2015 recommendation on screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes; the 2016 recommendation on screening for breast cancer; and the recommendation on screening for prostate cancer, which is currently in progress. A more comprehensive list of recommendations that includes considerations for specific populations is also provided.

Introduction

Background

Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States. Early detection from screening has contributed to an increase in overall survival rates. However, it is important to address the disparities in breast cancer outcomes among different racial and ethnic groups. African American women face significant challenges in relation to breast cancer. African American women experience the highest breast cancer mortality rate among all racial or ethnic groups in the United States, with a 40% mortality rate. When compared with their white counterparts, the mortality rate for black women diagnosed with breast cancer is 42% higher. Furthermore, among women under the age of 40 years, African American women have a higher incidence of breast cancer compared with white women. Several factors contribute to the higher mortality rates observed among African American women. These factors are multifactorial and may include later-stage diagnosis, socioeconomic disparities, differences in access to healthcare and biological differences in breast cancer subtype response. Addressing these disparities requires a multifaceted approach that includes improving access to healthcare services, promoting early detection through education and screening initiatives, and addressing socioeconomic barriers.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)recommends biennial mammography screening for women aged 50–74 years. The 2016 USPSTF guidelines are recommended for women aged 40–49 years; the USPSTF acknowledges the potential benefits and harms of mammography screening, emphasising the importance of individual decision-making based on personal values, risk factors and preferences. The USPSTF suggests that women in this age group engage in a discussion with their healthcare providers to make an informed decision.

Introduction

Breast cancer (BC) is the second most prevalent cancer in the world and the most frequent among women. In the European Union, 404,920 women were diagnosed with BC and 98,755 women died during 2018. Despite these high rates, the mortality risk of BC has decreased over the last decades due to improvements in treatment, services quality, and to early diagnosis linked to the implementation of population-based screening programmes. However, there is still ongoing research and debate on how to best implement BC screening programmes, including which is the optimal mammography screening interval.

Published recommendations on mammography screening frequencies vary among organisations. The National Health Service Breast Screening Program (NHSBSP) of the United Kingdom, recommends screening every 3 years to women aged 50–70 (47–73 in England). The United States Prevention Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends biennial mammography for women aged 50–74 and making a case by case decision for women in their 40s. The American Cancer Society recommends annual screening between the ages of 45 and 54 (with the option of starting annual screening between 40 and 44), and screening every two years from age 55 or continue annually if the woman is in good health and expected to live ten more years.

Previous studies have suggested that the balance between benefits and harms for different screening intervals might vary depending on the age subgroup. A modelling study found that for every 1000 women aged 50–74, biennial screening avoided seven BC deaths, while annual screening had similar benefits but caused more harms. Observational data from the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries, observed that premenopausal women undergoing biennial screening had more BC lesions with less favourable prognostic characteristics compared to those having annual screening.

In 2015, the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC) was launched to develop the European Guidelines on Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis. This article describes the systematic review that informed the recommendations about mammography screening intervals for women of average breast cancer risk in three separate age subgroups. During the guideline development process, the Guidelines Development Group (GDG) made detailed considerations about the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, values and preferences, equity, acceptability and feasibility; these considerations are described in the published methodology and summary of recommendations.

### Medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116psUfo]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer states: For women aged ≥ 35 y at increased risk for breast cancer, offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors (Grade: B). For women aged ≥ 35 y not at increased risk for breast cancer, do not routinely use risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors (Grade: D). This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women 35 years and older, including women with previous benign breast lesions on biopsy, and does not apply to women who have a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The USPSTF has also made recommendations on screening for breast cancer and on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA gene mutations.

### Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116VbY9k]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) harms and net benefit — genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions: Psychological effects after testing included increased breast cancer worry in most studies and mixed anxiety findings; nine studies evaluated worry or distress, seven reported increased worry and two reported decreased worry, and two studies noted higher anxiety in women not tested vs those tested. Intensive screening is associated with false positives and downstream testing; in a retrospective cohort of women with potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations or first‑degree relatives, mammography led to more additional imaging than MRI. For women at increased risk for harmful BRCA1/2 mutations, there is adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are moderate, whereas for women without such risk the net benefit is small to none; overall harms of these activities are small to moderate.

### The impact of mammography screening guideline changes in a universally insured population [^117WkMuL]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) modified breast cancer screening guidelines in November 2009. The impact has been studied among privately and Medicare insured populations, but not among universally insured women. Materials and Methods: This study compared the proportion of TRICARE beneficiaries aged 40–64 receiving mammograms from fiscal years 2006 to 2015 using an interrupted time series analysis to determine the impact of the 2009 USPSTF guideline changes. Stratified analyses evaluated differences by age (ages 40–49, 50–64), race, care setting, beneficiary type, and military status. Results: The proportion of women receiving mammograms increased from October 2005 through September 2009. A small, but significant decrease of 65–66 fewer women screened per 10,000 occurred in the first quarter of 2010 (October 1 to December 31) following the screening guideline update publication. The proportion screened then remained unchanged through 2015. Comparative analysis revealed no differences in impact between age groups, blacks and whites, or military dependents and active-duty/retirees. Conclusions: This study determined that the USPSTF guideline updates had a small, but immediate and lasting impact that was not different across age groups, beneficiary type, or race. No racial disparities in the proportion screened or in the impact of the guideline change were noted in our universally insured population.

### USPSTF recommendation: screening for breast cancer… [^116KZa6k]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer with breast ultrasonography or MRI in women who have a negative screening mammogram result, regardless of breast density. Population Cisgender women and all other persons assigned female at birth aged 40 years or older at average risk of breast cancer. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 74 years has a moderate net benefit.

The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older and the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer with breast ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, regardless of breast density. Recommendation The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.

The USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of DBT as a primary screening method; the balance of benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, MRI, or DBT in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram; and the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. 49 For the current recommendation, the USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years. The USPSTF again finds that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram and the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older.

Current evidence suggests that both digital mammography and DBT are effective primary screening modalities.

### New recommendations for breast cancer screening-in pursuit of health equity… [^114PxDUQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force last released recommendations on breast cancer screening in 2016, when they recommended that most women be screened every 2 years starting at age 50 years. In their 2024 recommendations, 1–3 the USPSTF now recommends initiating screening mammography for all women at age 40 years and screening every 2 years until age 74 years. Similar to the 2016 recommendations, in their updated recommendations, 1–3 the USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women aged 75 years and older and that evidence is insufficient to assess the role of supplemental screening for women with dense breasts.

Beyond the change in the recommended age to initiate screening, the new recommendations differ from prior recommendations in 2 critical and related ways: a deliberate focus on health equity and greater reliance on evidence from studies other than randomized clinical trials. To inform its current recommendations, 1–3 the USPSTF commissioned a new modeling study assessing the benefits and harms of mammography screening in the average-risk population of US women overall and for Black women specifically. Model inputs included real-world data on treatment, including inferior treatment received by Black women, and higher breast cancer mortality rates among Black women. For example, the USPSTF model identified a breast cancer mortality reduction from mammography of 30% for screening women aged 40 to 74 years, which is substantially higher than reductions from mammography observed in RCTs are modest for both Black women and the general population, particularly for women in their 40s, and the likelihood of false positives and overdiagnosis is high. 1–3 It was this modest ratio of benefits to harms that prompted the USPSTF's previous recommendations for an individualized approach to screening for women in their 40s, based on women's preferences and risk factors.

### AAFP backs updated USPSTF breast cancer screening guidance… [^113vd65N]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

June 13, 2024, Scott Wilson — After a detailed review, the AAFP has endorsed a recently finalized U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that all women ages 40 through 74 be screened for breast cancer every two years. The "B" level guidance, released in draft form last spring, estimated that this broader age range could save 19% more lives than the previous USPSTF recommendation on this topic, which had advised starting biennial mammography at age 50. The task force's updated guidance — issued April 30 with an infographic, a summary for clinicians and a discussion guide for clinicians and patients — repeats the 2016 finding that insufficient evidence exists to "assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older.

" It adds that digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis remain effective primary screening modalities. The Academy's concurrence with the new recommendation follows a detailed review by the AAFP Commission on Health of the Public and Science, in consultation with the AAFP Science Advisory Panel. That process flagged some caveats, including the USPSTF's reliance on indirect evidence from a self-commissioned modeling report, and an absence of new studies on the benefits and harms of lowering the age of initiating screening mammography from 50 to 40 years identified during the evidence review. The Science Advisory Panel nevertheless backed the Academy's endorsement of the new mammography recommendation. "I don't think this should change most family physicians' approach to screening mammography, " AAFP member Kenny Lin, M. D. M. P. H., says of the recommendation.

Lin, associate director of the Lancaster General Hospital Family Medicine Residency in Pennsylvania, recently published a commentary in. Medscape on the topic. In it, he noted that "screening messages are less complicated when guidelines agree, " while highlighting the importance of "individual decision-making based on patient preferences and values. " Elaborating on that first point, he told. "Knowing this, patients in their 40s can compare their personal values to the values that experts assigned to the benefits and harms of mammograms, and follow the guideline if they align or make an informed choice to delay being screened if they do not".
