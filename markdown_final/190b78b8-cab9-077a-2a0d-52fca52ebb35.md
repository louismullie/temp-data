## Question

What is Behcet's disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Behçet's disease is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative definition and classification. Then, I should verify the core clinical manifestations and how they cluster. Next, I will review epidemiology and genetic risk. After that, I need to check the diagnostic criteria and their limitations. Then, I will examine pathophysiology and why it behaves as a variable-vessel vasculitis. Finally, I will consider prognosis, special populations, and synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition anchored to guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't misstate anything. Behçet's syndrome is a chronic, relapsing systemic vasculitis affecting arteries and veins of all sizes, which is why it is classified as a variable-vessel vasculitis; it is multisystem and heterogeneous in presentation, with no single pathognomonic test, so diagnosis remains clinical and criteria-based rather than laboratory-confirmed [^116NThej] [^112TFPGf].

> Wait, let me verify the core clinical manifestations before listing them. The hallmark is recurrent oral aphthae, typically accompanied by genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum and papulopustular lesions, and ocular inflammation including posterior uveitis and retinal vasculitis; musculoskeletal, vascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system involvement are common and variably present, and their severity drives prognosis [^116NThej] [^112TFPGf] [^113NBhfc].

> Hold on, I should verify how these features tend to cluster because phenotype matters for management. Cluster analyses and contemporary reviews describe phenotypes such as mucocutaneous-articular, peripheral vascular with extra-parenchymal neurological disease, and parenchymal neurological with ocular disease; these clusters reflect both biological variation and some artificial heterogeneity, but they help anticipate organ-specific risks and guide therapy selection [^117QoszL] [^114cPrtB].

> I need to check epidemiology and genetic risk to frame pretest probability. Prevalence is highest along the historic Silk Road, with Turkey reporting up to 420 per 100,000, whereas Northern Europe and the US show much lower rates; HLA-B✱51 is the strongest genetic risk factor, yet a substantial fraction of patients lack it, indicating additional susceptibility loci and environmental contributors, and disease tends to be more severe in men and with earlier onset [^116NThej] [^115Yadvx] [^113BixDG].

> Next, I should review diagnostic criteria and their performance, and I need to be careful not to conflate classification with diagnosis. The 1990 International Study Group criteria require recurrent oral ulcers plus two of genital ulcers, eye lesions, skin lesions, or a positive pathergy test, whereas the 2014 International Criteria for Behçet's Disease assign weighted points and use a threshold of 4 or more; importantly, ICBD improves sensitivity but can trade specificity, and in uveitis cohorts a threshold of 5 improves specificity without sacrificing sensitivity, so I should double-check the local context and specialty when choosing a threshold [^113Kcjqf] [^113TX47R] [^113xQVxD].

> But wait, what if a patient has significant organ involvement yet fails criteria? I should confirm that limitation. Real-world cohorts show 15–40% of clinically diagnosed patients may not meet ISG or ICBD at some point, yet they can still harbor sight- or life-threatening disease; thus, expert clinical judgment remains essential, and the criteria should be applied as aids rather than absolute arbiters [^112AR37x].

> I will now examine pathophysiology to ensure I'm not oversimplifying. Behçet's syndrome reflects dysregulated innate and adaptive immunity with a type 1 helper T cell bias and neutrophil hyperactivation; unlike many vasculitides, granulomas are absent, and the vasculitis spans small, medium, and large vessels, both arterial and venous, explaining thrombosis, aneurysms, and ischemic complications; emerging data also implicate autoinflammatory pathways in subsets, aligning with the variable-vessel framework [^116NThej] [^112VwCAU] [^115cnsfb].

> Let me consider prognosis and disease course, and I should confirm modifiers. The disease is relapsing-remitting with unpredictable flares; major morbidity arises from posterior uveitis with risk of blindness, large-vessel vasculitis including pulmonary artery aneurysm, and parenchymal neuro-Behçet's disease; male sex, early onset, and certain ancestries portend worse outcomes, and modern management has improved survival, though organ damage can accrue silently even when mucocutaneous disease appears quiescent [^116NThej] [^112TFPGf] [^1134n7fe].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and pediatric nuances. Pediatric-onset Behçet's is rare and often delayed in diagnosis; fever of unknown origin and oral ulcers are common early features, and severe organ involvement occurs, warranting early immunosuppression; pediatric-specific classification criteria exist but have lower sensitivity, so expert input and longitudinal reassessment are critical, and TNF inhibitors are frequently first-line biologics for major organ disease in children [^113MVjzs] [^117F8Snq] [^112zBVsg].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful, concise definition, and I should double-check that it aligns with guidelines. Behçet's syndrome is a chronic, relapsing, variable-vessel vasculitis characterized by recurrent oral aphthae with potential involvement of genital mucosa, skin, eyes, joints, blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system; diagnosis is clinical and supported by validated criteria such as ISG or ICBD, recognizing that a minority of patients with significant disease may not meet criteria; management is organ-specific and risk-stratified, with immunomodulatory and biologic therapies guided by severity and phenotype, and multidisciplinary care improves outcomes [^116NThej] [^111V8s4P] [^117RqNKq].

---

Behçet's disease is a **chronic, relapsing vasculitis** [^116NThej] that affects blood vessels of all sizes, causing recurrent oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions, and eye inflammation, with potential involvement of the joints, vascular, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems [^112TFPGf]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on the International Study Group (ISG) or International Criteria for Behçet's Disease (ICBD) [^113Kcjqf] [^113TX47R], and there is no definitive laboratory test [^112TFPGf]. Management is **individualized** by organ involvement and severity, using colchicine for mucocutaneous disease [^113GXvUK], corticosteroids and immunosuppressants for major organ involvement [^111sKFfH], and biologics such as TNF inhibitors for refractory cases [^111568qd]. Prognosis varies with organ involvement, and severe disease can cause blindness, stroke, or vascular complications [^111sKFfH].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Behçet's disease presents with a broad spectrum of symptoms, often recurring and remitting over time [^116NThej]. The most common manifestations include:

- **Oral ulcers**: Recurrent, painful aphthous ulcers are the hallmark of the disease, occurring in nearly all patients [^1134n7fe].

- **Genital ulcers**: Typically painful, recurrent ulcers on the scrotum or vulva, often leaving scars [^notfound].

- **Skin lesions**: Erythema nodosum, papulopustular lesions, and acneiform eruptions are common [^114tTQHo].

- **Ocular involvement**: Uveitis, retinal vasculitis, and hypopyon can lead to vision loss if untreated [^111nGdiG].

- **Arthritis**: Non-erosive, inflammatory arthritis, often affecting the knees and ankles [^notfound].

- **Vascular involvement**: Thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, arterial aneurysms, and thrombosis are significant complications [^1144M6Ct].

- **Gastrointestinal involvement**: Ulcerations throughout the gastrointestinal tract, resembling inflammatory bowel disease [^111GPAj9].

- **Neurological involvement**: Neuro-Behçet's disease presents with parenchymal or non-parenchymal manifestations, including meningitis, encephalitis, and cerebral venous thrombosis [^116ErBd9].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

The exact cause of Behçet's disease remains unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors [^116NThej]. Key findings include:

- **Genetic predisposition**: HLA-B51 is the strongest genetic risk factor, particularly in populations along the Silk Road [^113BixDG].

- **Immune dysregulation**: Aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses, including neutrophil hyperactivation and T-cell mediated inflammation, are implicated [^117F8Snq].

- **Environmental triggers**: Infectious agents, such as Streptococcus sanguinis, have been hypothesized to trigger immune responses in genetically susceptible individuals [^115aqgq2].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is **primarily clinical**, as no definitive laboratory test exists [^112TFPGf]. The International Study Group (ISG) criteria require recurrent oral ulcers plus at least two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, eye lesions, skin lesions, or a positive pathergy test [^113Kcjqf]. The International Criteria for Behçet's Disease (ICBD) assigns points to clinical features, with a score of 4 or more supporting the diagnosis [^113TX47R]. However, a significant proportion of patients may not meet these criteria despite clinically significant disease, underscoring the need for clinical judgment [^112AR37x].

---

## Treatment

Management of Behçet's disease is **individualized** based on organ involvement, severity, and patient preferences [^112yBqMW]. General principles include:

- **Mucocutaneous disease**: Colchicine is first-line for recurrent oral and genital ulcers and erythema nodosum [^113GXvUK]. Topical corticosteroids are used for localized lesions [^111QQ82J].

- **Ocular involvement**: High-dose systemic corticosteroids combined with immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine, cyclosporine, interferon-alpha, or TNF inhibitors) are recommended for sight-threatening uveitis [^114Csizb] [^112XbtoU].

- **Vascular involvement**: Immunosuppression with corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide) is essential. Anticoagulation may be considered cautiously, balancing bleeding risks [^116y8fJw] [^117T2Pkp].

- **Gastrointestinal involvement**: Corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and TNF inhibitors are used for severe or refractory disease [^114LaVTm].

- **Neurological involvement**: High-dose corticosteroids followed by immunosuppressive maintenance therapy are recommended [^116y8fJw].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies widely depending on organ involvement and disease severity. Mucocutaneous disease typically has a benign course, whereas ocular, vascular, neurological, and gastrointestinal involvement can lead to significant morbidity and mortality [^111sKFfH]. Early diagnosis and aggressive management of major organ involvement have improved outcomes in recent years [^116NThej].

---

Behçet's disease is a **multisystem vasculitis** with diverse manifestations; diagnosis is clinical and management is tailored to organ involvement, with immunosuppression as the cornerstone for severe disease [^116NThej].

### Core set of domains for outcome measures in Behçet's syndrome [^114KGCHg]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

An unmet need exists for reliable, validated, and widely-accepted outcome measures for randomized clinical trials in Behçet's syndrome. The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) Behçet's Syndrome Working Group, a large, multidisciplinary group of experts in Behçet's syndrome and patients with Behçet's syndrome, had an objective of developing a core set of data-driven outcome measures for use in all clinical trials of Behçet's syndrome.

Methods

The core domain set was developed through a comprehensive, iterative, multistage project that included a systematic review, a focus group meeting and qualitative patient interviews, a survey among experts in Behçet's syndrome, a Delphi exercise involving both patients and physician experts in Behçet's syndrome, and use of the data, insight, and feedback generated by these processes to develop a final core domain set.

Results

All steps were completed and domains were delineated across the organ systems involved in this disease. Since trials in Behçet's syndrome often focus on specific manifestations and not on the disease in its entirety, the final proposed core set includes 5 domains mandatory for study in all trials in Behçet's syndrome (disease activity, new organ involvement, quality of life, adverse events, and death) with additional subdomains mandatory for study of specific organ-systems. The final core set was endorsed at the 2018 OMERACT meeting.

Conclusion

The core set of domains in Behçet's syndrome provides the foundation through which the international research community, including clinical investigators, patients, the biopharmaceutical industry, and government regulatory bodies can harmonize the study of this complex disease, compare findings across studies, and advance development of effective therapies.

### Diagnosis and management of neuro-behçet's disease: international consensus recommendations [^115fsj5t]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Neuro-Behçet's disease (NBD) is one of the more serious manifestations of Behçet's disease (BD), which is a relapsing inflammatory multisystem disease with an interesting epidemiology. Though NBD is relatively uncommon, being potentially treatable, neurologists need to consider it in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory, infective, or demyelinating CNS disorders. Evidence-based information on key issues of NBD diagnosis and management is scarce, and planning for such studies is challenging. We therefore initiated this project to develop expert consensus recommendations that might be helpful to neurologists and other clinicians, created through an extensive literature review and wide consultations with an international advisory panel, followed by a Delphi exercise. We agreed on consensus criteria for the diagnosis of NBD with two levels of certainty in addition to recommendations on when to consider NBD in a neurological patient, and on the use of various paraclinical tests. The management recommendations included treatment of the parenchymal NBD and cerebral venous thrombosis, the use of disease modifying therapies, prognostic factors, outcome measures, and headache in BD. Future studies are needed to validate the proposed criteria and provide evidence-based treatments.

Results

The advisory group agreed on the scope of the project to cover the diagnosis, investigations, and management issues, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Project scope: key issues addressed in the consensus recommendations

A literature search showed that there were no studies with level I or II in any of the items researched within the scope of this consensus. The best available evidence was in the form of studies within level III or IV (Fig. 2). There are a few randomized, controlled trials investigating treatment options in BD and two meta-analyses, but none on NBD. Figure 2 shows the summary of the literature review and evidence used in the project to draw draft recommendations.

Fig. 2
Summary of the systematic literature review

The disease terminology was voted and agreed upon as 'neuro-Behçet's disease', as two-thirds of the advisory group members preferred to use this term to describe the neurological manifestations of BD (66% voted for neuro-Behçet's disease, 22% for neuro-Behçet syndrome, and 12% for either/other).

A diagnostic criteria for NBD and 16 recommendations covering important diagnostic and management aspects in NBD were voted through and approved as consensus recommendations. The supporting voting score summary is given in Table 2.

### Criteria for diagnosis of Behçet's disease. international study group for Behçet's disease [^113Kcjqf]. Lancet (1990). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "International Study Group (ISG) diagnostic criteria for Behçet's syndrome" for Behçet's syndrome.

The International Study Group (ISG) diagnostic criteria for Behçet's syndrome is a clinical calculator used to diagnose Behçet's syndrome, a rare and chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder. This calculator is applicable to patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of Behçet's syndrome, such as recurrent oral and genital ulcers, eye inflammation, and skin lesions.

The ISG criteria for Behçet's syndrome is clinically useful in identifying patients with this disorder, guiding treatment decisions, and facilitating research. The criteria include recurrent oral ulceration, plus at least two of the following: recurrent genital ulceration, eye lesions, skin lesions, or a positive pathergy test.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ISG diagnostic criteria for Behçet's syndrome. However, it should be noted that these criteria are not intended to replace clinical judgment and should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical evaluation. Other causes of the symptoms should be ruled out before a diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome is made.

This diagnostic tool assesses the likelihood of Behçet's syndrome by examining five key clinical features, each contributing to an overall score.

- Recurrent oral ulcers, whether major, minor aphthous, or herpetiform, occurring three or more times per year, are a significant indicator, contributing 5 points if present.
- Recurrent genital ulcers, characterized by aphthous or scarring lesions, add 1 point to the total score.
- Eye disorders, including anterior or posterior uveitis, cells in the vitreous identified through slit lamp exam, or retinal vasculitis, contribute another 1 point.
- Skin manifestations such as erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis, papulopustular lesions, or specific acneiform nodules earn 1 point. These are relevant for post-adolescent patients not on steroids.
- A positive pathergy test, evaluated at 24–28 hours, is also worth 1 point.

Each symptom is checked and given its corresponding score, and the total is then calculated by summing these individual scores.

To interpret the results of this calculation:

- A cumulative score of 7 or higher indicates "Diagnostic criteria are met", supporting the diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome.
- A score below 7 means "Diagnostic criteria not met", suggesting that further criteria exploration is necessary to consider Behçet's syndrome diagnosis.

| **Clinical feature** | **Points if present** |
|-|-|
| Recurrent oral ulcers | 5 |
| Recurrent genital ulcers | 1 |
| Eye lesions | 1 |
| Skin lesions | 1 |
| Positive pathergy test | 1 |

This score should be used in conjunction with comprehensive clinical judgment and possibly further investigation.

### Diagnosis and management of neuro-behçet's disease: international consensus recommendations [^116TmctR]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Comments and conclusions

We present recommendations for the key issues in the diagnosis and management of NBD, which are intended for the use of practicing clinicians.

Recommendations are a way to support effective clinical practice. While uncertainties, especially in dealing with uncommon conditions, are likely to persist, recommendations can aid clinicians in determining the best options for a particular patient.

The strengths of our consensus recommendations include an extensive literature review and the use of the best available evidence, wide-scale consultations with international experts, involvement of a patient group representative, emphasis on issues that are of particular interest to clinical practice, and setting a high level for accepting a consensus recommendation.

The limitations include lack of high-grade, evidence-based data on all of the issues covered by this consensus, and reliance on level III and IV evidences and experts' opinions to reach the consensus. There are inherent limitations to the consensus process and the Delphi method.

The proposed diagnostic criteria for NBD include two levels of certainty, but with strict requirements including objective neurological signs to reduce false positive diagnosis and improve accuracy. It only uses investigations, which have well-established supportive roles in the diagnosis. Its use is facilitated by the clear explanations for the terms used. We would like to emphasise that it is a clinical and not pathological criteria. It would require some neurological expertise to characterise the neurological syndromes. It might not help in the diagnosis of difficult and controversial neurological presentations of NBD and caution needs to be practiced, as its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are unknown while validation is needed.

The use of anticoagulants in Behçet's venous thrombosis and CVT is an important topic that needs priority in future research. International cooperation is needed to establish future studies on the best treatment options for NBD patients. These recommendations need to be updated in the future, pending further evidence.

### Diagnosis and management of neuro-behçet's disease: international consensus recommendations [^111rR57r]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hulusi Behçet, a Turkish dermatologist, described the triad of recurrent oral and genital ulcers with uveitis in 1937; the disease is commonly referred to as Behçet's disease (BD) and is recognized as a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology. Interestingly, BD is more prevalent along the ancient Silk Road, including countries in the Far East, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean basin. It has been reported, however, from most countries across the globe. Neuro-BD (NBD) refers to the neurological manifestations of the disease.

The various systemic features of BD and its commonly accepted diagnostic criteria, in addition to the description of the various epidemiological and clinical features of NBD have been described in previous publications.

In recent years, paraclinical diagnostic tests and an increasing range of immunomodulatory treatments are available for NBD patients. Practice guidelines are needed to improve the diagnostic process, improve quality of care, encourage sensible use of resources, and ensure a balanced consideration of potentially harmful medications. Because NBD is relatively uncommon, studies providing high-quality evidence are very limited. Published studies include mainly personal experiences or single-centre approaches.

Our aim was to reach expert consensus recommendations on the key issues of the diagnosis and management of NBD. As BD is a systemic disease, we felt that wide consultation with an international, multidisciplinary panel was essential to identify the key issues (scope of the recommendations) before reaching consensus through a Delphi exercise amongst a group with a majority of neurologists with special interest in BD.

The Delphi method has been widely used in healthcare and especially in developing clinical practice guidelines where rigorous data are lacking. It includes repeated rounds of communications and voting amongst a panel of experts. The outcome represents the collective opinion of the panel.

In this article, we aim to address the key issues in diagnosis and management of NBD. We will present a brief summary of the relevant background literature on each topic of interest, followed by the list of agreed consensus recommendations.

### A contemporary review of behcet's syndrome [^113NBhfc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Behcet's syndrome (BS) is a chronic systemic inflammatory vasculitis with a wide range of clinical manifestations including recurrent oral and genital ulcers; cutaneous lesions; and ophthalmic, neurologic, and gastrointestinal involvement. BS has a global distribution but is particularly prevalent in so-called Silk Road populations. Disease onset is usually around the third or fourth decade of life, and the sex ratio is roughly 1:1. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of BS, although the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. At present, there is no laboratory examination with diagnostic value for BS; therefore, a diagnosis is made based on clinical manifestations. The International Study Group diagnostic criteria published in 1990 is the most widely used and recognized, but in order to improve sensitivity, the International Criteria for Behcet's Disease is developed in 2014. Evaluating disease activity in BS is an important basis for treatment selection and monitoring, the simplified Behcet's Disease Current Activity Form (2006 version) is a well-established scoring method. Given that multiple organs are affected in BS, it must be differentiated from other diseases with similar manifestations or that may be induced by drug treatment. The goal of BS treatment is to eradicate triggers and/or aggravating factors, alleviate and control clinical symptoms, prevent and treat any damage to organs, slow disease progression, and improve the patient's quality of life. The clinical management of BS depends on the affected organs and disease severity. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge of BS pathogenesis and therapeutic options.

### Behcet's syndrome in nonendemic regions [^112YxxqU]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Behcet's syndrome is more common in certain geographic regions, however, can be seen outside of these areas and need to be included in the differential diagnosis of many patients, as it has overlapping features with many rheumatologic conditions.

Recent Findings

Especially in regions with immigrant populations, there seem to be similarities to originating countries in Behcet's prevalence, but the syndrome is not limited to those from certain backgrounds and can be seen in others also. There is emerging evidence that even though the prevalence of Behcet's may be similar to that of endemic areas, in nonendemic regions the condition may be less severe, suggesting potential environment agents in determining the severity of the disease. In addition, women seem to be overrepresented in nonendemic areas and may explain part of the reason for less severe symptoms, as Behcet's tends to be more severe in men.

Summary

The somewhat different presentation of Behcet's syndrome in nonendemic areas needs to be considered when thinking about Behcet's in the differential diagnosis of patients. Research into potentially less severe form of the disease in nonendemic areas may provide new clues to the pathogenesis of this condition.

### One year in review 2020: Behçet's syndrome [^111eoK8X]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Behçet's syndrome is a variable vessel vasculitis with multi-system involvement that shows important heterogeneity among patients regarding demographic features, organ manifestations, frequency and severity of relapses, disease course, response to treatment and prognosis. This heterogeneity has made it difficult to interpret and compare the results of studies, to standardise disease assessment and to develop management strategies. Several new studies have been published during the previous year exploring the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of Behçet's syndrome. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the most relevant recent research in Behçet's syndrome from a critical perspective.

### The international criteria for Behçet's disease (ICBD): a collaborative study of 27 countries on the sensitivity and specificity of the new criteria [^113TX47R]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "International Criteria for Behçet's Disease (ICBD)" for Behçet's syndrome.

The International Criteria for Behçet's Disease (ICBD) is a clinical scoring system used to diagnose Behçet's Disease, a rare and chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder. This calculator is applicable to patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of Behçet's Disease, such as recurrent oral and genital ulcers, eye inflammation, skin lesions, and other systemic manifestations.

The ICBD is clinically useful in standardizing the diagnosis of Behçet's Disease across different populations and clinical settings. It helps clinicians to make a more accurate diagnosis, guide treatment decisions, and predict disease course and prognosis.

The ICBD includes oral aphthosis, genital aphthosis, ocular lesions, skin lesions, and a positive pathergy test as diagnostic criteria. Each of these criteria is scored, and a certain score threshold must be met for a diagnosis of Behçet's Disease.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ICBD. However, it should be noted that this scoring system is not intended to replace clinical judgment. Other differential diagnoses should be considered and ruled out before confirming a diagnosis of Behçet's Disease based on the ICBD score.

Behçet's Disease is evaluated using several clinical criteria, each contributing to a total score that aids in diagnosis. This process involves assessing seven symptoms, with each criterion assigned a certain number of points. Here's how the calculation works:

- **Oral aphthous ulcers**: 2 points
- **Genital aphthous ulcers**: 2 points
- Ocular manifestations such as anterior or posterior uveitis, or retinal vasculitis: 2 points
- Skin lesions including pseudofolliculitis, skin aphthosis, or erythema nodosum: 1 point
- **Neurologic manifestations**: 1 point
- Vascular manifestations, such as arterial thrombosis, large vein thrombosis, generalized phlebitis, or superficial phlebitis: 1 point
- **Positive pathergy test**: 1 point

Patients provide information on these symptoms, indicating whether they are present or not. The calculated score ranges between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 10. This is achieved by summing the points corresponding to the positive responses.

The interpretation of the score is direct and crucial for diagnosis:

- A score of 4 or more means that the diagnostic criteria for Behçet's Disease are met. This suggests a strong possibility of the presence of Behçet's Disease, warranting further medical evaluation.
- A score below 4 indicates that the diagnostic criteria for Behçet's Disease are not met, suggesting that the condition is less likely based on the chosen criteria.

The calculator provides both the total score and the interpretation to help clinicians and patients understand the likelihood of having Behçet's Disease.

### British Association of Dermatologists and British Society for Rheumatology living guideline for managing people with behçets 2024 [^116UEvs5]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Behçet's syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of CNS involvement (evaluation), BAD/BSR 2024 guidelines recommend to consider establishing the diagnosis of neuro-BS in patients with neurological presentations in the context of other Behçet's-defining features (such as recurrent oral or genital ulcerations, uveitis) or after the exclusion of other neurological conditions and disease mimics. Consider using the International Consensus Recommendation diagnostic criteria for neuro-BS in adult patients. Recognize that there are no corresponding criteria for pediatric and young patients.

### 2018 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of Behçet's syndrome [^116y8fJw]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for Behçet's syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of CNS involvement, pharmacotherapy, EULAR 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate high-dose corticosteroids followed by tapering for the treatment of the first episode of cerebral venous thrombosis. Consider adding anticoagulants for a short duration. Screen for vascular disease at an extracranial site.

### British Association of Dermatologists and British Society for Rheumatology living guideline for managing people with behçets 2024 [^117RqNKq]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Behçet's syndrome, more specifically with respect to general principles, BAD/BSR 2024 guidelines recommend to use a multidisciplinary team approach involving core specialties and any other relevant specialties (dermatology, oral medicine, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, and clinical psychology, with neurology and vascular surgery input where appropriate) when managing patients with BS. Manage pediatric and young patients with BS within a multidisciplinary team appropriate to their age and development. Consider referring patients to a national Behçet's center to optimize diagnosis and treatment.

### Outcome measures used in clinical trials for Behçet syndrome: a systematic review [^112YNdgs]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Behçet syndrome (BS) is a multisystem vasculitis that is most active during young adulthood, causing serious disability and significant impairment in quality of life. Differences in the disease course, severity, and organ involvement between patients, depending on the age at presentation and sex, makes it impossible to determine a single management strategy. The diversity and variability in the outcome measures used in clinical trials in BS makes it difficult to compare the results or inform physicians about the best management strategy for individual patients. There is a large unmet need to determine or develop validated outcome measures for use in clinical trials in BS that are acceptable to researchers and regulatory agencies. We conducted a systematic review to describe the outcomes and outcome measures that have been used in clinical trials in BS. This review revealed the diversity and variability in the outcomes and outcome measures and the lack of standard definitions for most outcomes and rarity of validated outcome tools for disease assessment in BS. This systematic literature review will identify domains and candidate instruments for use in a Delphi exercise, the next step in the development of a core set of outcome measures that are properly validated and widely accepted by the collaboration of researchers from many different regions of the world and from different specialties, including rheumatology, ophthalmology, dermatology, gastroenterology, and neurology.

### Assessing the efficacy of anticoagulation therapy in the treatment of vascular Behçet's disease: a systematic review [^117T2Pkp]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Behçet's disease (BD) often presents with vascular complications, termed vascular Behçet's disease (VBD). While immunosuppression (IS) is the cornerstone of treatment, the role of anticoagulation (AC) is debated. This systematic review aims to consolidate and summarise the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of AC in VBD, especially considering emerging studies post-2018 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus up to January 2024, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. We included studies that investigated the impact of AC on VBD outcomes, using the Joanna Briggs Institute tools for data extraction and risk of bias assessment.

Results

Our search yielded 2,202 articles, with 34 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Results indicate variable AC coverage, from 10.8% to 98.6% across studies, with different anticoagulants employed. Some studies highlighted significant benefits of AC in reducing thrombotic events and improving surgical outcomes, whereas others showed neutral or limited effects. Safety profiles were generally favourable, with low incidences of significant bleeding.

Conclusions

AC therapy can be beneficial in certain contexts of VBD, particularly in reducing thrombosis recurrence and managing postoperative complications. However, the benefits of AC are not uniformly demonstrated across all patient settings, suggesting a tailored approach to AC use in VBD might be warranted. The findings underscore the necessity for randomised controlled trials to clarify the optimal therapeutic strategies for AC in conjunction with IS in BD.

### Behçet syndrome [^116NThej]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Behçet syndrome is a systemic vasculitis with an unknown aetiology affecting the small and large vessels of the venous and arterial systems. The presence of symptom clusters, regional differences in disease expression and similarities with, for example, Crohn's disease suggest that multiple pathological pathways are involved in Behçet syndrome. These disease features also make formulating disease criteria difficult. Genetic studies have identified HLA-B✱51 as a genetic risk factor. However, the low prevalence of HLA-B✱51 in many patients with bona fide disease, especially in non-endemic regions, suggests that other factors must also be operative in Behçet syndrome. Despite lacking a clear aetiological mechanism and definition, management of manifestations that include major vascular disease, eye disease and central nervous system involvement has improved with the help of new technology. Furthermore, even with our incomplete understanding of disease mechanisms, the prognoses of patients with Behçet syndrome, including those with eye disease, continue to improve. New treatment options and a better understanding of the underlying pathogenesis for various manifestations of this condition are required to further improve the management of the disease, which will improve patient quality of life.

### Pediatric onset Behçet disease [^1169Pz2o]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Behçet disease is becoming increasingly recognized in the pediatric rheumatology practice. Behçet disease remains a challenging vasculitis owing to the heterogeneity of clinical presentation, the disease course characterized by remissions and relapses and the lack of evidence-based data for its treatment. We need to understand the scope of the disease, its pathogenesis and the available treatment strategies for better management of these patients.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown that Behçet disease is much more frequent than we had thought. Genetic factors have long been implicated in the disease. Associations with candidate genes continue; however, the genome-wide association studies will probably provide us with more substantial data. This year, studies in childhood Behçet disease have been mainly gathered around eye diseases. Recommendations in adult Behçet disease for treatment strategies in eye diseases as well as different organ involvements will be reviewed along with the limited pediatric reports addressing treatment.

Summary

The presented epidemiological data and specific clinical features of Behçet disease will enable us to understand the extent of the disease. It is important to understand the differences we encounter in children. Genetic associations may shed light on the pathogenesis and possibly treatment of Behçet disease. Since we lack sufficient pediatric data, we need to apply adult treatment strategies.

### Major vessel involvement in Behçet disease [^1144M6Ct]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Large vessel vasculitis occurs in a subgroup of patients with Behçet disease at high risk for disease-related morbidity and mortality. Recognition of patients at risk, early detection of vasculitis, and the need for aggressive treatment are essential for optimal care of these patients. The authors review the clinical spectrum and management of large vessel problems in Behçet disease, highlighting contributions over the past year.

Recent Findings

Vasculo-Behçet patients are at risk for multiple vessel-related complications including thromboses, stenoses, occlusions, and aneurysms. A number of factors may contribute to thrombosis in individual cases, but the primary reason for clot seems to reside in the inflammatory process in the arterial wall, still incompletely understood. An appreciation for the challenges in the perioperative period requires the joint efforts of physicians and surgeons, and fuels the study of alternate, less invasive procedures for Behçet patients.

Summary

Because of earlier recognition, aggressive medical treatment, and novel surgical procedures, the morbidity and mortality of large vessel vasculitis in Behçet disease are beginning to change. In the absence of controlled treatment studies, reports of clinical experience remain an important source of information for clinicians. Identification of patients at risk for vascular complications remains a priority.

Regarding medical management for Behçet's syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of mucocutaneous lesions, topical therapy, BAD/BSR 2024 guidelines recommend to offer potent or superpotent topical corticosteroids for the management of oral and genital ulcers in patients with BS if the symptoms are mild or as adjunctive therapy with systemic immunosuppression for more severe disease. Consider prescribing the appropriate formulation of the topical corticosteroids for oral and genital use depending on patient preference, age, and ulcer location.

### Treating ulcers associated with Behçet's disease… [^116Gz1q5]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory condition, probably of autoimmune origin, that is triggered by infectious antigens or other antigens in genetically predisposed persons. Recurrent, painful ulcerations of the oral and genital mucosa are the most common symptoms. Therapeutic agents, such as topical or intralesional corticosteroids, generally are used only for palliative therapy. Sucralfate, which is commonly used in the treatment of peptic ulcers, can also heal ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract. However, its effectiveness in healing oral and genital ulcerations is unknown. Alpsoy and associates evaluated the efficacy of topical sucralfate suspension in the treatment of the mucocutaneous lesions associated with Behçet's disease. Forty patients with Behçet's disease were randomized to receive either sucralfate or a placebo four times a day for three months. Sucralfate and the placebo were identical in appearance.

All patients were instructed to use 5 mL of sucralfate or placebo as an oral rinse for one to two minutes after routine mouth care and before sleep. Data were evaluated for 30 of the 40 patients eligible for the study. Disease parameters at baseline were similar between groups. Patients in the treatment group had significantly decreased mean frequency, healing time and pain associated with oral ulcerations, and decreased healing time and pain associated with genital ulcerations compared with the pretreatment period. Patients in the placebo group showed no significant differences between the pretreatment and treatment periods, except for decreased pain of oral ulcerations. Only mean frequency and healing time of oral ulcerations were significantly different in patients in the treatment group at the follow-up visit.

The authors conclude that topical sucralfate suspension is effective and inexpensive in treating the oral and genital ulcerations characteristic of Behçet's disease and offers an option to palliative therapy. The differences in improvement ratings for oral ulcerations between groups were significant. Despite the fact that the healing time and pain associated with genital ulcerations decreased clinically, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. A striking finding was the marked decrease in pain scores in both groups. Although the percentage of decrease was higher in the treatment group, the results indicate that coating agents are helpful in the palliation of pain.

### Biologic therapy in large and small vessels vasculitis, and Behçet's disease: evidence-and practice-based guidance [^111568qd]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vasculitis are a very heterogenous group of systemic autoimmune diseases, affecting large vessels (LVV), small vessels or presenting as a multisystemic variable vessel vasculitis. We aimed to define evidence and practice-based recommendations for the use of biologics in large and small vessels vasculitis, and Behçet's disease (BD).

Methods

Recommendations were made by an independent expert panel, following a comprehensive literature review and two consensus rounds. The panel included 17 internal medicine experts with recognized practice on autoimmune diseases management. The literature review was systematic from 2014 until 2019 and later updated by cross-reference checking and experts' input until 2022. Preliminary recommendations were drafted by working groups for each disease and voted in two rounds, in June and September 2021. Recommendations with at least 75% agreement were approved.

Results

A total of 32 final recommendations (10 for LVV treatment, 7 for small vessels vasculitis and 15 for BD) were approved by the experts and several biologic drugs were considered with different supporting evidence. Among LVV treatment options, tocilizumab presents the higher level of supporting evidence. Rituximab is recommended for treatment of severe/refractory cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Infliximab and adalimumab are most recommended in treatment of severe/refractory BD manifestations. Other biologic drugs can be considered is specific presentations.

Conclusion

These evidence and practice-based recommendations are a contribute to treatment decision and may, ultimately, improve the outcome of patients living with these conditions.

### Management of Behçet syndrome [^116oM2Rb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

New treatment options have been studied over the last several years, with a recent approval, a first for Behçet syndrome, in the United States. New management guidelines have also been published, helping with this nowadays more commonly recognized condition's management. The goal of this review is to summarize the most important and potentially clinically relevant recent developments and discuss their impact in the management of patients with Behçet syndrome.

Recent Findings

Apremilast is now approved for the treatment of oral ulcer of Behçet syndrome in the United States. It's possible benefits in controlling nonoral ulcer features of the syndrome are awaited. Long-term use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for the treatment of especially eye disease in Behçet syndrome seems to be safe and efficacious. New treatment options such as ustekinumab, secukinumab, tocilizumab and others have early promising data but more studies are needed to better clarify their role in Behçet management.

Summary

The last 2 years have not only seen the approval of the first drug specifically labeled for the treatment of Behçet syndrome in the case of apremilast, many groups have also presented and published their findings on promising new therapeutic agents, which may soon be added to our tools in treating this condition. We also know more about other drugs, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors as many patients have been on these for long periods of time, and long-term follow-up data seem to confirm their role in Behçet treatment. Lack of placebo controlled, randomized trials, for the most part, are still outstanding issues.

### Guidelines for the treatment of skin and mucosal lesions in Behçet's disease: a secondary publication [^114tTQHo]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the current study, we present guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of the mucocutaneous lesions of Behçet's disease, which is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the involvement of various organs, including mucocutaneous, ocular, vascular, intestinal and central nervous system lesions. It is often identified in the Middle East Mediterranean to East Asia region. Skin manifestations include erythema nodosum, papulopustular lesions and thrombophlebitis, and mucosal manifestations include oral and genital ulcers. These mucocutaneous lesions are characteristically the first signs of Behçet's disease and are important to be recognized for the early diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, these manifestations also recur and persist over the long-term course of the disease. The management of mucocutaneous lesions is important to prevent recurrence. We developed consensus guidelines that provide recommendations for general practitioners and dermatologists and physicians on the management of the mucocutaneous lesions of Behçet's disease.

### Management of patients with Behçet's disease during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113kwRvR]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Behçet's disease is a disease characterized by chronic inflammatory vasculitis. In the clinical symptoms of Behçet's disease, many immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs are used. The suspicion that drugs used in chronic disease treatments such as Behçet's disease during pandemic will increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19 disease, and that the disease may progress more lethally in these patients after the infection caused clinicians to worry. As far as we know, there is no study in the literature about the management of patients with Behçet's disease in the pandemic period. Fifty-four patients with Behçet's disease who were admitted to the dermatology outpatient clinic between 11 March and July 14, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. In this pandemic period, 44 of 54 patients were recommended to continue their previous treatment. While the dose of medication used by 7 patients was reduced, it was decided to change the treatment of 3 patients. No life-threatening activation was observed. None of the patients developed COVID-19 disease. This article is important in terms of being the first study in the literature examining the treatment of patients with Behçet's disease during the COVID-19. In this period, we know that the treatment practices in chronic diseases change frequently daily, and in this respect, we hope that our study will provide a perspective to other dermatology clinics in terms of the treatment of Behçet's disease during the pandemic.

According to these studies, the EULAR and RSCMA updated the guidelines in 2018 and 2021, respectively. The updated treatment principles can be summarized as follows: (1) The key point is to promptly suppress inflammatory exacerbations and prevent recurrences. (2) The prevention of irreversible organ damage and disease progression is the final goal. (3) A multidisciplinary approach and individualized treatment based on patient status, severity of organ involvement, and patient preferences are necessary. To some extent, it is similar to the principles of treatment for IBD, which aims for early induction of remission and long-term maintenance to prevent relapse.

### Imaging manifestations of behcet's disease: key considerations and major features [^114dwFDu]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Behcet's disease is an autoimmune disease most commonly seen in the Middle East. Although primarily known with painful oral and genital ulcers, it can lead to vasculitis. Therefore, several associated complications such as thrombotic syndromes, aneurysmal arterial disease may arise. In many cases, it might be difficult to make the diagnosis purely based on clinical grounds; however, imaging plays an important role for both diagnosis and assessment of the disease's complications. We provide a comprehensive review of the most notable imaging findings of Behcet's disease.

### Behçet: the syndrome [^117QoszL]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Behçet's syndrome (BS) is a systemic vasculitis characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. It can involve the skin, mucosa, joints, vessels (arteries and/or veins), eyes, and nervous and gastrointestinal systems, and so is referred to as a syndrome rather than as a unique and nosologically distinct condition. These involvements may present alone or co-exist in the same patient. Although all the possible combinations of the above-mentioned manifestations may occur, clusters of commonly co-existing involvements (also referred to as 'disease phenotypes') have been suggested, namely 'mucocutaneous and articular', 'peripheral vascular and extra-parenchymal neurological' and 'parenchymal neurological and ocular' phenotypes have been described. Patient-specific demographic and genetic features have been described as positively or negatively associated with specific disease phenotypes. This review will focus on the different clinical features of Behçet's syndrome, summarizing current evidence on the distinct disease manifestations as well as the major phenotypes.

### Validation of the PEDiatric Behçet's disease classification criteria: an evidence-based approach [^117F8Snq]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Behçet's disease (BD), is a systemic inflammatory multiorgan disease displaying features of both autoinflammation and vasculitis. Classified as a 'variable vessel vasculitis', the disease is characterized by an involvement of the skin, eyes, joints, gut and central nervous system. The geographical distribution of BD shows a prevalence along the eastern and Mediterranean countries, and its phenotypic expression varies among different populations. The disease pathogenesis still remains unclear, involving both the innate and T cells-mediated immunity, with MHC I-associated predisposing factors.

In children, BD is rare and its diagnosis challenging due to a gap between the onset of the first manifestations and the development of a complete clinical picture. In fact, the first BD symptoms may start in early childhood, reaching a complete form before the age of 16 years in 4–26% of cases only.

The variability of the disease features (age, ethnic background, disease clusters) has generated several sets of diagnostic and classification criteria, making BD the vasculitis with the highest number of criteria ever created (18 sets). In 1946, the first diagnostic criteria were published, followed in the next decades by several sets of criteria, highlighting also the geographical differences in the clinical presentation of BD. In the 1990s, the first international criteria were proposed (ISG), then revised in 2006 and 2013 (ICBD). Because pediatric BD was not addressed specifically in any of the previous criteria, in 2010 an international prospective cohort of pediatric BD was created, leading to the first set of pediatric BD classification criteria in 2015 (PEDBD). These criteria were tested in some pediatric cohorts with different results in sensitivity and specificity.

### Behçet: the syndrome [^115Yadvx]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Behçet's syndrome:

- **Definition**: BS is a chronic, relapsing autoimmune disorder characterized by systemic inflammation that primarily affects blood vessels throughout the body.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BS involves dysregulation of the immune system, leading to systemic inflammation. This inflammation primarily affects the blood vessels, resulting in vasculitis, which can occur in both the venous and arterial systems.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of BS in Northern Europe and the US ranges between 0.12 and 0.64 cases per 100,000 population. The highest prevalence of BS is reported in Turkey, with 420 cases per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BS include a genetic predisposition, with HLA-B✱51 identified as a significant genetic risk factor. Genome-wide association studies have also revealed associations with the IL23R-IL12RB2 and IL10 loci. Despite these genetic associations, BS can manifest in individuals lacking these genetic markers, suggesting the potential influence of environmental factors in disease development.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, BS is characterized by recurrent oral ulcers, ocular inflammation, and skin lesions. Other systems, such as the gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems, can also be involved. Neurological involvement, known as neuro-Behcet's syndrome, is a serious manifestation of the disease and can lead to significant morbidity.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BS is variable and unpredictable. It typically follows a relapsing and remitting course, with periods of exacerbation and remission. Over time, progressive organ damage can occur, particularly in cases with neurological or vascular involvement.

### Developing a core set of outcome measures for Behçet disease: report from OMERACT 2016 [^112gX9wk]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) Vasculitis Working Group has been working toward developing a data-driven core set of outcome measures for use in clinical trials of Behçet's syndrome [Behçet disease (BD)]. This paper summarizes the group's work through OMERACT 2016, discussions during the meeting, and the future research agenda.

Methods

Qualitative patient interviews were conducted among 20 patients with BD who have different types of organ involvement. A 3-round Delphi among BD experts and patients was initiated to identify domains, subdomains, and outcomes to be assessed in clinical trials of BD. The results of these studies were discussed during OMERACT 2016 and next steps were planned.

Results

Patients' perspectives and priorities were identified through qualitative interviews that identified candidate domains and subdomains for inclusion in the Delphi and characterized some shortcomings of the currently used patient-reported outcomes in BD. The first round of the Delphi was completed and several domains or subdomains were endorsed by the experts and/or the patients. Because many more items were endorsed than would be feasible to assess during a clinical trial, rating and ranking of items by physicians and patients was planned as a next critical step. The challenges of assessing specific organ system involvement was also discussed.

Conclusion

The OMERACT Behçet Syndrome Working Group research program will identify core domains for assessment in BD with the goal of developing a core set of outcome measures for use in all trials of BD with the option to incorporate additional outcomes for specific organ involvement.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. Behcet's syndrome was recorded as a clinical rarity until recently, chiefly among Japanese or Turkish patients. More recently, it has been recognized as an entity that is seen worldwide, defined as oculomucocutaneous syndrome with many systemic features, including thrombotic involvement of the large veins and the major arteries, demyelinating disease of the CNS, ulcerative disease of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, and sparing, in selected patients, virtually no organ system. A tenuous association with HLA-B5 has been identified, chiefly in propositi from the Middle East, North Africa, and northern Japan, although this association seems not to hold in surveyed patients from the midlands of England and the northern tier of the United States.

The cause remains obscure, but some relationships to trace metals and to immunologic features have been inferred. The regular administration of colchicine and the use of transfer factor both have seemed to alter the course in some. Ehrlich GE. Behcet's Disease. JAMA. 1979; 242:

### Major vessel involvement in Behçet's disease: an update [^1147MAtN]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Large vessel vasculitis occurs in a subgroup of patients with Behçet's disease who are at high risk for disease-related morbidity and mortality. Recognition of patients at risk, early detection of vasculitis, and aggressive treatment are essential for optimal care of these patients. We review the expanding knowledge on large vessel problems in Behçet's disease, highlighting recent contributions.

Recent Findings

Vasculo-Behçet patients are at risk for multiple vessel-related complications including thromboses, stenoses, occlusions, and aneurysms. The primary reason for clot seems to be an inflammatory process in the vessel wall. Less invasive endovascular procedures are increasingly used to treat aneurysms in Behçet patients.

Summary

Because of earlier recognition, aggressive medical treatment, and novel surgical procedures, the morbidity and mortality of large vessel vasculitis in Behçet's disease are improving.

### The unique features of vasculitis in Behçet's syndrome [^112VwCAU]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

The presence of a true vasculitis is difficult to discern in some of the more common manifestations of Behçet's syndrome, like the papulopustular lesions of the skin. On the other hand, a true vasculitis is seen in all vessel sizes in the majority of the patients. The pathogenesis is not yet known. A Th1-type inflammatory reaction is seen like in some other primary vasculitides. However, in contrast to other vasculitides, granuloma formation is absent. Behçet's syndrome is unique among the vasculitides with its differing geographic distribution in disease expression, the distinctly more severe disease among the male, the predominance of venous disease, and the generally abating disease course with lack of associated increased atherosclerosis.

### How to recognise a Behçet's ulcer from other types of oral ulceration? Defining Behçet's ulceration by an international Delphi consultation [^114hcSvd]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To define the clinical characteristics of oral ulceration (OU) in Behçet's disease (BD), to allow differentiation from other causes of OU, including aphthous ulcers, by an International Delphi consultation. To develop a clinical guideline on how to recognise BD ulcers.

Methods

Round 1. 40 clinical images of OU in BD, recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) were shown. Participants answered, independently, which images would be consistent with a BD ulcer. Round 2. The results from marking independently were shown. The panel remarked the questions through iteration process. The images not agreed to be a possible BD ulcer were discarded. Round 3. 10 clinical descriptors that may define BD ulcers were suggested. Participants ranked the level of importance for each descriptor on each image presented. Round 4. Participants re-ranked their level of agreement for each descriptor through iteration process. Whether the clinical pictures would be different from RAS was also explored. A final agreement was reached.

Results

This study has shown clear differentiation between BD, IBD and MMP ulcers when defining them by phenotype through clinical images only. On the other hand, no differentiation between RAS and BD ulcers was found. The most important clinical descriptors that define BD ulcers have been agreed.

Conclusions

New clinical guidance for Health Care Professionals (HCP) on how to recognise a BD ulcer has been proposed. This should elucidate an earlier diagnosis, quicker access to treatment and control of the disease enhancing patient's quality of life.

### The treatment principles and targets for intestinal behcet's disease [^112W3H9y]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic and recurrent systemic vasculitis involving large, medium and small blood vessels as well as arteries and veins. BD with predominant gastrointestinal manifestations is diagnosed as intestinal BD, which is associated with severe complications such as massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction. Recently, treat-to-target (T2T) strategies have been successfully used in many chronic diseases and been suggested in the management of BD, while there are no related reviews about the global treatment strategy including treatment principles and targets for intestinal BD in detail. Herein, we review the treatment principles from the aspects of departments of Rheumatology and Gastroenterology. In addition, treatment targets of intestinal BD are reviewed from three aspects such as evaluable markers, effective markers and potency-ratio markers. Some definitions and conceptions from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) bring us reference and enlightenments.

Ocular involvement in Behçet's syndrome still represents a challenge for both rheumatologists and ophthalmologists; over the past 20 years the availability of new diagnostic tools and the concomitant introduction of biologic drugs led to a significant improvement in the management of these patients. The lack of uniform definitions and the diversity of the outcome measures still represent an obstacle for the prompt and correct management of ocular manifestations. The aim of the present review is to summarise the current evidences related to correct diagnosis and proper management of patients with Behçet's syndrome and ocular involvement.

### Behçet's syndrome [^1163XySa]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Behçet's syndrome (BS) shows a peculiar distribution, with a much higher prevalence in countries along the ancient Silk Road compared with rest of the world. BS also seems to follow a more severe course in ethnic groups with higher prevalence. Diagnosis depends on clinical findings. Criteria sets may not help in patients with less frequent types of involvement. Management strategies should be modified according to the age and sex of the patient and the organs involved. Being a serious health problem in endemic areas, BS also attracts global attention as a model to study inflammatory diseases of unknown cause.

### Study details | NCT02307513 | A phase 3 randomized,… [^115nabQG]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Study Overview Behçet's disease, is a rare disorder that causes inflammation in blood vessels throughout the body. The signs and symptoms of Behçet's disease may include mouth sores, eye inflammation, skin rashes and lesions, and genital sores that vary from person to person and may come and go on their own. The exact cause of Behçet's is unknown, but it may be an autoimmune disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks some of its own healthy cells. This study will evaluate if apremilast is better than placebo for the treatment of oral ulcers in subjects with active Behçet's disease. Other manifestations of the disease will also be assessed, such as, pain and tenderness in joints, eye inflammation, genital ulcers, and skin disease. This study also will test how well the body tolerates apremilast. In addition, the second purpose of the study is to assess the safety of apremilast in patients with Behçet's disease.

Exclusion Criteria: The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from the study enrollment. Disease Specific Exclusions: Behçet's disease-related active major organ involvement
- pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems manifestations, and ocular lesions requiring immunosuppressive therapy; however: A serious AE is any AE that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or constituted an important medical event.

For both AEs and SAEs the investigator assessed the severity of the event according to the grading scale: Mild: asymptomatic or with mild symptoms; Moderate: symptoms causing moderate discomfort and local or noninvasive intervention is indicated; Severe: symptoms causing severe discomfort or pain, symptoms requiring medical/surgical intervention. An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. An SAE is any AE that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or constituted an important medical event.

### Behçet's syndrome: facts and controversies [^1174r2PT]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Behçet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis of small and large vessels affecting both veins and arteries. Almost all patients with Behçet's syndrome have recurrent oral aphthae, followed by genital ulcers, variable skin lesions, such as erythema nodosum and papulopustuler lesions, arthritis, uveitis, thrombophlebitis, and gastrointestinal and central nervous system involvement. Recent epidemiologic works suggest that genetic factors are more important than environmental factors in its pathogenesis. European League Against Rheumatism guidelines were recently published for the treatment of Behçet's syndrome. Although these are quite useful for the management of mucocutaneous, eye, and joint involvement, treatment of vascular, neurological, and gastrointestinal involvement are still problematic as there are no controlled studies for these manifestations. This contribution addresses the epidemiology, mucocutaneous manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based therapies, including biologic agents.

### Management of behcet's syndrome [^111sKFfH]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Behcet's syndrome (BS) is a variable vessel vasculitis with heterogeneous clinical features. Skin, mucosa and joint involvement can cause impairment of quality of life but do not cause permanent damage whereas untreated eye, vascular, nervous system and gastrointestinal system involvement can cause serious damage and even death. Management of BS as a multidisciplinary team enables a faster and more accurate diagnosis and well-integrated treatment strategies. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy. Colchicine, AZA, ciclosporin-A, cyclophosphamide, IFN alpha, and tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors are other agents used as induction and/or maintenance therapy. Although biologic agents have been increasingly used, there are still unmet needs. Head-to-head comparison studies of some therapeutic options (e.g. TNF inhibitors vs IFN alpha in uveitis) are required. Novel therapeutic agents in the pipeline could change the standard of care for BS in the future.

### Diagnosis and management of neuro-behçet's disease: international consensus recommendations [^116CpWBq]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

International consensus recommendation (ICR) diagnostic criteria of NBD

Although BD is a well-defined disease with well-established criteria for its diagnosis, the same is not true for NBD. The neurological manifestations of BD have been characterised in many publications. Neurological symptoms and signs seen in BD patients are not necessarily due to NBD, and could represent primary neurological disorders like stroke or migraine, or adverse effects of treatment of BD, like secondary infections or malignancy.

There have been previous attempts to produce diagnostic criteria of NBD, but these have not been validated and did not gain general acceptance. Clinically-based diagnostic criteria of other neuro-inflammatory conditions, whether confined to the CNS like in multiple sclerosis, or neurological manifestations of a systemic disease like in neurosarcoidosis have inspired us to develop our criteria.

In Table 3, we present practical clinical diagnostic criteria for NBD, approved by consensus. We are not describing a new disease entity, but characterising specific manifestations of a systemic disease. The objective is to help clinicians to diagnose patients with NBD with certainty through identifying the recognised clinical syndromes (presentations) and excluding mimics. Within the criteria, we propose "definite" and "probable" categories to express different degrees of certainty based on the diagnosis of BD and on the details of the neurological presentation. In Table 4, we clarify the terms used in the ICR diagnostic criteria for NBD.

### Behcet's disease as a multiple symptom complex… [^1158TAJc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A voluminous literature has accumulated since Halusi Behcet1 two decades ago in several publications called attention to the morbid entity of recurrent attacks of ulcerative changes in the eyes, mouth, and genitalia. Soon it became certain that besides the three manifestations, which are not always fully evident, other signs may be present in the blood vessels, skin, joints, and viscera, and the disease cannot be regarded anymore as a triple symptom complex but as a complex of diverse symptoms. Many observers maintain that the disease is more prevalent in the Middle East, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean area. Feigenbaum6 found that the full picture of this new syndrome was described by Hippocrates in his third book of endemic diseases. During the last 20 years I have had the opportunity to observe 10 cases of Bechet's disease. The diagnosis was made when two of the three cardinal symptoms were. BERLIN C.

### Behçet syndrome: a contemporary view [^113uBf5f]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

The presence of symptom clusters, regional differences in disease expression and similarities with, for example, Crohn's disease suggest multiple pathological pathways are involved in Behçet syndrome. These features also make formulating disease criteria difficult. Genetic studies have identified HLA-B✱51 to be the important genetic risk factor. However, the low prevalence of HLA-B✱51 in many patients with bone fide disease, especially in non-endemic regions, suggests other factors must also be operative in Behçet syndrome. This consideration is also true for the newly proposed 'MHC-I-opathy' concept. Despite lacking a clear aetiological mechanism and definition, management of manifestations that include major vascular disease (such as Budd-Chiari syndrome and pulmonary artery involvement), eye disease and central nervous system involvement has improved with the help of new technology. Furthermore, even with our incomplete understanding of disease mechanisms, the prognoses of patients with Behçet syndrome, including those with eye disease, continue to improve.

### Cluster analysis as a clinical and research tool in Behçet's syndrome [^114cPrtB]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review was to comprehensively summarize recent phenotype research findings in Behçet's syndrome.

Recent Findings

Cluster analysis has recently been employed as a phenotype research tool in Behçet's syndrome. Studies reported different clustering patterns caused by biological variation and some degree of artificial heterogeneity. However, some clusters were more consistent than others: 1) oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and skin lesions 2) oral ulcers, genital ulcers, skin lesions, and arthritis 3) oral ulcers, genital ulcers, skin lesions, and uveitis 4) oral ulcers, genital ulcers, skin lesions, and gastrointestinal involvement. A number of loci suggestive of differential risk for individual disease manifestations were proposed. Peripheral blood gene expression profile and plasma proteome exhibited significant differences in patients with different organ involvements and were able to differentiate between disease phenotypes. However, these observations require further validation and functional studies.

Summary

Clustering patterns in Behçet's syndrome is highly heterogeneous. Artificial heterogeneity might obscure the true biological variation of disease expression. Preliminary genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that different pathogenetic mechanisms may operate in different phenotypes of Behçet's syndrome.

Methods

Panel selection

The project was initiated by invitations to a wide range of experts with academic and clinical experience in the field of BD across the globe, who were mostly members of the International Society for Behçet's Disease. Fifty-two experts from 22 countries accepted the invitation, including a voluntary patients' group representative. They included 22 neurologists, 11 internists, and 19 other specialists, including 13 rheumatologists, two ophthalmologists, one dermatologist, one immunologist and one paediatrician. The panel was structured into three groups: a project organising committee (POC), a Neuro-Behçet's advisory group and a Neuro-Behçet's consensus group. The POC consisted of four members, AA-A, the convenor of the project, SK, the researcher and bibliographer, AS, an academic clinical epidemiologist, and GAD, an experienced neuro-Behçet's expert. The advisory group consisted of all 52 panel members who participated till the second round of the Delphi process. The consensus group consisted of 12 members (majority neurologists: seven) chosen from the advisory group based on their active contribution in the consensus process, specialty, and publications records. They continued the further steps of the Delphi exercise and are the authors of this paper. The project methodology was discussed, amended, and agreed upon by all participating members before starting the consensus process.

Search strategy and selection criteria

Literature was searched on Cochrane, Medline, and Embase databases using the key search terms "Behçet ", "Neuro Behçet ", and "triple-symptom complex" for entries from 1948 until April 2011. Titles and abstracts of published articles were reviewed. The search was limited to human studies only, published in the English language. The articles addressing diagnosis or treatment were reviewed, which could be case reports, case series, observations, comparison studies, interventional studies, or reviews. These were supplemented by reference lists from the authors' own collections. Full texts of relevant articles were reviewed and the final reference list was generated on the basis of relevance to the scope of this consensus. The search was updated every 3 months until April 2013. Draft recommendations were generated with their level of evidence; levels I–IV were used to grade the articles.

### The association of Behçet's syndrome with HLA-B51 as understood in 2021 [^113BixDG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Behçet's syndrome is a chronic multisystemic inflammatory disorder characterized by relapsing and recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcers, skin lesions, uveitis, and broader systemic manifestations, such as arthritis, and gastrointestinal or central nervous system involvement The disease is categorized as a variable vessel vasculitis with multiple lesions in all sizes of arterial and venous vessels. Some readers may be more familiar with the term Behçet's disease than Behçet's syndrome. However, Behçet's disease was replaced with Behçet's syndrome in the 2018 update of European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for management.

Box 1
no caption available

The cause of Behçet's syndrome remains unknown, although both genetic and environmental factors are considered important in disease pathogenesis. Genome-wide association study and subsequent detail genomic studies have identified multiple susceptibility genes, most of which are involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. Among them, HLA-B✱51 is responsible for the strongest genetic predisposition. It was first reported by Ohno et al. in Japan in 1973, followed by reports in other ethnic groups. A meta-analysis of HLA-B5 or B∗51 genotypes in 4800 patients with Behçet's syndrome with 16 289 healthy controls suggested a 32–52% of population attributable risks for Behçet's syndrome associated with the HLA-B5/B∗51 allele. This review discusses the clinical and pathogenetic aspects of HLA-B✱51 as a hallmark of Behçet's syndrome.

### The treatment principles and targets for intestinal behcet's disease [^117TxFnR]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic and recurrent systemic vasculitis involving large, medium and small blood vessels as well as arteries and veins. BD with predominant gastrointestinal manifestations is diagnosed as intestinal BD, which is associated with severe complications such as massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction. Recently, treat-to-target (T2T) strategies have been successfully used in many chronic diseases and been suggested in the management of BD, while there are no related reviews about the global treatment strategy including treatment principles and targets for intestinal BD in detail. Herein, we review the treatment principles from the aspects of departments of Rheumatology and Gastroenterology. In addition, treatment targets of intestinal BD are reviewed from three aspects such as evaluable markers, effective markers and potency-ratio markers. Some definitions and conceptions from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) bring us reference and enlightenments.

### Behçet's disease in children, an overview [^113MVjzs]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

BD is a systemic inflammatory disease with a variable vasculitis. Paediatric onset is very rare and carries a strong genetic component. Oral ulcers and fever of unknown origin are frequent at onset and difficult to distinguish from other inflammatory disorders; therefore, expert opinion is still mandatory to recognize the disease early. An international expert consensus has recently proposed new classification criteria for children with BD. The clinical spectrum of BD is heterogeneous and influenced by gender, ethnicity and country of residence. Young males have the worst prognosis with significantly more frequent neurological, ocular and vascular involvement. BD treatment is aimed at alleviating inflammation. Among all drugs, TNFα inhibitors have become a standard to control severe ocular, neurological and digestive system involvement.

### Evaluation of sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic criteria for Behçet's disease in the absence of a gold standard [^113xQVxD]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The performance of existing diagnostic criteria for Behçet's disease (BD) is usually evaluated by comparison with expert opinions, which may be limited by misclassification and disagreement among experts. We aim to evaluate these criteria in the absence of a gold standard.

Methods

We obtained two datasets involving possible BD and other mimickers from a uveitis registry using case-cohort and nested case-control analyses, respectively. With a Bayesian inference approach, the sensitivity and specificity of International Study Group (ISG) and International Criteria for Behçet's Disease (ICBD) criteria were simultaneously estimated when true BD state was unknown.

Results

A total of 2440 and 2224 participants were included in case-cohort and nested case-control analyses, respectively. In case-cohort analysis, with scores of ≥ 4 for BD diagnosis, ICBD criteria showed higher sensitivity (median 97.6%; 95% credible interval 96.9, 98.2) than ISG criteria (median 90.0%; 95% credible interval 88.8, 91.2) but had lower specificity (median 90.8%; 95% credible interval 89.4, 92.1) than ISG criteria (median 98.8%; 95% credible interval 98.3, 99.3). With scores of ≥ 5 for diagnosis, ICBD criteria demonstrated higher sensitivity (median 97.5%; 95% credible interval 96.8, 98.1) and specificity (median 99.6%; 95% credible interval 99.3, 99.8) than the sensitivity (median 92.3%; 95% credible interval 91.2, 93.3) and specificity (median 98.8%; 95% credible interval 98.2, 99.2) for ISG criteria. The highest diagnostic consistency was observed between ISG criteria and ICBD criteria with scores of ≥ 5 for diagnosis (Kappa = 0.999; P < 0.001). Nested case-control analysis showed similar results.

Conclusion

ICBD criteria showed optimum discriminatory properties in sensitivity and specificity with scores of ≥ 5 for BD diagnosis in uveitis. The diagnostic threshold of ICBD criteria could be considered adjustable according to medical specialty, disease prevalence and local practice characteristics.

### Current status, goals, and research agenda for outcome measures development in Behçet syndrome: report from OMERACT 2014 [^117LQzrs]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

There is an unmet need for reliable, validated, and widely accepted outcomes and outcome measures for use in clinical trials in Behçet syndrome (BS). Our report summarizes initial steps taken by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) vasculitis working group toward developing a core set of outcome measures for BS according to the OMERACT methodology, including the OMERACT Filter 2.0, and discussions during the first meeting of the BS working group held during OMERACT 12 (2014).

Methods

During OMERACT 12, some of the important challenges in developing outcomes for BS were outlined and discussed, and a research agenda was drafted.

Results

Among topics discussed were the advantages and disadvantages of a composite measure for BS that evaluates several organs/organ systems; bringing patients and physicians together for discussions about how to assess disease activity; use of organ-specific measures developed for other diseases; and the inclusion of generic, disease-specific, or organ-specific measures. The importance of incorporating patients' perspectives, concerns, and ideas into outcome measure development was emphasized.

Conclusion

The planned research agenda includes conducting a Delphi exercise among physicians from different specialties that are involved in the care of patients with BS and among patients with BS, with the aim of identifying candidate domains and subdomains to be assessed in randomized clinical trials of BS, and candidate items for a composite measure. The ultimate goal of the group is to develop a validated and widely accepted core set of outcomes and outcome measures for use in clinical trials in BS.

### Progression of coronary disease in a behcet's patient in remission [^1128ZcWH]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Behcet's disease is characterised histologically by vasculitis. In the heart this can lead to aneurysm formation and thrombosis. There is also accelerated atherosclerosis, the mechanism of which is unclear. Patients with external disease from Behcet's disease are treated with immunosuppression. The authors present a case of aneurysmal disease in a Behcet's patient. This case demonstrates that coronary disease may progress in Behcet's patients despite external disease remission. Therefore, internal disease may progress in the absence of external symptoms when immunosuppressive therapy is usually stopped. This case raises the issue of whether immunosuppression should be continued in Behcet's patients with coronary disease to suppress disease progression or included in a treatment protocol for patients with Behcet's related coronary disease. Clinical trials on the use of immunosuppressive therapy for coronary disease in Behcet's patients are needed.

Although both have hallmark symptoms (ocular and vestibuloauditory inflammation in Cogan syndrome and aphthous ulcers in Behcet syndrome), neither has confirmatory diagnostic testing. Delayed diagnosis can result in poor outcomes. In both syndromes, large vessel arterial inflammation may result in severe morbidity and mortality. Treatment strategies in both syndromes vary based on organ system involvement and severity of manifestations. In this article, the epidemiology, proposed pathogenesis, manifestations, and the most current treatment paradigms for these syndromes are reviewed.

### Behçet's disease in children, an overview [^115cnsfb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disease involving primarily the oral and genital mucosa, skin and eyes. BD includes a vasculitis affecting all sizes of vessels but prominently the veins; thus, it was recently reclassified as variable type. The onset is insidious with peak age of onset in young adulthood (25–30 years), but also occasionally in children before the age of 16 years in 4 to 26% of cases. As observed in autoinflammatory diseases, BD attacks are recurrent and self-limited. Neurological and ocular involvement cause substantial functional limitation and handicaps. Large vessel vasculitis is the leading cause of death, typically by multiple thrombosis or pulmonary arteritis. Even though it is considered as a single entity, the clinical presentation of BD is heterogeneous and may vary according to sex, country of residence and age of onset. The underlying mechanisms causing the disease are still unclear and could combine both autoinflammation and autoimmunity. The recent discovery of A20 protein haploinsufficiency as a cause of autosomal dominant "Behçet-like" disease strongly supports the idea that the full spectrum of disorders meeting criteria for BD cannot be related to a single mechanism.

Regarding medical management for Behçet's syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of CNS involvement (evaluation), BAD/BSR 2024 guidelines recommend to take into account the following when diagnosing neuro-Behçet's:

- the typical parenchymal presentation in patients with suspected neuro-BS, namely subacute onset of brainstem syndrome, cerebral hemispheric syndrome, spinal cord syndrome or a combination of these, which can manifest through a multitude of signs/symptoms (such as ophthalmoplegia, cranial nerve deficit, speech impairment, hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, myelopathy, sphincter symptoms, headaches, meningoencephalitis, encephalopathy, seizures, cognitive impairment, behavioral changes), and its course (relapsing-remitting pattern or a primary or secondary progressive course)

- the nonparenchymal presentation in patients with suspected neuro-BS presenting with headaches and visual impairment secondary to intracranial hypertension, cerebral thrombophlebitis, cerebral vascular accident, arterial thrombosis, dissection or aneurysm, usually as a monophasic illness, although relapses can ensue

- neuro-BS can present as a combination of parenchymal and nonparenchymal forms.

### Behçet disease: new aspects [^115aqgq2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Behçet disease is currently considered an "autoinflammatory disease" triggered by infection and environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. Although the disease is characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers and ocular involvement, it can affect multiple organ systems. Complex aphthosis is characterized by recurrent oral and/or genital aphthous ulcers. It is important to evaluate the patient with complex aphthosis for Behçet disease and related systemic disorders. We discuss the etiopathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches for complex aphthosis and Behçet disease in light of the current literature.

### Behçet's disease: treatment of mucocutaneous lesions [^115cpHaY]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Oral and genital ulcers, and cutaneous vasculitic lesions are considered hallmarks of the disease, and often precede other manifestations. Mucocutaneous lesions figure prominently in the presentation and diagnosis. Therefore, their recognition may permit earlier diagnosis and treatment, with beneficial results for prognosis. This review overviews the current state of knowledge regarding the therapeutic approaches including local and systemic agents for the treatment of mucocutaneous lesions of BD.

### Behçet's disease beyond the criteria: insights from a tertiary centre in Turkey [^112AR37x]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There are no pathognomonic findings for diagnosing Behçet's disease (BD), the diagnosis relying primarily on clinical evaluation. We aimed to assess patients with BD based on two classification criteria the International Study Group (ISG) criteria and the International Criteria for Behçet's Disease (ICBD), both at diagnosis and throughout the disease, and to explore the characteristics of patients who do not meet the criteria but are clinically diagnosed with BD.

Methods

Patients with BD were identified from the Hacettepe University Vasculitis Research Centre database. Paediatric cases and those with incomplete clinical data were not included. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatments were assessed. The physician's clinical judgment determined the gold standard for diagnosis. The patients' fulfilment of the ISG and ICBD criteria was evaluated at diagnosis and during the follow-up.

Results

The study included 804 patients with BD (49.8% males). The mean age at diagnosis was 28.9 ± 10.4 years. At diagnosis, 52.6% of patients fulfilled the ISG criteria, and 81.0% met the ICBD criteria. During follow-up, these rates increased to 59.0% and 84.7%, respectively. Significant organ involvement (ocular, vascular, or neurological) was present in 47.9% of patients not meeting ISG criteria and 30.9% of those not meeting ICBD criteria. The use of at least one immunosuppressive agent was 48.5% and 38.2% in these groups, respectively.

Conclusions

According to various classification criteria, 15–40% of patients with BD do not meet established classification criteria at any point during follow-up, yet significant organ involvement remains prevalent. These findings highlight the limitations of strict criteria-based diagnosis and underscore the importance of clinical expertise in recognising and managing BD.

### Behcet's syndrome… [^111ARzuh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction THE COMPLEX of recurrent oral and genital ulcerations and hypopyon iritis was first proposed as a clinical entity by Halusi Behcet in 1937, 1 although it is thought by some that this disease was described as early as Hippocrates' Third Book of Endemic Diseases. 2Like most syndromes, with time the clinical concept has extended far beyond the original description. More recently the frequency and severity of involvement of the central nervous system in this syndrome has been emphasized. 3 The poor prognosis when this occurs and lack of a specific etiology have led to the empiric trial of adrenal steroids in treatment. In view of the rarity of Behcet's syndrome and the uncertainty as to the effectiveness of adrenal steroids in treating the neurologic complications, it would appear profitable to report all cases so treated. The following case illustrates the diagnostic difficulties encountered when neurologic disease is the. SIGEL N, LARSON R.

### Validation of the PEDiatric Behçet's disease classification criteria: an evidence-based approach [^111GpGrN]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this international effort was made to have a validated cohort of BD patients to which classification criteria could be applied to validate accuracy. The PEDBD criteria performed well, with very high specificity, but with lower sensitivity. The complexity of childhood BD suggests that genotyping (incorporating autoinflammatory diseases, BD mimics and HLA-type) combined with clinical features, disease clusters and ethnic variables are likely to ultimately yield the most accurate classification criteria, that would require further validation in larger prospective international cohorts.

### Clusters in paediatric Behçet's disease: a multicentre international study [^115Z5mbm]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, we have defined seven clusters in our multicentre PEDBD cohort highlighting the heterogeneity of disease manifestations. BD mainly presents with mucocutaneous manifestations in the paediatric population but has wide phenotypic clinical variability. Also, there are certain differences in clinical presentations between countries. Defining clusters in PEDBD may provide clues for understanding the aggregation of clinical manifestations, predicting outcomes and prognosis in individual patients. However, future research is needed to guide clinical practice and treatment algorithms. Further large-scale studies by analysing genetic and biological samples might shed light on the possible different pathogenetic pathways in these clusters.

### Clinical features and natural course of Behçet's disease in 661 cases: a multicentre study [^1134n7fe]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disease with unpredictable exacerbations and remissions. The natural course of BD is not fully known.

Objectives

We aimed retrospectively to determine the occurrence of the symptoms in chronological order. We also evaluated the influence of the treatment and follow-up on the clinical severity and tried to identify the factors determining severe organ involvement.

Methods

Six hundred and sixty-one patients were involved in this multicentre study. The symptoms of the disease were recorded retrospectively in the time order of the manifestations in each patient.

Results

Oral ulcers were the most common manifestation (100%), followed by genital ulcers (85.3%), papulopustular lesions (55.4%), erythema nodosum (44.2%), skin pathergy reaction (37.8%), and articular (33.4%) and ocular involvement (29.2%). Oral ulcers were the most common onset manifestation (88.7%). The mean ± SD duration between the onset symptom and the fulfilment of diagnostic criteria was calculated to be 4.3 ± 5.7 years. The clinical severity score was significantly increased in the noncompliant treatment group compared with the compliant group with the passage of time (P < 0.001). The frequency of ocular involvement and genital ulcers was significantly higher in patients whose disease onset was at < 40 years. Genital ulcers, ocular involvement, papulopustular lesions, thrombophlebitis and skin pathergy reaction were found to be significantly more frequent in males.

Conclusions

Mucocutaneous lesions are the hallmarks of the disease, and especially oral ulcers precede other manifestations. The increase in clinical severity score is more pronounced in patients without regular treatment and follow-up. Male sex and a younger age at onset are associated with more severe disease.

### Validation of the classification criteria commonly used in Korea and a modified set of preliminary criteria for Behçet's disease: a multi-center study [^113tH6Ru]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Recently we have proposed a modified set of criteria to settle the questions raised regarding the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for Behçet's disease (BD). The aim of the present study was to validate the two pre-existing criteria sets commonly used in Korea, the ISG criteria and the criteria of the Behçet's Disease Research Committee of Japan (Japanese criteria), as well as the proposed modified criteria.

Methods

The study population included 155 consecutive patients with BD and 170 controls with non-Behçet's rheumatic diseases. Detailed data for all of the subjects were recorded prospectively by the participating physicians on a standard form that listed the clinical features of BD. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each set of the criteria were measured.

Results

Of the three criteria sets employed, the modified criteria were the most accurate, with an accuracy of 96.3%. The ISG criteria often failed to classify the following patients with BD: patients with only oral and genital ulcerations, certain patients with intestinal ulcerations, patients who did not manifest oral ulcerations, and patients with acute disease but fewer than three recurrent oral ulceration relapses in a 1-year period. The Japanese criteria also failed to categorize the following patients with BD: patients with oral and genital ulcerations, and patients with oral ulcerations, skin lesions, and a positive pathergy reaction. In addition, the Japanese criteria misclassified some of the control subjects with non-Behçet's uveitis as having BD.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that there are some points that need to be reconsidered in the clinical application of the two pre-existing sets of criteria. Although the modified criteria were the most accurate, further validation studies will be required in other ethnic populations.

### Validation of the PEDiatric Behçet's disease classification criteria: an evidence-based approach [^11472WgL]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Initially, ISG were defined 'diagnostic', but in 1989 (V International Conference on BD) they were proposed as 'classification' criteria, because they were considered more 'useful in ensuring the uniformity of groups of patients for clinical and laboratory studies and for teaching purposes'. Diagnostic criteria are a set of signs, symptoms and tests used in order to make the diagnosis, and are consequently broad, so as to represent the disease heterogeneity, and to identify a large number of patients with the disease (high sensitivity). On the other hand, classification criteria are standardized definitions used to identify homogeneous cohorts for clinical studies, selecting the majority of patients with characteristic disease features and not the entire group of patients with the diagnosis (high specificity).

In pediatrics, BD presentation is heterogeneous and the differential diagnosis challenging. Therefore, highly specific classification criteria are mandatory to stratify patients for clinical trials and research purposes.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree of consensus on BD classification in patients enrolled in a large international registry, and to evaluate the performance of the ISG, ICBD and PEDBD classification criteria in a cohort of internationally validated pediatric BD, through an international clinicians/researchers (expert)-based consensus process.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^112zBVsg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The task force devised 33 statements including 4 overarching principles. Major themes endorse the importance of acknowledging that pediatric Behcet disease can be a challenging diagnosis, as symptoms emerge gradually over time. It's crucial to consider genetic or genomic conditions in the differential diagnosis, especially for patients with early-onset or family history of Behcet-like disease. In these cases, evaluation should include genetic testing using NGS-based autoinflammatory gene panels or WES or WGS as well as screening (immune-phenotyping) for immune dysregulation, and disease-associated comorbidities. Monoclonal Anti TNFs should be used as a first-line biologic treatment for patients with severe major organ such as ocular, neuro, vascular and GI involvement. Close monitoring for disease progression and complications is essential as well as the access to specialized, multidisciplinary care at referral centers.

Conclusion: These recommendations represent state-of-the-art knowledge based on published data and expert opinion to guide diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and monitoring of patients with pediatric BD, and to standardize and improve care, quality of life and disease outcomes.
