## Question

Spider bite treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage and treat a spider bite. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate first aid and when to activate emergency services. Then, I should verify species-specific management for widow and recluse spiders. Next, I will examine wound care, analgesia, and tetanus. After that, I need to check indications for antibiotics and antivenom. Finally, I should consider special populations, prevention, and a concise decision algorithm, while double-checking controversies and evidence gaps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the universal first aid steps and thresholds for escalation. Clean the wound with soap and water, apply a cold compress or ice for pain and swelling, elevate the limb, and avoid tourniquets, incision, suction, or tight constrictive bands; activate EMS for any systemic symptoms such as difficulty breathing, muscle rigidity, confusion, or severe uncontrolled pain, and seek medical care if pain extends beyond the site, becomes severe and unresponsive to OTC analgesics, or if an open wound develops [^116v2wkH] [^111AUTAi] [^116qPyXd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about species identification. I should confirm that most suspected "spider bites" are actually infections or other dermatoses, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion for MRSA and other SSTIs, especially when the history is vague or the lesion is purulent; definitive spider identification is rarely available, and misdiagnosis is common outside endemic areas, so I must document the wound carefully and consider the differential before labeling a case as loxoscelism or latrodectism [^116xE6w9] [^114fNnuR] [^113u4Zvj].

> Now, for widow spider envenomation (latrodectism), I should verify the core management. Supportive care with analgesics and benzodiazepines for muscle spasm is first-line; antivenom is reserved for severe or refractory cases given limited availability and hypersensitivity risk, and randomized data show mixed results with faster pain relief in some studies but no clear superiority over placebo in others, so I need to weigh benefit against anaphylaxis risk and local access before using antivenom [^113GcSxq] [^114xo48g] [^113tozoK].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric and special presentations. Children can deteriorate quickly with respiratory compromise or autonomic instability; case reports describe severe presentations requiring intubation and ICU care, and rare complications like priapism have responded to antivenom when standard measures failed, so I should maintain a lower threshold for escalation and consider early antivenom in significant pediatric latrodectism after discussing risks with caregivers [^111gZr6N] [^115TuAQC] [^117Pido7].

> For brown recluse envenomation (loxoscelism), I need to ensure I'm not over-treating. Conservative local wound care with rest, ice, elevation, and tetanus prophylaxis is recommended; most lesions heal without aggressive intervention, and routine antibiotics, dapsone, hyperbaric oxygen, and early excision lack robust evidence and are not routinely advised, though I should monitor closely for evolving necrosis or secondary infection [^114js5Qv] [^113QyN8g] [^115fqKb1].

> I should double-check systemic loxoscelism red flags. Hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy can occur, sometimes with a bimodal time course; if suspected, I need CBC, LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, CK, renal function, and coagulation studies, and consider early hematology or toxicology consultation, as case reports describe successful use of corticosteroids, IVIG, or even therapeutic plasma exchange for refractory hemolysis, though these are based on limited evidence [^113ENjSY] [^114X6xQy] [^117Bi7r5] [^112Duepb].

> Next, I should review wound care principles that apply across scenarios. Copious irrigation, careful debridement of devitalized tissue, and moist dressings are foundational; negative pressure may help for large debrided areas, and early mobilization with occupational therapy reduces stiffness and dysfunction, especially for hand and digit injuries; I need to ensure tetanus status is updated and avoid unnecessary closure of high-risk wounds [^113Xs2eU] [^116o2TNV] [^114js5Qv].

> Let me consider analgesia and supportive measures. OTC acetaminophen and NSAIDs are reasonable first-line for mild pain; topical lidocaine can be offered for intact skin to reduce local pain, and ice or cold packs are appropriate; for moderate to severe pain, opioids may be necessary, and benzodiazepines help with muscle spasm in latrodectism; I should reassess pain frequently and escalate as needed while monitoring for respiratory depression and sedation [^112fTmBk] [^113GcSxq].

> I need to check when antibiotics are indicated. Routine prophylaxis is not recommended for uncomplicated spider bites; antibiotics are appropriate when there are signs of secondary infection such as purulence, spreading erythema, fever, or systemic toxicity, or in immunocompromised hosts, and amoxicillin–clavulanate is a reasonable first choice given typical polymicrobial flora in bite-related infections; I should align with SSTI guidelines and tailor to culture results if obtained [^111uLr8V] [^114VXaF2].

> But wait, what about antivenom for recluse bites. I initially thought antivenom might be broadly available, but I should correct that: there is no FDA-approved antivenom for Loxosceles in the United States, and although animal data suggest potential benefit, human evidence is lacking; therefore, antivenom is not a standard therapy for brown recluse envenomation here, and management remains supportive and expectant [^114uPUNq].

> I will now examine special populations and settings. Children are at higher risk for systemic toxicity and may require closer observation; pregnancy complicates antibiotic choices, so I should avoid tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones when possible and consult obstetrics; in wilderness or resource-limited settings, prioritize evacuation to facilities with antivenom access when relevant and ensure adequate hydration and pain control during transport [^113ENjSY] [^111uLr8V] [^116kdRX9].

> Prevention deserves attention too. I should counsel on protective clothing, shaking out shoes and clothing, using gloves when handling stored items, and applying DEET-containing repellents in endemic areas; reducing clutter and sealing entry points around homes decreases harborage, and public education can curb misattribution of skin lesions to spiders [^11211sU6] [^113aoMeX].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway and sanity-check it against guidelines. If the patient is unstable or has systemic symptoms, activate EMS and provide ABCs with early analgesia; if stable with local findings, perform wound care, ice, elevation, tetanus update, and analgesia, then reassess at 24–48 hours for progression or infection; if widow features predominate, use benzodiazepines and opioids, and consider antivenom for severe or refractory cases; if recluse features predominate, continue conservative care and monitor for hemolysis or renal injury; if infection is suspected, start appropriate antibiotics and arrange follow-up or referral as indicated [^116v2wkH] [^114js5Qv] [^113GcSxq].

> Finally, I should confirm key controversies and evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. Many diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in spider envenomation rest on low-quality evidence and expert consensus; misdiagnosis is common, antivenom for latrodectism has mixed RCT results, and no specific therapy has proven benefit for loxoscelism, so shared decision-making, careful documentation, and follow-up are essential while we individualize care to severity, geography, and patient risk [^113u4Zvj] [^114xo48g] [^113tozoK] [^113QyN8g].

Spider bites are managed with **supportive care** and **species-specific treatment**. Clean the wound with soap and water, apply a cold compress, and elevate the limb to reduce swelling and pain [^116nD31e]. Use acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain, and benzodiazepines for muscle spasms in widow bites [^113GcSxq]. Antivenom is reserved for severe widow envenomation or systemic symptoms [^113GcSxq]. Brown recluse bites require local wound care and tetanus prophylaxis; avoid routine antibiotics unless infection is present [^114js5Qv]. Seek medical attention for severe pain, spreading erythema, necrosis, or systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or muscle cramps [^116v2wkH].

---

## General first aid and supportive care

- **Wound cleaning**: Clean the bite area thoroughly with soap and water to reduce the risk of secondary infection [^116nD31e].

- **Cold compress**: Apply a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a cloth to the bite site for 10–15 minutes at a time to reduce swelling, pain, and inflammation [^116nD31e].

- **Elevation**: Elevate the affected limb above heart level to minimize swelling and discomfort [^116nD31e].

- **Pain management**: Over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for pain relief [^112fTmBk].

- **Tetanus prophylaxis**: Ensure tetanus vaccination status is up to date, especially if the wound is deep or contaminated [^114js5Qv].

---

## Specific treatment based on spider species

### Black widow spider (Latrodectus spp.)

- **Muscle spasms**: Benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam) are effective in managing severe muscle spasms and rigidity associated with black widow envenomation [^113GcSxq].

- **Antivenom**: Antivenom is reserved for severe cases with refractory symptoms, significant systemic toxicity, or when pain and muscle spasms are unresponsive to standard therapy [^113GcSxq] [^113aoMeX].

- **Supportive care**: Intravenous fluids, oxygen therapy, and close monitoring of vital signs are essential in moderate to severe cases [^116kdRX9] [^114xa7bx].

---

### Brown recluse spider (Loxosceles spp.)

- **Local wound care**: Conservative management with local wound care, regular cleansing, and debridement of necrotic tissue is recommended [^114js5Qv].

- **Tetanus prophylaxis**: Ensure tetanus vaccination status is updated [^114js5Qv].

- **Antibiotics**: Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended unless there is clear evidence of secondary bacterial infection [^notfound].

- **Surgical intervention**: Surgical excision or grafting may be considered in cases of extensive necrosis or delayed healing, but routine early surgical intervention is not recommended [^113QyN8g].

---

## Indications for medical evaluation and hospitalization

Medical evaluation and possible hospitalization are indicated for:

- **Severe pain**: Uncontrolled pain despite analgesic use [^116v2wkH].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, hypertension, or difficulty breathing [^116v2wkH].

- **Progressive local reaction**: Rapidly spreading erythema, swelling, or necrosis [^notfound].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Increased risk of complications and infection [^notfound].

- **Uncertain diagnosis**: Suspicion of other serious conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis or severe allergic reactions [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies include:

- **Protective clothing**: Wear long sleeves, pants, and gloves when working outdoors or in areas where spiders are common [^11211sU6].

- **Environmental control**: Regularly clean and declutter living spaces, seal cracks and crevices, and use insecticides to reduce spider habitats [^notfound].

- **Public education**: Educate communities about spider identification, bite symptoms, and appropriate first aid measures [^116v2wkH].

---

## Common misconceptions and myths

Several misconceptions surround spider bite treatment, including:

- **Antibiotics**: Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection [^notfound].

- **Surgical intervention**: Early surgical excision is not recommended and may worsen outcomes [^113QyN8g].

- **Electric shock therapy**: There is no scientific evidence supporting the use of electric shock therapy for spider bites [^113QyN8g].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Aspect** | **Black widow spider** | **Brown recluse spider** |
|-|-|-|
| First aid | - Clean wound <br/> - Cold compress <br/> - Elevation <br/> - Analgesics | - Clean wound <br/> - Cold compress <br/> - Elevation <br/> - Analgesics |
| Muscle spasms | Benzodiazepines | Not applicable |
| Antivenom | Severe cases only | Not applicable |
| Antibiotics | Only if infection present | Only if infection present |
| Surgical intervention | Not routine | Only if extensive necrosis |
| Hospitalization | Severe symptoms | Extensive necrosis or systemic symptoms |

---

Effective management of spider bites centers on **supportive care**, **species-specific treatment**, and **timely medical evaluation** when indicated. Most bites resolve with conservative measures, but severe envenomation requires targeted therapy and close monitoring.

Unlabelled

Necrotic arachnidism is the potential cutaneous reaction to spider bite venom. In the United States, members of 7 spider families may be responsible for envenomation sufficiently severe to warrant treatment. Characteristics of several spiders, in particular Loxosceles spiders, whose bite is toxic to humans are described, and diagnostic standards, preventive measures, and treatment options are reviewed. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2001;44:561–73.)

Learning Objective

After the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the characteristics of several different spider families endemic to the United States. Furthermore, this learning activity should aid in the prevention and diagnosis of spider bites as well as in the classification and treatment of specific bites.

### Best evidence topic report. are antibiotics indicated following human bites? [^115uMrnS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether antibiotics are indicated for human bites. Eighty nine papers were found using the reported search, of which two represent the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients with human bites to the hands, feet, and skin overlying joints or cartilaginous structures, and to all patients with bites that penetrate deeper than the epidermal layer.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^111AUTAi]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

First aid for spider and scorpion envenomation — Emergency activation and medical evaluation thresholds are specified, and analgesic options for scorpion stings are provided. "Emergency services should be called" if systemic symptoms develop after a bite or sting (1 C-EO), and a person "should seek medical care" if pain extends beyond the site, becomes severe and is not controlled, if an open wound develops, or if systemic symptoms occur (1 C-EO). For scorpion stings, "Over-the-counter acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents can be used to alleviate local pain", and, if the skin is intact, "topical lidocaine can be useful to relieve local pain", and "Ice can be useful for local pain relief" (each 2a C-LD).

### The global epidemiology, syndromic classification, management, and prevention of spider bites [^114fEbgc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2004). Low credibility.

Spiders are carnivorous arthropods that coexist with humans and ambush or ensnare prey. Unlike other arthropods, spiders rarely transmit communicable diseases, and play a critical role in the ecosystem by consuming other arthropods that frequently transmit human diseases, such as mosquitoes and flies. There are more than 30,000 species of spiders, most of which are venomous, but they cannot inflict serious bites due to delicate mouthparts and short fangs. The differential diagnosis of spider bites is extensive and includes other arthropod bites, skin infections, and exposure to chemical or physical agents. However, approximately 200 species from 20 genera of spiders worldwide can cause severe human envenomings, with dermonecrosis, systemic toxicity, and death. Spider bites can usually be prevented by simple personal and domestic measures. Early species identification and specific management may help prevent serious sequelae of spider bites.

This article discusses the epidemiology, prevention, clinical features, first aid and medical treatment of venomous bites by snakes, lizards, and spiders; stings by fish, jellyfish, echinoderms, and insects; and poisoning by fish and molluscs, in all parts of the world. Of these envenoming and poisonings, snake bite causes the greatest burden of human suffering, killing 46,000 people each year in India alone and more than 100,000 worldwide and resulting in physical handicap in many survivors. Specific antidotes (antivenoms/antivenins) are available to treat envenoming by many of these taxa but supply and distribution is inadequate in many tropical developing countries.

### Arthropod envenomation in north America [^1172BG21]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Arthropods (phylum Arthopoda) account for a higher percentage of morbidity and mortality to humans than do mammalian bites, snake bites, or marine envenomation. They are ubiquitous in domestic dwellings, caves, and campsites and in wilderness settings such as deserts, forests, and lakes. Although arthropods are most intrusive during warmer months, many are active throughout the winter, particularly indoors. Arthropods are also nocturnal and often bite unsuspecting victims while they are sleeping. Encounters with humans are generally defensive, accidental, or reactive. An individual stung by an insect or bitten by an arachnid may experience pain and local swelling, an anaphylactic reaction, or life-threatening toxicity. This review discusses the clinical presentation and latest treatment recommendations for bites and stings from spiders, scorpions, bees, ants, ticks and centipedes of North America.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^115T9KeM]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Spider and scorpion envenomation — Spider bites and scorpion stings are common occurrences in the United States. Although many are benign and cause only self-limited local symptoms, some species of spider such as the black widow and brown recluse and some species of scorpion, for example, the bark scorpion, can cause more severe localized and systemic symptoms. Bites from black widow and related spiders (genus Latrodectus) cause severe crampy pain, muscle rigidity, diaphoresis, and hypertension; although a rash is sometimes observed around the bite site, widow spider bites do not cause local tissue injury. Bites from brown recluse and related spiders (genus Loxosceles) cause painful ulcerated wounds that progress over days to weeks, sometimes associated with hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis. Bark scorpion (Centruroides) stings cause severe localized pain and muscle cramping that may impair breathing in children. First aid treatment involves localized wound care and over-the-counter analgesics for pain. Data on first aid treatment are limited, with few randomized trials of first aid interventions. Advanced medical care is sometimes needed for the more severe symptoms. These guidelines are relevant to spider bites and scorpion stings occurring in the United States and Canada.

### Venomous bites, stings, and poisoning: an update [^11211sU6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

This article discusses the epidemiology, prevention, clinical features, and treatment of venomous bites by snakes, lizards, and spiders; stings by fish, jellyfish, echinoderms, insects, and scorpions; and poisoning by ingestion of fish, turtles, and shellfish. Invertebrate stings cause fatalities by anaphylaxis, secondary to acquired hypersensitivity (Hymenoptera, such as bees, wasps, and ants; and jellyfish), and by direct envenoming (scorpions, spiders, jellyfish, and echinoderms). Simple preventive techniques, such as wearing protective clothing, using a flashlight at night, and excluding venomous animals from sleeping quarters, are of paramount importance to reduce the risk of venomous bites and stings.

### Spider bite [^113u4Zvj]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Spiders are a source of intrigue and fear, and several myths exist about their medical effects. Many people believe that bites from various spider species cause necrotic ulceration, despite evidence that most suspected cases of necrotic arachnidism are caused by something other than a spider bite. Latrodectism and loxoscelism are the most important clinical syndromes resulting from spider bite. Latrodectism results from bites by widow spiders (Latrodectus spp) and causes local, regional, or generalised pain associated with non-specific symptoms and autonomic effects. Loxoscelism is caused by Loxosceles spp, and the cutaneous form manifests as pain and erythema that can develop into a necrotic ulcer. Systemic loxoscelism is characterised by intravascular haemolysis and renal failure on occasion. Other important spiders include the Australian funnel-web spider (Atrax spp and Hadronyche spp) and the armed spider (Phoneutria spp) from Brazil. Antivenoms are an important treatment for spider envenomation but have been less successful than have those for snake envenomation, with concerns about their effectiveness for both latrodectism and loxoscelism.

### Surgical treatment of a Brown recluse spider bite: a case study and literature review [^117PMU9T]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Spider bite envenomation can cause local, constitutional, and/or systemic symptoms. The present case study reports on 5 years of follow-up for a "probable" brown recluse spider bite of the foot and ankle that was refractory to conservative treatment and was subsequently treated with surgery. The present case study reports the atypical occurrence of long-term peripheral neuropathy after necrotic arachnidism induced by "probable" brown recluse (Loxosceles recluse) envenomation, in a 46-year-old male. The state of published data suggests to minimize inflammation and tissue necrosis, prevent bacterial superinfection, and control pain levels. For patients with long-term peripheral neuropathy refractory to conservative therapy, surgical intervention may further improve their symptoms.

### Envenomations: an overview of clinical toxinology for the primary care physician [^113oxgXj]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

About 4,000 to 6,000 venomous snakebites occur each year in the United States. Although these envenomations (also known as envenomings) are rarely fatal, about 70 percent require antivenom therapy. Few evidence-based guidelines are available for the management of envenomation. Antivenom therapy is the cornerstone of management for hemorrhagic or coagulopathic envenomation from pit vipers (with or without paralytic features), and for paralytic envenomation from coral snakes. Early intubation and ventilation may be required after bites from pit vipers whose venoms contain presynaptic neurotoxins. Although relatively controversial, antivenom therapy seems to be effective for the management of severe envenomation from widow spiders. Conversely, little evidence supports any specific management strategy for necrotic envenomation from recluse spiders. Cytotoxic fish stings, cnidarian stings, and traumatic penetrative envenomation by stingrays are typically managed symptomatically. Private collection of nonnative venomous animals in the United States is another source of medical risk.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^116CyXAz]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Spider and scorpion envenomation — supportive evidence summary: Many bites and stings result only in local symptoms, but severe manifestations can compromise breathing or cause muscle injury and kidney failure, requiring treatment in a health care setting. A randomized trial of 130 adults with scorpion stings in Turkey "showed pain improvement with application of topical 5% lidocaine, administration of intravenous acetaminophen, or topical application of ice; the greatest pain reduction was from lidocaine". A similar Turkish study found "slightly better pain relief in 106 adult patients who received intravenous acetaminophen or intravenous dexketoprofen… compared with topical 5% lidocaine or placebo". Intravenous acetaminophen and NSAIDs "are not available in the first aid setting". Overall, these studies "provide indirect evidence for the use of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, topical lidocaine, and ice for scorpion stings" in the United States, and "no studies assessing the use of these therapies for spider bites were found".

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^116kdRX9]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Toxins and Environmental — Bites and Envenomation treatment and interventions — In prehospital care, consider an IV fluid bolus (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) 20 mL/kg up to 2 liters and consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation for the hypotensive patient; if seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline. For envenomations including black widow spider, bark scorpions, crotalid snakes (rattlesnake, copperhead) and coral snakes, consider transport to a hospital that has access to antivenom, if feasible. For jellyfish, generally scrape off remaining tentacles or nematocysts and immerse the affected body part in hot water (113°F/45°C); vinegar may be used to reduce pain due to deactivation of nematocysts except for certain species such as Physalia that may have nematocysts activated by vinegar, and vinegar may also activate sea nettle nematocysts and is not recommended after this exposure. For lionfish, scorpionfish, and stingray injuries, immerse the affected body part in hot water to reduce pain associated with the toxin, and provide adequate analgesia per the Pain Management Guideline.

### Arthropod bites and stings [^113aoMeX]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Arthropods, including insects and arachnids, significantly affect humans as vectors for infectious diseases. Arthropod bites and stings commonly cause minor, usually self-limited reactions; however, some species are associated with more severe complications. Spider bites are rarely life-threatening. There are two medically relevant spiders in the United States. Widow spider (Latrodectus) envenomation can cause muscle spasm and severe pain that should be treated with analgesics and benzodiazepines. Antivenom is not widely available in the United States but may be considered for severe, refractory cases. Recluse spider (Loxosceles) bites are often overdiagnosed, should be treated supportively, and only rarely cause skin necrosis. Centruroides scorpions are the only medically relevant genus in the United States. Envenomation causes neuromuscular and autonomic dysfunction, which should be treated with analgesics, benzodiazepines, supportive care, and, in severe cases, antivenom. Hymenoptera, specifically bees, wasps, hornets, and fire ants, account for the most arthropod-related deaths in humans, most commonly by severe allergic reactions to envenomation. In severe cases, patients are treated with analgesia, local wound care, and systemic glucocorticoids. Diptera include flies and mosquitoes. The direct effects of their bites are usually minor and treated symptomatically; however, they are vectors for numerous infectious diseases. Arthropod bite and sting prevention strategies include avoiding high-risk areas, covering exposed skin, and wearing permethrin-impregnated clothing. N, N-diethyl- m-toluamide (DEET) 20% to 50% is the most studied and widely recommended insect repellant.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^113Kxgfx]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Research questions

The IBG identified the following research questions:

How commonly do insect bites present in general practices?
How do patients present to general practices, that is, what consultation modes are used?
What symptoms and signs of bites are recorded?
What treatment options are used?
How does insect bite-related flucloxacillin prescribing compare to practice-level flucloxacillin prescribing?

Design

Our project adopted QI methodsas these allow us to describe, critique, and potentially change current GPC practice. The first step in this approach is to define what we are trying to accomplish in order to generate ideas for change improvement. Our questions, therefore, focus on describing the size of the problem and the scope of current practice.

Sampling frame

We explored the affected population and current service provision by GPCs in our IBG practices. This was a convenience sample of 10 practices, members of the RCGP OD group in England and Wales.

Sample

Identifying all patients presenting with insect bites between the dates of 1st April to 30th September 2021, inclusive, by searching online all consultations using the words "insect bites" coded in participating practices. To identify consultations, inclusion criteria were: first consultation of any person, of any age, presenting with a presumed insect bite to general practices, even if they had contacted a different health care provider previously. Patients with insect bite reactions due to spiders or ticks (arthropods) were included if not Lyme disease, that is, managed as insect bites. It was accepted that it cannot be known whether some "bite" reactions might include vegetation injuries, for example, hogweed contact, but data were cleaned to exclude known stings and other causes.

Exclusion criteria: not first GPC consultations, stings, and illnesses GPCs diagnosed as not due to insect bites, that is, Lyme disease and a patient with shingles. Presentations to out-of-hours (OOH) or walk-in centres were excluded.

### Arthropod bites [^117HppRP]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The phylum Arthropoda includes arachnids and insects. Although their bites typically cause only local reactions, some species are venomous or transmit disease. The two medically important spiders in the United States are widow spiders (Latrodectus), the bite of which causes intense muscle spasms, and the brown recluse (Loxosceles), which may cause skin necrosis. Widow bites usually respond to narcotics, benzodiazepines, or, when necessary, antivenom. Most recluse bites resolve uneventfully without aggressive therapy and require only wound care and minor debridement. Tick bites can transmit diseases only after prolonged attachment to the host. Treatment of clothing with permethrin and proper tick removal greatly reduce the risk of infection. Ticks of medical importance in the United States include the black-legged tick, the Lone Star tick, and the American dog tick. The prophylactic use of a single dose of doxycycline for Lyme disease may be justified in high-risk areas of the country when an attached, engorged black-legged tick is removed. Bites from fleas, bedbugs, biting flies, and mosquitoes present as nonspecific pruritic pink papules, but the history and location of the bite can assist with diagnosis. Flea bites are usually on ankles, whereas mosquito bites are on exposed skin, and chigger bites tend to be along the sock and belt lines. Antihistamines are usually the only treatment required for insect bites; however, severe mosquito reactions (skeeter syndrome) may require prednisone. Applying insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) 10% to 35% or picaridin 20% is the best method for preventing bites.

### Bite injuries in a connected world: a call for global consensus on clinical and public health action [^112Cb45S]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

This edition of the Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open journal explores a problem as ancient as human history itself: the consequences of human–human and human–animal interactions. It describes the pattern and outcomes of bite injuries in a major German city which reflect patterns in most urban settings. Although common, animal bites rarely attract attention unless they are sensational enough to make the news, such as rare shark or crocodile attacks.

Although more commonly associated with domesticated animals, bite injury sources vary between geographical locations and range from arthropods, rodents, reptiles to exotic animals. The incidence ranges from 50 to 200 per 100,000 population per year and is associated with a significant social, economic, and psychological burden.

In the US alone, animal bites have been estimated to cost US$13 billion annually. Apart from the financial burden, evidence shows that animal bites can leave long-lasting psychological effects. Although not clearly explored in adults, children have notably been found to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, which may eventually reflect onto their caregivers. This is another potential area of research that may delve into the broader range of effects that bite injuries portend.

Being among the most common causes for bite-related injuries and the dramatic impact of rabies and envenomation, dog and snake bites have garnered significant attention and research with well-established protocols in management.

Each region of the world has its own unique challenges owing to the variety of predominant fauna, such as shark and spider bites in Australia, camel, falcon, and exotic animal bites in the Middle East, and monkey bites in Southeast Asia. These unique patterns of bites bring with them their own challenges requiring dedicated research into the causes, prevention, and treatment. As population movements increase globally, these local problems will have wider-reaching consequences. As such, the exchange of knowledge across regions would help in improving awareness and even mitigation. Furthermore, the development, use, and distribution of novel technologies in the prevention of animal attacks can impact the epidemiology of these injuries. For example, the use of shark listening stations, drones, and SMART drumlines in Australia has reduced human-shark interactions.

What would be beneficial would be the creation of a global registry of bite-related injuries with global standards for reporting akin to the WHO rabies registry. This may help with the exchange of knowledge across regions and the formulation of standardized prevention and treatment protocols.

### Complications and outcomes of Brown recluse spider bites in children [^113ENjSY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Brown recluse spider bites may cause severe local and systemic morbidity, but data regarding morbidity in children are limited. This study reviewed inpatient medical records (n = 26; 10 years) with a discharge diagnosis of "spider bite" from a tertiary pediatric hospital. The majority (85%) of children had an inflammatory response accompanying necrosis, usually with signs of secondary cellulitis (77%). Hemolytic anemia (50%), rhabdomyolysis (27%), and acute renal failure (12%) were the most prevalent systemic effects. Hemolytic anemia was bimodal in distribution relative to the time-of-onset of the bite (early, 2.2 ± 0.4; late, 6.9 ± 1.5 days postbite, respectively; p = 0.004). Although no fatalities occurred in the population, 65% of children had major morbidity, including wound complications requiring surgical care and acute orbital compartment syndrome. The findings emphasize the importance of anticipatory patient/family education for outpatients and careful monitoring for systemic morbidity in inpatients. Timely and appropriate supportive care should yield favorable outcomes in most cases.

### Brown recluse spider bites to the head: three cases and a review [^114Td4bN]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Consequences of envenomation from the bite of a brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa) range from mild itching to death. The bite of this spider causes the most severe form of arthropod-induced tissue necrosis. These bites pose several challenges to the clinician in that diagnosis can be difficult, systemic manifestations can occur, and healing can be resistant to conventional measures. Bites to the head and neck-particularly the face-are uncommon, and they have not been widely reported in the otolaryngology literature. As experts in facial soft tissue, otolaryngologists and facial plastic surgeons should be able to recognize and treat these lesions. Because no laboratory test is available to identify the cause of symptoms in these cases, the diagnosis is made clinically. Early intervention can make a significant difference in cosmetic outcome, so a high index of suspicion is warranted. Local wound care includes rest, ice, compression, and elevation of the affected part of the body. Drug therapy with dapsone may limit the severity of the bite and prevent complications. Because some bites cause systemic loxoscelism, clinicians should be familiar with its manifestations. When necrosis occurs despite adequate medical treatment, reconstructive procedures should be delayed until healing is complete. We report 3 cases of brown recluse spider bites to the head. These cases illustrate the broad spectrum of the disease course, and they highlight the therapeutic challenges that these lesions pose.

### Common spider bites [^117UgPS4]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

There are more than 30,000 species of spiders, most of which cannot inflict serious bites to humans because of their delicate mouthparts and impotent or prey-specific venoms. However, some spiders produce toxic venoms that can cause skin lesions, systemic illnesses, and neurotoxicity. One of the more common bites is inflicted by the widow spiders (Latrodectus species). A bite from a widow spider results in muscle spasms and rigidity starting at the bite site within 30 minutes to two hours. Another common bite is inflicted by the recluse spider (Loxosceles species). Most bites from these spiders occur early in the morning and are initially painless. These bites usually progress to ulcerating dermonecrosis at the bite site. Spider bites can be prevented by simple measures. Early species identification and specific management can prevent most serious sequelae of spider bites.

### Loxoscelism: old obstacles, new directions [^114uPUNq]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Loxosceles spiders have a worldwide distribution and are considered one of the most medically important groups of spiders. Envenomation (loxoscelism) can result in dermonecrosis and, less commonly, a systemic illness that can be fatal. The mechanism of venom action is multifactorial and incompletely understood. The characteristic dermonecrotic lesion results from the direct effects of the venom on the cellular and basal membrane components, as well as the extracellular matrix. The initial interaction between the venom and tissues causes complement activation, migration of polymorphic neutrophils, liberation of proteolytic enzymes, cytokine and chemokine release, platelet aggregation, and blood flow alterations that result in edema and ischemia, with development of necrosis. There is no definitive treatment for loxoscelism. However, animal model studies suggest the potential value of specific antivenom to decrease lesion size and limit systemic illness even when such administration is delayed.

### Dapsone use in dermatology [^115fqKb1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Indications and Dosage

Dapsone has off-label uses for a wide array of conditions owing to its safety profile suitable for long-term treatment. Chronic skin diseases with elevated levels of neutrophils and/or eosinophils can benefit from dapsone therapy due to its action on these cells. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved dapsone for the treatment of leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis, its off-label use is extensive, encompassing both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy approaches, (Tables 1, 2). Use of dapsone for recluse spider bites (loxoscelism) in the United States is no longer recommended. Support for off-label applications varies, drawing from a spectrum of evidence including randomized controlled trials, case reports, and retrospective chart reviews (Tables 1, 2).

Table 1
Uses of dapsone in various dermatologic conditions as a first-line agent (both on- and off-label) with recommended dosing and notable findings from the source. Level of evidence for the use of dapsone is described by the type of study/source listed.

### Brown recluse spider envenomation: dermatologic application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^115yVofC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Envenomation from the brown recluse (Loxosceles recluse) spider commonly proceed on one of three clinical pathways. The majority of bites (90%) result in nothing more than a local reaction. They are essentially self-limiting, require little if any attention, and resolve spontaneously. A great majority of the remaining bites will produce necrotic ulcerations of various sizes and dimensions, with systemic sequela ranging from fever to hemolysis and kidney failure. Finally, and in the most rare cases, the patient will succumb a fatal systemic reaction. Current therapeutic options for these wounds remain controversial and include the following: local care, corticosteroids, dapsone, and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy. This article will review the application of HBO therapy for patients who are envenomated by brown recluse spiders. Information for this manuscript was derived from multiple MEDLINE searches as well as searches of the National Baromedical Service's hyperbaric specialty literature collection.

### Loxoscelism [^115R2BSd]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Loxoscelism (bites by spiders of the genus Loxosceles) is the only proven arachnological cause of dermonecrosis. Although Loxosceles spiders can be found worldwide, their distribution is heavily concentrated in the Western Hemisphere, particularly the tropical urban regions of South America. Although Loxosceles bites are usually mild, they may ulcerate or cause more severe, systemic reactions. These injuries mostly are due to sphingomyelinase D in the spider venom. There is no proven effective therapy for Loxosceles bites, although many therapies are reported in the literature.

### A randomized controlled trial of trypsin to treat Brown recluse spider bites in Guinea pigs [^116uDMLx]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Brown recluse spider bites result in necrotic skin lesions for which there is no known antidote. Since venom toxins are proteins, a proteolytic enzyme like trypsin might be effective in reducing toxicity. The aim of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial of trypsin to treat brown recluse spider bites in guinea pigs. Subjects were 18 female guinea pigs. Anesthesia for injections was inhaled isoflurane. Analgesia was 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine twice a day as needed. Intervention was intradermal injection of 30 μg of brown recluse venom (Spider Pharm, Yarnell, AZ). Immediately after envenomation, subjects were randomized to two groups of nine: trypsin 10 μg in 1 mL normal saline and 1 mL of normal saline. The primary outcome was lesion area over a 10-day time period. Statistical analysis was performed with repeated measures ANOVA. Mean lesion area was smaller but not statistically different in the placebo group. Maximum lesion size occurred at day 4 in both groups, when lesion area was 76.1 ± 108.2 mm(2) in the placebo group and 149.7 ± 127.3 mm(2) in the treatment group. P value was 0.15 for placebo vs. treatment. This study did not establish a role for trypsin as a treatment for brown recluse spider bites in a guinea pig model.

### Randomized controlled trial of intravenous antivenom versus placebo for latrodectism: the second redback antivenom evaluation (RAVE-II) study [^114xo48g]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Latrodectism is the most important spider envenomation syndrome worldwide. There remains considerable controversy over antivenom treatment. We aimed to investigate whether antivenom resulted in resolution of pain and systemic effects in patients with latrodectism who received standardized analgesia.

Methods

In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of redback spider antivenom for latrodectism, 224 patients (> 7 years) with a redback spider bite and severe pain, with or without systemic effects, were randomized to receive normal saline solution (placebo) or antivenom after receiving standardized analgesia. The primary outcome was a clinically significant reduction in pain 2 hours after trial medication compared with baseline. A second primary outcome for the subgroup with systemic features of envenomation was resolution of systemic features at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes were improved pain at 4 and 24 hours, resolution of systemic features at 4 hours, administration of opioid analgesics or unblinded antivenom after 2 hours, and adverse reactions.

Results

Two hours after treatment, 26 of 112 patients (23%) from the placebo arm had a clinically significant improvement in pain versus 38 of 112 (34%) from the antivenom arm (difference in favor of antivenom 10.7%; 95% confidence interval -1.1% to 22.6%; p = 0.10). Systemic effects resolved after 2 hours in 9 of 41 patients (22%) in the placebo arm and 9 of 35 (26%) in the antivenom arm (difference 3.8%; 95% confidence interval -15% to 23%; p = 0.79). There was no significant difference in any secondary outcome between antivenom and placebo. Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4 of 112 patients (3.6%) receiving antivenom.

Conclusion

The addition of antivenom to standardized analgesia in patients with latrodectism did not significantly improve pain or systemic effects.

### Suspected Brown recluse envenomation: a case report and review of different treatment modalities [^1159Duwh]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The Loxosceles reclusa, commonly known as the brown recluse spider, is responsible for virtually all cases of spider bites leading to a significant necrosis.

Case Report

We report the case of a 72-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department complaining of back pain, weakness, and diarrhea. The patient stated that he sustained a bug bite 1 week before presenting to the hospital. His wound was necrotizing in nature and after an exhaustive work-up, the most likely etiology was found to be envenomation by a brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa.

Conclusion

This is an endemic cause of a necrotizing wound bite in areas of the Midwestern and Southern United States, but it is rarely reported in the Northeast.

### Recognition and successful treatment of priapism and suspected black widow spider bite with antivenin [^115TuAQC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Priapism, although uncommon in preadolescent children, is considered a true emergency. Envenomation by a black widow spider bite has been reported to induce priapism as a manifestation of its toxicity. Early recognition and timely administration of antivenin have been reported to be effective in relieving priapism. Clinicians who care for children need to be aware of this unusual presentation. The diagnosis is traditionally from either direct observation of a spider bite or capture of a spider. We report a case of a previously healthy 2-year-old boy who presented with severe irritability, leg cramps, and stomach ache. The diagnosis of a likely black widow spider envenomation was made on the basis of clinical suspicion and suggestive physical findings in absence of demonstrated exposure. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and successful resolution of symptoms with administration of antivenin and supportive care.

### Managing snakebite [^1123C7qv]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Examination

Bite site — Look for fang marks, retained fangs, bleeding, swelling, bruising, discoloration, and blisters. Fang marks do not confirm snakebite since bites by lizards, fish, rodents, large spiders, and some insects and thorns also leave paired punctures. Their absence does not preclude envenoming, as many snake species produce faint or undetectable bites. Raised vertical, red, tender streaks on the bitten limb suggest lymphangitis. Regional lymph nodes may be enlarged and tender with bruised overlying skin. Note any tourniquets, ligatures, wound incisions or cauterisation, and local traditional remedies as these may lead to specific complications requiring management. For instance, tourniquets and ligatures, if left on for long, can cause severe local damage including ischaemia, necrosis, and gangrene. Similarly, incisions and local applications can lead to local bacterial infections, sepsis, and tetanus.

Systemic examination — Look for signs of coagulopathy such as sub-conjunctival, retinal, nasal, and gingivobuccal bleeds, ecchymoses and internal haemorrhage (such as intracranial, pericardial, pleural, and retroperitoneal). Assess extraocular movements, bulbar function, and muscle power. Look for ptosis, muscle tenderness, and jaw stiffness. Jaw stiffness is a prominent but often overlooked feature in sea snake envenoming that, unlike trismus, can be reduced by sustained pressure on the lower jaw.

Identifying snake species — Occasionally patients or accompanying persons may bring the killed snake for identification or have a picture of it. A herpetologist can be consulted to help identify the species. Identification of snakes based on description by victims or recognition from pictures is often unreliable. Identifying biting-species helps avoid unnecessary antivenom in patients bitten by non-venomous snakes or by species whose venoms are not neutralised by available products. It can help select appropriate antivenom in countries with products specific against single species and anticipate clinical progression. However, delaying emergency treatment until the species is identified is unnecessary.

Knowledge of local snake species, comparison of clinical effects in the patient against established species-specific syndromes, and consideration of the circumstances and timing of the incident can help infer likely biting species. This approach is widely used to guide treatment with polyspecific antivenom in endemic areas of Africa and Asia. Snake identification tests based on venom antigen are valuable research tools but are currently unavailable for routine clinical use except in Australia.

### Emergency department death from systemic loxoscelism [^114X6xQy]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Systemic loxoscelism is a constitutional illness resulting from the bite of the brown recluse spider. In severe form, it may cause hemolysis, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. More rarely, it may result in death. We report an unusual case of systemic loxoscelism resulting in death less than one day following envenomation. We also discuss screening algorithms and contemporary management of systemic loxoscelism.

### Arthropod bites and stings [^113Qwvhu]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on spider envenomation:

- **Definition**: Spider bites in the US are primarily caused by widow spider (Latrodectus) and brown recluse spider (Loxosceles). Less common spiders include Australian funnel web spiders (Atrax and Hadronyche species) found in eastern Australia, armed or wandering spiders (Phoneutria species) found in South America, hobo spiders (Tegenaria agrestis) found in Europe and in the Pacific Northwest of the US, and the noble false widow (Steatoda nobilis) found in England and Ireland.
- **Pathophysiology**: The venom of the widow spide contains α-latrotoxin, which affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle cramping and hypertension. The venom of the brown recluse spider contains multiple active components, including sphingomyelinase D hyaluronidase, and other enzymes, resulting in local tissue necrosis and, rarely, systemic effects.
- **Epidemiology**: There were 142,886 spider bites treated in emergency departments in the US from 2001 to 2010.
- **Disease course**: Most spider bites cause only localized skin injury, such as burning pain, swelling, erythema, and bleeding, typically on the upper oextremities. Fang marks and a hemorrhagic vesicle may also be observed. Skin necrosis may develop by 72 hours. Systemic symptoms include fever, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, pruritus, malaise, and musculoskeletal pain. Systemic toxicity leading to intravascular hemolytic anemia, coagulopathy, and acute renal failure is rare.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most spider bites are mild and resolve with supportive care. Systemic toxicity and mortality are rare.

### A novel approach for the treatment of spider veins [^116o3moQ]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Currently, there are two widely used methods for the management of spider veins.

The older method using sclerosing agents is well established among physicians. A new method using lasers is becoming more common with variable success depending on vessel size, body region, and laser type. Both methods treat these lesions with a variable success rate.

In order to effectively sclerose veins, the sclerosant must cause total endothelial destruction, which produces thrombosis, eventual fibroses, and vessel disappearance. Each class of sclerosants produces this effect with different and highly variable patterns of efficacy, potency, and complications. All sclerosants represent a compromise between efficacy and toxicity.

Despite 150 years of unregulated human experimentation encompassing an enormous range of more or less toxic agents, the "perfect sclerosant", complication free and 100% effective, has not been discovered.

With sclerotherapy, clearance after one treatment varies from 50% to 84% in 70%-80% of patients. In order to achieve full clearance, up to six treatments may be needed. There are numerous complications and adverse reactions associated with both sclerosants and lasers.

Pain may be very pronounced with a sclerosant if it is injected into perivascular tissue. Extravasation necrosis after the use of commonly recommended concentrations represents a leading disadvantage associated with sclerosant use. Neovascularization (matting) and treatment failures probably occur at the same rate in all type of sclerosants with equal potency. Hyperpigmentation is reported to be a major drawback occurring in up to 30% of patients. Allergies and anaphylaxis varies between 0.01% and 0.9%. Deep venous thromboses and pulmonary emboli are rare, occurring most often in patients who are not ambulatory and receive inappropriate compression or have hypercoagulable states. There have been five reported cases of anaphylactic shock leading to death.

### Extreme pain from Brown recluse spider bites: model for cytokine-driven pain [^116uSNrr]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Bites from the brown recluse spider (BRS) can cause extreme pain. We propose cytokine release as a cause of the discomfort and a central mechanism through glial cell upregulation to explain measured pain levels and time course.

Observations

Twenty-three BRS bites were scored at a probable or documented level clinically, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to confirm the presence of BRS venom. The mean (SD) pain level in these cases 24 hours after the spider bite was severe: 6.74 (2.75) on a scale of 0 to 10. Narcotics may be needed to provide relief in some cases. The difference in pain level by anatomic region was not significant. Escalation observed in 22 of 23 cases, increasing from low/none to extreme within 24 hours, is consistent with a cytokine pain pattern, in which pain increases concomitantly with a temporal increase of inflammatory cytokines.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings in BRS bites support the hypothesis of cytokine release in inflammatory pain. A larger series is needed to confirm the findings reported here. The extreme pain from many BRS bites motivates us to find better prevention and treatment techniques.

### Generalization of beneficial exposure effects to untreated stimuli from another fear category [^113UJGDZ]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

While exposure can lead to reductions in fear and avoidance, observations of therapeutic effects of exposure have usually been restricted to the treated context. Further, the few studies investigating generalization of exposure effects to untreated stimuli have so far been limited to stimuli sharing the same stimulus class and/or stimuli with high perceptual similarity. As such, it has been demonstrated that exposure-induced fear reduction does in fact generalize to different specimens of the treated stimulus. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that a generalization of therapeutic effects during exposure is possible across stimuli which belong to the same category yet differ perceptually from each other. In this regard, we provided initial evidence that subjects with fear of spiders and cockroaches who underwent an exposure for one phobic stimulus (spiders), whereas the other phobic stimulus (cockroaches) was left untreated, exhibited attenuated fear to both spiders and cockroaches. Beneficial effects of exposure for treated (spiders) and untreated (cockroaches) stimuli were observable at the behavioral, subjective, and physiological level. Perceptual similarities between treated and untreated stimuli and a set of shared cognitive distortions related to common animal fears may account for the previous findings. However, findings are thus far limited to untreated stimuli sharing the same stimulus category and bearing some degree of perceptual feature overlap with the treated stimuli.

Building on this previous research, the current study was therefore designed to test whether the observed exposure treatment generalization can also be demonstrated for untreated stimuli which do not share any perceptual resemblance and belong to a different fear category. Given that fears and phobias related to spiders and heights are relatively common in the general population, fear of spiders and heights were considered to be appropriate candidates for examining exposure generalization across different stimulus categories (animal vs. natural environment). To this end, subjects with both, fear of spiders and heights received an exposure treatment for their spider fear, while leaving their fear of heights untreated. Generalization of treatment effects to the untreated fear was determined after exposure therapy and compared to a waiting control group receiving no exposure. Observable generalization effects were expected to occur at various fear response levels, including avoidance behavior, subjective fear, and self-reported symptoms.

### "Spider bite" lesions are usually diagnosed as skin and soft-tissue infections [^116xE6w9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Many people seek medical attention for skin lesions and other conditions they attribute to spider bites. Prior experience suggests that many of these lesions have alternate causes, especially infections with community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).

Objectives

This study determined the percentage of emergency department (ED) patients reporting a "spider bite" who received a clinical diagnosis of spider bite by their physician vs. other etiologies, and if the diagnoses correlated with demographic risk factors for developing CA-MRSA infections.

Methods

ED patients who reported that their condition was caused by a "spider bite" were prospectively enrolled in an anonymous, voluntary survey regarding details of their illness and demographic information. Discharge diagnoses were also collected and categorized as: spider bite, bite from other animal (including unknown arthropod), infection, or other diagnosis.

Results

There were 182 patients enrolled over 23 months. Seven patients (3.8%) were diagnosed with actual spider bites, 9 patients (4.9%) with bites from other animals, 156 patients (85.7%) with infections, and 6 patients (3.3%) were given other diagnoses. Four patients were given concurrent diagnoses in two categories, and 8 (4.4%) did not have the diagnosis recorded on the data collection instrument. No statistically significant associations were found between the patients' diagnostic categories and the demographic risk factors for CA-MRSA assessed.

Conclusion

ED patients reporting a "spider bite" were most frequently diagnosed with skin and soft-tissue infections. Clinically confirmed spider bites were rare, and were caused by black widow spiders when the species could be identified.

### Histopathology aiding diagnosis of viscerocutaneous loxoscelism in a nonendemic region [^116gfmxZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Viscerocutaneous loxoscelism is a rare syndrome caused by brown recluse spider envenomation. In addition to the cutaneous manifestation of a necrotic wound, it can present with systemic symptoms, including acute hemolytic anemia, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and even death. The Loxosceles reclusa is responsible for most cases of loxoscelism in the United States. Diagnosis and management of viscerocutaneous loxoscelism can pose challenges because of the often undetected initial bite and limited studies on treatment. We report a delayed diagnosis of fulminant viscerocutaneous loxoscelism in a nonendemic region supported by histopathology.

### Local cutaneous arachnidism: a report of three cases and their management [^116br9hx]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Bites from Loxosceles spiders can cause few symptoms to gangrenous skin necrosis or even death. To date, the treatment of the violin spider bite is largely unsatisfactory. Although no specific therapy exists, it has been suggested that heparin, steroids, dapsone, experimental antivenin and/or surgical excision may be beneficial. Three rare cases of suspected spider bite and their surgical treatment are reported. On the basis of geographical area, anamnesis and clinical symptoms, we suppose Loxoceles rufescens responsible for these bites.

The staff were amazing. They were compassionate, kind and supportive. Not only to me but also to my wife, keeping her up to date on my condition and enabling her to visit me or speak to me when she could not be there. I cannot remember everything that happened, or unfortunately, everyone that looked after me, while in ICU. But I do remember how caring everyone was. One doctor even held my hand when I was at my lowest, that act of kindness was very reassuring and I will never forget that gesture. They looked after me and made me feel that nothing was too much trouble even though I felt a burden.

With the help of expert colleagues they were able to diagnose me with Mediterranean Spotted Fever from a tick bite and gave me the treatment I needed.

After 5 days in ICU and a further 4 days on a ward, I was allowed home. I am still recovering but should get back to normal thanks to the fantastic, professional and caring service I received from the NHS.

If you ever get bitten by an insect, either here or abroad, do not dismiss it. Insect bites can cause as many problems as spider or snake bites which you may take more seriously. If you feel unwell or the bite starts to get red make sure you seek medical advice. If after starting antibiotics you feel no better or worse go back and see your GP.

While it is very easy to complain I felt compelled to put pen to paper and say what absolutely fantastic treatment I received both from my GP and everybody at the hospital. The NHS is a wonderful institution with some amazing people that deserve to be recognised. No one wants to be critically ill but it is reassuring to know that we have some outstanding individuals that are dedicated to making you well again and look after you when you need it. I would not be here today without the wonderful medical team and I cannot thank them enough.

### Clinical issues in the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of anthrax [^114r4s71]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Cutaneous Anthrax

Seven confirmed and four suspected cases of cutaneous anthrax were identified during the 2001 outbreak. Skin trauma was not associated with these cases of cutaneous anthrax. Exposure to contaminated mail was the apparent source of infection in all patients. The incubation period after exposure ranged from 1 to10 days. The initial symptom was often a pruritic papule resembling an insect bite. The papules vesiculated, with some becoming hemorrhagic. The vesicles ruptured to form depressed ulcers, often with local edema, ultimately forming dry eschars. These stages occur regardless of antibiotic therapy. The differential diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax includes brown recluse spider bite, ecthyma, ulceroglandular tularemia, accidental vaccinia, and necrotic herpes simplex. Cutaneous anthrax is painless, does not include rash, and results in a black eschar. Patients with cutaneous anthrax may have fever, extensive edema, and other systemic signs.

Gram stain and culture of the lesion are recommended; however, prior antibiotic treatment rapidly renders the infected site culture-negative for B. anthracis. Serologic testing and punch biopsy at the edge of the lesion, examined by silver staining and immunohistochemical testing, are useful in diagnosing cutaneous anthrax in patients who have received antibiotic therapy.

Clinical recognition and diagnosis issues needing further consideration and research include rapid, reliable, and readily available detection methods (e.g. PCR and antigen detection); education and ready access to information for clinicians regarding anthrax clinical features and risk stratification; recognition of anthrax in children; and the role of serologic testing in the diagnosis and management of both inhalational and cutaneous anthrax.

Toxins and Environmental — Bites and Envenomation patient safety — Do not apply tourniquets, tight Ace/crepe bandage, or constricting bands above or below the site; do not incise and/or suction the wound to remove toxin; and do not apply cold packs or immerse the extremity in ice water. EMS clinicians should not try to capture the marine or terrestrial animal or insect. If the organism has been killed, many dead insect, marine, or fanged animals can continue to bite or sting with venom and should be safely placed in a hard sided and closed container for future identification. A patient may still have an imbedded stinger, tooth, nematocyst, or barb that may continue to deliver toxin if left imbedded; consider safe removal without squeezing the toxin delivery apparatus.

### Antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis for snake-bitten patients [^115AnqCf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering the frequently isolated bacteria in snakebite-related infection, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, or a third-generation cephalosporin are the most appropriate antibiotics for empiric therapy. After identification of the causal bacteria, antibiotics must be changed to narrower spectrum drugs based on the microbiological results. Little information is available to guide the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy or the value of combination drug therapy. Available data report antibiotic use for 7 to 10 days with several proposed therapeutic regimens without documented advantages of one strategy over another.

In conclusion, the study by Bonilla-Aldana et al.accurately shows the prevalence and microbiological patterns of snakebite-related infections. On the basis of the international literature, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of routinely administered prophylactic treatment. Nevertheless, empiric antibiotics can be used in targeted cases with high suspicion of infection, mainly those with necrosis or local signs suggestive of cellulitis. The most appropriate empiric antibiotics are piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, or a third-generation cephalosporin. First-line AMC should no longer be considered because it is ineffective against most bacteria involved in snakebite-related infection. Once the microbiological results are available, deescalation is necessary to provide the narrowest spectrum drug active against the responsible microorganism. Finally, efficiently managing snakebite envenoming requires not only safe and effective antivenom but also appropriate antibiotics, both of which are, unfortunately, often unavailable in poor and disadvantaged regions.

### Reports of presumptive Brown recluse spider bites reinforce improbable diagnosis in regions of north America where the spider is not endemic [^114fNnuR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Envenomations by the brown recluse spider have been reported throughout North America, despite the fact that the spider's range is limited to the South and central Midwest of the United States. Several of these medical reports have originated from regions of nonendemicity where the spider has never or rarely been documented and brown recluse spider populations are unknown. In most of these reports, no spider is positively identified in association with the dermonecrotic wound, and diagnosis has been based on clinical examination findings. Considering the extreme rarity of brown recluse spiders in areas of nonendemicity, the diagnosis of a presumptive bite is a misdiagnosis that reinforces the assumption that brown recluse spiders are common local etiologic agents of necrosis. There are many medical conditions of diverse origin that have been misdiagnosed as brown recluse spider bites, some of which can be fatal or debilitating. Physicians' awareness of these conditions will increase diagnostic accuracy in areas of North America where bites from brown recluse spiders are improbable.

### Rare case of dermonecrosis caused by a recluse spider bite in Europe [^112jrhC3]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Spider poisoning is rare in Europe, with very few reported cases in the literature. Recluse spider (genus Loxosceles) bites may lead to cutaneous and systemic manifestations known as loxoscelism. We report the second known case of spider bite poisoning in Malta caused by Loxosceles rufescens (Mediterranean recluse spider). A young adult female presented with localised erythema and pain on her left thigh after a witnessed spider bite. Over a few days, the area developed features of dermonecrosis together with systemic symptoms, including fever, fatigue and a generalised erythematous eruption. She was managed by a multidisciplinary team and the systemic symptoms resolved within 6days, while the skin lesion healed with scarring within 2months. A recluse spider bite should be considered in patients with dermonecrosis. Although spider bite poisoning is uncommon in Europe, it is important to diagnose and manage it appropriately since it could lead to potentially serious sequelae.

### Snakebite-associated infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pcXiu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The prevalence of snakebite-associated infections is high, primarily due to M. morganii, and should be taken into account when selecting the most adequate empirical therapy. Most patients presenting with snakebite infection require surgical intervention. Rational use of antimicrobials is recommended and should guide initial empirical treatment. In light of the present results, snakebites warrant further microbiological study for the isolation and identification of bacteria in all cases to confirm or rule out an associated infection. Finally, the importance of monitoring infection in snake-bitten patients is of note.

### A US perspective of symptomatic latrodectus spp. envenomation and treatment: a national poison data system review [^115LMniZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Black widow spider (Latrodectus spp.) envenomation remains the most clinically significant spider envenomation in the US. The syndrome is characterized by painful muscle rigidity and autonomic disturbances. Treatment has ranged from symptomatic care to administration of specific antivenom. Declining antivenom availability and, possibly, the fear of hypersensitivity allergic reactions, has limited antivenom use in the US.

Objective

To describe Latrodectus spp. exposures and the subsequent treatment reported to US poison centers; the secondary objective was to identify factors associated with shorter duration of symptoms (< 24 hours).

Methods

All Latrodectus spp. exposures reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008, were reviewed. Cases with at least minor clinical effects due to Latrodectus spp. exposure were extracted. Descriptive statistics were generated. The probability that symptom duration was less than 24 hours was modeled, using logistic regression.

Results

From 2000 through 2008, a total of 23,409 Latrodectus spp. exposures were reported in 47 states; 9872 cases had at least minor clinical effects and were included in the subsequent analysis. Exposures peaked in September and fell to a nadir in January and February. Fifty-eight percent of the cases involved males, and the mean (SD) age was 31.5 (17.4) years. Sixty-five percent of the patients had minor clinical effects, 33.5% had moderate effects, 1.4% had major effects, and there were no deaths. Antivenom use was associated with symptom duration of less than 24 hours in moderate and major outcome groups. There was no evidence of shorter symptom duration in patients who received benzodiazepines or calcium. Adverse drug reactions were more common in patients receiving benzodiazepines and antivenom.

Conclusions

In the US, most symptomatic Latrodectus spp. exposures reported to the NPDS are minor. Few patients receive antivenom, although antivenom is associated with shorter symptom duration among moderate and major outcomes.

### Use of antivenin to treat priapism after a black widow spider bite [^117Pido7]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Black widow spider envenomation (BWSE) is commonly associated with severe abdominal pain, muscle cramping, and hypertension. Treatment is primarily symptomatic with the use of opiates and benzodiazepines. Priapism is a complication of BWSE that has only rarely been reported. We describe a 17-month-old male who developed priapism after known BWSE. His priapism did not respond to opiates or benzodiazepines, and he was treated with black widow spider antivenin. Complete detumescence followed within several hours. The patient required no additional opiates for pain and was discharged from the hospital the following day. The patient's rapid improvement after antivenin suggests its efficacy in treating BWSE-associated priapism.

### Wolf spider envenomation [^1145wDiG]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Although wolf spider venom has been implicated in necrotic arachnidism without acceptably documented verification, limited, prospectively collected data demonstrate a lack of cutaneous necrosis. The infrequent nature of exposure and inherent difficulty in confirming wolf spider bites in humans makes it challenging to study such envenomations. We present the case of a 20 year-old man with confirmed exposure to the wolf spider who developed cutaneous erythema with ulceration following the bite. There was no evidence of skin necrosis. He was treated with aggressive wound care and systemic antibiotics for wound infection, with subsequent resolution of symptoms. This case adds to the limited knowledge regarding wolf spider envenomations and describes the clinical effects and management of wolf spider envenomation.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111uLr8V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infected animal bite–related wounds — treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

### 36th international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine: brussels, belgium. 15–18 March 2016 [^112BX91i]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 8 subjects participated in the study. All of the patients were males with an age range of 25–58 years (median: 47 years). In all eight cases the black widow spider identification was made via a description of the spider. The time of onset of pain ranged from 30 minutes after the sting to 4 hours (median: 1 hour). Of the eight patients, three were asymptomatic, three had leg pain and two patients had abdominal pain. One patient had nausea and vomiting (12%); the same patient had ptosis and sweating with neck rigidity and back pain (12%). Upon examination, most of the symptomatic patients had redness over the sting location with no signs of compartment or swelling. Patients with abdominal pain had a rigid abdomen and guarding that mimicked an acute abdomen. blood test includes white blood count, kidney function test, coagulation profile, and creatine kinase. The results were normal in seven patients; only one patient developed acute kidney injury although his kidney function returned to normal upon discharge. In the treatment, all symptomatic patients received analgesia depending on the physician's discretion. Three patients received calcium gluconate intravenously and reported no improvement in their symptoms. In addition, all patients received tetanus toxoid vaccine. Four of the patients required admission (50%), but they were all discharged with a mean hospital of stay of 3.75 days.

Conclusions

Envenomation by black widow is a complex syndrome that manifests itself in various ways and results in various outcomes. The syndrome is generally self-limited and antivenom treatment is rarely necessary. Patients with significant pain that does not improve should be admitted for observation and possible treatment with antivenom.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a highly purified equine F (ab) 2 antibody black widow spider antivenom [^115wSKbD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Black widow spider antivenom has never been tested in a randomized clinical trial, to our knowledge. We explore various efficacy measures for a novel F(ab)2 antivenom in patients with moderate to severe pain caused by black widow spider envenomation.

Methods

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial was conducted in 12 academic emergency departments. We included patients at least 10 years old with moderate to severe latrodectism. Subjects received either a single intravenous infusion of antivenom or placebo. Pain was assessed with the visual analog scale. The primary efficacy outcome was the difference in pre- and posttreatment visual analog scale score. Prospectively defined secondary outcomes included treatment failures and time to clinically important decrease in pain.

Results

Twenty-four subjects were enrolled between October 2005 and October 2006; 13 were randomized to antivenom and 11 to placebo. The median change in visual analog scale at 150 minutes posttreatment was -50.0 mm (Interquartile Range [IQR] -67, -41 mm) in the antivenom treatment group and -46.0 mm (IQR -51, 0 mm) in the placebo treatment group (P = 0.14). There were 7 treatment failures (64%; 95% confidence interval 35% to 92%) in the placebo group and 3 (23%; 95% confidence interval 0.2% to 46%) in the antivenom group (P = 0.06). The median time to a clinically important decrease in pain after treatment was shorter in the antivenom group compared with the placebo group (30 minutes [IQR 30, 60 minutes] versus 90 minutes [IQR 30, 90 minutes]; p = 0.03). No serious adverse events or deaths were reported.

Conclusion

Although the overall reduction in pain was similar for antivenom- and placebo-treated subjects, antivenom reduced pain more rapidly than placebo. No significant adverse events occurred in either group.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^11521twJ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Treatment — general considerations and decontamination: As with any potentially serious illness or injury in the field, care begins with an assessment of scene safety followed by a primary evaluation of the patient with interventions as needed to support airway, breathing, and circulation, and epinephrine should be given as soon as possible once anaphylaxis has been identified. Removal of the inciting allergen is appropriate in certain circumstances, such as immediately removing an insect stinger from the skin to prevent additional injection of venom (avoiding pressure, if possible, on the venom sac). Exposure to aerosolized, food-based allergens should be stopped by discontinuing on-site cooking of the associated food and, if feasible, distancing of the patient, and inducing vomiting for food-based allergens has not been proven effective and may delay treatment with epinephrine.

### The efficacy of antivenin latrodectus (black widow) equine immune F (ab') versus placebo in the treatment of latrodectism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial [^113tozoK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The antivenom currently available for treatment of systemic black widow envenomation (latrodectism) is composed of equine whole immunoglobin. Although considered effective, it has been associated with anaphylaxis and 2 reported fatalities. We test the efficacy and safety of new equine antivenom composed of purified F(ab') 2 antibody fragments.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 16 sites across the United States. Subjects aged 10 years or older with moderate to severe pain because of black widow spider envenomation received F(ab') 2 antivenom or placebo. The primary outcome measure was treatment failure, which was defined as failure to achieve and maintain clinically significant reduction in pain for 48 hours posttreatment. Secondary measures of pain intensity differences and summed pain intensity difference were computed. Adverse events were recorded.

Results

Sixty patients were treated (29 antivenom and 31 placebo). The mean age was 39 years and 68% were male. There were 15 treatment failures in the antivenom group and 24 in the placebo group (P = 0.019). Differences in pain intensity difference between groups were lower at each postbaseline point, and the mean summed pain intensity difference was greater for the antivenom group (difference 2,133; 95% confidence interval 177 to 4,090). No deaths or serious drug-related adverse events were detected.

Conclusion

The F(ab') 2 antivenom met the predefined primary outcome of reduced treatment failures. Secondary outcomes of pain intensity difference and summed pain intensity difference also supported efficacy. The rate of symptom improvement in the placebo group was higher than expected, which may be related to enrollment criteria or placebo effect.

### Therapeutic plasma exchange for refractory hemolysis after Brown recluse spider (loxosceles reclusa) envenomation [^117Bi7r5]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The brown recluse spider (BRS) (Loxosceles reclusa) envenomation can lead to multiple complications, including hemolysis. We present a case of refractory hemolysis after a BRS bite treated with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE).

Case Report

A 17-year-old female presented with fever, fatigue, and dyspnea. She was diagnosed with sepsis and received intravenous (IV) fluids, inotropic support, and antibiotics. On hospital day 1 she was noted to have skin lesion consistent with a BRS bite and developed hemolysis. Systemic loxoscelism with hemolysis was then suspected and methylprednisolone IV was initiated. She was discharged with a stable HGB on hospital day 3 on oral prednisolone. She was re-admitted 24 h later, with signs of worsening hemolysis. Methylprednisolone was restarted and she was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells. TPE was initiated due to the refractory hemolysis. Shortly after the TPE session, her clinical and laboratory status improved. She required no further transfusions and was discharged on a steroid taper.

Discussion

TPE is an extra-corporeal method to remove substances from the blood by separating plasma from cellular blood components and replacing it with physiologic fluids. TPE has been used for snake envenomation but there are no reports detailing its use for BRS envenomations. Improvement was associated with TPE initiation and may have been due to removal of complement components activated by the spider venom. This report suggests that TPE could be a possible treatment modality for systemic loxoscelism with refractory hemolysis due to BRS envenomation. Further investigation is warranted.

Option (Opt) means the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec) means a lack of pertinent evidence and unclear benefit–harm balance; clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Control and prevention of anthrax, Texas, USA, 2019 [^1144FA7f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Although an eschar is the cardinal sign of cutaneous anthrax, in its early stages, anthrax can manifest as a group of small vesicles that might be pruritic. The lesion might be surrounded by erythema and swelling but is usually painless. Lymphadenopathy can occur, and constitutional symptoms including fever and headache are also possible. Localized cutaneous anthrax can disseminate to become a systemic disease. Although a substantial portion (10%–40%) of patients with cutaneous anthrax would die if left untreated, most can recover with treatment. Meningitis is also a possible, and typically fatal, complication.

In the United States, cutaneous anthrax is decidedly rare: other causes of eschars and eschar-like lesions include poxvirus infections (e.g. cowpox, vaccinia, orf), rickettsial infections (e.g. scrub typhus and Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis), ulceroglandular tularemia, staphylococcal or streptococcal infections, and noninfectious causes such as insect or spider bites. Obtaining a good exposure history is key to determining the likelihood of various etiologies among the differential diagnoses and determining the best specimens to collect. Patients seeking care with an eschar or eschar-like lesion should be asked about recent exposure to dead or dying herbivores or biting flies in an anthrax enzootic area; recent animal bites or scratches; and recent contact with lagomorphs, rodents, fleas, ticks, and spiders.

Question 3: What treatment would be most appropriate for this patient?
A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months
B. Cephalexin for 10 days
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks

Answers:

A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months – Incorrect. Rifampin and isoniazid are more appropriate for the treatment of latent tuberculosis. While rifampin does have activity against some atypical mycobacterium, M chelonae is unlikely to respond well to this antibiotic combination.
B. Cephalexin for 10 days – Incorrect. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin with limited activity against atypical mycobacterium. It is more often used to target staphylococcal or streptococcal infections.
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks – Incorrect. Fluconazole is an antifungal agent that is not effective against mycobacterium species.
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months – Correct. Combination therapy with a macrolide antibiotic and tetracycline for a long-term period (at least 3 months) are appropriate to target M chelonae. Ideally, antibiotic treatment is based on specific susceptibilities if available. The use of doxycycline over other tetracyclines such as minocycline minimizes the risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions.
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks – Incorrect. Fluoroquinolones alone are inappropriate for the treatment of this atypical mycobacterium and would need to be combined with a macrolide or tetracycline to account for resistance.

### Silently suffering: a pediatric black widow spider envenomation [^111gZr6N]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Black widow spiders are distributed worldwide and, although rarely fatal, account for significant morbidity. Diagnosis can be challenging, and children are at risk of increased morbidity due to their small size.

Case Report

We present a case of a 3-year-old boy who was brought to our emergency department because of sudden ear pain followed by labored breathing, abdominal pain, refusal or inability to speak, and grunting respirations. A black widow spider bite was suspected based on additional history obtained, and the spider was found in his helmet, confirming the diagnosis. The patient had progressive respiratory distress and somnolence and was intubated and transferred to a local pediatric intensive care unit. Antivenom was not initially available and eventually declined by the family. The child received supportive care and recovered after several days. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? This case illustrates the potentially deadly effects a black widow envenomation could cause in a child, and that bite location can affect the constellation of symptoms. It is a reminder that toxins, including that of the black widow spider, should be on the differential for acute abdominal pain, especially with autonomic features.

### Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia secondary to a Brown recluse spider bite [^113dYi33]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A female in her 30s from Missouri with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with worsening fatigue, haematuria and back pain following a brown recluse spider bite. On admission, laboratory findings were significant for anaemia, leukocytosis, hyperbilirubinaemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low haptoglobin and a positive direct antiglobulin test. The working diagnosis was autoimmune haemolytic anaemia secondary to a brown recluse spider bite; a rare but serious haematologic complication associated with brown recluse spider bites. The patient required multiple red blood cell transfusions, high-dose corticosteroids and antibiotic therapy. Her condition improved with pharmacologic treatment, and she was discharged home with outpatient haematology follow-up. This case highlights the potential for systemic haemolysis in the setting of brown recluse spider bites and underscores the importance of early recognition and comprehensive management.

### The critical time period for administering antivenom: golden hours and missed opportunities [^117Rm8m3]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antivenom is widely accepted as an effective treatment for snake envenomation. This is despite very limited evidence supporting clinical effectiveness for major envenomation syndromes, and is mainly based on pre-clinical studies and observational studies without control groups.

Effectiveness Of Early Antivenom

Although antivenom exhibits efficacy by binding to snake toxins and preventing toxic injury in animals if pre-mixed with venom, this efficacy does not always translate to clinical effectiveness. There are many irreversible venom mediated effects that antivenom cannot neutralise or reverse, such as pre-synaptic neurotoxicity and myotoxicity. Fortunately, early antivenom appears to prevent some of these.

Practicalities Of Administering Antivenom Early

With good evidence that early antivenom prevents some envenomation syndromes, the time between bite and antivenom administration must be reduced. This requires improving the initial assessment of snakebite patients, and improving early decision making based on clinical effects.

Conclusion

Until there are improved, simplified, easy to use, rapid and inexpensive tests, whether available in the laboratory or preferably at the bedside that identify systemic envenomation, the key to early antivenom administration is early assessment and decision making based on systemic symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, headache and abdominal pain.

### Reversible myocarditis after spider bite [^111fVV5k]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Black widow spiders (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus) are poisonous spiders endemic in Turkey. Latrodectus bites may cause myocarditis with increased cardiac enzymes. We treated two men (aged 20 and 33 years) who had myocarditis after black spider bites with leucocytosis and elevated levels of troponin I, creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB fraction. Both patients had normal results on an ECG, and one patient had abnormal echocardiography with minimal left ventricular wall movement disorder. Both patients were hospitalised in the intensive care unit and treated with intravenous fluids, analgesics, spasmolytic drugs, tetanus prophylaxis and cardiac monitoring. The levels of troponin I, creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB fraction improved, and the patients were discharged home on the third and fifth hospital day without complications. Myocarditis after a Latrodectus bite is rare, but may be associated with serious complications. Therefore, in regions endemic with Latrodectus spiders, prudent treatment of spider bites may include cardiac evaluation and monitoring.

### Lyme disease masquerading as Brown recluse spider bite [^114mzNsm]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We report a case of Lyme disease with clinical features resembling those described from brown recluse spider bites. The most striking manifestation was a necrotic skin wound. Brown recluse spider bites may be overdiagnosed in some geographic regions. Tick bite and infection with Borrelia burgdorferi should be considered in the differential diagnosis of necrotic arachnidism in regions endemic for Lyme disease.

### Systemic loxoscelism leading to autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in a healthy young adult [^112Duepb]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

The brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa) is endemic to the southcentral Midwest and the Southern United States. A bite from a brown recluse spider may result in symptoms that range from local skin necrosis to systemic complications such as acute haemolytic anaemia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis and death. Although rare, systemic loxoscelism is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion that should be considered in a patient with acute autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. We describe a case of a young man with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia secondary to systemic loxoscelism successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^113y1EZQ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Large local reactions — clinical course and management — are usually IgE mediated, almost always self-limited, and rarely create serious health problems; patients with prior large local reactions often have recurrences, and up to 10% might eventually have a systemic reaction. For patients with large local reactions, it is optional to prescribe injectable epinephrine for use if a systemic reaction occurs in the future, most need only symptomatic care and are not candidates for testing for venom specific IgE or venom immunotherapy (VIT), although increasing evidence shows VIT significantly reduces the size and duration of large local reactions and might be useful in those with frequent unavoidable reactions and detectable venom specific IgE; the decision to give VIT must be weighed against added cost and potential inconvenience. Supportive care can include cold compresses, oral antihistamines, and oral analgesics; although many physicians use oral corticosteroids for large local reactions, definitive proof of efficacy is lacking, and antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection (eg, fever, chills, or sweats).

### Calculated decisions: antivenom dosing algorithm [^113wMwNg]. Emergency Medicine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Antivenom Dosage Calculator" for snake bite.

The Antivenom Dosing Algorithm is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients who have been bitten by pit vipers. This algorithm helps clinicians determine the appropriate dose of antivenom to administer based on the severity of the patient's symptoms and the type of creature involved. The clinical utility of this calculator is to provide a standardized approach to antivenom dosing, which can help reduce the risk of complications and improve patient outcomes.

The antivenom dosing algorithm is designed to determine the necessity of administering antivenom to a snakebite victim by evaluating two key criteria: signs of envenomation and indications for antivenom administration.

Inputs consist of:

- **Signs of envenomation**: This evaluates whether the victim exhibits specific symptoms such as swelling, redness, bleeding, and systemic issues like hypotension or neurotoxicity. Options here are "Yes" or "No".
- **Indications for antivenom**: This determines if there is a medical justification for antivenom action due to moderate or severe reactions, coagulation abnormalities, or other systemic signs. Again, options are "Yes" or "No".

The algorithm processes these inputs by examining combinations of conditions:

- If no signs of envenomation are observed, regardless of indications for antivenom, the output is: "Do not administer antivenom".
- If signs of envenomation are present but no specific indications for antivenom exist, the result remains: "Do not administer antivenom".
- If both signs of envenomation and indications for antivenom exist, the protocol advises: "Administer antivenom".

These conditions can be boiled down to a table for clearer understanding:

| **Signs of envenomation** | **Indications for antivenom** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|
| No | Yes or No | Do not administer antivenom |
| Yes | No | Do not administer antivenom |
| Yes | Yes | Administer antivenom |

By evaluating the presence or absence of symptoms and aligning them with clinical indications, this algorithm aids healthcare providers in making informed decisions quickly and effectively in the case of a snakebite. This ensures a balanced approach, minimizing unnecessary intervention while ensuring necessary treatment is not delayed.

Systemic antibiotics — Frostbite is not an inherently infection-prone injury and antibiotic administration specifically for preventing infection during or after frostbite injury is not supported by evidence; systemic antibiotics, either oral or parenteral, should be administered to patients with significant trauma, other potential infectious sources, or signs and symptoms of cellulitis or sepsis. Recommendation: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Evaluation and treatment of Brown recluse spider bites… [^113QyN8g]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Brown recluse spiders are known to cause necrotic skin reactions with their bite and often are blamed for cases of skin necrosis even in areas they do not inhabit. This can lead to misdiagnosis and delay in appropriate treatment for other conditions. Swanson and Vetter reviewed the available literature on the epidemiology, evaluation, and treatment of these bites. Brown recluse spiders are found in several areas of the United States, including southeastern Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, northern Georgia, and southern portions of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa. They are not endemic in the west, northeast, midatlantic, or coastal south. Other Loxosceles spiders exist in the southwest, although most ulcerating spider bites are caused by the brown recluse. Bites have been noted outside endemic areas, but these reports are questionable.

Reported spider bites often are caused by other arthropods, and only about one in 10 patients with a suspected spider bite submits a spider specimen. Furthermore, bites are uncommon even in homes with known infestation. Definitive diagnosis is made by confirmation of a bite and positive identification of the spider by an arachnologist; there are no laboratory tests available for clinical use. Ulcerating wounds have many possible causes, including infection, vascular disorders, neoplasm, and trauma. This extensive differential diagnosis, combined with the relative rarity of brown recluse bites and the difficulty of confirming a bite, should make physicians cautious in diagnosing a brown recluse envenomation. There are many proposed treatments for brown recluse bites, although in most cases the bites will heal without therapy. No randomized controlled trials have been performed.

The sulfone antibiotic dapsone often is recommended, although no prospective trials support its use for bites in humans. Other treatments include steroids, surgical excision, hyperbaric oxygen, local electrical shock, and antivenom; none has been proven effective for brown recluse bites. Because bites most often are self-limited, typical wound care is the best option in unconfirmed cases.
