## Question

is it appropriate to give prednisone for eczema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to give prednisone for eczema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard treatment hierarchy for atopic dermatitis and where, if anywhere, systemic corticosteroids fit. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about oral steroids, including any narrowly defined exceptions. Next, I will review efficacy and safety data, watching for rebound and long-term harms. After that, I must consider pediatric-specific guidance. Finally, I will reconcile regulatory labeling with real-world practice patterns and synthesize a practical recommendation with safeguards if prednisone is used at all.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care so I don't jump to conclusions. Atopic dermatitis management is stepwise: liberal daily emollients to repair the barrier; then topical anti-inflammatory therapy, primarily topical corticosteroids of appropriate potency with proactive or intermittent strategies; and steroid-sparing topicals such as calcineurin inhibitors for sensitive areas or maintenance, with systemic therapy reserved for moderate-to-severe disease refractory to optimized topical care, phototherapy, or targeted systemic agents, so prednisone, as a systemic corticosteroid, sits outside routine care and carries a different risk–benefit profile [^114xj2Qu] [^111Z5o2K] [^114nHgU2] [^116gbFE5] [^113P14o4].

> Now, I need to check what the major guidelines actually recommend about systemic corticosteroids. High-credibility European consensus and living guidelines uniformly discourage routine systemic corticosteroid use in atopic dermatitis, but allow for exceptional short-term "rescue" in acute flares, largely restricted to adults with severe disease; I initially thought this meant a categorical prohibition across all settings, but wait, the texts explicitly carve out rare, short-duration use in exceptional circumstances rather than a blanket ban [^114KmSet] [^114QAtwa].

> Next, I should review the consensus on what counts as an exception so I don't overgeneralize. The International Eczema Council reached agreement that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided, but may be used rarely as short-term rescue when no other viable options exist, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, for severe acute flares requiring immediate relief, around major life events, or in the most severe cases, with strong emphasis on limiting duration and planning a non-steroid long-term regimen [^113AYwQb] [^116CeFCp] [^113yRupp] [^1135RnSF].

> Hold on, let me verify the efficacy data before inferring that "rapid relief" translates into meaningful outcomes. The best head-to-head trial comparing prednisolone to ciclosporin in severe adult eczema was terminated early for safety and exacerbations, with stable remission achieved in only 1 of 21 on prednisolone, highlighting poor durability and frequent rebound after cessation; observational and expert consensus further warn of high flare rates upon withdrawal despite initial improvement [^117JZ6LE] [^113AYwQb].

> I will now examine safety, because short-term benefits can be outweighed by cumulative harms. Patients with eczema report substantial lifetime corticosteroid exposure and repeated oral courses, which drive cumulative risk; population data suggest increased osteoporotic fracture risk in atopic eczema, with oral corticosteroids contributing in a dose-dependent manner; and systemic steroids increase susceptibility to serious infections such as varicella and measles, which is especially relevant when vaccination status is incomplete or exposure risk is high [^114cATYK] [^notfound] [^112i6FFa].

> But wait, what about children and adolescents; is prednisone ever appropriate there? I initially assumed guidelines categorically prohibit oral corticosteroids in pediatric eczema; let me reconsider. IEC participants largely agreed they should never be used in children, but formal consensus was not reached; still, European guidelines emphasize that if considered at all, systemic steroids are largely restricted to severe adult disease, with pediatric use strongly discouraged due to risks such as growth suppression, infection, and metabolic effects, and the availability of safer alternatives like ciclosporin or targeted biologics in specialist hands [^113mAhvi] [^1156F5bs] [^114KmSet].

> Next, I should review and confirm that topicals remain appropriate and effective so we are not substituting prednisone for therapies with better risk–benefit. Topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors are strongly recommended as first-line anti-inflammatories with proactive strategies to prevent relapses, and updated adult and allergy guidelines endorse intermittent maintenance with medium potency agents and optimized application to frequently flaring sites, which supports staying topical rather than escalating to systemic prednisone in routine care [^116gbFE5] [^114nHgU2] [^1167Rb6v] [^115K3trQ].

> I should double-check labeling because clinicians sometimes cite it to justify practice. FDA listings provide prednisone dosing ranges for broad entities such as contact dermatitis and exfoliative dermatitis, but these are not disease-specific endorsements for atopic dermatitis management and do not supersede dermatology and allergy guideline recommendations that discourage routine systemic steroid use in eczema except as rare, short-term rescue [^112E3qA8] [^113aokPe] [^113rLNuo] [^114KmSet] [^114QAtwa].

> Let me consider the implementation gap, because practice often diverges from guidance. Despite consensus discouraging systemic steroids, they remain frequently prescribed in routine care due to familiarity, low cost, and rapid symptomatic relief in distressed patients, but expert groups explicitly aim to curb such overprescription and redirect clinicians toward guideline-concordant, steroid-sparing strategies and timely referral for systemic non-steroid options when needed [^115ahS9M] [^1135RnSF].

> If, after all that, prednisone is considered, I need to ensure strict safeguards. Under specialist supervision, use should be exceptional, short-term rescue ideally no more than about a week, with the daily dose not exceeding roughly 0.5 mg/kg and an immediate plan to bridge to phototherapy or safer systemic agents such as ciclosporin or targeted therapies; I almost said "1–2 weeks is standard", but wait, European guidance emphasizes up to one week in exceptional adult cases while IEC notes short-term use without a precise definition and cautions about lack of RCT-level dosing evidence, and infection precautions including varicella and measles exposure protocols should be reviewed alongside a written taper and relapse-prevention plan [^114KmSet] [^116Y33zD] [^1156F5bs] [^112i6FFa].

> Putting this together, prednisone is generally inappropriate for routine eczema treatment; it may be considered only as rare, short-term rescue in adults with severe atopic dermatitis during an acute flare and preferably as a bridge to steroid-sparing maintenance, while repeated or maintenance courses should be avoided and pediatric use is strongly discouraged, with care anchored instead in optimized emollients, topical anti-inflammatories, phototherapy, and indicated systemic non-steroid agents per current guidelines [^114QAtwa] [^114KmSet] [^113mAhvi] [^116gbFE5].

---

No, prednisone is **not appropriate** for routine eczema care [^113yRupp]. It is only for **short-term rescue** [^114QAtwa] in severe flares when other options are unavailable or as a bridge to safer systemic therapy. Prednisone is not for long-term use due to **rebound and adverse effects**; use topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or dupilumab for maintenance [^116Y33zD] [^115VUbDH] [^116wE947] [^1133bUzU].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus statements consistently **advise against routine use** of systemic corticosteroids [^113mAhvi], including prednisone, for eczema. The International Eczema Council (IEC) states that systemic corticosteroids should **generally be avoided** [^113yRupp] and considered only in exceptional circumstances — such as severe acute flares, when other options are unavailable, or as a short-term bridge to systemic therapies or phototherapy. The European guideline (EuroGuiDerm, 2025) similarly recommends systemic corticosteroids **only as rescue therapy** [^114QAtwa] for acute flares in patients with atopic dermatitis, emphasizing their limited role and prioritizing alternative treatments.

---

## Risks and adverse effects of prednisone in eczema management

Prednisone, like other systemic corticosteroids, carries **significant risks and adverse effects**, particularly with long-term or repeated use [^114KmSet]. These include:

- **Rebound flares**: Rapid recurrence or worsening of eczema symptoms upon discontinuation of prednisone, often more severe than the initial flare [^113yRupp].

- **Immunosuppression**: Increased susceptibility to infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections [^117CF1AN].

- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, weight gain, hypertension, and dyslipidemia [^112YcZPn].

- **Musculoskeletal effects**: Osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and increased risk of fractures.

- **Psychiatric effects**: Mood disturbances, anxiety, depression, and insomnia [^117CF1AN].

- **Dermatologic effects**: Skin atrophy, striae, and delayed wound healing [^112YcZPn].

Given these risks, prednisone is **not recommended for long-term eczema management** and should be limited to short-term courses (typically less than one week) [^114KmSet] in exceptional cases [^1156F5bs].

---

## Alternative treatments for eczema

Current guidelines **recommend several alternatives** for eczema management:

- **Topical corticosteroids**: First-line therapy for acute flares and maintenance treatment [^116sXU2x], with careful consideration of potency, duration, and application technique [^115VUbDH].

- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors**: Recommended for sensitive skin areas (face, intertriginous sites, anogenital area) [^1121cYzF] and as steroid-sparing agents [^116wE947].

- **Emollients and moisturizers**: Essential for maintaining skin barrier function [^114xj2Qu] and preventing flares [^117XGrw5].

- **Systemic immunomodulatory agents**: Such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine, recommended for moderate-to-severe eczema unresponsive to topical therapies [^114KmSet].

- **Biologic therapies**: Dupilumab, an IL-4 receptor antagonist, has demonstrated significant efficacy and safety in moderate-to-severe eczema [^1133bUzU] and is recommended by current guidelines.

---

## Clinical scenarios where prednisone may be considered

Prednisone **may be considered** in specific scenarios, including:

- **Severe acute flares**: Short-term use (less than one week) [^114KmSet] in exceptional cases where rapid symptom control is necessary [^116Y33zD].

- **Bridge therapy**: Temporary use while initiating other systemic therapies or phototherapy [^113yRupp].

- **Lack of alternative options**: When other treatments are contraindicated or unavailable [^113yRupp] [^1135RnSF].

In all cases, prednisone use should be **carefully monitored** [^113yRupp], with a long-term plan that avoids systemic corticosteroids [^114QAtwa].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Prednisone is **not appropriate for routine management of eczema** because of significant risks, adverse effects, and the potential for rebound flares [^113yRupp]. Its use should be limited to **short-term rescue therapy** in exceptional cases, with careful monitoring and a clear plan for alternative long-term management [^114KmSet]. Current guidelines strongly recommend topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, emollients, and systemic immunomodulatory or biologic therapies as safer and more effective alternatives for eczema management [^116sXU2x] [^116z3foJ] [^114xj2Qu].

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^115VUbDH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

- **Types of interventions**: The intervention is topical anti-inflammatory treatments. The following interventions were included:

	- Topical corticosteroids (TCS), including combinations with antimicrobials (with the caveat that studies where eligibility is limited to clinically infected eczema will not be included) or salicylic acid. TCS were grouped by potency (i.e. mild, moderate, potent, and very potent)
	- Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus
	- Topical phosphodiesterase IV (PDE-4) inhibitors, such as crisaborole
	- Topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib or delgocitinib
	- Topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activators, such as tapinarof
	- Any other well-characterised novel anti-inflammatory treatments

In general, eligible interventions are listed in the British National Formulary (BNF) as suitable products for treating eczema, but products not included in the BNF were considered if they were clinically relevant. To ensure our review was relevant and focused, trials of historical topical therapies that are no longer used worldwide for managing eczema (such as coal tar) were not included, except for trials of discontinued TCS, for which the potency of the TCS preparation can be inferred.

### Qvar [^112i6FFa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Transfer of patients from systemic steroid therapy to Qvar may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic steroid therapy, such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and eczema.

Individuals on immunosuppressive drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids. For those who have not had these diseases or have not been properly immunized, it is crucial to avoid exposure. The effects of dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration on the risk of developing a disseminated infection remain unknown, as does the contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) In the event chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

Qvar is not a bronchodilator and is not indicated for the rapid relief of bronchospasm. As with other inhaled asthma medications, bronchospasm, with an immediate increase in wheezing, may occur after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with Qvar, it should be treated immediately with a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Treatment with Qvar should be discontinued, and alternate therapy should be initiated.

### Atopic dermatitis: A new treatment paradigm using pimecrolimus [^111oGPDK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD), often called eczema, is a disease characterized by intense pruritus, erythema, dry skin, and inflammation. Pimecrolimus is a novel steroid-free treatment for AD. Consistently positive results have been found with pimecrolimus treatment in infants, children/adolescents, and adults. Its safety record is excellent, and studies have found no clinically relevant drug-related systemic adverse events.

- **Atopic dermatitis and conventional treatment strategies**: In this article, we first review atopic dermatitis and conventional treatment strategies.
- **Pimecrolimus and its various aspects**:
	- **Pharmacologic properties and toxicology**: We discuss various aspects of pimecrolimus, including its pharmacologic properties and toxicology.
	- **Short- and long-term studies, and safety and adverse events**: Additionally, we cover findings from short- and long-term studies and examine safety profiles and potential adverse events.

Finally, we propose a new steroid-sparing treatment strategy for AD.

### Choosing topical corticosteroids [^117ViBdX]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are among the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. Many topical steroids are available, differing in potency and formulation. Successful treatment relies on an accurate diagnosis and factors such as the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and potential side effects. Although the use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for specific conditions, including psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for their use in conditions such as melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of atopic dermatitis, particularly concerning topical corticosteroids, the 2024 AAAAI/ACAAI guidelines recommend considering a trial of occlusive low-to-mid-potency topical corticosteroid therapy (US classes 3–7). This trial should be time and body area-limited, lasting from 4 to 7 days, with applications ranging from a minimum of 1 hour to a maximum of overnight, once daily. This recommendation is made in conjunction with standard topical therapy for patients with localized uncontrolled atopic dermatitis that is refractory to mid-to-high-potency topical treatment (US classes 2–5 or tacrolimus).

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^116CeFCp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority (65%) disagreed that nonresponse to topical therapy was an indication for the use of systemic CS. Consensus was reached that the appropriate circumstances for the use of systemic CS in AD include a lack of other viable treatment options, use as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, acute flares in need of immediate relief, anticipation of a major life event, or in the most severe cases. Consensus emphasized that, if used, systemic CS treatment of severe AD should be limited to short‐term use.

Individual participants provided varied responses to open-ended questions. Some expressed strong support for the use of systemic CS, whereas others strongly opposed it.

In the sensitivity analysis using a < 20% disagreement as a more stringent cut-off, only five statements would have reached consensus (Box S1; see Supporting Information). In the sensitivity analysis where no more than 30% of voters marked within the left two-thirds of the VAS (considering more of the 'neutral' range as disagreement), only three statements would have reached consensus (Box S2; see Supporting Information).

### Expert perspectives on management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: A multidisciplinary consensus addressing current and emerging therapies [^114aHnb3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Until recently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved systemic treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD was systemic steroids, which are not recommended by guidelines and are commonly associated with disease rebound. Instead, clinicians choose from several off-label immunosuppressants, which can have serious adverse effects. A significant number of these patients go untreated.

Research on the immunopathogenesis of AD has paved the way for new, targeted, systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe AD. In early 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical therapies. Although the national guidelines can be very helpful to clinicians, the process for updating them does not allow for timely incorporation of novel therapies.

A steering committee of AD experts, including dermatologists, allergists, and a patient advocacy group representative, developed recommendations on the basis of a literature review and expert opinion. These recommendations help clinicians understand how new therapies fit into the treatment paradigm and provide practical recommendations for assessing AD severity, treatment response, and treatment failure.

### Practical guidelines for the use of steroid-sparing agents in the treatment of chronic pruritus [^113eiStZ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus in the adult patient is both an underappreciated and difficult-to-treat condition. In the vast majority of cases, itch is the result of inflammatory skin disease and therefore may respond to systemic anti-inflammatory therapies. Urticarial dermatitis is an under-recognized cause of chronic itch in the adult population. Patients with this disorder are characterized by prolonged, prednisone-responsive pruritus, often in the absence of substantial cutaneous findings. When present, skin findings can range from subtle, persistent urticarial lesions to excoriated papules, often intermixed with urticaria, eczematous change, and lichenification secondary to chronic scratching.

Hereby, we describe our algorithm for evaluation and management of adult patients with refractory pruritus, particularly urticarial dermatitis. This includes evaluation for other etiologies of pruritus, pre-immunosuppression workup, and the use of azathioprine and other steroid-sparing agents for the treatment of recalcitrant itch.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^113AYwQb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Among a large international group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in atopic dermatitis (AD), we reached consensus on 12 key statements related to the use of systemic corticosteroids (CS) for severe AD. The results provide a framework for clinicians caring for patients with severe AD who are considering systemic CS as a treatment option. Most notably, the group agreed on the statements that, for patients of any age, systemic CS should generally be avoided but may be used rarely. The group strongly opposed the statements that systemic CS should be used regularly for severe AD.

While our group agreed that systemic CS use should be limited, consensus was reached on several clinical situations in which systemic CS may be appropriate. These included disease-related factors, such as severe acute flares, as well as patient-related factors, such as important life events. Additionally, 72% of participants agreed that systemic CS could be considered a bridging treatment to other systemic treatments.

While ciclosporin acts rapidly for acute AD flares, it may be contraindicated in some patients. Methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate take several weeks to exert their clinical effects. Therefore, in some circumstances, taking advantage of the rapid onset of action of systemic CS while waiting for a safer long-term alternative to work may be appropriate. There are also some circumstances in which other systemic treatment options are not acceptable; for example, a recent diagnosis of cancer along with a history of alcoholism would be a contraindication to the use of ciclosporin, azathioprine, and mycophenolate.

### Corticosteroid exposure and cumulative effects in patients with eczema: Results from a patient survey [^114cATYK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Individuals with eczema may have substantial lifetime corticosteroid exposure, increasing the risk of corticosteroid-related side effects.

- **Objective**: To conduct a patient survey evaluating corticosteroid exposure and its cumulative effects in individuals with eczema.

- **Methods**: The multinational online survey was conducted between November 5, 2020, and January 11, 2021. Participants were aged 18 years or older and were either a patient (n = 1889) or a caregiver of a child (n = 271) diagnosed with eczema by a medical professional.

- **Results**: All participants reported using corticosteroids. The average duration of topical corticosteroid (TCS) use was 15.3 years in adults and 3.6 years in children; 75% used TCS 1 to 2 times a day, and 50% applied TCS 15 to 30 days per month. Frequency and duration could not be determined by varying prescription TCS potencies. Oral corticosteroid use was reported by 36% of the participants (23% for eczema), with a lifetime average of 8.4 courses in adults and 8.1 courses in children. Corticosteroids for non-eczema atopic conditions were reported by 49% of the participants. In participants using TCS, 83% of adults and 64% of children experienced worsening symptoms over time. Development of new symptoms and conditions increased with a greater number of corticosteroid treatments and longer duration of TCS use but may have been due to eczema progression. Symptoms consistent with topical steroid withdrawal syndrome after TCS discontinuation were reported by many participants.

- **Conclusion**: Participants reported substantial corticosteroid exposure throughout their lives.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^116a2u2o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments.

- **Objectives**: To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta-analysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries on 29 June 2023 and checked the reference lists of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included within-participant or between-participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity. We excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti-inflammatory treatments used for at least one week and compared them with another anti-inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. A vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient-reported eczema symptoms, clinician-reported eczema signs, and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life measures.

Barriers to Effective Interpretation of Longer-Term Data

- **Clinical trial design**: Clinicians interpreting trial results should be aware of several key parameters of clinical trial designs that may influence outcomes. Some of the key parameters identified in the recent review by Silverberg et al. were the comparator (e.g. placebo, active control, head-to-head), the definition of and rules for rescue treatment (e.g. timing for when rescue is permitted), lengths of washout periods for topical and systemic treatments (e.g. 72 hours; 1, 2, or 4 weeks), and inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g. age, disease severity).

Inconsistent inclusion and exclusion criteria between trials can complicate comparative data interpretation. In our experience, patients with moderate AD at baseline may be more responsive to treatment and, thus, show increased improvement, whereas those with severe AD may have more refractory disease that is less responsive to treatment. Exclusion criteria can also affect safety outcomes because some trials exclude patients with more complicated medical histories who may be at risk of experiencing adverse events (AEs).

The washout period refers to the time before baseline when a patient does not use medication to ensure that effects of previous treatment are no longer present prior to initiating the investigational drug. A shorter washout period could affect early trial results due to an unintended enduring effect of the previous treatment. Longer washouts could allow AD to flare up, necessitating the use of rescue treatment early in the trial.

### Prednisone [^117CF1AN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: The initial dosage of prednisone tablets, USP, may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In less severe situations, lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients, higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response following a reasonable period, prednisone should be discontinued, and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy.

	- It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized based on the disease under treatment and the patient's response. After a favorable response, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Constant monitoring is required regarding drug dosage. Situations warranting dosage adjustments include changes in clinical status due to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, individual drug responsiveness, and effects of patient exposure to stressful situations unrelated to the disease entity under treatment. In such cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period consistent with the patient's needs.

### Atopic eczema-associated fracture risk and oral corticosteroids: A population-based cohort study [^113dAXB6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

We found evidence of an association between atopic eczema and major osteoporotic fractures that persisted after adjusting for oral corticosteroids, regardless of how oral corticosteroid use was defined. The link between atopic eczema and fractures was greater in more severe cases of atopic eczema and varied by fracture site, with spinal fractures being more than twice as common in those with severe atopic eczema compared to people without atopic eczema. Evidence of this association remained after adjusting for oral corticosteroid use, indicating that only some of the association between atopic eczema and fracture risk could be explained by oral corticosteroid use. After controlling for oral corticosteroids, the attenuation of the association between atopic eczema and fractures was greater in individuals with severe atopic eczema — i.e. when additionally adjusting for oral corticosteroids, the effect estimate decreased more in people with severe atopic eczema than for those with moderate or mild atopic eczema — potentially due to more frequent use of oral corticosteroids in severe cases.

- **Results in context**: Our results offer insight into the role of oral corticosteroids in the association between atopic eczema and fractures. While a number of other studies describe an association between atopic eczema and worse bone health, insight into the impact of oral corticosteroids on this relationship, until now, has been limited, as described in a recent systematic review. Of the studies included in the review, only our previous study and one other have focused on this aspect.

### Not all topical corticosteroids are created equal! Optimizing therapeutic outcomes through better understanding of vehicle formulations, compound selection, and methods of application [^115GUQfy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Since the first successful topical glucocorticosteroid, compound F, was applied to human skin to treat eczematous dermatitis approximately 60 years ago, several advances have been made in the development of topical corticosteroid (TC) compounds and vehicle formulations. The ability to apply a TC and improve skin disease revolutionized dermatologic therapy and has proven to be one of the biggest advances in the history of dermatology. The potency of a TC and their vehicle formulation can vary among brand and generic TC compounds, which can sometimes confound the clinical situation as one brand or generic formulation of a TC may be well tolerated while another generic formulation induces skin irritation or allergenicity in a patient who previously encountered no difficulties.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema [^114HBu2e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Eczema is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin condition frequently associated with atopic conditions, including asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have a corticosteroid-sparing role in asthma, but their role in eczema remains controversial. Currently available topical therapies for eczema are often poorly tolerated, and the use of systemic agents is restricted by their adverse effect profile. A review of alternative treatments was therefore warranted.

- **Objectives**: To assess the possible benefits and harms of leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to September 2017: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database. We also searched five trial registries and hand-searched the bibliographies of all extracted studies for further relevant trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of LTRAs alone or in combination with other (topical or systemic) treatments compared with other treatments alone, such as topical corticosteroids or placebo, for eczema in the acute or chronic (maintenance) phase of eczema in adults and children.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were change in disease severity, long-term symptom control, and adverse effects of treatment. Secondary outcomes were change in corticosteroid requirement, reduction of pruritis, quality of life, and emollient requirement. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^1156F5bs]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We were unable to reach consensus on many issues related to dosing and duration of systemic CS use. However, the clear majority of participants (94%) agreed that the use of systemic CS should be limited to short periods of time; this is in keeping with clinical practice guidelines. Our group did not reach consensus on a definition of short-term use. The European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis/European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology task force position statement on the treatment of AD suggests that a typical regimen of systemic CS might be methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg daily for 1–2 weeks tapered over 1 month, but there is no RCT evidence for the safety or efficacy of this specific regimen.

Most respondents (but not enough for consensus) agreed that systemic CS should never be used in children. Further, while the circumstances agreed upon for the use of systemic CS in AD can be applied to patients of all ages, they are less likely to be applicable for young children. Most children will have fewer comorbidities complicating the use of immunomodulatory agents such as ciclosporin. As such, while systemic CS should be used rarely for severe AD in general, their use should be even more limited in children, particularly given concerns regarding infection, growth delay, and increased rates of obesity.

### A clinician's paradigm in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^112N1UCu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Successful management of atopic dermatitis requires a multipronged approach that includes skin barrier function care, the use of topical or systemic agents, and the identification and elimination of precipitating or exacerbating factors. Because the origin of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and trigger factors differ among patients, treatment plans must be specific to the individual patient. This article offers an example of a permutational, or flexible, treatment paradigm.

The approach utilizes four topical regimens: high-potency topical corticosteroids, lowest effective potency topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), or topical corticosteroid/TCI combinations as initial therapy in a variety of induction protocols, as determined by the severity of a patient's condition and history. The paradigm permits treatment to progress from a chosen induction therapy to maintenance therapy. During the patient's induction therapy, as soon as an acceptable level of clearance is achieved, therapy should be adjusted to a maintenance regimen. This regimen may involve monotherapy with either a TCI or a lowest effective potency topical corticosteroid, with the latter used intermittently, or an alternation of the two agents.

If there is no clearance or positive response with the initial induction protocol, the clinician should move to one of the alternative regimens.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema with pruritus as a primary lesion. The strategies to treat AD in Japan from the perspective of evidence-based medicine consist of three primary measures:

- **Use of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment**: These are considered the main treatments for inflammation.

- **Topical application of emollients**: This approach treats the cutaneous barrier dysfunction.

- **Avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors**: Additionally, psychological counseling and advice about daily life are crucial.

The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes concerning several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### Chronic urticarial plaques in a young woman [^115vj7rd]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?
	- A. Prednisone – Incorrect. While prednisone may provide symptomatic relief, it is not ideal for long-term management of FCAS due to its significant side-effect profile.
	- B. Mepolizumab – Incorrect. Mepolizumab is a fully humanized anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody used to treat severe asthma with eosinophilia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome. It has neither shown benefit in FCAS nor in CIU.
	- C. Omalizumab – Incorrect. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds the Fc receptor of immunoglobulin E. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for asthma and CIU but not for FCAS.
	- D. Canakinumab – Correct. Canakinumab is a fully human anti-interleukin 1β monoclonal antibody administered subcutaneously every 8 weeks. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of FCAS, as well as other periodic fever syndromes, hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and adult-onset Still disease. Our patient was treated with canakinumab 150 mg administered every 8 weeks and experienced full resolution of symptoms after her first dose.
	- E. Dupilumab – Incorrect. Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody to the interleukin 4 receptor α subunit, which binds interleukin 4 and interleukin 13. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for atopic dermatitis, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^116sXU2x]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

New evidence has emerged since the 2014 guidelines that further informs the management of atopic dermatitis (AD) with topical therapies. These guidelines update the 2014 recommendations for management of AD with topical therapies.

- **Objective**: To provide evidence-based recommendations related to the management of AD in adults using topical treatments.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary workgroup conducted a systematic review and applied the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

- **Results**: The workgroup developed 12 recommendations on the management of AD in adults with topical therapies. These include nonprescription agents and prescription topical corticosteroids (TCS), calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (PDE-4), antimicrobials, and antihistamines.

- **Limitations**: The pragmatic decision to limit the literature review to English-language randomized trials may have excluded data published in other languages and relevant long-term follow-up data.

- **Conclusions**: Strong recommendations are made for the use of moisturizers, TCIs, TCS, and topical PDE-4 and JAK inhibitors. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of bathing and wet wrap therapy and against the use of topical antimicrobials, antiseptics, and antihistamines.

### Expert perspectives on key parameters that impact interpretation of randomized clinical trials in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^116bApPt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Comparator**: Placebo-controlled randomized trials are the gold standard for clinical research and are required for regulatory approval. Considerations around placebo utilization in AD clinical trials and practical suggestions for trial design were recently expertly reviewed. When attempting to compare active agents from independent placebo-controlled trials, attention must be paid to the response rate to placebo in each trial, which may be influenced by background treatments/rescue therapies.

To reflect real-world practice, many clinical trials for moderate-to-severe AD compare placebo and TCS with the experimental drug and TCS, as placebo alone may not meet standard-of-care and may expose participants to a risk of worsening AD and reduced quality of life. However, if background TCS is used on an as-needed basis, participants in the placebo arm may use more TCS than participants in the active treatment arm. This could result in higher levels of AD improvement in the placebo arm and lead to an underestimation of the perceived placebo-adjusted treatment effect of the experimental drug.

Placebo responses may also be influenced by the method by which participants obtain rescue treatment in a trial. Some trials supply TCS directly to participants, which minimizes barriers to use. In such trials, participants may use TCS more consistently and in greater amounts than they would in the real world, where a prescription is typically required. Other trials do not supply TCS and require participants to obtain new TCS prescriptions. In some instances, there may be a financial barrier to access.

### Prednisolone vs. ciclosporin for severe adult eczema. An investigator-initiated double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial [^117JZ6LE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with severe eczema frequently receive systemic glucocorticosteroids. The efficacy of prednisolone and other steroids, however, has never been evaluated appropriately. A meta-analysis indicated that ciclosporin is the best evaluated systemic treatment for eczema.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the comparative efficacy of prednisolone and ciclosporin for severe eczema.

- **Methods**: In an investigator-initiated double-blind randomized multicentre trial, adults with severe eczema (objective SCORAD ≥ 40 and Dermatology Life Quality Index ≥ 10) were randomly allocated to receive prednisolone (initial dose 0.5–0.8 mg/kg daily) for 2 weeks followed by placebo for 4 weeks, or ciclosporin (2.7–4.0 mg/kg daily) for 6 weeks and followed for another 12 weeks. Concomitant treatment included a moderately potent topical steroid, emollients, and continuation of antihistamines. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with stable remission, i.e. ≥ 50% SCORAD improvement under active treatment and no flare (≥ 75% of baseline SCORAD) during follow-up. Sample size calculation indicated that 66 patients were needed to see clinically relevant differences between groups. Analysis was by intention-to-treat [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00445081].

- **Results**: Because of unexpectedly high numbers of withdrawals due to significant exacerbations of eczema (n = 15/38), an independent data monitoring and safety board proposed early study termination. Thirty-eight patients were randomized and analysed. Stable remission was achieved in one of 21 patients.

### Systemic treatments for eczema: A network meta-analysis [^116z3foJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Eczema is a common and chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disorder that significantly impacts quality of life and economic outcomes, particularly for individuals with moderate to severe eczema. Although various treatments offer sustained disease control, their relative benefits are unclear due to the limited number of trials directly comparing treatments.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of different types of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe eczema using NMA and to generate rankings of available systemic immunosuppressive treatments for eczema according to their efficacy and safety.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to August 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic immunosuppressive agents for moderate to severe atopic eczema when compared against placebo or any other eligible eczema treatment were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were synthesized using pair-wise analysis and NMA to compare treatments and rank them according to their effectiveness. Effectiveness was assessed primarily by determining the proportion of participants who achieved at least 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) and improvement in the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). Safety was evaluated primarily by considering the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) and infection. Short-term follow-up was defined as ≤ 16 weeks, and long-term follow-up as > 16 weeks.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis 2016 [^114TNKe3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema, with pruritus as a primary lesion. Most patients have an atopic predisposition. The definitive diagnosis of AD requires the presence of all three features: (i) pruritus; (ii) typical morphology and distribution of the eczema; and (iii) a chronic and chronically relapsing course.

The strategies to treat AD in Japan from the perspective of evidence-based medicine consist of three primary measures: (i) the use of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment as the main treatment for the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling, and advice about daily life.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International eczema council consensus statement [^115ahS9M]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The divergence between guidelines discouraging the use of systemic corticosteroids (CS) and their frequent use in routine clinical practice is a concern. Ease of use, rapid response in a distressed patient, cost, and the familiarity of primary care physicians with systemic CS for other conditions likely contribute to this issue. The discrepancy between treatments physicians suggest in guidelines in a hypothetical clinical scenario and the decisions they make when dealing with an individual patient in one-to-one consultations has been studied using a behavioral economics approach. Physicians often deviate from agreed best practices when confronted with a distressed patient. Systematic approaches to better understand the implementation gaps between guidelines and practice have been advanced in a recent white paper by the healthcare quality organization Joint Commission International and may be applicable to systemic CS use for atopic dermatitis.

The major strength of our study is the large, geographically diverse group of International Eczema Council (IEC) expert atopic dermatitis clinicians and researchers who participated in the consensus process. During the panel discussion preceding the formal consensus survey, it was clear that clinical practice, even among experts, differed significantly from country to country. Particularly given the sparsity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) and high-quality nonrandomized study evidence to support any one viewpoint, it is important to keep an open mind to different practices. Despite the diversity of respondents, there was over-representation from some countries, including the United States, which may have biased the results.

### Rapid, successful treatment of atopic dermatitis recalcitrant to topical corticosteroids [^113finou]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is typically responsive to mid-potency topical corticosteroids, which constitute the mainstay of treatment. However, many patients experience what appears to be "resistance" to triamcinolone prescribed for outpatient use. Such resistance often stems from poor adherence, although patients and caregivers may insist that the steroid was ineffective and assure the physician it was applied as recommended.

We describe the case of a young girl with a 2-year history of atopic dermatitis resistant to triamcinolone, whose condition rapidly improved with continued use of triamcinolone. This case raises the ethical dilemma of whether physicians should base treatment plans on patient reports or evidence on adherence suggests.

### Assessment of efficacy and safety outcomes beyond week 16 in clinical trials of systemic agents used for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in combination with topical corticosteroids [^112vnCQD]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

When making cross-trial comparisons, the following elements of ECZTRA 3 are important to consider:

- **Placebo comparator absence and active therapy beyond week 16**: In the analyses beyond week 16, no placebo comparator was included, and all patients received active therapy.

- **Response rates at week 32**: Response rates presented at week 32 are based on a post-hoc analysis conducted by pooling all patients treated with tralokinumab in the initial treatment period (n = 252), irrespective of responses at week 16 and tralokinumab dosing regimen thereafter.

- **Washout and rescue treatment protocol**: A 2-week washout of topical corticosteroids (TCS) was required before treatment initiation; rescue treatment with higher-potency TCS (Europe class > 3; US class < 4) or systemic drugs was allowed from the start of the trial to control intolerable atopic dermatitis symptoms at the investigators' discretion.

- **Standardization of concomitant TCS use**: This trial was the only one to standardize concomitant TCS use in the protocol to mometasone furoate 0.1% cream (Europe class 3 [potent]; US class 4 [mid-strength]) and supply this medication to patients in kit sizes of 180–200 g every two weeks. Patients returned all used and unused TCS tubes, which were then weighed to determine the amount of medication used. Patients were also allowed to use low-potency TCS or TCI in areas where use of the supplied TCS was inadvisable. At week 16, patients treated with tralokinumab used approximately 50% less TCS compared with patients treated with placebo; the mean use remained low (around 5–7 g/week) for patients continuing with tralokinumab treatment.

- **Implementation of NRI**: Non-response imputation (NRI) was implemented for patients who used rescue medication or withdrew from the trial, as well as for missing data.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^1135RnSF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines generally discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis, yet their usage remains widespread. An objective of the study was to achieve consensus among an international group of experts about the use of systemic corticosteroids for this condition.

A survey was distributed to the International Eczema Council, consisting of statements with visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree'. Agreement on a statement reached consensus if less than 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.

From 77 members, 60 (78%) participated in the study. Consensus was achieved on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but may be used rarely in severe cases under certain circumstances. These circumstances include a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares needing immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event, or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be restricted to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, although consensus was not reached on this statement. The conclusions of this expert group are constrained by the limited availability of high-quality published evidence. More stringent consensus criteria (e.g. requiring less than 20% marking towards 'strongly disagree') would have resulted in consensus on fewer statements.

In conclusion, based on expert opinion, the routine use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis is generally discouraged.

### Dermatologists' knowledge of and preferences regarding topical steroids [^117EovbC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the standard-of-care treatment for dermatitis, mild psoriasis, and other inflammatory skin diseases. Prescribing practices rely on knowledge of topical corticosteroid potency, as well as potential side effects, including steroid allergies.

- **Purpose**: The primary aim of this study is to determine how dermatologists classify particular topical corticosteroids according to potency, and which products they prefer when allergenicity is a concern.

- **Methods**: The data were collected and analyzed from 105 US-based dermatologists surveyed at the 2011 Summer American Academy of Dermatology meeting.

- **Results**: The majority of dermatologists agreed on the potency ranking of many commonly prescribed topical corticosteroids. Two-thirds of the surveyed dermatologists expressed concern about allergy to topical corticosteroids. In cases of suspected allergy, desoximetasone was the leading product dermatologists would choose to prescribe.

- **Limitations**: The survey was limited to attendees of an educational conference, possibly leading to an overestimation of dermatologist knowledge of topical steroids.

- **Conclusions**: This study shows that dermatologists are generally knowledgeable about group classifications of corticosteroids in terms of potency, and they can appropriately select a topical product with a low potential for allergy.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2017. Part 1: Treatment and prevention [^1133bUzU]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual updates that summarize the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE). It provides a summary of key findings from 25 systematic reviews that were published or indexed during 2017 and focuses on the treatment and prevention of AE. There is high-quality evidence to demonstrate that dupilumab is better than placebo for the treatment of AE, is not associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects, and does not increase the risk of infection compared with placebo; however, comparison studies with other systemic treatments are necessary.

Topical tofacitinib is a promising treatment for mild to moderate AE but currently lacks sufficient evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing it with other active treatments. Topical doxepin may be effective for pruritus in AE, but available studies have short follow-up periods, and longer-term outcomes are needed. Bleach baths were no more effective than water baths alone at reducing AE severity. Topical antibiotics cannot be recommended for infected AE owing to insufficient evidence of benefit.

There is little comparison of different emollients in RCTs, but overall evidence indicates that they reduce AE severity, are steroid-sparing, and lead to better outcomes in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) than TCS alone. No clear benefit was demonstrated for vitamin D/C/E supplementation in pregnancy for eczema prevention.

Regarding medical management for atopic dermatitis, particularly in relation to topical corticosteroids, the 2018 guidelines by EAACI/EADV/EDF/EFA/ESDaP/ESPD/ETFAD/GA²LEN/UEMS recommend considering proactive therapy with a twice-weekly application during long-term follow-up to reduce relapses. It is advisable to continue proactive therapy with topical corticosteroids for at least 20 weeks.

### Safety and efficacy of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of childhood atopic dermatitis [^1179zu3p]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 10–20% of infants in industrialized countries experience atopic dermatitis. In recent decades, topical corticosteroids have been the first-choice therapy for treatment of flares. However, this form of therapy may induce skin atrophy, especially after application to facial lesions or with long-term use. Thus, the development of new anti-inflammatory topical agents for the treatment of childhood atopic dermatitis was needed.

The topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus have an effect on various cells of the cutaneous immune system, specifically on T cells, by inhibiting the phosphatase calcineurin and preventing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. In several clinical studies of children and adults with atopic dermatitis, topical calcineurin inhibitors were found to be effective both on the face and the trunk and extremities, in both short- and long-term treatment regimens. Tachyphylaxis or rebound were not observed.

In most patients, an improvement of their eczema occurred during the first week of treatment, as measured by subjective and objective clinical signs of atopic dermatitis. Treatment significantly reduced the incidence of flares and the need for corticosteroids in children and adults. Treatment success, commonly defined as 'excellent improvement' or 'clearing of all lesions', was observed in more than one-third of all children treated with 0.03% or 0.1% tacrolimus or 1% pimecrolimus. Topical application of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus does not lead to significant blood concentrations of these agents in the majority of children with atopic dermatitis.

### Do people with eczema and their carers understand topical steroid potency? Results of two surveys [^111izKw9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are classified into four potencies: mild, moderate, potent, and very potent. Confusion arises from the wide range of products available, none of which have the potency level printed on the tubes or packaging. An online survey of patients and carers of people with eczema showed that only 17% of 984 respondents knew how many potencies there are. In a second survey, 315 respondents provided 1520 assignments of the potency of commonly used TCSs: 55.5% were correct, 21% were underestimates, and 23.5% were overestimates. Some errors were extreme: 12 (8%) of those using a very potent TCS considered it mild, while 9 (27%) using a mild TCS considered it potent or very potent. Other themes expressed in free-text comments included inadequate and conflicting advice about using TCSs and lack of warnings about long-term adverse effects, particularly topical steroid withdrawal. Ninety-five percent of respondents wanted TCSs to be clearly labelled with potency.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: A Cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113CfdL9]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Low credibility.

Eczema is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide, and topical anti-inflammatory treatments are commonly used to control its symptoms. The relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments remain uncertain. A network meta-analysis was performed within a Cochrane systematic review to compare and statistically rank the efficacy and safety of these treatments.

The data sources included the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries up to June 2023. Eligible trials were randomized controlled trials, either within-participant or between-participant designs. Participants had eczema that was not clinically infected and was not contact dermatitis, seborrheic eczema, or hand eczema. The interventions involved topical anti-inflammatory treatments, excluding complementary treatments, antibiotics alone, wet wraps, phototherapy, or systemic treatments. Comparators were either no treatment/vehicle or another topical anti-inflammatory.

In total, 291 trials were identified, involving 45,846 participants, mainly conducted in high-income countries. Most trials were industry-funded, with a median treatment duration of three weeks. The risk of bias, assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, was high in 89% of trials, primarily due to selective reporting. The network meta-analysis of binary outcomes ranked potent and/or very potent topical steroids, tacrolimus 0.1%, and ruxolitinib 1.5% among the most effective treatments for improving patient-reported symptoms (40 trials, all low confidence) and clinician-reported signs.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^113yRupp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, it is the consensus of the IEC that systemic corticosteroids have a limited role in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in children and adults. Clinicians should limit their use to special circumstances and always consider other treatment options. If systemic corticosteroids are prescribed, they should be limited to short-term use with a long-term treatment plan not involving systemic corticosteroids. We hope that this serves to curb the overprescription of these medications for patients with atopic dermatitis.

### Does order of application of emollient and topical corticosteroids make a difference in the severity of atopic eczema in children [^116irt5T]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Atopic eczema (AE) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder in children, with emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCSs) commonly prescribed as treatment. There is no published guidance on the correct order of application of emollient and TCS in children with AE.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to determine whether the order of application of emollient and TCS makes a difference in the severity of AE in children.

- **Methods**: Forty-six patients ages 4 months to 5 years with moderate to severe AE were randomized into two groups. Group A applied emollient followed by TCS 15 minutes later twice daily. Group B applied TCS followed by emollient 15 minutes later twice daily for 2 weeks.

- **Results**: There was no statistically significant difference in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected, or itch score between groups A and B (p > 0.05). Group A had statistically significant improvement in the EASI score, percentage BSA affected, and itch score from baseline to weeks 1 and 2; group B demonstrated statistically significant improvement only in the EASI score from baseline to week 1 and in itch score from baseline to week 2. There was no difference in adverse events between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that the order of application of emollient and TCS does not matter in the treatment of AE in children, and that parents can apply topical medications in whichever order they prefer.

### Topical tacrolimus for atopic dermatitis [^115gtqnE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting both children and adults, significantly impacting their quality of life. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the first-line therapy; however, chronic use can lead to significant adverse effects. An alternative treatment is tacrolimus ointment available in two manufactured strengths: 0.1% and 0.03%. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are classified as topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs).

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of topical tacrolimus for moderate and severe atopic dermatitis compared with other active treatments.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 3 June 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 5, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT database). We searched six trials registers and examined the bibliographies of included studies for additional relevant trials. Specialists in the field were contacted for unpublished data. A separate search for adverse effects of topical tacrolimus was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE on 30 July 2013. We also reviewed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites for information on adverse effects.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (both children and adults) using topical tacrolimus at any dose, course duration, and follow-up were included.

### Assessment of efficacy and safety outcomes beyond week 16 in clinical trials of systemic agents used for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in combination with topical corticosteroids [^1163DNVE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

When making cross-trial comparisons, the following elements of JADE DARE are important to consider (Fig. 1): because of the lack of a placebo comparator, all patients received active therapy; therefore, any improvement from baseline might include any potential placebo response in addition to a response to study treatment. Washout of topical corticosteroids (TCS) prior to treatment initiation was not required. Rescue treatment, using high-potency TCS for up to two weeks at a time or systemic corticosteroids for up to ten days, to manage intolerable atopic dermatitis (AD) symptoms was allowed after week 4 at the investigators' discretion.

Concomitant TCS use was standardized by the protocol to medium- or low-potency TCS, such as triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream or fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% ointment. However, these were not provided by the trial sponsor, and the frequency and amount used were not reported. Alternatively, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) or phosphodiesterase inhibitors were allowed on areas of thin skin or if TCS were considered unsafe. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was implemented for those patients who used rescue medication or withdrew from the trial. Other missing data were assumed to be missing at random.

- **Placebo-controlled phase III trials**:

- **ECZTRA 3 (tralokinumab)**: ECZTRA 3 (NCT03363854) was a 32-week, phase III, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial comparing tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS (n = 252) with placebo + TCS (n = 126) for an initial 16-week treatment period in patients aged ≥ 18 years with moderate to severe AD (Fig. 1). The initial treatment period was followed by re-randomization for an additional 16-week continuation.

### Consensus statement on the management of chronic hand eczema [^116EXTne]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The management of chronic hand eczema is often inadequate. There are currently no evidence-based guidelines specifically for the management of chronic hand eczema, and the evidence for established treatments for hand eczema is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. This consensus statement, based on a review of published data and clinical practice in both primary and secondary care, is intended to guide the management of chronic hand eczema. It describes the epidemiology and pathogenesis of hand eczema, its diagnosis, and its effect on patients' quality of life. Management strategies include a skin education program, lifestyle changes, and the use of emollients, barriers, and soap substitutes.

- **Topical drug therapy**: Includes topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Treatment with psoralen ultraviolet A and systemic therapies may then be appropriate, although there is no strong evidence of efficacy.

- **Efficacy of alitretinoin**: Alitretinoin has been shown to be effective in a randomized controlled trial and is currently the only treatment specifically licensed for the treatment of hand eczema.

Recommendations for management are summarized in a treatment algorithm.
