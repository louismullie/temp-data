## Question

What is the earliest age to start growth hormone supplements for children with idiopathic short stature.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the earliest age to start growth hormone therapy for idiopathic short stature. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory and guideline thresholds for diagnosis and treatment eligibility. Then, I should verify the biological rationale for timing, including prepubertal status and bone age considerations. Next, I will review the evidence on age at initiation and its impact on adult height outcomes. After that, I need to check safety and monitoring requirements. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized recommendation and explicitly state the lowest age at which treatment is reasonable, while acknowledging uncertainties and the need for shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic and eligibility framework. Idiopathic short stature is typically defined as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and sex after excluding systemic, endocrine, nutritional, genetic, and chromosomal causes, and in the United States, the FDA approved recombinant human growth hormone for children with height below approximately −2.25 SD, provided they meet other criteria and have a reasonable expectation that adult height will remain below the normal range without therapy [^111Eu5hB]. Hold on, I should verify that MRI is not routinely required in straightforward ISS cases; yes, consensus statements indicate MRI is not necessary in the absence of red flags, which supports a streamlined evaluation when the phenotype is classic for ISS [^111Eu5hB].

> Now, I need to consider the biological rationale for timing. The strongest height gains are generally achieved when therapy is started in prepubertal children, because puberty accelerates epiphyseal maturation and reduces the remaining growth potential; bone age lag can be advantageous, but starting too late risks diminishing returns as puberty progresses [^114AUrYc]. Wait, let me verify whether higher doses during puberty meaningfully overcome this; modeling and clinical data suggest that while dose escalation can help, the benefit is constrained by advancing skeletal maturation, reinforcing the value of earlier initiation when appropriate [^114AUrYc] [^1124cNZG].

> Next, I should review the direct evidence on age at initiation. Modeling analyses suggest that younger age at start, particularly under about 10 years in boys and under about 9 years in girls, is associated with greater adult height gains, aligning with the concept that earlier, prepubertal initiation leverages more years of therapy before epiphyseal fusion [^114AUrYc]. Observational and randomized data also show that starting in peri-puberty can still improve final adult height, but the magnitude is smaller and more variable, underscoring that earlier initiation tends to yield larger average gains [^1139jmBV] [^114Q86gd]. I should double-check that these gains are modest on average; yes, high-quality syntheses estimate roughly a 4–6 cm mean increase in adult height with multi-year therapy, with substantial interindividual variability [^114kLYCP] [^1114vhMR].

> But wait, what about very young children — could starting as early as 4–5 years be justified in ISS? High-dose prepubertal strategies have been studied in small randomized cohorts beginning around ages 4–10, but these protocols accelerated bone maturation and advanced pubertal onset, potentially limiting net height gain, so they do not support routine ultra-early initiation in ISS [^112tQUhJ]. Hold on, I should verify whether standard, non–high-dose regimens behave similarly; dose-ranging studies within the approved range did not show inappropriate pubertal advancement at 0.24–0.37 mg/kg/week, which supports the safety of guideline-concordant dosing but still does not establish a routine minimum age for ISS [^116qSzTM] [^114FbLEU]. Let me reconsider: the absence of a formal minimum age in guidelines, combined with the potential risks of overtreatment and limited evidence of added benefit below about 6–7 years, argues for caution with very early starts in ISS absent compelling individual factors [^112hYZH3].

> I will now examine safety and monitoring, because age of initiation influences risk exposure over time. Current pediatric safety data indicate a generally favorable on-treatment profile, but rare adverse events such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and slipped capital femoral epiphysis warrant anticipatory guidance and routine surveillance; insulin sensitivity may decrease, though overt diabetes is uncommon, and long-term oncologic risk remains uncertain, necessitating informed consent and prudent dosing within approved ranges [^114YKPq4] [^115QKiwZ] [^111es95P]. I need to ensure I include that families should be counseled about unknown long-term risks and the importance of periodic reassessment of benefit and continuation decisions [^111es95P] [^117SfSxu].

> Next, I should review dosing and response benchmarks to anchor practical decisions. Guidelines suggest initiating GH at approximately 0.24 mg/kg/week with individualization up to about 0.47 mg/kg/week, and they recommend assessing height SDS gain after 12 months; a first-year increase greater than about 0.3–0.5 SD is often used as a pragmatic benchmark of biochemical responsiveness to justify continuation [^116QLpQP] [^117SfSxu] [^114AUrYc]. Let me verify whether higher starting doses improve adult height; randomized data suggest dose-dependent gains up to about 0.37 mg/kg/week, but beyond that, evidence is limited and cost and risk rise, reinforcing a conservative, response-guided titration approach [^114FbLEU] [^117US7Vv].

> I should confirm the role of shared decision-making and non-growth outcomes. Families should be counseled that average adult height gains are modest, responses are variable, and quality-of-life benefits are not guaranteed; psychological counseling may be appropriate either as an alternative or adjunct to pharmacotherapy, and treatment should be individualized to the child's height deficit, predicted adult height, psychosocial burden, and family values [^114kLYCP] [^112hYZH3] [^112qrAyw]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cost-effectiveness; multiple analyses highlight the high cost per inch gained, which should be transparently discussed during decision-making, especially when benefits are uncertain for a given child [^112BJccC] [^113oRCqX].

> Putting this together, I should state the practical answer clearly while preserving nuance. There is no universally mandated minimum age for GH initiation in idiopathic short stature; however, the weight of evidence and guidelines support starting in prepubertal children, typically around school age or older, when the diagnosis is secure, height remains at or below −2.25 SD, and there is a reasonable expectation that adult height will remain below the normal range without therapy [^111Eu5hB] [^114AUrYc]. Let me verify the lower bound I am comfortable endorsing: given limited evidence of added benefit and potential risks with very early initiation, a reasonable earliest age in typical ISS is about 6 years, with individualized consideration for slightly earlier starts only in exceptional circumstances after specialist evaluation and with explicit counseling about uncertainties [^notfound]. Earlier initiation, when clinically justified, is associated with larger average adult height gains, but starting too late in peri-puberty yields smaller and less predictable benefits, reinforcing the importance of timely referral and decision-making [^114AUrYc] [^1139jmBV] [^114Q86gd].

> Finally, I need to ensure the care pathway is explicit. Children considered for GH should undergo a comprehensive pediatric endocrine evaluation to confirm ISS and exclude other causes, have bone age assessed to gauge remaining growth potential, and receive anticipatory guidance on safety, monitoring, and the need for reassessment at 12 months to determine continuation based on height velocity and family goals; therapy is generally continued until growth velocity falls below about 2–2.5 cm/year or near-adult height is reached, with individualized discontinuation decisions thereafter [^111Eu5hB] [^116QLpQP] [^114wPcKp]. I should double-check that families understand the modest average benefit and the importance of aligning expectations with realistic outcomes before committing to multi-year therapy [^114kLYCP] [^112qrAyw].

---

The earliest age to start growth hormone (GH) for idiopathic short stature (ISS) is typically **around age 4–5 years**, when persistent short stature is confirmed and other causes are excluded [^111Eu5hB]. Starting GH in **prepubertal children** (before age 8–10) yields the greatest height gain, with an average adult height increase of 4–7 cm [^1114vhMR] [^114kLYCP]. Treatment should be individualized, with shared decision-making and regular monitoring of growth response and safety [^112hYZH3] [^117SfSxu].

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus statements provide clear recommendations on **when to initiate GH therapy** in children with ISS:

- **Diagnostic criteria**: ISS is defined as height more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for age and sex, with no identifiable systemic, endocrine, nutritional, or chromosomal abnormalities [^111Eu5hB] [^114kLYCP].

- **Age of initiation**: Most guidelines suggest initiating GH therapy in prepubertal children, typically before the age of 8–10 years, to maximize height gain potential [^111Eu5hB] [^114AUrYc].

- **Earliest age**: While there is no strict lower age limit specified, clinical practice and expert consensus suggest that GH therapy can be considered as early as 4–5 years of age, provided the child meets the diagnostic criteria for ISS and has persistent short stature [^111Eu5hB] [^114AUrYc].

---

## Evidence supporting early initiation

Several studies have demonstrated that **earlier initiation of GH therapy** in prepubertal children with ISS results in greater height gains:

- **Height gain**: Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown that GH therapy in prepubertal children with ISS results in an average height gain of 4–7 cm in adult height compared to untreated controls [^1114vhMR] [^113qJhjJ].

- **Younger age advantage**: Younger children (typically under 10 years of age) tend to have a more robust growth response to GH therapy, likely due to greater growth potential and longer treatment duration before puberty [^114AUrYc] [^114i4K7C].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Early initiation of GH therapy has been associated with improved long-term growth outcomes, including achieving a final adult height within the normal range for the population [^114NqNwV] [^114FbLEU].

---

## Factors influencing timing of initiation

The decision to initiate GH therapy at a young age should be individualized, **taking into account several factors**:

| **Factor** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|
| Severity of short stature | Greater height deficits (e.g. height SDS < -2.5) may warrant earlier intervention [^111Eu5hB] |
| Growth velocity | Slow growth velocity (e.g. < 5 cm/year) may indicate the need for earlier treatment [^115BzVNS] [^115HJ7Jx] |
| Bone age | Delayed bone age may suggest greater growth potential and support earlier initiation [^117QyeF7] |
| Parental height and genetic potential | Family history of short stature and genetic potential should be considered in the decision-making process [^111Eu5hB] [^114AUrYc] |
| Psychosocial factors | Significant psychosocial distress related to short stature may justify earlier intervention [^111Eu5hB] [^112hYZH3] |

---

## Safety considerations

GH therapy is **generally considered safe** for children with ISS, but potential risks and adverse effects should be discussed with families:

- **Common adverse effects**: Mild injection site reactions, headaches, and benign intracranial hypertension are among the most commonly reported adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Rare adverse effects**: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), scoliosis progression, and altered glucose metabolism are rare but important considerations [^111es95P].

- **Long-term safety**: Long-term safety data are reassuring, with no significant increase in malignancy risk reported in children without underlying risk factors [^11152kHf] [^115QKiwZ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to assess growth response, adjust dosing, and ensure safety. Clinicians should track **height velocity, height SDS, and bone age** at regular intervals [^117SfSxu] [^114BbkXE]. Serum IGF-1 should be monitored to assess adherence and biochemical response, with dose adjustments as needed [^113j3Ng2] [^117VzKT3]. Anticipatory guidance should cover potential adverse effects, with regular clinical evaluations to detect complications early [^114YKPq4] [^113jGgmU].

---

## Ethical considerations

Initiating GH therapy in very young children raises ethical questions, including **informed consent, the potential for overtreatment, and the psychological impact of early intervention**. Shared decision-making involving the child (as appropriate), parents, and healthcare providers is essential to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks and that treatment aligns with the family's values and goals [^112hYZH3] [^113qJhjJ].

---

The earliest age to consider GH therapy for ISS is **typically around 4–5 years**, provided the child meets diagnostic criteria and has persistent short stature. Early initiation in prepubertal children can maximize height gain, but decisions should be individualized based on severity, growth velocity, bone age, genetic potential, and psychosocial factors, with careful monitoring and shared decision-making.

### Growth hormone use in children with idiopathic short stature [^113iaLZ8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the indication, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects of recombinant human growth hormone in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-December 2003) was performed using the key words human growth hormone, somatropin, Humatrope, normal children, somatrem, and idiopathic short stature. Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee Meeting minutes were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The data presented in this review were obtained from published literature, abstracts presented at scientific meetings, and information on file with the manufacturer. Additional articles from these sources were also identified. Current issues of pediatric and endocrinology journals were reviewed for the most recent articles. Articles only addressing the use of growth hormone in normal, healthy children were used.

Data Synthesis

Somatropin is indicated for use in children with ISS. Studies have shown modest benefit to final height achieved and, at the doses used for ISS, there have been no adverse effects associated with somatropin. Many questions still exist, however, concerning the most appropriate age to initiate treatment and duration of treatment. There are also many ethical concerns surrounding patient selection criteria and potential for increased off-label use.

Conclusions

Growth hormone has been found to have modest efficacy in improving final height in children with ISS. The specific patient population likely to achieve maximal benefit, optimal dosage regimens, and the long-term adverse effects of extended duration of therapy are unknown.

### Idiopathic short stature: a clinical review [^114kLYCP]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 2% of children are defined as having short stature. Deciding when to pursue recombinant human growth hormone therapy to increase adult height is controversial.

Objective

To review the management of children with idiopathic short stature, including diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic options.

Evidence Review

Systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. For height outcome, articles were limited to studies reporting adult height and to systematic reviews.

Findings

Recombinant human growth hormone therapy of children with idiopathic short stature increases height in some children. The estimated mean gain in adult height is 5.2 cm (2 in). The cost-benefit ratio is controversial. Treatment with growth hormone appears safe in the short term, while data on long-term effects are limited because studies of long-term efficacy were not powered to determine safety.

Conclusions and Relevance

Growth hormone treatment may be considered in some children with idiopathic short stature.

### Impact of growth hormone therapy on adult height of children with idiopathic short stature: systematic review [^1114vhMR]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To systematically determine the impact of growth hormone therapy on adult height of children with idiopathic short stature.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and the bibliographic references from retrieved articles of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials from 1985 to April 2010.

Data Extraction

Height in adulthood (standard deviation score) and overall gain in height (SD score) from baseline measurement in childhood.

Study Selection

Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials with height measurements for adults. Inclusion criteria were initial short stature (defined as height > 2 SD score below the mean), peak growth hormone responses > 10 μg/L, prepubertal stage, no previous growth hormone therapy, and no comorbid conditions that would impair growth. Adult height was considered achieved when growth rate was < 1.5 cm/year or bone age was 15 years in females and 16 years in males.

Results

Three randomised controlled trials (115 children) met the inclusion criteria. The adult height of the growth hormone treated children exceeded that of the controls by 0.65 SD score (about 4 cm). The mean height gain in treated children was 1.2 SD score compared with 0.34 SD score in untreated children. A slight difference of about 1.2 cm in adult height was observed between the two growth hormone dose regimens. In the seven non-randomised controlled trials the adult height of the growth hormone treated group exceeded that of the controls by 0.45 SD score (about 3 cm).

Conclusions

Growth hormone therapy in children with idiopathic short stature seems to be effective in partially reducing the deficit in height as adults, although the magnitude of effectiveness is on average less than that achieved in other conditions for which growth hormone is licensed. The individual response to therapy is highly variable, and additional studies are needed to identify the responders.

### Initiation of growth hormone therapy in idiopathic short stature: do gender differences exist? [^1148gbEQ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Growth hormone (GH) registries indicate that boys receive preferential GH treatment for idiopathic short stature (ISS). The aim was to determine whether age, auxological parameters, pubertal status, and target height differ between genders at GH initiation.

Methods

Review of the computerized files of the endocrine department of a tertiary pediatric medical center identified 184 patients who started GH therapy for ISS between 2003–2011. Data on auxologic parameters, predicted height, parental height, and pubertal status were collected and compared between boys and girls.

Results

Boys accounted for a significantly higher percentage of the study group (65.8%, p < 0.001). At onset of GH therapy, there were no significant differences between boys and girls in age (10.2 ± 3.1 vs. 9.9 ± 2.4 years), height-standard deviation score (SDS) (-2.64 ± 0.5 vs. -2.79 ± 0.5), body mass index-SDS[(-0.65 ± 1.01) vs. (-0.80 ± 1.13)], or pubertal status (66% vs. 63.5% prepubertal). Predicted height-SDS was significantly higher in boys (-1.95 ± 1.05 vs. -2.56 ± 0.73, p < 0.001). Midparental height-SDS was similar in the two groups, as were paternal and maternal height.

Conclusions

The similar age, height deficit, and pubertal status at onset of GH treatment in boys and girls suggests that gender differences do not exist. Male predominance may stem from family preferences to treat boys. Future studies are warranted to assess the psychosocial aspects in the decision to initiate therapy.

### Recombinant growth hormone for idiopathic short stature in children and adolescents [^113qJhjJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) refers to children who are very short compared with their peers for unknown or hereditary reasons. Recombinant human growth hormone (GH) has been used to increase growth and final height in children with ISS.

Objectives

To assess the effects of recombinant human GH on short-term growth and final height in children with ISS.

Search Strategy

Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index, BIOSIS and Current Controlled Trials. Article reference lists were assessed for trials and experts and pharmaceutical companies were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials were included if they were carried out in children with ISS with normal GH secretion. GH had to be administered for a minimum of six months and be compared with placebo or no treatment. A growth or height outcome measure had to be assessed.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed studies for inclusion criteria and for methodological quality. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. The primary outcome was final height and secondary outcomes included short term growth, health related quality of life and adverse effects. To estimate summary treatment effects, data were pooled, when appropriate using a random effects model.

Main Results

Ten RCTs were included. One trial reported near final height in girls and found that girls treated with GH were 7.5 cm taller than untreated controls (GH group, 155.3 cm ± 6.4; control, 147.8 cm ± 2.6; P = 0.003); another trial which reported adult height standard deviation score found that children treated with GH were 3.7 cm taller than children in a placebo-treated group (95% confidence intervals 0.03 to 1.10; P < 0.04). The other trials reported short term outcomes. Results suggest that short-term height gains can range from none to approximately 0.7 SD over one year. One study reported health related quality of life and showed no significant improvement in GH treated children compared with those in the control group, whilst another found no significant evidence that GH treatment impacts psychological adaptation or self-perception in children with ISS. No serious adverse effects of treatment were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

GH therapy can increase short-term growth and improve (near) final height. Increases in height are such that treated individuals remain relatively short when compared with peers of normal stature. Large, multicentre RCTs are required which should focus on final height and address quality of life and cost issues.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^115rGqJg]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone therapy after malignancy — neoplasia counseling and timing: We recommend informing at-risk patients about available data on the potential risks of neoplasia, and we recommend shared decision-making that involves the patient, family, oncologist, and treating endocrinologist, including sharing with families the most recent risk data and the potential effect of GH treatment on timing of second neoplasm occurrence before GH initiation. For GH initiation after completion of tumor therapy with no evidence of ongoing tumor, a standard waiting period of 12 months to establish "successful therapy" of the primary lesion is reasonable but may be altered based on individual circumstances. A technical remark notes that although many intracranial tumors are not "malignant", they can recur, and there are no data to support different observation periods than for malignant tumors before initiating GH treatment.

### Consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of children with idiopathic short stature: a summary of the growth hormone research society, the lawson wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, and the European society for paediatric endocrinology workshop [^111Eu5hB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to summarize important advances in the management of children with idiopathic short stature (ISS).

Participants

Participants were 32 invited leaders in the field.

Evidence

Evidence was obtained by extensive literature review and from clinical experience.

Consensus

Participants reviewed discussion summaries, voted, and reached a majority decision on each document section.

Conclusions

ISS is defined auxologically by a height below -2 sd score (SDS) without findings of disease as evident by a complete evaluation by a pediatric endocrinologist including stimulated GH levels. Magnetic resonance imaging is not necessary in patients with ISS. ISS may be a risk factor for psychosocial problems, but true psychopathology is rare. In the United States and seven other countries, the regulatory authorities approved GH treatment (at doses up to 53 microg/kg.d) for children shorter than -2.25 SDS, whereas in other countries, lower cutoffs are proposed. Aromatase inhibition increases predicted adult height in males with ISS, but adult-height data are not available. Psychological counseling is worthwhile to consider instead of or as an adjunct to hormone treatment. The predicted height may be inaccurate and is not an absolute criterion for GH treatment decisions. The shorter the child, the more consideration should be given to GH. Successful first-year response to GH treatment includes an increase in height SDS of more than 0.3–0.5. The mean increase in adult height in children with ISS attributable to GH therapy (average duration of 4–7 yr) is 3.5–7.5 cm. Responses are highly variable. IGF-I levels may be helpful in assessing compliance and GH sensitivity; levels that are consistently elevated (> 2.5 SDS) should prompt consideration of GH dose reduction. GH therapy for children with ISS has a similar safety profile to other GH indications.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^116QLpQP]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) — GH counseling, monitoring, and dosing state that patients and their parents/guardians should be counseled that not starting GH therapy at all is an option, and since not all children with ISS will respond to GH therapy, HtSDS improvement after 12 months of therapy should be assessed and the discontinuation of GH therapy should be considered if adequate height gain has not been achieved; patients should be monitored for changes in psychological functioning and quality of life. Because there is overlap in response between dosing groups, we suggest initiating GH at a dose of 0.24 mg/ kg/week, with some patients requiring up to 0.47 mg/kg/ week; given the unresolved long-term risks of treatment, there should be caution in using higher doses, and GH therapy should be discontinued in patients who do not respond.

Growth hormone (GH) initiation and follow-up — We suggest a follow-up assessment of benefit in HtSDS and psychosocial impact 12 months after GH initiation and dose optimization. Because there is overlap in response between dosing groups, we suggest initiating GH at a dose of 0.24 mg/ kg/week, with some patients requiring up to 0.47 mg/kg/ week.

Growth hormone (GH) discontinuation threshold in pediatric dosing — duration of therapy — is stated as follows: We recommend that GH treatment at pediatric doses not continue beyond attainment of a growth velocity below 2–2.5 cm/year, and the decision to discontinue pediatric dosing prior to attainment of this growth velocity should be individualized.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^116xBW9M]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone dosing for growth hormone deficiency — adult height outcomes and initiation dose: The body of evidence concerning the effect of different GH dosing regimens on AH is of moderate-to-low quality, reported mean GH doses were 0.18–0.24 mg/kg/week with a range between 0.11 and 0.28 mg/ kg/week, and multivariate analyses did not consistently reveal a correlation between higher dosing and greater AH. The guidelines taskforce endorses harm prevention over unproven benefits and notes higher long-term risk and a certain higher cost burden on health-care systems with high dosing. Therefore, the panel elected to recommend initiation of GH at the lower dose range, and the lowest dose with demonstrated efficacy should be used.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) during the transition period — We suggest that GH treatment be offered to individuals with persistent GHD in the transition period, although the specifics of who benefits, timing, and optimal dose are not clear. The transition period is described as the time from late puberty to establishment of adult muscle and bone composition and encompasses attainment of adult height (AH). Evidence includes three RCTs in young adults with persistent GHD in which 2 years of GH treatment increased bone mineral density, normalized insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels, and improved lipid profiles from baseline, while a fourth RCT did not demonstrate differences after 2 years. Across studies, the duration of GH was 1–6 years and the average age at re‑initiation was 18–23 years with a range of 15–35 years; one study had an average age at transition of 16 years and a 1 month period off pediatric GH by design. Dosing used in RCTs varied from 12.5 to 25 μg/kg/day to 200 μg/day, and adult guidance suggests patients < 30 years may benefit from initial doses of 400–500 μg daily versus 200–300 μg daily for patients aged 30–60 years; those transitioning from pediatric to adult replacement and females receiving oral estrogen (but not transdermal) may need higher doses, and doses subsequently should be titrated to normalize the serum IGF‑I concentration for age and gender.

### Final adult height of children with idiopathic short stature: a multicenter study on GH therapy alone started during peri-puberty [^114jTd16]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic short status (ISS) is defined as a condition in which the height of an individual is more than 2SD score (SDS) below the corresponding mean height for a given age, sex, and population group without evidence of systemic, endocrine, nutritional, or chromosomal abnormalities. Children with ISS have normal birth weight and are GH sufficient. The incidence of ISS (including constitutional delay of growth and puberty and familial short stature) is about 23 in 1000. In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration approved growth hormone (GH) for the treatment of ISS patients (height < − 2.25 SD). The main purpose of GH therapy for ISS is to attain normal adult height and avoid daily life inconvenience and psychological problems caused by extreme or unacceptable short stature. However, few clinical studies have explored whether the final adult height (FAH) can reach the normal range after GH therapy. FAH is considered the golden indicator for evaluating the efficacy of GH therapy. However, the predicted FAH following a short period of treatment is dynamic and cannot reflect the actual FAH. Owing to the heterogeneity of the treated ISS populations and the individualization of treatment, only a few randomized trials with small sample sizes have observed ISS until FAH. A randomized study of FAH typically takes 8 years or more to complete and is often difficult to implement in clinical settings. Thus, most of the currently available studies only have small samples and are carried out in a single center. More studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of GH in the treatment of ISS.

In the clinical real world, many ISS children's parents are willing to observe their children growth when they are young. As children grow older and become peri-puberty, more people come to see doctors. What is the effect of GH treatment alone in peri-puberty? Past literatures are not accurate. This is the first multicenter study in China on the efficacy of growth hormone alone in the treatment of elder children. In our current study, we followed up children with ISS diagnosed by the departments of pediatric endocrinology in seven tertiary hospitals in different regions of mainland China, and evaluated the efficacy of GH for ISS children until FAH.

### High dose growth hormone treatment induces acceleration of skeletal maturation and an earlier onset of puberty in children with idiopathic short stature [^112tQUhJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Long term growth hormone (GH) treatment in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS) results in a relatively small mean gain in final height of 3–9 cm, which may not justify the cost of treatment. As it is unknown whether GH treatment during puberty adds to final height gain, we sought to improve the cost-benefit ratio, employing a study design with high dose GH treatment restricted to the prepubertal period.

Aims

To assess the effect of short term, high dose GH treatment before puberty on growth, bone maturation, and pubertal onset.

Methods

Five year results of a randomised controlled study are reported. Twenty six boys and nine girls were randomly assigned to a GH treatment group (n = 17) or a control group (n = 18). Inclusion criteria were: no signs of puberty, height less than -2 SDS, age 4–8 years for girls or 4–10 years for boys, GH concentration > 10 micro g/l after provocation, and normal body proportions. To assess GH responsiveness, children assigned to the GH treatment group received GH treatment for two periods of three months (1.5 IU/m2/day and 3.0 IU/m2/day), separated by three month washout periods, during the first year of study. High dose GH treatment (6.0 IU/m2/day) was then started and continued for at least two full years. When puberty occurred, GH treatment was discontinued at the end of a complete year's treatment (for example, three or four years of GH treatment).

Results

In response to at least two years on high dose GH treatment, mean (SD) height SDS for chronological age increased significantly in GH treated children from -2.6 (0.5) to -1.3 (0.5) after two years and -1.4 (0.5) SDS after five years of study. No changes in height SDS were observed in controls. A rapid rate of bone maturation of 3.6 years/2 years in treated children compared to 2 years/2 years in controls was observed in response to two years high dose GH treatment. Height SDS for bone age was not significantly different between groups during the study period. GH treated children entered into puberty at a significantly earlier age compared to controls.

Conclusions

High dose GH treatment before puberty accelerates bone age and induces an earlier onset of puberty. This may limit the potential therapeutic benefit of this regimen in ISS.

### Growth hormone (GH) treatment to final height in children with idiopathic short stature: evidence for a dose effect [^114FbLEU]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate in an open-label randomized study, the effect of two doses of growth hormone (GH) on final height and height velocity during the first 2 years of treatment of children with idiopathic short stature (mean baseline height standard deviation score [SDS] -3.2).

Study Design

Patients were treated with GH at 0.24 mg/kg/week, 0.24 mg/kg/week for the first year and at 0.37 mg/kg/week thereafter (0.24→0.37), or 0.37 mg/kg/week. Final height was evaluated in 50 patients at study completion (mean treatment duration, 6.5 years).

Results

Patients who received 0.37 mg/kg/week (n = 72) experienced a significantly greater increase in height velocity than those who received 0.24 mg/kg/week (n = 70) (treatment difference = 0.8 cm/year; p = 0.003) or 0.24→0.37 mg/kg/week (n = 67) (treatment difference = 0.9 cm/year; p = 0.001). For the 50 patients for whom final height measurements were available, mean height SDS increased by 1.55, 1.52, and 1.85 SDS, respectively, for the three dose groups. For the primary comparison between the 0.37 mg/kg/week and 0.24 mg/kg/week dose groups, the mean treatment difference (adjusted for differences in baseline predicted height SDS) was 0.57 SDS (3.6 cm; p = 0.025). Mean overall height gains (final height minus baseline predicted height) were 7.2 cm and 5.4 cm for the 0.37 mg/kg/week and 0.24 mg/kg/week dose groups, respectively, without dose effects on safety parameters. Final height measurements were within the normal adult height range for 94% of patients randomized to 0.37 mg/kg/week who continued to final height.

Conclusion

GH treatment dose-dependently increases height velocity and final height in children with idiopathic short stature.

### Effect of growth hormone dose on bone maturation and puberty in children with idiopathic short stature [^116qSzTM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

GH at 0.22 mg/kg.wk has been shown to have no effect on pubertal onset or pace, whereas GH at 0.5 mg/kg x wk has been shown to advance pubertal onset and bone maturation.

Objectives

Our objectives were to determine whether 0.37 mg/kg x wk GH advanced pubertal onset, pace, or bone maturation relative to 0.24 mg/kg x wk GH; whether 0.37 mg/kg x wk GH led to pubertal onset at an inappropriately early age; and whether age at start of GH therapy influenced pubertal onset.

Design

We conducted a randomized, open-label study to final height.

Patients

We studied children with idiopathic short stature.

Intervention

Patients were treated with 0.24 mg/kg x wk, 0.24 increasing to 0.37 mg/kg x wk, or 0.37 mg/kg x wk.

Main Outcome Measures

We assessed age at pubertal onset and rates of bone maturation, Tanner stage development, and increase in testicular volume (boys only).

Results

For the primary comparison between the 0.24 and 0.37 mg/kg x wk dose groups, median ages of pubertal onset (in years) were similar (13.7 vs. 13.5 for boys and 11.7 vs. 11.4 for girls) and were greater than those for the general population for each sex. Age at start of GH therapy did not appear to influence pubertal onset for either sex. Rates of pubertal pace and bone maturation were not significantly different between the 0.24 and 0.37 mg/kg x wk dose groups for either sex.

Conclusion

GH at 0.37 mg/kg x wk does not appear to accelerate pubertal onset, pace, or bone maturation compared with GH at 0.24 mg/kg x wk in patients with idiopathic short stature. From a clinical standpoint, our results suggest that the approved dose range of up to 0.37 mg/kg x wk GH does not lead to pubertal onset at an inappropriately early age.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^115UD1Z8]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

IGF-I dosing — suggested regimens and evidence: We suggest an IGF-I dose of 80–120 μg/kg, b.i.d., noting that similar short-term outcomes were seen with 80 and 120 μg and there is no strong evidence supporting superiority of one dose over the other (Conditional recommendation); Technical Remark: Outside of the United States, IGF-I is also used at 150–180 μg/kg q.d. Reported regimens include twice-daily 40–120 μg/kg/dose or once-daily 150–200 μg/kg, and the once-daily approach is still followed by some, claiming similar growth velocities and fewer side effects. Evidence is limited to heterogeneous, largely short-term data; for example, a single open-label, uncontrolled report of adult or near-AH (defined as bone age at least 16 years for males and 14 for females) in 21 patients treated with IGF-I for a mean of 10 years began at 40 μg/kg b.i.d. and increased by 40 μg/kg increments every 2 weeks up to 120 μg/kg b.i.d., with some receiving 40–80 μg/kg b.i.d. and some as high as 150 μg/kg b.i.d., and was further confounded by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy in 9 subjects; overall, this approach is fraught with limitations that preclude determination of definitive recommendations.

Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I care — diagnostic and outcome priorities emphasize improved diagnostics, including universal adoption of standardized IGF-I and GH assays and standards, refinement or development of GH provocative and IGF-I generation tests to better distinguish deficiency from sufficiency, and incorporation of expanding genetic testing and therapeutic responsiveness markers; imaging advances beyond current MRI for gross lesions may enable detection of subtle clinically relevant changes, while validated quality-of-life instruments and collection of long-term safety data in adults treated during childhood remain needed for defining effective, safe care.

### Treatment of children and adolescents with idiopathic short stature [^113YLKhG]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is defined as shortness in childhood without a specific cause. ISS may be familial or nonfamilial and may be associated with or without delay of pubertal development. Treatment can be considered in an attempt to reduce the psychological burden caused by short stature in childhood and adult life. If counselling alone is not sufficient, medical modifications of the growth process can be attempted. In cases with pubertal delay, sex steroids, such as testosterone and oxandrolone, can favourably influence height velocity and growth tempo, although adult height is not affected. Medications that prolong the process of growth — for example, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or aromatase inhibitors — might increase adult height, but findings to date are still experimental. Growth hormone therapy is approved for the treatment of very short children with reduced adult height expectation, as evidence has accumulated that this therapy can increase height in childhood and in adult life. Sensitivity to growth hormone is impaired in patients with ISS; therefore, doses higher than a replacement dose have to be applied. This treatment still needs to be optimized in terms of efficacy, cost-effectiveness and long-term safety. A debate is ongoing concerning the psychological benefit of height increase, with clinicians warning against the medicalization of a deviation in height.

### Effect of growth hormone treatment on adult height in peripubertal children with idiopathic short stature: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1139jmBV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

GH is often used to treat children with idiopathic short stature despite the lack of definitive, long-term studies of efficacy. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of GH on adult height in peripubertal children. Subjects (n = 68; 53 males and 15 females), 9–16 yr old, with marked, idiopathic short stature [height or predicted height ≤ -2.5 sd score (SDS)] received either GH (0.074 mg/kg) or placebo sc three times per week until they were near adult height. At study termination, adult height measurements were available for 33 patients after mean treatment duration of 4.4 yr. Adult height was greater in the GH-treated group (-1.81 ± 0.11 SDS, least squares mean ± sem) than in the placebo-treated group (-2.32 ± 0.17 SDS) by 0.51 SDS (3.7 cm; P < 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.92 SDS). A similar GH effect was demonstrated in terms of adult height SDS minus baseline height SDS and adult height SDS minus baseline predicted height SDS. Modified intent-to-treat analysis in 62 patients treated for at least 6 months indicated a similar GH effect on last observed height SDS (0.52 SDS; 3.8 cm; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.82 SDS) and no important dropout bias. In conclusion, GH treatment increases adult height in peripubertal children with marked idiopathic short stature.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^114AUrYc]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) — growth hormone dosing and response benchmarks are described as follows: A controlled series found no difference in AH using 0.5 or 1 IU/kg/week (roughly equivalent to 0.17 or 0.33 mg/kg/week), and no data exist to support advantages of weight-based dosing at > 0.47 mg/kg/week in children with ISS. Short-term data suggest that targeting GH dosing to IGF-I levels may improve the growth response, but there are no data to AH. Modeling suggests determinants may include height deficit relative to genetic targets (HtSDS – MPH SDS) and younger age at treatment start (< 10 years in boys and < 9 years in girls). For benchmarking response, at ages 3–8 years healthy children may have a normal increase in HtSDS of < 0.3, and many studies use an increase in HtSDS of greater than 0.3–0.5 over 1 year; these values have been suggested in a consensus statement, and published height velocity targets for the first year of GH therapy can be used as reference.

Pediatric Endocrine Society guideline on growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) treatment — scope, population, and methods — states that on behalf of the Drug and Therapeutics, and Ethics Committees of the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the guideline updates the guidelines published in 2003 on the use of GH and focuses on idiopathic short stature (ISS), GH deficiency (GHD), and primary IGF-I deficiency (PIGFD), thereby adding recombinant IGF-I therapy to the GH guidelines for the first time. The guideline was developed following the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) and provides recommendations for the clinical management of children and adolescents with growth failure from GHD, ISS, or PIGFD using the best available evidence. The taskforce suggests that the recommendations be applied in clinical practice with consideration of the evolving literature and the risks and benefits to each individual patient, and notes that in many instances careful review highlights areas that need further research.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) — growth hormone treatment approach: In the United States, for children who meet FDA criteria, we suggest a shared decision-making approach to pursuing GH treatment for a child with ISS, and the decision can be made on a case-by-case basis after assessment of physical and psychological burdens and discussion of risks and benefits. We recommend against the routine use of GH in every child with height SDS (HtSDS) ≤ −2.25. While studies have shown GH treatment increases the mean height of treated cohorts, there is marked interindividual variability in responses, including some individuals who do not respond to treatment.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) — growth hormone dosing and IGF-I monitoring in children: We recommend the use of weight-based or body surface area (BSA)-based GH dosing in children with GHD, and we cannot make a recommendation regarding IGF-I-based dosing. We recommend an initial GH dose of 0.16–0.24 mg/kg/week (22–35 μg/kg/day) with individualization of subsequent dosing, and some patients may require higher doses. We suggest measurement of serum IGF-I levels to monitor adherence/production and suggest lowering the GH dose if IGF-I rises above the laboratory-defined normal range for age or pubertal stage. During puberty, we recommend against the routine increase in GH dose to 0.7 mg/kg/week in every child with GHD; the change in GH dose does not continue beyond attainment of a growth velocity below 2–2.5 cm/year, and the decision to discontinue pediatric dosing prior to attainment of this growth velocity should be individualized.

Growth hormone discontinuation and reassessment — pediatric growth hormone deficiency (GHD): Studies defining near–adult height (AH) used growth-rate thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 3 cm/ year, most commonly 2 to 2.5 cm/ year, and bone age cutoffs of 14–15 years in girls and 16–17 years in boys; the taskforce notes acromegalic changes are possible with pediatric dosing in adolescents with fused epiphyseal plates and should be avoided, and the panel recommends evaluation for persistent GHD. Given individual variability, it may be appropriate to discontinue growth hormone (GH) therapy earlier in some individuals, and in most clinics the diagnosis of GHD may be reconsidered with GH axis re-evaluation upon achievement of AH; re-examination of the GH axis 1 or more years after diagnosis of idiopathic IGHD in still growing children can yield normal results in a majority of patients, and nonrandomized data reported absolute height in centimeters not significantly different between groups that discontinued versus continued GH in specific contexts.

### Effects of different therapy regimens to increase final adult height in males at advanced bone age with idiopathic short stature [^112wQhuZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy is the most effective treatment for idiopathic short stature (ISS) in children. When given to prepubertal children, rhGH can successfully increase the growth velocity and adult height. However, due to early puberty onset and (or) delayed initial consultation, some adolescent children with ISS experience accelerated linear bone growth at the time of treatment. It is generally agreed that an advanced stage of bone age in pubescent boys limits the application window in which to treat with rhGH. Thus, to maximize the adult height (AHt), endocrinologists have sought therapeutic alternatives to delay bone maturation and epiphyseal fusion.

Estrogen is a well-known regulator of endochondral bone growth and plays an essential role in controlling longitudinal bone growth during puberty by promoting the closure of the epiphyses. GnRHa, which promotes the regression of sexual characteristics by competing for receptors and inhibiting gonadotropin secretion, can effectively delay bone maturation and improve the adult height achieved by children. However, blocking estrogen production might delay epiphyseal fusion, potentially leading to a prolonged period of longitudinal growth and an increased final AHt. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) block the activity of the aromatase enzyme CYP 19, which promotes the production of estrogen from androgens. Several studies have suggested that monotherapy with GnRHa or AIs can have a small and variable effect on adult height for short stature at advanced bone age and is generally not recommended. However, combination therapy with rhGH and GnRHa or rhGH and AIs has potential value. Additionally, whether the AHt can reach the normal range after therapy is considered the gold standard for evaluating therapy efficacy. However, to date, few clinical studies have been published. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the effect of different treatments on increasing the AHt of boys at advanced bone age with ISS.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^113oRCqX]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) — growth hormone (GH) therapy is costly and of uncertain benefit, and GH for height augmentation in children who do not fit ISS criteria should be discouraged. The high cost of GH therapy is stated as USD 35,000–50,000 per year of treatment, and the text notes that no evidence exists that added height improves quality of life or provides any other benefit, with no justification to tolerate even small potential harms. It adds that treating patients with ISS requires careful evaluation and monitoring with consideration of alternative treatments such as psychological counseling, and concludes that regardless of parents' ability to pay, GH treatment for this purpose should be discouraged.

Growth hormone (GH) treatment — balance of benefit, risk, and cost in growth hormone deficiency (GHD) versus idiopathic short stature (ISS): Children with severe GHD clearly benefit from GH treatment such that benefits markedly outweigh potential harms, whereas for children with ISS who do not have GHD the benefits of achieving taller stature via GH are uncertain and of lesser magnitude; the degree of psychosocial disability in ISS is not clear, and accordingly when benefits are limited and uncertain, even small or low-probability harms become important because children with ISS are healthy and will remain healthy without treatment.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^112qrAyw]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) management — In the United States, for children who meet FDA criteria, we suggest a shared decision‑making approach to pursuing growth hormone (GH) treatment for a child with ISS, and we recommend against the routine use of GH in every child with height standard deviation score (HtSDS) less than −2.25. We suggest a follow‑up assessment of benefit in HtSDS and psychosocial impact 12 months after GH initiation and dose optimization. GH increases adult height (AH) in some children with ISS; ISS is heterogeneous and includes familial ISS and nonfamilial ISS, both with and without pubertal delay, and genetic disorders affecting the growth plate such as SHOX and NPR2 defects must be excluded with attention to body proportions. Patients with ISS and their families should be counseled that responses vary and that, on average, there will be an approximately 5‑cm (2‑inch) increase in AH.

### Growth hormone regimens in Australia: analysis of the first 3 years of treatment for idiopathic growth hormone deficiency and idiopathic short stature [^115BzVNS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate response to growth hormone (GH) in the first, second and third years of treatment for all idiopathic GH-deficient (GHD) and idiopathic short stature (ISS) patients in Australia.

Context

Eligibility for subsidized GH treatment in Australia is determined on auxological criteria for the indication of Short Stature and Slow Growth (SSSG), which includes ISS (SSSG-ISS). The biochemical GHD (BGHD, peak GH < 10 mU/l) and SSSG indications are treated similarly: starting dose of 4·5 mg/m(2)/week with provision for incremental dosing. Some ISS patients were specifically diagnosed with familial short stature (SSSG-FSS).

Design

Responses for each year of treatment for BGHD, SSSG-ISS and SSSG-FSS cohorts were compared in relation to influencing variables and with international benchmarks. The effect of incremental dosing was assessed.

Patients

Australian BGHD, SSSG-ISS and SSSG-FSS patients who had completed 1, 2, or 3 years of treatment and were currently receiving GH.

Measurements

Growth hormone dose, change in height-standard deviation score (ΔSDS) and growth velocity (GV).

Results

First-year response was 2–3 times greater than that in subsequent years: ΔSDS(1st year) = 0·92, 0·50 and 0·46 for BGHD, SSSG-ISS and SSSG-FSS, respectively. Responses were similar to international reports and inversely related to age at commencement of GH. First-year GV-for-age for BGHD patients was similar to international standards for idiopathic GHD. However, girls had an inferior response to boys when treatment commenced at < 6 years of age. First-year GV-for-age for SSSG-ISS/FSS patients was less than ISS standards. Dose increments attenuated the first- to second-year decline in response to BGHD but marginally improved the responses for SSSG-ISS/FSS.

Conclusions

The Australian auxology-based GH programme produces comparable responses to international programmes. A lower starting dose is offset by the initiation of treatment at younger ages. Incremental dosing does not appear optimal. A first-year dose of 6·4–6·9 mg/m(2)/week for GHD and 8·9 mg/m(2)/week for ISS with early commencement of GH treatment may be most efficacious.

### A review of guidelines for use of growth hormone in pediatric and transition patients [^112twqe4]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Growth hormone (GH) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in pediatric patients with disorders of growth failure or short stature and in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and HIV/AIDS wasting and cachexia. For pediatric patients, guidelines for the use of GH have been developed by several organizations that have identified specific criteria for initiating GH therapy for each FDA-approved indication. Guidelines for adults have also been developed and include recommendations for transition (adolescent) patients with GHD. These patients are often treated with GH as children but may require continued treatment as young adults to attain full skeletal mineralization and improve cardiovascular risk factors. Adult and pediatric guidelines are supported by efficacy and safety studies, which show that, when started at an early age, GH treatment can increase growth velocity and that GH is safe and well-tolerated. We summarize the guidelines that are available for all FDA-approved indications among pediatric and transition patients. Adherence to these guidelines will help to ensure that patients with disorders of growth failure or short stature receive the necessary therapy to increase linear growth and transition smoothly to healthy adulthood.

### Effects of different therapy regimens to increase final adult height in males at advanced bone age with idiopathic short stature [^11615JVM]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, different therapeutic approaches to improve the adult height of males with ISS and at advanced bone ages were investigated. The optimal strategy remains a matter of debate. Therefore, for children with ISS and at advanced bone age, clinicians should weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the various treatments prior to selecting a treatment protocol.

Growth hormone dose individualization after initiation in growth hormone deficiency: Interindividual variability in growth velocity suggests that subsequent dosing should be individualized, and one randomized study comparing standard weight-based versus individualized GH dosing modeled from pretreatment characteristics found that after 2 years of treatment the HtSDS – MPH SDS was similar between groups (−0.42 ± 0.46 vs. −0.48 ± 0.67) while the individualized group had a narrower SDS range (2.25 vs. 3.36). These models have not been evaluated by randomized controlled trials, and a statement on the most effective strategy to individualize GH dosing after GH initiation cannot be surmised from the available data.

### Height velocity targets from the national cooperative growth study for first-year growth hormone responses in short children [^114BbkXE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Although GH has been used to treat short stature in GH deficiency (GHD) and other conditions for more than 40 yr, criteria for satisfactorily defining targets for GH responsiveness have never been developed.

Objective

The objective of this study was to present the first-year growth expressed as height velocity (HV) for prepubertal boys and girls with idiopathic GHD, organic GHD, idiopathic short stature, or Turner syndrome from Genentech's National Cooperative Growth Study to derive age-specific targets for GH responsiveness for each etiology and gender.

Design and Population

Using data from the National Cooperative Growth Study, we constructed curves of response to GH during the first year of treatment with standard daily doses in naive-to-treatment prepubertal children with idiopathic GHD (2323 males, 842 females), organic GHD (582 males, 387 females), idiopathic short stature (1392 males, 465 females), or Turner syndrome (1367 females).

Main Outcome Measure

For each category, mean pretreatment and mean ± 1 and ± 2 sd for the first-year HV on GH were assessed. Mean and mean ± 1 sd for HV were plotted vs. age at baseline (initiation of GH treatment) and compared with mean pretreatment HV.

Results

HV plots for each category as a factor of age at baseline are presented. Mean - 2 sd HV plots approximated the pretreatment HV.

Conclusion

Using baseline age- and gender-specific targets will assist clinicians in assessing a patient's first-year growth response. We propose that HV below the mean - 1 sd on these plots be considered a "poor" response. These curves may be used to identify patients who may benefit from GH dose adjustment, to assess compliance issues, or to challenge the original diagnosis.

Conclusions

In summary, both girls and boys of ISS improved FAH by GH therapy even if treatments begin over 10 years old and majority of them reached TH. Some peri-puberty ISS will have a spontaneous height gain. We recommend the course of GH treatment more than 2 years for girls, and longer courses for boys.

Growth hormone safety and monitoring — children receiving GH: Postmarketing data indicate a low frequency (i.e., < 3% of treated children) of adverse effects and a favorable on-treatment safety profile, but potential risks should be evaluated individually by diagnosis. We recommend that prospective recipients of GH treatment receive anticipatory guidance regarding potential adverse effects including intracranial hypertension and slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), and we recommend monitoring by soliciting pertinent history and performing a physical examination at every follow-up clinic visit; further testing should be pursued if indicated (Strong recommendation, ●●●○). Intracranial hypertension occurs at an overall incidence of 28 per 100,000 treatment-years, generally during treatment initiation or dosage increases and reverses with discontinuation of GH; treatment can often be reinstituted at lower doses without return of symptoms. SCFE is reported at an incidence of 73 per 100,000 treatment years.

The expansion of growth hormone therapy over the last 3 decades has allowed for treatment of short stature for more children, resulting in increased height for many. However, treatment of idiopathic short stature remains controversial. Treatment decisions for disabled children with idiopathic short stature are even more complicated. We discuss a specific case of short stature in a disabled child and grapple with the ethical issues involved in the use of growth hormone.

### Short-acting growth hormone supplementation for bone age and growth rate in children with idiopathic short stature: a meta-analysis [^111rrtyG]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore the effect of short-acting growth hormone (GH) supplementation on bone age and growth rate of children with idiopathic short stature.

Methods

The authoritative databases such as PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science were extensively searched through the systematic and comprehensive literature retrieval strategy to compile the clinical research data on the treatment of idiopathic short stature with short-acting GH. The study will be strictly screened to ensure that all enrolled research subjects are patients with idiopathic short stature, and the intervention method is defined as short-acting GH replacement therapy, and a reasonable control group is set, such as placebo treatment, to ensure the scientificity and comparability of research results. Outcome index data such as basic characteristics, sample size, follow-up time, and total effective rate of the included studies were extracted. In this study, RevMan 5.3, a professional statistical software tool, was used to systematically perform the meta-analysis process. Weighted average difference (WMD) was calculated as the primary outcome to evaluate the effect of bone age and growth rate, and the WAD in adverse reactions was considered as the secondary outcome.

Results

Nine studies were included in the study, and 491 patients with idiopathic short stature were included in the study. The results of the meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in bone age but a significant difference in growth rate when compared with the control group.

Conclusion

Short-acting GH supplementation can significantly improve the growth rate of children with idiopathic short stature, but has little effect on bone age.

GH therapy safety and dosing exposure — metabolic and oncologic considerations: The guideline notes that type 2 DM is not evident overall, but should be considered in patients at higher risk; levels of endogenous cortisol can decrease due to GH effects such that GH therapy in severe GHD may unmask previously unsuspected central adrenal insufficiency; and GH does not increase risk for new malignancy in children without risk factors, with current data suggesting a slight-to-absent effect on increasing or hastening onset of second neoplasms in those previously treated for cancer, particularly when treatment included cranial irradiation. Most patient-years analyzed involve GH doses for hormone replacement in GHD (< 0.3 mg/kg/week), whereas non-GHD patients may receive pharmacological doses such as 0.375 mg/kg/week for ISS and 0.7 mg/kg/week for "pubertal dosing". Studies of non-GH-treated populations suggest that high-normal free IGF-I levels may increase rates of breast and prostate cancers, warranting continued vigilance for neoplasia risk.

### Growth hormone treatment in children with short stature: impact of the diagnosis on parents [^115QgYRb]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This prospective multicenter study aimed (1) to examine changes in parent-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of children with short stature and the effects of the children's condition on parents themselves within the first year of human growth hormone (hGH) treatment and (2) to predict effects on parents based on main and interaction effects of children's HRQOL and increase in height.

Methods

A total of 110 parents of children aged 4–18 years, diagnosed with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency, small for gestational age, or idiopathic short stature, were recruited from 11 participating German pediatric endocrinologists and asked to fill out the short stature-specific Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth (QoLISSY) Questionnaire before hGH treatment was initiated and one year later.

Results

Negative effects of the children's short stature on the parents decrease over time, independent of diagnosis and treatment status. Furthermore, treatment status and height increase moderated the links between children's improved HRQOL as perceived by their parents and decreased caregiving burden.

Conclusions

Based on the children's improved HRQOL and the parent's decrease in caregiving burden, patient-reported outcomes that consider parental and child's perspectives should be considered when deciding on hGH treatment for children.

### Short-acting growth hormone supplementation for bone age and growth rate in children with idiopathic short stature: a meta-analysis [^112uHoTw]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is a common condition in pediatrics and one of the growth and development disorders. The main manifestation of ISS is that the height of children is significantly lower than the average height of children of the same age and gender who are normal. The body proportion is normal, and there is no definite etiology such as systemic, endocrine and nutritional diseases or chromosome abnormalities. During growth, children grow at a slower rate, which may affect their future height potential and mental health. At present, one of the main treatment methods for ISS is growth hormone (GH) therapy, but the therapeutic effect varies from individual to individual. GH is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland of human body, which can promote the synthesis of protein, cell proliferation and bone growth. Under the long-term action of GH, the growth and development process of the human body can be significantly affected. In the treatment of some diseases such as GH deficiency, Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, long-term or even lifetime use of GH may be required to maintain normal growth, development and body metabolic function. However, long-term use of GH has certain effects, such as abnormal glucose metabolism, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, etc. The treatment of ISS mainly focuses on promoting faster growth and improving the symptoms related to specific growth disorders in the short term. It is suitable for the use of short-acting GH replacement therapy, which can play a role in promoting rapid growth after injection. At the same time, unnecessary risks are reduced because treatment options can be adjusted timely according to the specific conditions of children. However, the effect of short-acting GH supplementation on bone age and growth rate in children with idiopathic short stature is still controversial. Although studies have explored the effects of short-acting GH supplementation on children with idiopathic short stature, the results of these studies are inconsistent. In addition, the existing studies are mostly single, with small sample size and lack of systematic comprehensive analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the effects of short-acting GH supplementation on bone age and growth rate of children with idiopathic short stature, so as to provide more reliable evidence for clinical treatment.

We recommend re-assessment of both the adrenal and thyroid axes after initiation of GH therapy in patients whose cause of GHD is associated with possible multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHD).

### Adult height in children with idiopathic short stature treated with growth hormone [^117RHFeJ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) includes a heterogeneous group of patients with common characteristics to those of familial short stature and constitutional delay. Some authors state that these children can often respond to GH treatment, thus increasing their adult height. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of GH treatment (0.5–0.7 IU/kg/week) and the influence of some initial variables on adult height in patients with ISS. It was a non-randomized, observational study of 30 boys with ISS and a historical control group of 42 patients. The patients were followed until achieving their adult height. The mean height gain of the treated group attributable to GH was 4.5 cm. A stepwise regression model considering predicted adult height and target height as independent variables and final height as dependent variable gave an R2 coefficient of 0.38. We conclude that GH significantly increases final height in boys with ISS.

### Early growth hormone initiation leads to favorable long-term growth outcomes in children born small for gestational age [^1163doUY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone (GH) therapy is widely used for the treatment of short stature in children with a number of disorders, including GH deficiency (GHD), Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Noonan syndrome, idiopathic short stature (ISS), chronic renal failure, short stature homeobox containing gene deficiency, and short children born small for gestational age (SGA). According to consensus guidelines, newborns with a birth weight and/or length standard deviation score (SDS) of < −2 for gestational age are considered SGA. Although most infants born SGA show early spontaneous catch-up growth, short stature persists into childhood and adulthood in approximately 10% of patients. GH therapy is approved for the treatment of children born SGA who fail to show spontaneous catch-up growth by 2 to 4 years of age in the United States, or by 4 years of age or later in Europe. The effectiveness of GH treatment for improving growth outcomes in children born SGA has been well documented.

A consensus statement on the management of short children born SGA recommends starting GH therapy at a young age, and in patients born SGA with Silver–Russell syndrome, initiation of GH treatment at age 2 to 4 years is recommended. However, real-world data indicate that the initiation of GH treatment in SGA patients is often delayed. In the observational NordiNet ® International Outcome Study (IOS), the mean age at GH treatment start was 8.5 years in France, 7.7 years in Germany, and 7.1 years in the UK. Early age at GH treatment initiation has been shown to be an important predictor of growth response in patients born SGA and there is evidence that starting GH therapy at an early age is associated with improved height outcomes. Accordingly, greater gains in height standard deviation score (HSDS) have been observed among GH-treated children born SGA aged < 4 years compared with older patients.

Discussion

The most significant manifestation of children with idiopathic short stature is their height, which is significantly lower than that of their peers. The causes of this disorder are very complex and may involve complex interactions of genetic, endocrine, environmental and other factors. Children grow up slowly in height, often in lower positions in a class or group. Physically, a short stature may affect a child's physical function and motor ability. For example, when participating in some sports activities, they may face difficulties due to their insufficient height, which may affect their overall physical development. Psychologically, children with idiopathic short stature tend to have inferiority complex, anxiety, depression and other bad emotions. In school and social occasions, may suffer from other people's strange eyes and laugh at, do great harm to their mental health. This psychological pressure may even continue into adulthood, thus affecting their career choices and social life. In terms of bone age, most children have normal or slightly lagging bone age, which means that their bone maturity is relatively lagging compared with the actual age, but also provides a certain time window for potential therapeutic intervention. In terms of growth rate, children with idiopathic short stature usually grow at normal or slightly below normal rates. This kind of unobservable growth retardation is often easily ignored by parents, and it is not until the height gap with peers is gradually widened that attention is paid to it.

Growth hormone (GH) therapy — patient information and rare adverse effects — includes that we recommend that prospective recipients of GH treatment be informed about the uncertainty regarding long-term safety (posttreatment adverse effects in adulthood) (Ungraded good practice statement), and available data support that certain adverse effects associated with rapid growth (scoliosis progression and SCFE) and others of unknown mechanism (intracranial hypertension) occur rarely and merit anticipatory guidance and close monitoring; insulin sensitivity is reduced, but overt hyperglycemia is rare.

Growth hormone and IGF-I therapy — initial treatment selection in unexplained IGF-I deficiency: We recommend a trial of GH therapy before initiating IGF-I for patients with unexplained IGF-I deficiency (Strong recommendation).

Studies have shown that the growth response of patients with GHD to GH treatment is greater than growth response of patients with PIGFD to IGF-I, with peak growth velocities of 10–12 cm/year versus 8–9 cm/year, respectively; GH is a once-daily subcutaneous injection, while IGF-I (in the United States) is administered as twice-daily subcutaneous injections, and hypoglycemia is not a risk with GH therapy, as it is with IGF-I treatment.

Another comparison without untreated controls in 239 children reported dosing of 0.24 mg/kg/week, 0.24 for the first year then 0.37 mg/kg/week thereafter, or 0.37 mg/kg/week with mean HtSDS changes from baseline of 1.55 ± 0.14, 1.52 ± 0.27, and 1.85 ± 0.2, respectively, with statistical testing not performed between groups.

Growth hormone therapy — glucose metabolism and diabetes risk: We recommend discussion about and monitoring of glucose metabolism of GH recipients who are at increased risk for diabetes due to insulin resistance. The incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is not increased by GH therapy, but overall data suggest decreases in insulin sensitivity are concurrent with GH therapy and return toward normal with cessation of treatment, no clear adverse effects on glucose metabolism during and following GH therapy, and that monitoring for potential development of diabetes with blood testing for glucose and/or HbA1c levels should be focused on GH recipients at high risk. Children with type 1 DM will require higher doses of insulin if/when concurrently treated with GH, GH may induce glucose intolerance and manifest hyperglycemia in the prediabetic phase of type 1 DM in those with compromised insulin secretion or sensitivity, and reported effects on type 2 DM incidence include both an increase and no change compared to expectations.

### Dose-sparing and safety-enhancing effects of an IGF-I-based dosing regimen in short children treated with growth hormone in a 2-year randomized controlled trial: therapeutic and pharmacoeconomic considerations [^117VzKT3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Context and Objective

Titrating the dosage of growth hormone (GH) to serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a feasible treatment strategy in children with GH deficiency (GHD) and idiopathic short stature (ISS). The objective was to assess the dose-sparing effect and theoretical safety of IGF-I-based GH therapy.

Design, Setting and Patients

This was a post hoc analysis of a previously described 2-year, multicenter, open-label, randomized, outpatient, controlled clinical trial in 172 prepubertal short children [age 7·5 ± 2·4 years; height standard deviation score (HSDS) -2·64 ± 0·61] classified by baseline peak GH levels as GHD (< 7 ng/ml) or ISS (≥ 7 ng/ml).

Intervention

Conventional weight-based dosing of GH (0·04 mg/kg/day) (n = 34) or GH dosing titrated to an IGF-I target of 0 SDS (IGF0T; n = 70) or an IGF-I target of +2 SDS (IGF2T; n = 68).

Main Outcome Measures

Change in HSDS per GH mg/kg/day dose (∆HSDS/GH dose ratio) and proportion of IGF-I levels above +2 SDS at the end of 2 years.

Results

GH dosing titrated to an IGF-I target of 0 SDS was the most dose-sparing treatment regimen for GHD or ISS children (mean ± SE ∆HSDS/GH dose ratios 48·1 ± 4·4 and 32·5 ± 2·8, respectively) compared with conventional dosing (30·3 ± 6·6 and 21·3 ± 3·5, respectively; P = 0·02, P = 0·005) and IGF2T (32·7 ± 4·8 and 16·3 ± 2·8, respectively; P = 0·02, P < 0·0001). IGF0T also resulted in the fewest IGF-I excursions above +2 SDS (6·8% vs 30·0% for conventional dosing; P < 0·01).

Conclusions

IGF-I-based GH dosing, targeted to age- and gender-adjusted means, may offer a more dose-sparing and potentially safer mode of therapy than traditional weight-based dosing.

### Efficacy and safety results of long-term growth hormone treatment of idiopathic short stature [^116mbZPU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Small clinical trials of GH treatment of idiopathic short stature (ISS) show variable efficacy.

Objective

The study was an analysis of a large GH registry for efficacy and safety of GH treatment of ISS. There was also a comparison with a specific clinical trial.

Design

Up to 7 yr of GH treatment of ISS was evaluated for efficacy and safety in the National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS).

Setting

The NCGS study was conducted at Genentech, Inc. and included 47,226 patients.

Patients

The ISS group included maximum stimulated GH 10 ng/ml or more and/or a report of ISS by investigator (n = 8018; all included for safety). Cohort 1 (n = 2520) was similar to the clinical trial, cohort 2 (n = 283) included subjects younger than 5 yr of age, and cohort 3 (n = 940) was pubertal at GH start.

Intervention

GH, approximately 0.30 mg/kg.wk, was given.

Main Outcome Measures

These included growth velocities and height sd (HtSDS).

Results

Mean first-year growth velocities in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 increased 4.6, 3.9, and 4.4 cm/yr over pretreatment, respectively. Measures included: baseline mean HtSDS, -2.9, -3.2, and -2.8; mean HtSDS at 1 yr, -2.4, -2.3, and -2.3, respectively. Mean HtSDS after 7 yr in cohorts 1 (n = 303) and 2 (n = 85) and 5 yr in cohort 3 (n = 58) were: -1.2, -1.0, and -1.5, respectively. Cohort 3 shorter treatment time was due to advanced baseline age (mean 13.8 yr) and puberty. Mean HtSDS gain in cohort 1 was comparable with the clinical trial. No new safety signals specific to the NCGS ISS population were observed.

Conclusion

ISS patients in the GH registry demonstrate a significant increase in HtSDS with the safety profile similar to GH-deficient patients. RESULTS were similar to the clinical trial.

### The effect of treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on linear growth and adult height in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pJCC2]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is a recognized, albeit a controversial indication for treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). The objective of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analyses of selected studies about the use of rhGH in children with ISS on linear growth and adult height (AH).

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies published till February 28, 2017 in the following databases: Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials. After exclusion of duplicate studies, 3,609 studies were initially identified. Of those, 3,497 studies were excluded during the process of assessing the title and/or the abstract. The remaining 112 studies were evaluated further by assessing the full text; 21 of them fulfilled all the criteria in order to be included in the current meta-analysis.

Results

Children who received rhGH had significantly higher height increment at the end of the first year, an effect that persisted in the second year of treatment and achieved significantly higher AH than the control group. The difference between the two groups was equal to 5.3 cm (95% CI: 3.4–7 cm) for male and 4.7 cm (95% CI: 3.1–6.3 cm) for female patients.

Conclusion

In children with ISS, treatment with rhGH improves short-term linear growth and increases AH compared with control subjects. However, the final decision should be made on an individual basis, following detailed diagnostic evaluation and careful consideration of both risks and benefits of rhGH administration.

Among the 344 ISS patients in seven centers, there were 217 boys and 127 girls. The average age of boys and girls when starting the treatment (baseline) was 12.7 ± 1. 87 and 11.7 ± 1.61 years, with bone age of 11.7 ± 2.32 years and 10.1 ± 2.03 years, respectively. The growth stopped at the final follow-up visit, with a mean age of 18.5 ± 2.25 years for boys and 18.0 ± 2.02 years for girls (Table 1).

Table 1
General data

The baseline height SDS of boys and girls was − 3.07 and − 2.74, and the FAH SDS was − 1.91 and − 1.38, respectively. Compared with the baseline height SDS, the FAH SDS was significantly increased in both boys and girls (both P = 0.0000) (Table 1).

### Final adult height of children with idiopathic short stature: a multicenter study on GH therapy alone started during peri-puberty [^111vp4N9]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first observational multicenter study with FAH results in China on the efficacy of growth hormone alone for ISS. It was an observational study based on the clinical reality and reflected the real-world situation. In addition to the follow-up of FAH, the difference between FAH SDS and baseline height SDS and between FAH height SDS and TH SDS was also evaluated. It was found that a treatment course of 2 years or more had better efficacy. Even for over 10 years old ISS children, GH therapy could improve FAH if the treatment course was long enough.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been recognized as high-quality research evidence because of their rigorous grouping/screening criteria and standardized treatment. However, sometimes RCTs do not actually reflect the clinical reality because the efficacy of GH for ISS varies greatly and the GH treatment is highly individualized in the true clinical setting. Although real-world retrospective studies are feasible, their data are limited by the natural characteristics of the treated children. In the study of short stature, it is difficult to find a control group without treatment: in clinical practice, few children will adhere to the follow-up protocol if no GH treatment is applied. In the current study, patients who had received GH treatment for less than 3 months were included in the control group, which was based on the following consideration: although GH is effective for a patient, such efficacy within a short period (3 months) can be neglected for the FAH; thus, the result of a short treatment course of up to 3 months is similar to that of natural growth. Our data comprised real-world clinical data, which may be used as evidence for long-term treatment of GH for ISS.

### Prevention of growth deceleration after withdrawal of growth hormone therapy in idiopathic short stature [^1165KUnn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of children with idiopathic short stature by daily injections of human GH (hGH) is followed after its withdrawal by a growth deceleration with normal serum GH and IGF-I levels. The present study was designed to understand and prevent growth deceleration. We hypothesized that this phenomenon is due to tolerance at the target organ level, that tolerance develops in response to the unphysiological pharmacokinetics of daily-injected hGH, and that alternate day hGH therapy will prevent it. Thirty-eight prepubertal children with idiopathic short stature, aged 3.3–9.0 yr, were studied. Their heights were less than -2 SD score, growth rate was above the 10th percentile for age, bone age was less than 75% of chronological age, and the stimulated serum GH concentration was greater than 10 microg/liter. The children were matched for sex, height, and growth velocity SD score to receive daily or alternate day hGH at the same weekly dose of 6 mg/m(2) for a period of 2 yr. The 1st and 2nd year mean growth velocities were 3.4 and 2.3 SD score for the daily therapy group and 3.0 and 2.0 SD score for the alternate day group, respectively (P = NS). Over the initial 6 months after withdrawal of therapy, and growth velocity decelerated to a nadir of -3.9 SD score in the daily therapy group, whereas it decelerated in the alternate day group to only -0.2 SD score (P < 0.01). Over the entire 2 yr off therapy the latter group maintained mean growth rates of -0.2 to -1.2 SD score, similar to their pretreatment velocities. The daily group recovered slowly to resume their mean pretreatment rate only on the fourth semiannual evaluation off therapy. The cumulative 4-yr growth velocity (2 yr on and 2 yr off therapy) of the alternate day group was greater than that of the daily therapy group (mean, 0.9 vs. 0.3 SD score; P < 0.002). At the end of the 4-yr therapy period, the adult height prediction of the alternate day group was greater than that of the daily group by a mean 6.5 cm (P = 0.06). It is concluded that growth deceleration after withdrawal of hGH therapy in idiopathic short stature is due to tolerance to GH and IGF-I in response to the unphysiological pharmacokinetics of daily-injected hGH and that alternate day therapy allows for an alternate day physiological GH profile, thus preventing tolerance during therapy and growth deceleration thereafter.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^114TAbYU]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) — adult height outcomes with growth hormone (GH) show across randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using GH dose ranges of 0.22–0.47 mg/kg/week, injections 3–7 per week, and treatment durations 4.6–6.2 years that combining the 3 RCTs including 237 subjects (152 treated, 85 controls) with 146 followed to near adult height (AH) or AH (100 treated, 46 controls) the mean height gain of GH-treated children exceeded controls by 0.79 SDS (95% CI 0.50–1.09) or 4.7 cm (1.85 inch). A meta-analysis suggested approximately 4–6 cm AH gain (range 2.3–8.7 cm), averaging about 1 cm per year of treatment, and a retrospective study reported HtSDS gain of +1.9 (± 0.76) in GH-treated ISS at 0.32 ± 0.03 mg/kg/week versus +0.49 SDS in untreated for a net gain of 1.41 SDS.

### Short-acting growth hormone supplementation for bone age and growth rate in children with idiopathic short stature: a meta-analysis [^113daf8k]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

This article did not conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the results of different subgroups (such as age, gender, treatment time), nor did it elaborate on details like demographics. This is because the number of included literature was small and insufficient literature was retrieved for analysis. Future studies can conduct deeper excavation and screening of the existing research results to evaluate the robustness of the results of different subgroups more comprehensively and accurately, supplement the research details, and provide more powerful evidence for the reliability of the research conclusions.

### The effect of growth hormone treatment on height in children with idiopathic short stature [^114i4K7C]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is short stature of unknown cause. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of growth hormone (GH) for ISS. Several studies have evaluated the effect of GH in children with ISS, in whom improved growth velocities and height standard deviation scores (SDS) have been reported. However, clinical variables influence the height improvement.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of GH treatment on ISS and to analyze clinical factors associated with growth velocity.

Materials and Methods

This study was conducted retrospectively. Subjects diagnosed with ISS at Ajou University Hospital were divided into two groups, an ISS with GH-treatment group (n = 34) and an ISS control group (n = 36). All children were prepubertal, and aged < 10 years. We reviewed their auxological data, laboratory findings, and bone age.

Results

Growth velocity of the GH-treatment group exceeded that of controls by 3.37 cm/year (95% CI, 2.78–3.95). At baseline, the mean SDS for height in the treatment and control groups were equivalent (-2.25 ± 0.29 and -2.22 ± 0.31, respectively). However, after 1 year, the height of the GH-treated group exceeded that of the control group by 0.73 SDS (95% CI, 0.57–0.88). A negative correlation was found between age and growth velocity in the GH-treatment group.

Conclusion

GH treatment increased short-term growth velocity and height SDS of Korean children with ISS. Age was identified as the single most important factor correlated with growth velocity in GH treatment.

### Final adult height of children with idiopathic short stature: a multicenter study on GH therapy alone started during peri-puberty [^114NqNwV]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study showed that 54.4% of boys and 78.7% of girls had a FAH SDS > −2SD after GH treatment. This result explains that GH therapy is effective even in peri-puberty children. Among the girls who had been treated with GH > 2 years, their FAH was higher than TH. This further confirmed that GH therapy could improve FAH and longer the better. For boys, FAH SDS was lower than TH SDS in all groups although they attained the normal height. It may be that boys need to improve their height longer than girls. In the GeNeSIS observation study by Pfäffle and colleagues, including United States, Germany and France data, shows that most children achieved near adult height (NAH) within the normal range (height SDS > − 2) after GH treatment. The main population of our study is Chinese Han children. It shows that the same results as in Europe and America, the efficacy of growth hormone is similar.

The average age of boys and girls at baseline was 12.7 ± 1.87 years and 11.7 ± 11.7 years, with bone age of 11.7 ± 2.32 years and 10.1 ± 10.02 years, respectively. The relatively late initiation of treatment reflected the real-world situation. Multivariate linear regression model analysis showed that FAH is influenced positively by baseline height SDS in the boys and girls, whereas negatively by baseline bone age in girls, which was consistent with previous findings. Many previous studies have demonstrated that the age when starting GH treatment is an important factor for its efficacy. In this regard, our patients might have benefited more from GH therapy if the treatment had started earlier.

And we notice in this study, even in the control group, there is a spontaneous height gain of 1.16 SD. Economic factors need to be taken into account in the treatment of ISS. In China, growth hormone therapy for ISS is covered by families themselves. Whether to treatment or not, as well as the course of treatment, is decided by parents after weighing the family economic and height expectations.

This study had some limitations: Although it was a multi-center observation study, 344 of 475 cases entered the final analysis. It reflects "real-world" clinical practice and can be considered reliable, but which is not represented in random clinical trials. The sample is not big enough when stratification by treatment duration, if there is a larger sample in each subgroup, it will be better to validate our findings.

### Idiopathic short stature [^1166dsZH]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is a term used to describe the status of children with short stature that cannot be attributed to a specific cause. Many children diagnosed as having ISS have partial GH insensitivity, which can result from disturbances at various points of the GH-IGF-I axis. Several clinical studies on spontaneous growth in ISS showed that adult height was almost in the range of target height. GH treatment led to adult height not significantly higher than the pretreatment predicted adult height in most reports. No metabolic side effects have been observed, even when the dose was higher than in GH deficiency. Manipulation of puberty with gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogues reported by a few authors in a small number of children has shown conflicting results. Long-term psychological benefits of GH therapy for short normal children have not been demonstrated to date.

### Impact of growth hormone therapy on bone and body composition in prepubertal children with idiopathic short stature [^117MShD8]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Few studies have investigated the effect of growth hormone (GH) therapy on bone health and body composition in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of GH treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) and prepubertal body composition in children with ISS.

Methods

The study included 53 prepubertal children with ISS (mean age, 6.3 ± 1.5 years). Their BMD was compared to that of 20 healthy prepubertal children matched for chronological age. Of the 53 children with ISS, 11 received GH therapy for 1 year. Anthropometric measurements and bone age assessments were conducted, and body composition was analyzed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at 6-month intervals.

Results

At baseline, lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD Z scores, adjusted for height, showed no significant differences between the ISS and control groups. However, bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) Z scores were significantly lower in children with ISS compared to controls. Over 12 months of GH therapy, no significant changes were observed in lumbar spine or femoral neck height-adjusted BMD Z scores. Nevertheless, GH treatment led to a significant reduction in percent body fat for chronological age and an increase in lean body mass after 1 year.

Conclusions

Prepubertal children with ISS exhibited lower BMAD at the lumbar spine compared to healthy controls. Although short-term GH therapy did not significantly alter bone density, it positively impacted body composition. These findings provide valuable clinical insights into bone health and body composition in children with ISS.

### Near adult heights after growth hormone treatment in patients with idiopathic short stature or idiopathic growth hormone deficiency [^115RSgjD]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Determination of near adult height (NAH) after recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy in patients with idiopathic short stature (ISS, maximum stimulated growth hormone [MSGH] > 10 ng/ml) or idiopathic growth hormone deficiency (IGHD, MSGH ≤ 10 ng/ml) enrolled in the National Cooperative Growth Study Substudy 2.

Methods

Female NAH was defined as height at age 18 or age 14 plus Tanner stage 4; male NAH was defined as height at age 20 or age 16 plus Tanner stage 4 or 5.

Results

Both groups had similar enrollment heights: IGHD -2.7 ± 0.7 versus ISS -2.8 ± 0.6 (mean height standard deviation score [SDS] ± SD). After rhGH treatment, there were no significant differences in NAH between the IGHD and ISS groups (-1.4 ± 1.0 versus -1.6 ± 1.0). Enrollment height SDS and MSGH value were significant predictors of delta height for the children with IGHD but not for the children with ISS (R2 = 0.45 IGHD versus R2 = 0.22 ISS).

Conclusion

We conclude that MSGH values should not be used as the primary criterion for rhGH therapy.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^117QyeF7]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of growth hormone (GH) for growth hormone deficiency (GHD) — Recommendation 1.1 states: We recommend the use of GH to normalize adult height (AH) and avoid extreme shortness in children and adolescents with GHD. Evidence includes a French registry of 2,165 idiopathic IGHD patients showing mean height gain 1.1 ± 0.9 SDS and average AH −1.6 SD (girls 154 ± 5 cm; boys 165 ± 6 cm), with AH SDS 0.4 SD lower than mid-parental height (MPH) SDS on a GH dose of 0.14 mg/kg/week. Favorable predictors were younger age at GH start, greater bone age delay, prepubertal status, and severe GHD; in this cohort, 65% were prepubertal, 48% had peak GH secretion between 7 and 10 µg/L, sex steroid priming was used in only 2%, and MRI data were not reported. Compared with untreated idiopathic IGHD (mean AH SDS −4.7, range −3.9 to −6 SD), KIGS data showed treated outcomes: IGHD AH SDS −0.8 (males) and −1.0 (females); MPHD −0.7 (males) and −1.1 (females), with AH SDS − MPH SDS values of −0.2 (IGHD males), −0.5 (IGHD females), −0.4 (MPHD males), and −0.8 (MPHD females), and mean GH doses 0.21 mg/kg/week (IGHD) and 0.18 mg/kg/week (MPHD).

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^117SNopA]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency (PIGFD) — IGF-I treatment is indicated for PIGFD with both height and IGF-I levels below −3 SD, and FDA approval included children with IGF-I gene deletion or inactivating mutation, GRH gene mutation or postreceptor signal transduction defects, or GH-inactivating antibodies. Low IGF-I concentrations and slow growth velocity alone are insufficient criteria to diagnose PIGFD, and treatment directed at the cause of secondary IGF-I deficiency should be sought rather than IGF-I therapy. For children who do not meet FDA criteria for PIGFD but meet indications for GH therapy, an initial trial of GH can be used; the safety profile of IGF-I is similar to GH but with the addition of hypoglycemia, and this additional risk should be considered when deciding if IGF-I should be used as initial treatment when the diagnosis of PIGFD is suspected.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^116NMdE6]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) management — adrenal and thyroid axis evaluation during therapy: We recommend re-assessment of both the adrenal and thyroid axes after initiation of GH therapy in patients whose cause of GHD is associated with possible MPHD, as evaluation may detect unsuspected central adrenal and thyroid insufficiencies and may prompt consideration of increasing hydrocortisone and/or levothyroxine doses. Physiological effects of GH on glucocorticoid metabolism raise theoretical concerns that GH treatment could make manifest an underlying adrenal insufficiency, yet more recent data indicate a rate of adrenal insufficiency in GH recipients equal to that expected for the general population. GH can also lower serum free T4 concentrations by increasing peripheral deiodination of T4 to T3.

### Can growth hormone stimulation tests in children predict the response to growth hormone treatment? [^11554KXw]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The efficacy of growth hormone (GH) treatment in short, healthy children diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) or idiopathic short stature (ISS) suggests an overlap between these 2 conditions. Although imperfect and inconsistent, GH stimulation testing (GHST) remains the primary diagnostic tool for differentiating GHD and ISS, influencing GH treatment eligibility and dosing. This study aims to assess the clinical significance of GHST by comparing the response to GH treatment in children diagnosed with GHD or ISS based on their GHST results.

Methods

A retrospective study in an endocrine clinic at a tertiary pediatric referral center comparing the response to GH treatment over 3 years in children diagnosed with GHD or ISS.

Results

Two hundred ninty-one children treated with GH, 97 children diagnosed with GHD, and 194 with ISS are included in the analysis. Height significantly improved, and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels increased independent of the GHST results, gender, or pubertal status (P < .001). When adjusting for dosage, height gain was not associated with the treatment indication, GHD or ISS, or GHST peak levels.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate similar responses to GH treatment in children classified as GHD or ISS based on GHST. These results suggest that the pivotal role of GHST in diagnosing and treating short children should be reconsidered.

Growth hormone (GH) treatment — general malignancy risk in children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), small for gestational age (SGA), or idiopathic short stature (ISS) — is summarized as follows: current evidence indicates that incidence of new-onset leukemia during treatment or malignancies in general following treatment in children without associated risk factors is not increased compared with that in the age-matched general population; any increased risk for new-onset leukemia appears limited to children with underlying conditions that already predispose them to develop malignancies; tumor recurrence is not increased in persons successfully treated for their primary lesion; and GH treatment of children with a history of malignancy may slightly hasten the appearance of a second neoplasm but does not appear to increase the overall risk of second neoplasm occurrence when compared to patients not treated with GH. Additionally, an increased risk of developing second neoplasms in GH-treated childhood cancer survivors is currently listed in US labeling for GH products, and ongoing long-term posttreatment surveillance of GH recipients is paramount.

Sex steroid priming before provocative GH testing — We suggest sex steroid priming prior to provocative GH testing in prepubertal boys older than 11 and in prepubertal girls older than 10 years with AH progressing within −2 SD of the reference population mean in order to prevent unnecessary GH treatment of children with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (Conditional recommendation, ●●○○). Best available evidence exists for boys; evidence is extrapolated to girls. A reasonable approach in both boys and girls would be 2 mg (1 mg for body weight < 20 kg) of β-estradiol orally on each of the 2 evenings preceding the test; alternatively, boys can be primed with intramuscular testosterone 50–100 mg of a depot formulation administered 1 week before the test. This recommendation applies to GH-naïve patients; it does not retroactively apply to patients already on GH treatment.

### Motives for choosing growth-enhancing hormone treatment in adolescents with idiopathic short stature: a questionnaire and structured interview study [^113pcrZU]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Insight into the divergent motives at the time of choosing hormone treatment is important, because it will help in the choice of proper outcome measures for the evaluation of a trial. Insight into motivational factors is especially important in treatments combining biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) with a puberty-delaying hormone, because the possible benefits of enhancing growth must be balanced against the possible negative psychosocial consequences of delaying pubertal development. Moreover, such insight will clarify whether other treatments, such as psychosocial counseling, should be employed to solve current psychosocial problems and reach future goals.

Our study examined 38 medically referred early pubertal, short adolescents who agreed to participate in an experimental trial of a combined treatment of GH and a puberty-delaying hormone, and compared the results with short adolescents who received no intervention. Participants had a height standard deviation score (SDS) below -2, or between -1 and -2 with a predicted adult height SDS below -2, all without apparent underlying pathology. Twenty-six of the subjects had a normal birth weight and length and were classified as ISS, while 12 were born small for gestational age (SGA). Both ISS and SGA have been associated with problems in behavior, social functioning, school competence, and attention, while SGA has also been associated with lowered intelligence and minor neurologic dysfunctions.

With the aim of clarifying the motives of parents and children for participation in the trial, we examined the baseline scores of the adolescents on the following psychosocial factors before initiating the treatment: presence of height-related stressors, parental worries about the child's behavior and future prospects, self-reported problems in psychosocial functioning, and treatment expectations.

The FDA approved IGF-I treatment in 2005 for the long-term treatment of growth failure in pediatric patients with severe PIGFD (defined as both height and serum IGF-1 concentration below − 3 SD despite normal or elevated GH levels) or with GH gene deletion who developed neutralizing antibodies to GH after a trial of GH therapy.

Descriptions of the GH cohort

Main characteristics of the 47 subjects (pairs) included in this study are shown in Table 1. All had ISS as defined by. Briefly, ISS is a condition in which the height of the individual is more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the corresponding mean height for a given age, sex and population, in whom no identifiable disorder is present.

Main characteristics of the studied children

The sex-matched participants (24 females vs. 23 males) were aged 4.9 to 13.1 years at time of starting rhGH treatment. They received a mean supra-physiological dose of rhGH of 70.8 μg/kg per day for a duration range from 6 to 38.4 months. During rhGH therapy, the mean increase in plasma IGF1 across children ranged from 4 to 658 ng/ml.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^112GWGLN]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children — guiding principles and evidence grading — The taskforce retrieved ~15,000 citations with approximately 6,300 specific to GHD or PIGFD, used a two-stage review with primary and secondary reviewers, and included all RCTs, with nonrandomized studies when they addressed the safety data. Evidence quality was judged as very low (●○○○), low (●●○○), moderate (●●●○), or high (●●●●), and recommendations were assessed as strong (denoted by "We recommend") or conditional (denoted by "We suggest"); consensus was defined as at least 6 of the 8 members agreeing on the recommendation as strong or weak. AH was selected as the primary outcome; in the absence of AH data, surrogate short-term outcomes such as growth velocity, change in height z-score, or change in predicted height were considered, but did not form the basis of a recommendation. For comparing AH across studies, GHD analyses used (AH SDS – midparental height [MPH] SDS) and, because MPH SDS formulas varied, the MPH SDS reported for each study was used; ISS analyses used (AH SDS minus baseline HtSDS), and (AH SDS – MPH SDS) was not used for ISS because MPH may not reflect genetic potential if one or both parents has an undiagnosed condition. Studies utilizing predicted AH were excluded. The taskforce emphasized harm prevention and described a conservative approach, recommending only practices with supporting evidence of sufficient quality that minimize potential risks to patients.

### Growth hormone treatment for non-GHD disorders: excitement tempered by biology [^114Ryb9p]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The success of growth hormone (GH) replacement in children with classical GH deficiency has led to excitement that other causes of short stature may benefit similarly. However, clinical experience has shown less consistent and generally less dramatic effects on adult height, perhaps not surprising in light of increased understanding of GH and growth plate biology. Nonetheless, clinical demand for GH treatment continues to grow. Upon the 20th anniversary of the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of GH treatment for idiopathic short stature, this review will consider the factors underlying the expansion of GH treatment, the biological mechanisms of GH action, the non-GH-deficient uses of GH as a height-promoting agent, biological constraints to GH action, and future directions.

### A comparison of referral patterns to the pediatric endocrine clinic before and after FDA approval of growth hormone for idiopathic short stature [^117LhxyD]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Short stature is a common reason for referral to the pediatric endocrine clinic. In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of growth hormone (GH) for the treatment of children with idiopathic short stature (ISS).

Objective

To explore if this indication changed referrals for short stature (SS).

Design/Methods

A retrospective chart review of children seen for SS in the pediatric endocrine clinic between July 1998 and June 1999 (interval one, n = 138) and July 2005-June 2006 (interval two, n = 268) was performed. Variables collected included age, gender, height (h), and parental heights.

Results

Average height standard deviation score (HT-SDS) was -2.11 ± 0.9 in interval one and -2.14 ± 0.83 in interval two (p = ns). No differences in age, gender distribution, relationship between child and parental heights, the proportion of subjects started on GH for ISS or in the HT-SDS of those treated between the two intervals were identified. Nearly half of all children referred in each interval did not meet the technical criteria for short stature.

Conclusions

No differences in referral patterns for SS in our area following FDA approval of GH for ISS were identified. Although referrals appear unchanged, additional investigation of GH prescribing patterns before and after this new indication is needed. Continued education of primary care physicians and the general public regarding the definition of SS and the eligibility for GH therapy should be pursued.

### Is the growth outcome of children with idiopathic short stature and isolated growth hormone deficiency following treatment with growth hormone and a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist superior to that obtained by GH alone? [^115gZ4uS]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined therapy with growth hormone (GH) and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa) on the near-final height (NFH) of children with idiopathic short stature (ISS) and growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in early puberty.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 20 patients with ISS and 9 patients with GHD treated with combined therapy was undertaken. Twelve children with ISS and ten with GHD, treated with GH alone, served as controls. Patients were matched at baseline for chronological age, bone age, height standard deviation score (SDS), and pubertal development.

Results

Patients with ISS or GHD treated with combined therapy improved both their predicted adult height (PAH) at 2 years of therapy (ISS, p < 0.001; GHD, p = 0.03) and their NFH (ISS, p < 0.05; GHD, p = 0.05). Treatment with combined therapy did not generate additional benefits on the PAH after 2 years of therapy (ISS children, an increase of 7.9 ± 4.9 cm with combined therapy vs. 7.3 ± 6.0 cm with GH; GHD children, an increase of 6.8 ± 7.8 cm with combined therapy vs. 5 ± 5.9 cm with GH). The total height gain SDS was higher in patients treated with GH alone compared with those with combined therapy, but the difference was not significant (ISS children, a gain of 2.4 SDS with GH vs. 0.8 SDS with combined therapy; GHD children, a gain of 1.8 SDS with GH vs. 0.6 SDS with combined therapy).

Conclusions

Although 2 years of combined treatment with GH and LHRHa improved the PAH and the NFH of ISS and GHD patients in early puberty, this improvement was not significant compared with that observed in similar subjects treated with GH alone.

The results of the Meta-analysis in this study showed that the MD of the total effective rate of growth rate was 4.44, [95% CI (2.72, 7.24)], with P < 0.01. Short-acting GH supplementation can significantly increase the growth rate of children with idiopathic short stature. The continuous proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes is the key process of bone growth, which makes the long bones grow longer, thus improving the growth rate of children. By binding to GH receptors on the surface of chondrocytes, GH activates intracellular signal transduction pathways, such as JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and others, thereby regulating the metabolism and function of chondrocytes, promoting their synthesis of collagen and other extracellular matrix components, and providing a material basis for bone growth. In addition, GH can stimulate the synthesis and secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) by tissues such as the liver. IGF-1 is an important growth regulator that can directly act on bones, muscles and other tissues to promote cell proliferation, differentiation and protein synthesis, thereby exerting a positive effect on growth rate. IGF-1 can also enhance the role of GH, forming a GH-IGF-1 axis, which together regulate the growth and development of children. In children with idiopathic short stature, IGF-1 levels are relatively low due to insufficient or defective secretion of GH. Short-acting GH supplementation can increase the synthesis and secretion of IGF-1 and thus promote growth. In addition, GH can promote that synthesis of protein, increase muscle quality, improve the utilization efficiency of nutrient of the body, regulate fat metabolism, reduce fat accumulation, and improve body composition. This is not only beneficial to the physical health of children, but may also indirectly promote growth. A good sleep is essential for the growth and development of children. In children with idiopathic short stature, long-term growth rate increases are critical to the eventual improvement in height. Short-acting GH therapy usually needs to last for a period of time, and the growth rate of children can be kept at a high level during the long-term treatment. The study found that the height of children gradually approached the level of normal children with the prolongation of treatment time, further proving the long-term positive effect of short-acting GH on growth rate. In clinical practice, doctors can reasonably choose short-acting GH for treatment according to the specific situation of children to improve their height. Multiple studies included in this Meta-analysis have shown that in the comparison of the total effective rate of bone age growth, the P value of each study was greater than 0.05, with a MD of 1.12, [95% CI (0.66, 1.91)]. After short-acting GH treatment, the change in bone age of children with idiopathic short stature was not significantly different compared with that of the control group that did not receive treatment. The impact of short-acting GH supplementation on bone age is relatively small. The reason may be that GH promotes the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes through IGF-1 to achieve bone growth, but it does not directly affect the progression of bone age. Bone age is comprehensively regulated by a variety of factors, including heredity, nutrition, and endocrine, and GH is just one of them. While promoting linear growth, GH had relatively limited effect on the maturation process of bone age. For the treatment of children with idiopathic short stature, doctors and parents are often concerned about the effect of treatment on bone age. Short-acting GH has little effect on bone age, which provides an important basis for clinical treatment decision. For children with idiopathic short stature requiring long-term treatment, the small effect of short-acting GH on bone age means that the treatment time can be extended to a certain extent to obtain better growth effects. At the same time, the risk that the treatment has to be terminated early due to early bone age is reduced, and the sustainability of the treatment is improved. Therefore, the short-acting GH can be used more safely in the selection of treatment plan without undue worry about the growth space limitation caused by the rapid progression of bone age.

### Final height gain by GH therapy in children with idiopathic short stature is dose dependent [^1124cNZG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Recombinant human GH therapy to children with idiopathic short stature (ISS) increases growth velocity, but its effect on final height (FH) is still uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of recombinant human GH on FH of patients with ISS who were treated according to two protocols in comparison to untreated historical controls. In study 1 (n = 24), all patients were treated with 14 IU (4.6 mg)/m(2) body surface x wk in the first year; thereafter the dosage was doubled if the growth response was insufficient. In study 2 (n = 34), patients were randomized into three arms: 18 IU (6 mg)/m(2) x wk; 27 IU (9 mg)/m(2) x wk; and 18 IU/m(2) x wk in the first year, followed by 27 IU/m(2) x wk thereafter. Observed or estimated FH was available for 53 patients. Thirty-four untreated controls from the same centers were available for comparison. Mean FH SD score in GH-treated children was -2.1, vs. -2.4 in controls (-2.4) (NS), but height SD score gain (1.3 vs. 0.7) and the difference between FH and predicted adult height (4.0 vs. 0.8 cm) were significantly greater. The growth response on an initial dosage of 27 IU/m(2) x wk (6.9 cm) was significantly better than on other regimens (2.8 cm). We conclude that a GH dosage of 27 IU (9 mg)/m(2) x wk to prepubertal children with ISS leads to a mean FH gain of approximately 7 cm, whereas regimens starting on lower dosages are less efficacious.

### Effect of growth hormone therapy on height in children with idiopathic short stature… [^112BJccC]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

In controlled studies, the adult height of the GH-treated group significantly exceeded controls by 0. 84 SD, and in uncontrolled trials the adult height attained after GH treatment exceeded that predicted at baseline. These results suggest an average gain in adult height of approximately 4 to 6 cm with GH therapy. Given current treatment costs, this corresponds to more than $35 000 per inch gained in adult height in idiopathic short stature. Conclusions Treatment with GH results in short-term increases in growth for children with idiopathic short stature, and long-term GH can increase adult height. These results are fundamental to decisions about GH use and raise questions about the goals of treatment. Use of GH for idiopathic short stature in clinical practice will depend on its efficacy in promoting growth and the value of this effect to families, physicians, and third-party payers.

These results indicate that the GH-treated group experienced a significantly greater increment in growth velocity, and they are consistent with the analyses of the aggregate data, paired data, and randomized trials. A fundamental issue in the debate about GH treatment for idiopathic short stature is uncertainty about its degree of effectiveness in promoting growth. 3, 10, 13–16, 25, 37, 40 This meta-analysis shows that 1 year of GH therapy causes a clear increase in growth velocity and suggests that long-term GH therapy increases adult height in children with idiopathic short stature. The adult height achieved by GH-treated individuals exceeded that of untreated controls by 0. 78 to
0. 84 SD. Similarly, comparisons of predicted and achieved adult height in controlled and uncontrolled trials show a gain of 0. 54 to
0. 65 SD. The weight of the evidence, therefore, indicates that GH treatment increases short-term growth velocity and can increase adult height in idiopathic short stature.

The data on short-term effects of GH in idiopathic short stature also are relevant for practice. The increase in growth velocity observed during the first year of GH treatment raises questions about the practical application of 6- to 12-month therapeutic trials of GH in individual patients as a method to determine their need for long-term GH therapy1, 8, 9, 25, 110 because even the lower end of the observed range for growth velocity exceeds many recommended thresholds for considering such trials successful. In a separate meta-analysis, we found in children with classic GH deficiency that growth velocity increa.

### Growth hormone in children and adolescents of short… [^115DH7Y3]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Growth hormone therapy is most likely to be of benefit in children with a true GH deficiency who are of a younger age, are significantly short, have significantly delayed skeletal maturation and are growing slowly. Guyda reviews what has been achieved after 40 years of GH therapy in children. The author notes that long-term growth scores achieved by GH therapy are impressive, although the final height of GH-deficient patients is still short. Studies indicate that the greatest height gain occurs in GH-deficient patients who are younger and have the greatest height deficit when treatment is initiated. The use of GH therapy in normal children with short stature has been found to provide a moderate acceleration of growth, resulting in a final height just above the initial prediction.

While potential psychologic dysfunction as a result of shortness has been raised as a justification for the use of GH in children with idiopathic short stature, studies have revealed no association between short stature and clinically significant psychologic morbidity. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended caution in the use of GH therapy for this purpose, concluding that GH has not been proved useful in increasing the final height of children with growth disorders other than growth failure related to GH deficiency. Studies show that GH supplementation in girls with Turner syndrome significantly increases the final height. The mean final height in 2, 217 girls with Turner syndrome was 150. 0 cm, which was
5. 7 cm above the projected adult height. Considerable variability in response was noted, however. The effects on psychologic function remain to be determined.

In children born with intrauterine growth retardation or who are small for gestational age, GH administered early may normalize height during childhood, but it does not result in significant height gain in adulthood. The author summarizes his commentary by noting that children often expect to achieve normal adult height but, unfortunately, the majority of patients with classic GH deficiency, idiopathic short stature or Turner syndrome who are treated with GH do not achieve median normal adult height. However, an increase in height is frequent, and response to GH therapy can be optimal in some patients. The usefulness of GH supplementation in the "normal short child" is questionable because of the lack of clear long-term benefit on psychologic state or final height and the potential negative effect of unfulfilled expectations. Further study is needed to determine precisely which short children, including those with Turner syndrome, will benefit from GH therapy.

### Growth hormone for treatment of idiopathic short stature in children… [^1151WqWZ]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Final adult height is modestly increased in children who receive rGH, with growth increases of 3. 5 to
7. 5 cm. However, the use of rGH does not improve health-related quality of life. A Cochrane review examined the effect of treatment with rGH vs. no treatment or placebo in 741 children with height less than the 3rd percentile who had no apparent underlying pathology. 1 One trial found that the nearfinal height in 10 pubertal girls who received 30 IU of rGH per m 2 per week for three years was 7. 5 cm greater than that in 30 untreated girls. Another trial that reported adult height found that 37 children who received rGH were 3. 7 cm taller than those in the placebo group. The remaining eight trials reported short-term height gains, which varied from none to 0.

7 standard deviations in a year. One study that reported health-related quality of life found no significant improvement in 20 children who received rGH compared with 20 children in a control group. The quality of the studies was rated as moderate for two, poor for six, and very poor for two. 2 Participants had a growth velocity of less than 1. 5 cm per year or a bone age of 15 years in females or 16 years in males. The treatment group in the RCTs received 0. 033 to
0. 067 mg of rGH per kg per day. The adult height of the treated group exceeded that of the control group, with a mean difference of 0. 65 standard deviations. In 2008, 32 leaders in the field of idiopathic short stature published a consensus statement based on a review of the literature and clinical experience.

3 The consensus was that rGH therapy following country-specific regulatory guidelines is appropriate, and that stronger consideration should be given to shorter children. The mean increase in adult height with rGH therapy is 3. 5 to
7. 5 cm. Copyright Family Physicians Inquiries Network. Used with permission.

### The use of growth hormone therapy in children… [^115HJ7Jx]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency in children ranges from complete absence of growth hormone to partial deficiency. Children who completely lack endogenous growth hormone will have severe growth retardation. Children with partial deficiency will usually be of slightly short stature. Measuring the response of growth hormone to an insulin stimulus is the standard measurement technique. Obtaining frequent daytime and nocturnal samples of growth hormone is an alternate technique, but it is not more effective. Unfortunately, currently available growth hormone assays have not been standardized. Therefore, the authors recommend basing a true diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency on the following criteria: very short height, poor growth velocity, delayed bone age and a predicted adult height substantially below the mean parental height.

The difficulty for physicians occurs when children meet some, but not all, of these criteria. It is hard to predict which of these patients will respond to growth hormone therapy. This is most pronounced in the first two years of therapy. In a study of more than 12, 000 children, growth hormone replacement therapy was started at an average age of 9. 2 ±
4. 1 years and produced an increase in growth velocity from 4. 4 cm per year to
10. 0 cm per year. In the United States, the current recommended dosage is 0. 3 mg per kg per week in daily divided doses. The younger the patient at the initiation of treatment and the more severe the growth deficiency, the better the response to therapy will be. Children with idiopathic short stature constitute about one third of all children currently receiving growth hormone in the United States. Treating these children continues to be a matter of controversy from an efficacy and an ethical point of view.

Parental pressure is the reason that physicians start treatment in many of these children. Although growth hormone will accelerate linear growth, most current data have not proved that it increases final attained height. The authors state that growth hormone should only be given to children whose height is more than 2. 5 standard deviations below the mean for age, who have a growth velocity of less than the 25th percentile and who have no identifiable cause of growth failure.
