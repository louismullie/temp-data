## Question

what is consdiered evidence of hepatic steatosis? does elevated liver enzymes count

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether elevated liver enzymes alone constitute evidence of hepatic steatosis, and if not, what does count as evidence and how to interpret enzyme abnormalities in this context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of hepatic steatosis and what counts as diagnostic evidence. Then, I should verify the role and limitations of aminotransferases in steatotic liver disease. Next, I will review which imaging modalities actually confirm steatosis and how reliable they are. After that, I need to consider histology as the reference standard and when it is indicated. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned approach and answer the question directly with supporting thresholds and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: hepatic steatosis is defined as the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes, typically at or above 5% of hepatocytes, and the diagnosis requires demonstration of steatosis by imaging or histology after excluding other causes such as significant alcohol use, steatogenic medications, or monogenic disorders; elevated liver enzymes are not part of the diagnostic criteria for steatosis itself, though they may coexist and prompt evaluation [^117StPTZ] [^112TeHbB] [^111dPX12].

> Wait, let me verify the role of liver enzymes before I overinterpret them: aminotransferases (ALT, AST) are nonspecific markers of hepatocellular injury and can be normal in a substantial proportion of patients with steatosis or even NASH, so normal enzymes do not exclude disease; conversely, mild elevations are common and nonspecific, and many laboratory "normal" ALT cutoffs are too high for steatotic liver disease, with AASLD suggesting that ALT greater than about 30 U/L in men and 19–25 U/L in women warrants attention even if within a lab's reference range [^112TeHbB] [^113nLMvo] [^116GN7V6].

> Hold on, I should double-check the imaging hierarchy because not all modalities are equal: standard grayscale ultrasound can suggest steatosis but has poor sensitivity for mild disease and is operator dependent, so it is not recommended to identify steatosis; controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) on transient elastography can identify steatosis with a commonly used cut point around 288 dB/m, and MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) is the most accurate and reproducible method to detect and quantify steatosis, using a threshold of at least 5% fat to define steatosis and allowing longitudinal monitoring of change [^114c2FN8] [^115xKUdj] [^113nc1hW].

> I need to ensure I address histology correctly: liver biopsy remains the reference standard to confirm steatosis, distinguish simple steatosis from steatohepatitis, and stage fibrosis; however, it is invasive and not routinely required when noninvasive assessment suffices, and it is typically reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, or when advanced fibrosis risk is high and noninvasive tests are indeterminate or discordant [^115wj5Rg] [^114V6RrY].

> Let me consider the clinical context and exclusions so I don't mislabel patients: before labeling someone with steatotic liver disease, I should exclude alcohol-related liver disease, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and medication-induced liver injury, and I should assess metabolic risk factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension that increase the likelihood of MASLD/NAFLD when steatosis is present [^112TeHbB] [^116wucuv] [^113z2Ems].

> But wait, what if the enzymes are "mildly elevated" and the ultrasound is "echogenic" — does that equal steatosis? Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a bright liver on ultrasound might suffice, but I should correct that: ultrasound is not reliable for mild steatosis and should not be used to "rule in" steatosis definitively; CAP or MRI-PDFF are preferred when available, and even with imaging evidence, I still need to apply the exclusion framework and metabolic risk assessment before making a firm diagnosis of MASLD/NAFLD [^114c2FN8] [^113nc1hW] [^112TeHbB].

> I will now examine how to interpret enzyme abnormalities pragmatically: persistently elevated ALT above about 30 U/L in men or 19–25 U/L in women should prompt evaluation for steatotic liver disease and other etiologies, but normal enzymes do not exclude clinically significant fibrosis; conversely, marked enzyme elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal should raise concern for alternative or additional diagnoses such as drug-induced liver injury, acute viral hepatitis, ischemia, or autoimmune hepatitis rather than uncomplicated steatosis alone [^113nLMvo] [^112TeHbB].

> Next, I should review pediatric nuances so I don't overgeneralize: in children, ALT alone — even with obesity — is insufficient to diagnose MASLD; confirmation of steatosis by imaging or biopsy plus at least one cardiometabolic risk factor is required, with MRI-PDFF preferred when available and ultrasound/CAP limited by accuracy and validation concerns; thresholds for concern include ALT persistently at or above roughly 2 times the upper limit of normal, prompting further evaluation and possible biopsy in selected cases [^114aTzK4] [^114QfumX] [^112aTCXM].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly: elevated liver enzymes alone do not constitute evidence of hepatic steatosis; evidence of steatosis requires imaging or histologic confirmation, ideally with CAP or MRI-PDFF for detection/quantification, while aminotransferases serve as nonspecific injury markers that may be normal or mildly elevated and should trigger, but not replace, appropriate imaging-based confirmation and etiologic workup [^117StPTZ] [^114c2FN8] [^112TeHbB].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical next steps so the clinician can act: if steatosis is suspected based on risk factors or mild enzyme elevations, obtain metabolic risk screening, exclude other liver diseases, and use noninvasive imaging to confirm steatosis; if fibrosis risk is present, apply FIB-4 and, if indeterminate or high, proceed to elastography or ELF and consider referral; reserve biopsy for diagnostic uncertainty or advanced disease suspicion, and remember that normal enzymes never exclude clinically significant disease in this spectrum [^112TeHbB] [^114c2FN8] [^1125vBTC].

Elevated liver enzymes alone are **not sufficient** to diagnose hepatic steatosis [^1149o1M4]; they are a nonspecific signal that warrants further evaluation. Definitive diagnosis requires **imaging or histology** [^117StPTZ] to confirm steatosis and exclude other causes [^112TeHbB]. Ultrasound, CAP, or MRI-PDFF are preferred noninvasive methods [^notfound], with MRI-PDFF being the most accurate for quantification [^115xKUdj]. Liver enzymes may be normal in steatosis, so normal results do not exclude disease [^1149o1M4]. Persistent ALT > 30 U/L in men or > 19–25 U/L in women should prompt evaluation, but diagnosis still requires imaging or biopsy [^112TeHbB].

---

## Definition and diagnosis of hepatic steatosis

Hepatic steatosis is defined as **≥ 5% fat accumulation in hepatocytes** [^117StPTZ], confirmed by imaging or histology after excluding other causes (e.g. alcohol, medications, metabolic disorders) [^117StPTZ]. It spans a spectrum from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and fibrosis [^1125CqgP].

---

## Role of liver enzymes in hepatic steatosis

Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) reflect hepatocellular injury or inflammation but are **nonspecific** and may be normal in steatosis [^115L7iqZ]. Elevations are common but not diagnostic; they indicate possible liver injury, not steatosis itself [^113nLMvo].

---

## Limitations of elevated liver enzymes in diagnosing hepatic steatosis

- **Nonspecificity**: Elevated enzymes occur in many liver diseases (e.g. viral hepatitis, alcohol-related liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury) [^112eeqNX], limiting their diagnostic value for steatosis [^113nLMvo].

- **Normal enzymes**: Many with steatosis have normal ALT/AST, so normal results do not exclude disease [^1149o1M4].

- **Mild elevations**: Typically 1–2× ULN and overlap with other conditions, reducing specificity [^notfound].

- **ALT thresholds**: ALT > 30 U/L in men or > 19–25 U/L in women may suggest chronic liver injury but are not diagnostic for steatosis [^112TeHbB].

---

## Imaging modalities for diagnosing hepatic steatosis

Imaging is **essential** to confirm steatosis and quantify fat [^115xKUdj]. Common modalities include:

| **Imaging modality** | **Accuracy and limitations** |
|-|-|
| Ultrasound | - Widely available <br/> - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited sensitivity for mild steatosis <br/> - Not recommended for routine steatosis detection [^114c2FN8] |
| Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) | - Noninvasive <br/> - Moderate accuracy <br/> - Can detect steatosis but limited quantification [^115xKUdj] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) | - Highly accurate <br/> - Quantifies fat <br/> - Gold standard noninvasive method [^115xKUdj] |

---

## Histological confirmation

Liver biopsy is the **gold standard** for diagnosing steatosis and differentiating simple steatosis from steatohepatitis or fibrosis [^115wj5Rg]. It is invasive and reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or when advanced disease is suspected [^1128earA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

AASLD guidance states that elevated liver enzymes alone are **insufficient**; diagnosis requires imaging or histology [^117StPTZ]. Persistent ALT > 30 U/L in men or > 19–25 U/L in women should prompt evaluation, but confirmation still needs imaging or biopsy [^112TeHbB].

---

## Clinical implications of elevated liver enzymes

Elevated enzymes suggest liver injury and may indicate progression to steatohepatitis or fibrosis [^111342tt]. They should prompt evaluation for other causes and risk stratification for fibrosis using noninvasive tests (e.g. FIB-4, transient elastography) [^1125vBTC].

---

## Summary of evidence

- **Elevated enzymes are not diagnostic**: They are nonspecific and may be normal in steatosis [^1149o1M4].

- **Imaging is required**: Ultrasound, CAP, or MRI-PDFF are needed to confirm steatosis [^115xKUdj].

- **MRI-PDFF is preferred**: It is the most accurate noninvasive method for quantifying steatosis [^114QfumX].

- **Biopsy is the gold standard**: Used when diagnosis is uncertain or advanced disease is suspected [^1125CqgP].

---

Elevated liver enzymes alone are **not sufficient** to diagnose hepatic steatosis; definitive diagnosis requires imaging or histology [^117StPTZ]. Enzymes may be normal in steatosis, so normal results do not exclude disease [^115L7iqZ]. Persistent mild ALT elevations should prompt evaluation, but confirmation relies on imaging or biopsy [^114h9YzH].

Initial evaluation of a patient with NAFLD states that patients with NAFLD are most commonly referred with incidentally noted hepatic steatosis on imaging or elevated liver chemistries; normal laboratory reference ranges may exceed what is appropriate for NAFLD, in which a true normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ranges from 29 to 33 U/L in men and from 19 to 25 U/L in women; initial evaluation should include screening for metabolic comorbidities, assessment of alcohol intake, exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and physical examination to identify signs of insulin resistance and advanced liver disease; and when the clinical profile is atypical or accompanied by additional signs or symptoms suggesting additional/alternate etiologies, less common causes of steatosis or steatohepatitis should be excluded.

GRADE approach — quality of evidence and recommendation strength are organized by study design and predefined modifiers. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence has an initial rating of High and observational evidence Moderate; quality can be rated down for risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias, and rated up for large or very large effect, dose-response gradient, or when all plausible confounding would increase the association. Determinants of recommendation strength include quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resources and costs. Implications are defined: for a Strong recommendation, the population statement is "Most people in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", health care workers are told "Most people should receive the recommended course of action", and policy makers are told "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations". For a Conditional recommendation, the population statement is "The majority of people in this situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", health care workers are told "Be prepared to help patients make a decision that is consistent with their values using decision aids and shared decision-making", and policy makers are told "There is a need for substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders".

Diabetes-specific screening recommendations — clinically significant fibrosis (stages F2–F4): In persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D), clinicians should consider screening using the FIB-4 even if liver enzyme levels are normal (Grade C; High/Intermediate Strength of Evidence; BEL 2). In persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D), clinicians may consider FIB-4 screening only if risk factors are present — obesity, features of metabolic syndrome (MetS), elevated plasma aminotransferase levels (> 30 U/L), or hepatic steatosis on imaging — graded C with Intermediate/Weak Strength of Evidence and BEL 2, downgraded for heterogeneity and moderate to high bias. Clinicians should further risk stratify persons with T2D or T1D with cardiometabolic risk factors and/or elevated aminotransferases (> 30 U/L) using the FIB-4, elastography, and/or ELF test (Grade B; High/Intermediate Strength of Evidence; BEL 2).

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: diagnosis and management [^115Q7x8g]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is characterized by steatosis, liver cell injury, and inflammation. The mechanism of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is unknown but involves the development of insulin resistance, steatosis, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with physical inactivity, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Screening is not recommended in the general population. The diagnosis is usually made after an incidental discovery of unexplained elevation of liver enzyme levels or when steatosis is noted on imaging (e.g., ultrasonography). Patients are often asymptomatic and the physical examination is often unremarkable. No single laboratory test is diagnostic, but tests of liver function, tests for metabolic syndrome, and tests to exclude other causes of abnormal liver enzyme levels are routinely performed. Imaging studies, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, can assess hepatic fat, measure liver and spleen size, and exclude other diseases. Liver biopsy remains the criterion standard for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Noninvasive tests are available and may reduce the need for liver biopsy. A healthy diet, weight loss, and exercise are first-line therapeutic measures to reduce insulin resistance. There is insufficient evidence to support bariatric surgery, metformin, thiazolidinediones, bile acids, or antioxidant supplements for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The long-term prognosis is not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or liver disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111L6gsn]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated steatosis — presentation, testing, and management: Patients with alcohol-associated steatosis are usually asymptomatic, and a palpably enlarged liver may be found in the absence of jaundice or stigmata of advanced liver disease. Among the common liver enzymes, elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and GGT are the best indicators of recent excessive alcohol consumption. Hepatic steatosis is readily identified on sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver, and MRI is more accurate for quantifying fat than other radiologic techniques, with the added advantage that MRI can assess fat over the entire volume of the liver. Liver biopsy is rarely needed for the diagnosis of alcohol-associated steatosis, and treatment entails abstinence.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114ZWqSb]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a common condition associated with metabolic syndrome. It is the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes in U.S. adults, and is diagnosed after ruling out other causes of steatosis (fatty infiltration of liver), particularly infectious hepatitis and alcohol abuse. Liver biopsy may be considered if greater diagnostic and prognostic certainty is desired, particularly in patients with diabetes, patients who are morbidly obese, and in patients with an aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase ratio greater than one, because these patients are at risk of having more advanced disease. Weight loss is the primary treatment for obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Medications used to treat insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and obesity have been shown to improve transaminase levels, steatosis, and histologic findings. However, no treatments have been shown to affect patient-oriented outcomes.

NAFLD — Assessment and management notes limitations of liver enzymes and preferred imaging for steatosis. Aminotransferase levels may be normal in advanced NASH and should not exclude disease with clinically significant fibrosis. Most laboratory "normal" ALT thresholds are high; as a general rule, ALT > 30 U/L should be considered abnormal. Standard ultrasound is not recommended to identify steatosis due to low sensitivity, whereas controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) may be used to identify steatosis and MRI–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) can quantify steatosis.

### Case definitions for inclusion and analysis of endpoints in clinical trials for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis through the lens of regulatory science [^111vGQ3c]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

In summary, histology remains the current standard for diagnosis of NASH cirrhosis. Presence of cirrhosis may be inferred from elastography with increased liver stiffness along with imaging or endoscopic evidence of collaterals, nodular liver, or splenomegaly without portal or splenic vein thrombosis. In the absence of radiographic or endoscopic evidence of cirrhosis, a diagnosis of cirrhosis can be inferred if patients have two or more of the following: (1) HVPG > 6 mm Hg, (2) AST/ALT ratio > 1 but < 2 and ALT < 10 × the upper limit of normal, or (3) platelet count < 150,000/mm³. Decompensated cirrhosis is defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage, Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score > 14, or an otherwise unexplained abnormality of ≥ 2 of bilirubin, international normalized ratio, or albumin. If biopsy is not available, the diagnosis of NASH cirrhosis may be inferred from the following after a negative laboratory workup for common causes of chronic liver disease: (1) current documentation of hepatic steatosis with noninvasive profile of cirrhosis, (2) prior biopsy showing NASH with evidence of cirrhosis, (3) prior imaging demonstrating hepatic steatosis with evidence of cirrhosis, or (4) two or more risk factors for NASH with evidence of cirrhosis. The diagnosis of cirrhosis based on prior imaging or presence of risk factors may be suitable for early‐phase clinical trials, though the level of evidence is not strong enough to be allowed for phase 2B or 3 trials.

Imaging-detected unsuspected hepatic steatosis — when patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging have symptoms or signs attributable to liver disease or have abnormal liver biochemistries, they should be evaluated as though they have suspected NAFLD and worked-up accordingly (Strength – 1, Evidence - A); in patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who lack any liver-related symptoms or signs and have normal liver biochemistries, it is reasonable to assess for metabolic risk factors (e.g., obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia) and alternate causes for hepatic steatosis such as significant alcohol consumption or medications (Strength – 1, Evidence - A); in patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who are asymptomatic and have normal liver biochemistries, a liver biopsy cannot be recommended (Strength – 1, Evidence - B).

A proportion of patients with biopsy-proven steatohepatitis develop hepatic fibrosis (20–40%) and cirrhosis (8–20%), and one-third of patients with asymptomatic forms of ASH have significant liver fibrosis.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a rapidly rising prevalence worldwide and is the most common cause of liver disease in developed countries. In this article, we discuss the spectrum of disease of NAFLD with a focus on the earlier spectrum of the disease that is commonly encountered by non-specialists, as well as the hepatic and extra-hepatic associations of the disease. We discuss in detail the two common presentations of NAFLD, incidentally detected hepatic steatosis and asymptomatic raised liver enzymes, and provide an algorithm for management and continued to follow up for these patients. Considerations for the management of cardiovascular comorbidities in these patients are also discussed. Finally, we cover the topic of screening for NAFLD in high-risk populations.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: common questions and answers on diagnosis and management [^116HUNgv]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease in the United States, affecting up to 30% of adults. There are two forms of NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), defined as 5% or greater hepatic steatosis without hepatocellular injury or fibrosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined as 5% or greater hepatic steatosis plus hepatocellular injury and inflammation, with or without fibrosis. Individuals with obesity are at highest risk of NAFLD. Other established risk factors include metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although NAFLD is common and typically asymptomatic, screening is not currently recommended, even in high-risk patients. NAFLD should be suspected in patients with elevated liver enzymes or hepatic steatosis on abdominal imaging that are found incidentally. Once other causes, such as excessive alcohol use and hepatotoxic medications, are excluded in these patients, risk scores or elastography tests can be used to identify those who are likely to have fibrosis that will progress to cirrhosis. Liver biopsy should be considered for patients at increased risk of fibrosis and when other liver disorders cannot be excluded with noninvasive tests. Weight loss through diet and exercise is the primary treatment for NAFLD. Other treatments, such as bariatric surgery, vitamin E supplements, and pharmacologic therapy with thiazolidinediones or glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, have shown potential benefit; however, data are limited, and these therapies are not considered routine treatments. NAFL typically follows an indolent course, whereas patients with NASH are at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and end-stage liver disease.

### AASLD practice statement on the evaluation and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children [^1147hqbX]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Evaluation of persistently elevated ALT in children — For children with persistently elevated ALT, perform a comprehensive evaluation to identify the underlying cause. Refer to Table 1 for detailed guidance on necessary tests, including viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and cardiometabolic disorders. Review all current and recent medications that may cause liver injury or contribute to hepatic steatosis. In adolescents aged 12 years and older, screen for substance use, including alcohol and recreational drugs, which can elevate ALT or contribute to steatosis, using validated questionnaires for youth. Consider inborn errors of metabolism if there are atypical signs or symptoms, such as early onset (particularly before 3 y of age), rapidly progressive or acute disease, absence of overweight/obesity, or additional involvement of other organ systems, particularly neurological signs or symptoms.

Diagnosis and staging of NAFLD/NASH

Clinical features and blood tests

A diagnosis of NAFLD requires that there is evidence of hepatic steatosis on imaging or histology, and other causes of liver disease or steatosis have been excluded.NAFLD is usually asymptomatic, so diagnosis usually follows the incidental finding of abnormal liver enzymes or steatosis on imaging. If abnormal LFTs are present, this is usually mildly raised transaminases (ALT > aspartate transaminase (AST)) and/or gamma-glutamyltransferase. However, ∼80% of patients have normal-range ALT levels (males < 40 IU/L and females < 31 IU/L), and even if elevated, the ALT typically falls (and AST may rise) as fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis. ALT values do not correlate with histological findings and are unhelpful in both the diagnosis of NAFLD and determining disease severity. Clinicians overly rely on abnormal liver enzymes to identify patients with NAFLD, so patients with significant liver disease can be overlooked, potentially missing opportunities for intervention. It has been repeatedly shown that 70–80% of subjects with central obesity and 50–80% of patients with type 2 diabetes have evidence of NAFLD on imaging. Therefore, a new approach is needed to use metabolic risk factors to identify subjects with NAFLD/NASH rather than relying on liver enzyme abnormalities.

In patients with abnormal LFTs, alternative causes of liver disease (or cofactors) should be excluded, including alcohol excess, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, haemochromatosis, coeliac disease and Wilson's disease (in patients < 45 years old). Autoantibodies are also frequently detected at a low titre in subjects with NAFLD (antinuclear antibody (ANA) ≥ 1:160 and/or antismooth muscle antibody (ASMA) ≥ 1:40) and are usually associated with normal IgG levels and do not generally indicate autoimmune hepatitis. Raised ferritin levels are common in NAFLD and usually reflect underlying inflammatory activity or insulin resistance. A transferrin saturation < 45% rules out haemochromatosis. If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis of NAFLD, then a liver biopsy should be considered.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease / nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: histological diagnostic criteria and scoring systems [^116MyEf4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is recognized as the most common cause of chronic liver disease in western countries. NAFLD is etiologically associated with systemic and hepatic insulin resistance and is considered by many as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD has a wide histological spectrum ranging from 'simple' steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma may occur in NASH-related cirrhosis. The diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH is based on clinico-pathological criteria. Currently available noninvasive tests for the diagnosis of NASH lack specificity and sensitivity, so liver biopsy, despite its limitations, still remains the 'golden standard' for confirming or excluding NASH in a patient with chronically-elevated liver enzymes and image-detected steatosis. This review examines the currently used criteria for the histopathological diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH in adults and children and the relevant histological scoring systems.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

Diagnosis of MASLD in children — criteria and referral triggers emphasize that although elevated ALT continues to be the most validated method to identify hepatic steatosis in children, elevated ALT alone, even with the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, is insufficient for diagnosing MASLD. As per the revised 2023 MASLD nomenclature, the diagnosis of MASLD requires confirmation of steatosis by imaging or biopsy, coupled with the presence of at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. Signs of acute hepatitis should prompt more urgent evaluation and early referral to gastroenterology or hepatology if associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, darker urine, lighter stools, easy bleeding, abdominal pain, fatigue, or pruritus are present, and evaluation for alternate causes of liver disease, such as Wilson disease or autoimmune hepatitis, remains important.

### Noninvasive assessment of hepatic steatosis [^115wj5Rg]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hepatic steatosis, the accumulation of lipids within hepatocytes, is a common condition. The prevalence of its most frequent manifestation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has been estimated to be as high as 35% in some populations. Currently, liver biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and assessment of severity of hepatic steatosis, staging of fibrosis, and is the only modality able to differentiate bland steatosis from steatohepatitis. However, its invasiveness, significant side effect profile, and susceptibility to sampling error ultimately make it a suboptimal tool. Accordingly, focus has been placed on noninvasive radiologic techniques for hepatic fat detection and quantification. The rationale, performance characteristics, and limitations of traditional noninvasive measures, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and imaging, are reviewed. A novel MR method, the spectrally modeled relaxation-invariant technique, overcomes the inherent weaknesses of conventional MR to diagnose and quantify hepatic steatosis over its entire range of severity. Noninvasive radiologic techniques, particularly MR, can be applied broadly, including in the diagnosis of NAFLD in asymptomatic patients with elevated serum aminotransferase levels, longitudinal monitoring of disease progression or response to treatment, population-based epidemiologic or observational studies, and drug discovery.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN pediatric NAFLD — diagnostic evaluation and imaging recommendations state that when evaluating a child suspected to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), it is recommended to exclude alternative etiologies for elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or hepatic steatosis and investigate coexisting chronic liver diseases (Strength: 1; Evidence: A). Liver biopsy should be considered for assessment in children who have increased risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and/or advanced fibrosis; potential clinical signs include higher ALT (> 80 U/L), splenomegaly, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT > 1, and known clinical risk factors include panhypopituitarism and type 2 diabetes (Strength: 1; Evidence: B). The use of ultrasound is not recommended for determination or quantification of steatosis due to poor sensitivity and specificity, though it may be useful for assessing other causes of liver disease (Strength: 1; Evidence: B), and the use of computed tomography (CT) is not recommended for determination or quantification of steatosis due to radiation risk (Strength: 1; Evidence: B).

Diagnosis of pediatric MASLD — key points emphasize that elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) alone, even with an unhealthy BMI, does not diagnose MASLD; a diagnosis in children requires confirmation of steatosis (by imaging or biopsy) and at least one cardiometabolic risk factor; and a diagnosis is presumptive until other steatotic liver diseases are excluded by serologic or histological examination. Imaging assessment of steatosis (ultrasound, MRI) can support diagnosis, with MRI-PDFF the most accurate noninvasive test and compliant with Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance standards; ultrasound lacks the specificity to make a definitive diagnosis; and Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) lacks sufficient validation in children with MASLD for the precision required in clinical decision-making.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^113wNBjj]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

NAFLD is a very common condition affecting approximately 30% of the population and can cause significant liver disease in a proportion of patients. Accurate diagnosis and staging is important in determining the appropriate long-term management for patients with NAFLD.

Key points

Alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are a poor predictor of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Ultrasound is the first-line imaging test for patients with suspected steatosis (good accuracy if > 30% of hepatocytes are steatotic).
Liver fat decreases as fibrosis increases.
Risk of NAFLD/NASH directly related to presence and severity of the metabolic syndrome.
Simple steatosis carries benign prognosis.
NASH carries poor prognosis with increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality.
Aims: to identify individuals at risk of NAFLD to risk stratify patients with NAFLD to focus care on patients with NASH.

Conventional imaging for hepatic steatosis — scope and limitations: Conventional grayscale ultrasound (US) can be used to screen for steatosis but is operator dependent and lacks sensitivity and specificity, and it is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy; noncontrast computed tomography (CT) lacks sensitivity for mild steatosis and exposes patients to radiation and thus is not recommended; overall, US, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have variable accuracy — especially at low fat levels — and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment, though US-based quantification with TE-CAP is now available and similar tools are emerging, and imaging tests can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques.

### Management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a 60-year-old man with probable nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: weight reduction, liver biopsy, or both? [^111wQU4N]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common hepatic disorders in the United States, but uncertainty remains as to the optimal way to manage it. Using the case of Mr T, a 60-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and increased serum transaminase levels, an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment is discussed. Diagnosis of NAFLD is based on patient clinical profile and risk factors for metabolic syndrome, the exclusion of other liver diseases, radiologic imaging and sometimes biopsy. At this point in Mr T's disease, the most important step is differentiation between simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Simple steatosis has a benign natural history, but NASH is progressive and may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by lack of large randomized trials, particularly of combinations of therapies, but weight loss, exercise, and medical therapies targeted at the mechanism of liver injury in NASH are recommended. Improved noninvasive diagnostic tests, a clearer understanding of the natural history of NAFLD, and large, well-designed clinical trials are needed.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

Diagnosis of NAFLD in adults — diabetes screening for clinically significant fibrosis (stages F2–F4) — In persons with T2D, clinicians should consider screening for clinically significant fibrosis using the FIB-4, even if they have normal liver enzyme levels (Grade B; High/Intermediate Strength of Evidence; BEL 2). In persons with T1D, clinicians may consider screening for NAFLD with clinically significant fibrosis using the FIB-4 only if there are risk factors such as obesity, features of metabolic syndrome, elevated plasma aminotransferase levels (> 30 U/L), or hepatic steatosis on imaging (Grade C; Intermediate/Weak Strength of Evidence; BEL 2, downgraded based on the heterogeneity of studies and moderate to high probability of bias). Clinicians should further risk stratify persons with T2D, or T1D with cardiometabolic risk factors and/or elevated plasma aminotransferase levels (> 30 U/L) using the FIB-4, elastography, and/or ELF test (Grade B; High/Intermediate Strength of Evidence; BEL 2).

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence-focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^117VDSBK]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Elevation in liver enzymes

Mild elevation in liver transaminases occurs in 0.5–2.0% of patients on any statin, usually within 3 months of initiation of therapy. This may not differ significantly from placebo, and in isolation, is unlikely to be clinically relevant. A systematic meta-analysis of 135 RCTs involving more than 246 000 patients reported that statins as a class produced ∼50% higher risk of transaminase elevation compared with control or placebo. There was a clear dose–response relationship for atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. These elevations were transient, and usually normalized with continuing therapy. Clinically relevant ALT elevations are rare. An analysis of 49 trials involving more than 14 000 patients, reported persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases [> 3× upper limit of normal (ULN)] in 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of patients on atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo (Table 4).

Table 4
Summary of evidence for possible adverse effects of statin treatment on hepatic function

In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not result in worsening of liver disease, although caution may be needed in patients with pre-existing primary biliary cirrhosis. Moreover, the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy are likely to outweigh any potential safety issues, as highlighted by the Joint Task Force guidelines. Indeed, an updated meta-analysis in more than 120 000 patients with chronic liver disease showed that statin use was associated with a lower risk of hepatic decompensation and mortality, and possibly reduced portal hypertension. Statins should not be prescribed, however, in patients with active hepatitis B virus infection until serum levels of AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, and ALP have normalized.

2.3 Eligibility criteria

Studies were eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) study design: RCTs; (2) population: adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of MASLD based on imaging or histological evidence; (3) intervention: any pharmacological treatment for MASLD; (4) control: placebo or standard care; (5) outcomes: primary outcomes including changes in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), liver histology (steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis) and secondary outcomes including changes in body weight, lipid profile and glycaemic parameters; (6) follow‐up duration: a minimum of 24 weeks. Studies were excluded if they: (1) were non‐RCT designs (observational studies, case reports, reviews); (2) included patients with other chronic liver diseases (viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, drug‐induced liver injury); (3) used combination therapies that could not isolate the effect of the studied drug; (4) had incomplete data reporting; (5) were published as abstracts only.

MASLD was diagnosed based on MRI‐PDFF, histological examination or non‐invasive scoring systems, depending on the study. In trials utilizing MRI‐PDFF, a threshold of ≥ 5% liver fat content was typically applied as the diagnostic criterion, consistent with established definitions of hepatic steatosis. In studies using liver biopsy, MASLD was diagnosed based on a steatosis grade ≥ 1 using the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), as per established histopathological criteria.

2.4 Study selection and data extraction

Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts of all retrieved records according to the eligibility criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer when necessary. The following data were independently extracted by two reviewers: study characteristics (first author, publication year, study design, country/region, sample size, study period), participant characteristics (age, gender distribution), intervention details (type and dosage of intervention, duration of treatment, control/comparison group, co‐interventions) and outcome measures (primary and secondary outcomes, the diagnosis of MASLD).

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117StPTZ]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) definitions — NAFLD requires evidence of hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology and absence of secondary causes such as significant alcohol consumption, long-term use of a steatogenic medication, or monogenic hereditary disorders; histologically, NAFLD is categorized as nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFL is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS without evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of hepatocyte ballooning. NASH is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (e.g., ballooning), with or without any fibrosis. For "advanced" fibrosis, this guidance refers specifically to stages 3 or 4, that is, bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.

### Diagnosis of fatty liver disease: is biopsy necessary? [^115ccwNS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasingly being recognized as an important and common condition, affecting approximately 20% of the general population. Although liver biopsy is currently the gold standard for diagnosis, there is a need for less invasive methods. Imaging by ultrasound, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance are all able to demonstrate fat. In this paper, these three imaging techniques are critically assessed. Ultrasound, although probably not the most reliable imaging method, has many advantages and, when positive, gives a high degree of certainty of the diagnosis depending on the prevalence of fatty liver in the population being studied. Unlike liver biopsy, none of these techniques is able to differentiate simple steatosis from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^116pUXU3]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

This process focuses on the nomenclature and definition of NAFLD rather than a determination of what constitutes hepatic steatosis or assessment of disease severity. There is extensive literature on the confirmation of hepatic steatosis, which we did not seek to interrogate; often, this is a pragmatic determination in clinical practice, which is where this guidance starts. Moreover, this nomenclature process, in line with published guidance, is not advocating for the routine use of tests to confirm hepatic steatosis although, in reality, most, if not all, patients will usually have imaging at some point. Finally, we recognise it is the evaluation of fibrosis either as part of screening strategies or individual clinical decisions, which is relevant for most clinical settings. That remains unchanged after this process, other than the name (eg, MASLD with advanced fibrosis).

Contrary to the initial proposal by Eslam and colleagues, the Delphi process revealed that most experts consider that MetALD patients should be classified in a category distinct from MASLD, mainly because of the added pathogenic value of alcohol consumption and consequential prognostic implications. The condition MetALD provides an opportunity to better define the natural history of such patients and the development of biomarkers and therapies that are currently lacking for this group of patients. ALD is a distinct liver disease (of which steatosis is one of the features) and, thus, is categorised under the SLD umbrella. This should raise awareness of alcohol as a driver of steatosis and highlight the impact of excessive alcohol consumption (ie, > 50–60 g daily in females and males, respectively) irrespective of their association with metabolic dysfunction. Studies have shown that, even in excessive drinkers, obesity increases the prevalence of cirrhosis, and glycaemic dysregulation increases fibrosis severity. Patterns of alcohol use must also be taken into consideration as bingeing (even within the total weekly "allowable limit" for MASLD) can be detrimental. We also recognise that objective tools are not available or sufficiently validated to determine the relative contribution of MASLD and ALD in patients with MetALD, and hence, we rely on self-reported alcohol intake, which can be inaccurate. In that regard, this is a conceptual construct and might be better seen as a disease spectrum with differing of modifiable disease drivers (CMRFs and alcohol). This is also relevant for the distinction between patients with MetALD and those drinking more heavily, which are termed as having ALD. Also, the category of ALD without metabolic factors is relatively rare among patients with significant fibrosis, but it was felt to represent part of the spectrum.

### Cholecystectomy causes ultrasound evidence of increased hepatic steatosis [^112TJCjH]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cholecystectomy might contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis through metabolic changes. The biologic alteration of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and the alteration of the metabolic activity of bile acid that follows cholecystectomy may contribute to hepatic steatosis. This prospective study was conducted to clarify the possibility of steatosis development after cholecystectomy.

Methods

From October 2013 to July 2014, 82 consecutive patients with a presumptive diagnosis of gallbladder disease were cholecystectomized. Liver parenchymal steatosis was measured using ultrasound and the hepatic steatosis index.

Results

In all 82 patients, the hepatic steatosis index was found to be significantly correlated with the US fatty liver grade (Spearman's correlation r² = 0.331, P < 0.001). A total of 62 patients were followed up for 3 months. Comparison with the initial grade showed that 12 (18.5%) patients had worsened from normal to mild (n = 10), from mild to moderate (n = 1), and from mild to severe (n = 1). The other patients stayed at their initial grade except one patient who improved (from moderated to mild). Analysis of laboratory findings showed that white blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase level, and total bilirubin level were decreased. However, serum albumin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly increased.

Conclusions

Hepatic steatosis significantly developed 3 months after cholecystectomy. Therefore, cholecystectomy might be considered a risk factor for hepatic steatosis, but the relationship should be confirmed with long-term follow-up from a large group of patients.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A decalogue from the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) expert committee [^116vXkW3]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

We report the evidence-based Italian Association for the Study of Liver guidelines for the appropriate diagnosis and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in clinical practice and its related research agenda. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease varies according to age, gender and ethnicity. In the general population, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is about 25% and the incidence is of two new cases/100 people/year. 2–3% of individuals in the general population will suffer from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Uncomplicated steatosis will usually follow a benign course. Individuals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, however, have a reduced life expectancy, mainly owing to vascular diseases and liver-related causes. Moreover, steatosis has deleterious effects on the natural history of HCV infection. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is usually diagnosed in asymptomatic patients prompted by the occasional discovery of increased liver enzymes and/or of ultrasonographic steatosis. Medical history, complete physical examination, etiologic screening of liver injury, liver biochemistry tests, serum lipids and insulin sensitivity tests should be performed in every patient. Occult alcohol abuse should be ruled out. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging technique. Liver biopsy, the gold standard in diagnosis and prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is an invasive procedure and its results will not influence treatment in most cases but will provide prognostic information. Assessment of fibrosis by composite scores, specific laboratory parameters and transient elastography might reduce the number of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients requiring liver biopsy. Dieting and physical training reinforced by behavioural therapy are associated with improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Diabetes and the metabolic syndrome should be ruled out at timed intervals in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients should undergo periodic evaluation of cardiovascular risk and of advancement of their liver disease; those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-cirrhosis should be evaluated for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

Diagnosis of NAFLD in adults — high-risk identification and biopsy evaluation — Clinicians should consider persons with obesity and/or features of metabolic syndrome, those with prediabetes or T2D, and those with hepatic steatosis on any imaging study and/or persistently elevated plasma aminotransferase levels (over 6 months) to be "high risk" and screen for NAFLD and advanced fibrosis (Grade B; Intermediate/High Strength of Evidence; BEL 2). Persons undergoing bariatric surgery should be evaluated for the presence and severity of NASH, and a liver biopsy should be considered at the time of bariatric surgery; liver biopsy should be recommended if preprocedural stratification suggests indeterminate or high risk of liver fibrosis (Grade B; Intermediate Strength of Evidence; BEL 2).

Monitoring liver enzyme elevation

Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes during statin therapy is not supported by current evidence, and is thus not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Indeed, routine periodic monitoring could identify patients with isolated increased ALT, AST, or GGT levels, and prompt physicians to reduce or discontinue statin therapy, thereby placing patients at increased risk for CVD events. It is, however, reasonable to measure hepatic function if symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity arise (e.g. unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-coloured urine, or yellowing of the skin or sclera). If the patient develops ALT levels > 3× ULN (or lower when combined with a new increase in bilirubin levels), the statin should be discontinued. Other potential aetiologies should be considered before assuming that the elevated liver enzymes are due to the statin.

Take home messages

Mild ALT elevation in isolation in asymptomatic statin users is not clinically relevant. In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not worsen liver disease.
Clinically apparent liver injury with statin therapy is very rare and likely to be a class effect of statins.
Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes is not justified.
Liver enzymes should be measured in the rare patient who develops symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. NAFLD is a spectrum of the disease characterized by hepatic steatosis when no other causes for secondary hepatic fat accumulation (e.g. excessive alcohol consumption) can be identified. NAFLD ranges from the more benign condition of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is at the more severe end of the spectrum. NAFLD may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. In NAFLD, hepatic steatosis is present without evidence of inflammation, whereas in NASH, hepatic steatosis is associated with lobular inflammation and apoptosis that can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Before the middle of the last decade, NASH was widely considered a serious condition, occurring almost exclusively in females with obesity, often associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and relatively benign prognosis, that are predictive risk factors of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes. The prevalence of liver disease (NAFLD) has risen rapidly in Western countries, with a worldwide prevalence of 25%. NAFLD is becoming more common chronic liver disease in Western industrialized countries, particularly in patients with central obesity, T2DM, dyslipidaemia, and metabolic syndrome.

In terms of diagnostic tests, the gold standard to investigate any form of liver inflammation e.g. damage is a liver biopsy. In the diagnosis of NAFLD and related disorders, liver biopsies can be extremely helpful and its findings can range from triglyceride deposition as droplets in the hepatocyte to more extensive forms of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is normally characterised by the earlier mentioned lipid droplets in hepatocytes, with concomitant inflammation and a variable degree of hepatic fibrosis. In the majority of the liver steatosis patients, the disease is 'non-progressive', however a small portion of these patients develop the earlier mentioned NASH, which can lead to liver failure and even hepatocellular carcinoma.

NAFLD management's US guidelines define NAFLD as steatosis with ≥ 5% fat infiltration in imaging or histology and b) no alcohol, drug, or viral-induced steatosis. NAFLD patients may present with elevated liver enzymes.

Introduction — Definition, diagnosis and clinical staging of NAFLD

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the liver disease epidemic of the 21st century, since prevalence rates range between 23% and 32% depending on the geographical region with numbers predicted to rise further globally. The term NAFLD itself summarizes a broad disease spectrum: non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), which is characterized by simple steatosis but absent inflammation or hepatocyte ballooning, represents the mildest manifestation. Non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), however, is characterized by not only steatosis of the liver but also inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, and is a more severe presentation of the disease spectrum which may lead to advanced fibrosis or even cirrhosis. In approximately 5% of patients with NAFLD complications of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma may occur during long‐term follow‐up. Of note, however, most patients with non‐advanced NAFLD (i.e. Fibrosis Stage 0–2) primarily show extrahepatic events during follow‐up and the predominant cause of death in these patients derives from cardiovascular disease rather than from liver‐related events. Apart from the importance of distinguishing between a diagnosis of NAFL or NASH and grading of disease activity, presence and stage of fibrosis need to be determined in every patient since it has been shown that prognosis is mostly influenced by the grade of fibrosis rather than presence/absence of NASH.

Suspicion of NAFLD should be raised in patients presenting with either elevated liver enzymes (i.e. liver transaminases and/or gamma‐glutamyltransferase) or those who show hepatic steatosis on abdominal ultrasound. Most importantly before diagnosing NAFLD the most common other etiologies of chronic liver disease (i.e. hepatitis, autoimmune, hereditary or cholestatic) and especially relevant alcohol consumption (≥ 30 g/day in men, ≥ 20 g/day in women) should be excluded. Typically, patients presenting with one‐ or more components of the metabolic syndrome are at high risk for developing NAFLD and hepatic steatosis on imaging and/or elevated liver enzymes should raise the suspicion for NAFLD.

A wide spectrum of non‐invasive diagnostic methods have been developed and clinically tested over the last years, the most important‐ and tested ones being vibration‐controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and non‐invasive fibrosis tests (i.e. NAFLD Fibrosis Score or FIB‐4 Score). However, non‐invasive diagnostic algorithms and risk stratification for NAFLD are out of the scope of this article but have been reviewed elsewhere.

For imaging assessment of steatosis, MRI-PDFF is preferred if available; ultrasound is used if MRI is not available; controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is not recommended for diagnosis. Consider liver biopsy if diagnostic uncertainty, including when ALT is persistently ≥ 2 × ULN (44 U/L, girls, 52 U/L, boys), when evaluating for alternate etiology if indicated, or when at risk for fibrosis (↑ ALT, ↑ GGT, diabetes, ↑ liver stiffness or other imaging signs).

### Prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19 infection and association with clinical outcomes [^115Kgq71]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver injury in COVID-19 patients might occur from viral infection of hepatocytes, or as a response to cytokine storm resulting in inflammation. This needs to be further corroborated by direct clinical evidence. SARS virus has been isolated in liver tissue based on some case series, although viral inclusions were not observed and the overall viral titer was low. On the other hand, in an alternative case report of a pathological analysis of a patient who died from COVID-19, viral inclusions in hepatic tissue were not noted.

In conclusion, liver injury indicators may help foresee disease severity. Patients with elevated AST and AST/ALT ratio are at higher risk of severe disease, as evidenced by intubation, vasopressor use, and inpatient death. These patients should be monitored closely, given their propensity for severe disease.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Liver function abnormalities have been observed in patients with COVID-19 infection
Evidence of extrapulmonary organ involvement, including hepatic injury, has been associated with higher mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection, based on previously published reports
Several mechanisms of liver injury have been described thus far, including potential binding of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 positive cholangiocytes, and causing cholangiocyte dysfunction, along with mild lobular and portal involvement and progression to microvesicular steatosis

What the new findings are:

An elevated aspartate (AST)/alanine (ALT) aminotransferase ratio of 2 or more can serve as a marker for multiorgan involvement, given that AST can be produced by several other organs apart from the liver; in our study, an elevated AST/ALT ratio was associated with severe clinical outcomes, as evidenced by increased need for intubation, intensive care unit admission, and vasopressor use
Patients with severe COVID-19 infection were more frequently noted to have AST elevation compared to ALT elevation
AST levels had the highest correlation with severe disease compared to other individual markers reflecting liver injury

Introduction

While the number of deaths from other common conditions is falling in the UK, those due to liver disease have been increasing dramatically, with a 400% increase in the standardised mortality rate over the period 1970–2010. Notably, for those patients younger than 65, the rise in standardised mortality rate for liver disease is > 500%, such that it now constitutes the fifth biggest cause of premature mortalitywith 64 000 years of working life lost every year. For morbidity, in England and Wales, 57 682 hospital admissions and 10 948 deaths were due to liver disease in 20 12. This rising burden of liver disease is mainly a reflection of the three the most common causes: alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and viral hepatitis, although autoimmune liver disease is also a significant contributor. The burden of liver disease in children differs from that in adults, as although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is seen in all ages, reflecting the rise in childhood obesity, disease associated with injecting drug use and alcohol are rarely encountered. However, viral hepatitis is seen as a consequence of perinatal transmission, and its chronicity contributes to the disease burden seen in adults. Other causes of liver disease, such as biliary atresia or metabolic disorders, present almost exclusively in infancy or childhood, but progressive liver disease continues to evolve throughout childhood and into adulthood. There are concerted efforts to deal with this rising tide of liver disease such as the Lancet Commission on Liver Disease, the Alcohol Health Alliance and the Obesity Health Alliance.

Liver disease develops silently; there may be no signs or symptoms until the complications of liver failure or portal hypertension develop. At this late, often pre-terminal stage, the tests of liver function — bilirubin, albumin, international normalised ratio (INR) and platelet count — may be abnormal. In necro-inflammatory hepatitic diseases liver enzymes are frequently elevated, whereas in apoptotic diseases including fatty liver disease (alcohol and non-alcohol related), liver enzymes may be normal or elevated, but the degree of abnormality is not related to the stage of progression from simple fatty liver, through progressive fibrosis to cirrhosis. Since the current liver blood tests were developed in the 1950s, they have been the mainstay of liver disease identification, with the result that many patients with liver disease are not identified until they have developed significant liver fibrosis.

Evaluation of incidentally discovered hepatic steatosis (HS) — A recent study showed that 11% of patients with incidentally discovered HS may be at high risk for advanced hepatic fibrosis based on the calculated NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). Patients with unsuspected HS detected on imaging who have symptoms or signs attributable to liver disease or have abnormal liver chemistries should be evaluated as though they have suspected NAFLD and worked up accordingly. Patients with unsuspected HS detected on imaging who have normal liver biochemistries should be assessed for metabolic risk factors (e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia) and alternate causes for HS such as significant alcohol consumption or medications.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — lifestyle modification may reduce aminotransferases and improve hepatic steatosis measured by ultrasound or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy, with studies reporting a significant reduction in liver fat by an average of ∼40% (ranging from 20% to 81%) and generally requiring a body weight loss between ∼5 to 10%. Exercise without dietary modification was investigated in four MR spectroscopy studies in which programs consisted of 2–3 sessions a week of 30–60 minutes over a period of 6 to 12 weeks, and in all but one study liver fat content diminished without a significant change in body weight. Weight loss generally reduces hepatic steatosis, achieved either by hypocaloric diet alone or in conjunction with increased physical activity. (Strength – 1, Evidence – A) Loss of at least 3–5% of body weight appears necessary to improve steatosis, but a greater weight loss (up to 10%) may be needed to improve necroinflammation. (Strength – 1, Evidence – B) Exercise alone in adults with NAFLD may reduce hepatic steatosis but its ability to improve other aspects of liver histology remains unknown.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^111E9Cjn]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

On the basis of strong research and consensus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in children and is soon to be the most common indication for liver transplantation in adults. Although the disease begins as simple steatosis, some patients may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, making early identification and treatment critical.• The diagnosis of NAFLD can be challenging because patients are typically asymptomatic, with no major clinical symptoms of liver disease. Overweight and obese children are at the highest risk for disease. (1)(2)• On the basis of moderate research and consensus, serum ALT is usually mildly elevated but is an imperfect test with a low sensitivity for detecting NAFLD at commonly used thresholds.(10) Liver biopsy is still considered the gold standard for diagnosis but is too invasive for population-level screening and is often used selectively. Novel, noninvasive diagnostic modalities and serum biomarkers are currently being studied but warrant further validation, especially in children.• On the basis of moderate research and consensus, assessing serum liver tests in any overweight or obese child is reasonable. Liver disease should be suspected if the serum ALT is ‡22 U/L(0.37 mkat/L) in girls and ‡25 U/L (0.42 mkat/L) in boys. (10)Subspecialist referral should be considered for those with a normal BMI, persistent ALT elevation longer than 6 months, specific symptoms of advanced liver disease such as splenomegaly, or concerning laboratory findings on selected screening tests.• On the basis of strong research evidence, weight loss is the most efficacious treatment for NAFLD.• On the basis of some research and consensus, initiation of vitamin E therapy (400 IU BID) may be started, although its use probably should be restricted to those children with biopsy-proven disease. (12)• On the basis of some research and consensus, novel elastography-based imaging modalities are being studied in children and several drugs show promise in treating NAFLD.

Initiation and monitoring of potentially hepatotoxic medications in pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — "Children with NAFLD occasionally require medications for other conditions such as diabetes, infections, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, psychiatric illness, or other chronic illnesses". "Current recommendations are to evaluate transaminases before starting metformin and to check liver enzymes at the time of diagnosis of T2DM". "Evidence is, however, lacking on how often to monitor liver enzymes after initiating therapy". "Atypical antipsychotic drugs can also cause rapid and severe weight gain and emergence of cardiometabolic risk factors, and elevated liver enzymes in previously normal weight children. Liver enzymes therefore should be checked before starting atypical antipsychotics and are typically monitored frequently after starting them". The guideline adds that "Baseline liver enzyme levels should be obtained in children with NAFLD before starting any medication known to be hepatotoxic" and that monitoring frequency should be guided by disease severity and drug risk with "Strength: 1, Evidence: C". It further states, "If potentially hepatotoxic drugs are being considered in patients with NAFLD, a baseline liver biopsy may be reasonable to consider for assessing the severity of liver disease before beginning the medication.

### Hypertension and fatty liver: guilty by association? [^114pJhio]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Essential hypertension is associated with the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and the development of fatty liver. Fatty liver disease is a spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple hepatic steatosis through steato-hepatitis to cirrhosis and hepatoma. The purpose of this review is to discuss the evidence for an association between essential hypertension and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and to consider the diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We conclude that it is important to consider the diagnosis of fatty liver disease in hypertensive patients, to measure the liver function tests at diagnosis and not to ignore minor elevations of serum aminotransferases. Hypertensive patients with raised liver enzymes should be referred for further assessment, particularly if risk factors for progressive liver disease, such as obesity and diabetes, are present.

Identification of people with NAFLD

Use of defined pathways for the investigation of suspected liver disease has been shown to increase the diagnosis of significant liver disease and reduce unnecessary referrals. Therefore, services should have an agreed local clinical pathway for the investigation of suspected liver disease that includes an assessment for liver fibrosis using available non-invasive liver fibrosis tests (Recommendation 1, Table 1). Key aspects to consider when developing pathways are described below.

NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome (defined as any three of the following: impaired fasting glucose or T2DM; hypertriglyceridemia; low HDL; increased waist circumference or high blood pressure). As well as NAFLD being highly prevalent in those with T2DM or the metabolic syndrome, the presence of these risk factors is associated with more progressive liver disease in NAFLD. Therefore, consider the possibility of liver fibrosis due to NAFLD in those with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or the metabolic syndrome (Recommendation 2, Table 1).

Proactive assessment for the presence of liver fibrosis in patients at risk can permit earlier identification of significant liver disease –. The 'Scarred Liver Project', which offered community fibrosis testing to people with diabetes or obesity alongside those with hazardous alcohol consumption, identified 3688 patients at risk from a cohort of 25,018. Overall, 20% of at-risk individuals who attended a follow-up clinic had evidence of significant liver disease. Furthermore, a study including FIB-4 (discussed below) testing in annual diabetic reviews in primary care followed by transient elastography in those with an indeterminate or high FIB-4 found that 4.5% of the cohort had previously undiagnosed advanced liver disease, defined as imaging, endoscopic or biopsy evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension or HCC.

Evidence to support a case finding strategy amongst people with significant risk factors is currently limited and remains an area of divergence between current European and North American clinical guidelines. However, it is likely that a fibrosis risk-based approach in primary care may be more successful - and cost-effective - for the early identification of liver disease, than reliance on abnormal liver function or incidental finding of steatosis on imaging. However, it is also important to acknowledge that greater efforts to investigate and identify advanced liver disease in this group may result in a significant increase in primary and secondary care workload, and local service development considerations should be planned accordingly.

### Metabolic syndrome and transaminases: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144MQ2J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) encompasses several cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, central obesity and hypertension. It is a multifactorial non-communicable disease that significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality and is considered a public health burden worldwide.

In addition to increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), MetS and its risk factors, including obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM), are associated with liver disease. Liver function is essential for glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Hepatic glucose homeostasis influences insulin sensitivity, while peripheral insulin resistance and lipolysis contribute to fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis).

In this regard, MetS has a direct relationship with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), both being predictors of the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

NAFLD affects approximately 25% of the world's population and is a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. This disorder, characterised by lipid deposition in hepatocytes, encompasses a group of liver diseases that resemble alcoholic liver disease, ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. These liver diseases have become the leading causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality and a risk factor for DM, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, MetS and CVD.

In this context, early liver impairment detection would help prevent or diagnose other metabolic disorders. According to recent studies, liver function tests, including serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), can be valuable parameters in the assessment of metabolic status, especially in the investigation of cardio-metabolic disorders. Specifically, several authors have explored the associations between liver enzymes, MetS, and CVD in different populations. In this regard, elevated ALT levels have been shown to help predict CVD in prospective studies, and MetS and its components. Although GGT is considered an indicator of the degree of liver disease and alcohol consumption, several studies have shown that the level of this enzyme is also associated with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular mortality independently of liver damage or alcohol consumption. One of the advantages of these parameters is that they are commonly measured in liver function tests and are well-known markers of liver damage.

Therefore, this possible relationship between serum liver enzymes and MetS has recently attracted much attention. Therefore, the main objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the best degree of evidence on the association between liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) and MetS, determining the effect size of these biomarkers.

### Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^11193En6]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition characterized by hepatomegaly, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, and a histologic picture similar to alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of alcohol abuse. Most patients with NASH are obese women, and many have diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertriglyceridemia. NASH has also been associated with a number of metabolic conditions, surgical procedures, and drug treatments. Most patients are asymptomatic. The most common sign of NASH is hepatomegaly. Stigmata of chronic liver disease are rare. Laboratory abnormalities include a 2–4-fold elevation of serum aminotransferase levels; other liver function test results are usually normal. Histologically, there is moderate to severe macrovesicular steatosis and lobular hepatitis with necrosis or ballooning degeneration and/or fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is poorly understood, but lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are the leading culprits. The natural history of NASH is unknown, but NASH seems to be a stable disease in most patients. Treatment of NASH is unproven, but weight reduction is recommended in obese patients. Small pilot studies of several drugs have shown promise, but large randomized clinical trials are awaited.

### Association of histologic disease activity with progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^111342tt]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease who are not undergoing specific therapeutic interventions, what factors are associated with progression and regression of hepatic fibrosis?

Findings

In this cohort study of 446 patients, high baseline nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score and changes in the score were associated with concordant changes in fibrosis. Weight gain, high baseline aspartate aminotransferase level, and increases in the aspartate aminotransferase level were associated with fibrosis progression.

Meaning

These data may support the use of therapeutics targeting disease activity in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and the use of short-term changes in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score as an end point in such clinical trials; in clinical practice, weight gain and an increasing aspartate aminotransferase level should increase suspicion of increasing fibrosis.

Further risk stratification in the gastroenterology and hepatology practice settings — advanced tools and biopsy use are described: The primary goal in the specialty care setting is the identification of patients with "at-risk" NASH or advanced fibrosis who may benefit from targeted interventions; MR-based tools such as MRE or MRI corrected T1 (cT1) can be used to further risk stratify when other noninvasive tests are indeterminate or not reflective of clinical suspicion, and liver biopsy should be considered when there is diagnostic uncertainty or when there is persistent elevation (> 6 mo) in liver chemistries.

### Metabolic syndrome and transaminases: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113MTHxL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to analyse the most recent evidence on the relationship between MetS and liver enzymes (ALT, AST and GGT). Seventeen articles were selected in which the effect size was quantified and the limitations that have conditioned the results of the different studies. All demonstrated sufficient reliability and methodological quality regarding the association between ALT, AST, GGT and MetS.

The present meta-analysis has shown the relationship between the levels of different liver enzymes studied and MetS. The concentration of the liver enzymes studied in the 76,686 MetS + subjects was significantly higher than in the group of 201,855 controls (MetS-).

The presence of elevated liver enzymes may precede the development of MetS, with alterations of the liver being observed that are directly related to metabolic problems, such as NAFLD. Recently, it was considered a manifestation of metabolic diseases. However, it has been suggested that NAFLD temporarily precedes DM and that hepatic steatosis may cause insulin resistance and may be an early sign of the development of metabolic diseases. In addition, when fat is deposited in insulin-sensitive organs such as the liver, muscle and visceral compartments, free fatty acids and inflammatory cytokines increase while adiponectin levels decrease. These changes can lead to peripheral insulin resistance, early atherogenesis, impaired glucose metabolism and MetS.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic liver disease [^116ZrX7B]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The liver fibrosis stage is the most important clinical determinate of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic liver diseases. With newer therapies, liver fibrosis can be stabilized and possibly reversed, thus accurate diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis are clinically important. Ultrasound, CT, and conventional MRI can be used to establish the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis but have limited utility for assessing earlier stages of fibrosis. Elastography-based ultrasound and MRI techniques are more useful for assessment of precirrhotic hepatic fibrosis. In patients with advanced fibrosis at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ultrasound is the surveillance modality recommended by international guidelines in nearly all circumstances. However, in patients in whom ultrasound does not assess the liver well, including those with severe steatosis or obesity, multiphase CT or MRI may have a role in surveillance for HCC. Both multiphase CT and MRI can be used for continued surveillance in patients with a history of HCC, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound may have an emerging role in this setting. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^114221NJ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the UK with approximately a third of the population being affected. The exact prevalence is not known, but population studies from the United States and China using magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimate that approximately 30% of the general population have steatosis. It is a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), through to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. The majority have simple steatosis, but approximately 10–30% develop NASH and the development of NASH cirrhosis is associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Patients with NASH have increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality. Many patients with NAFLD remain undiagnosed, and recognising those at risk is the first step. Clinicians overly rely on abnormal liver enzymes to identify patients with NAFLD, so patients with significant liver disease can be overlooked, potentially missing opportunities for intervention. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard method for diagnosing and staging NAFLD, the majority of patients can be effectively diagnosed non-invasively with tests that are routinely available in the clinic today. This review discusses a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and staging of NAFLD so that patients at the highest risk of liver-related complications can be identified.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^114vk2Zm]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in many developed countries. Up to a third of the population have evidence of steatosis on imaging, with the majority (70%–90%) having simple steatosis. However, 10%–30% of subjects with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis, which puts patients at risk of liver-related complications. Due to the metabolic risk factors that are common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, patients with NASH have an increased risk of cardiovascular death as well as liver-related mortality. In the first part of this review, we discussed the diagnosis and staging of patients with NAFLD and the importance of risk stratification. Here we will discuss the management of patients with NAFLD.

Presence of lifestyle risk factors associated with the development of NAFLD: obesity/type 2 diabetes

Commonly, the question about non-alcoholic fatty liver arises in response to the incidental observation of abnormal liver blood tests or an echobright liver on an ultrasound scan (USS). Case finding or screening to identify patients with NAFLD remains controversial, with conflicting advice from Americanand Europeanguidelines. Indeed recent NICE guidance does not advocate this at present, although the advent of new diagnostics and treatments allied with cost-effectiveness analyses may affect this in the future.

Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for NAFLD in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)

### Lomitapide-induced fatty liver is a reversible condition: evidence from a case of familial chylomicronemia syndrome [^111JSEpM]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Hepatic monitoring under lomitapide — liver safety was tracked with laboratory tests and imaging, showing mostly stable enzymes, intermediate fibrosis risk by FIB-4, progressive steatosis, and normal-range stiffness. Monitoring included liver function tests, ultrasonography, FibroScan, and magnetic resonance imaging. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) fluctuated with transient elevations occasionally exceeding the upper limit of normal, but levels predominantly remained within or close to the reference range. Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) values were initially 2.3, finally 2.4, and averaged 2.44, placing the patient within the category of intermediate risk of fibrosis. Hepatic steatosis progressed from mild to moderate and eventually severe, while FibroScan liver stiffness values varied yet maintained a median within the normal range at 6 kPa.

### Biopsy and noninvasive methods to assess progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1125CqgP]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of histopathologic features, ranging from isolated hepatic steatosis, to steatohepatitis with evidence of hepatocellular injury and fibrosis, to cirrhosis. The diagnosis and determination of NAFLD prognosis requires clinical and histopathologic assessments. Liver biopsy still is regarded as the reference for differentiating steatosis (NAFL) from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, for staging hepatic fibrosis, and for identifying NAFLD in patients with other chronic liver disease. Standardized grading and staging histologic scoring systems, such as the NAFLD activity score and the steatosis, activity, and fibrosis score, can help guide clinical decisions and assess outcomes of clinical trials. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of NAFLD and technologic advances have led to algorithms that can be used to assess serum biomarkers and imaging methods that are noninvasive alternatives to biopsy collection and analysis. We review the advantages and limitations of biopsy analysis and noninvasive tests as diagnostic and prognostic tools for patients with NAFLD. We also discuss techniques to improve dynamic histopathology assessment, and emerging blood and imaging biomarkers of fibrogenesis.

### Metabolic syndrome is linked to a mild elevation in liver aminotransferases in diabetic patients with undetectable non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by ultrasound [^117PtaBe]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin insensitivity is a known cause of liver damage. Elevation of circulating liver enzymes including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is suggestive of hepatocellular injury. There is increasing evidence that ALT is significantly and independently associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, however not all of the studies support this finding.

In recent years, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as a novel component of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (MetS), has drawn the attention of many researchers. NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple benign steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. This condition which is associated with long-standing elevations in liver enzymes, is related to higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and MetS.

Despite ongoing findings on the relationship between NAFLD and MetS, the relationship between elevated liver enzymes and MetS in diabetic patients without a known cause for liver enzymes elevation other than diabetes, per se, remains unclear. In particular, while most of the studies describe the association between MetS and elevated liver aminotransferases via the NAFLD mechanism; it is not clear what extent of liver steatosis is sufficient to mediate the association between liver enzymes and MetS in diabetes. To best of our knowledge, no evidence is available regarding the association between MetS and serum aminotransferases in patients with mild stages of liver steatosis. To determine subjects with mild liver steatosis from those with advanced stages, ultrasonography is an appropriate screening tool. Ultrasonography with the sensitivity of 60–89 percent and specificity of 66–93 percent in detecting steatosis is proved as a good tool for detection of clinically significant fatty infiltrations, in epidemiologic studies. It is reported that individuals with negative fatty liver changes in ultrasonography have hepatic fat < 30%.

Of note, there is limited evidence regarding the pattern of abnormality in liver enzymes in diabetic patients with and without MetS. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between circulating liver enzymes and MetS in a relatively large sample of Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes, after excluding patients with ultrasonographic signs of NAFLD or any other known causes of hepatocellular injury.

### A new noninvasive technique for estimating hepatic triglyceride: will liver biopsy become redundant in diagnosing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? [^1128earA]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of obesity is increasing worldwide at an alarmingly fast pace, mainly because of a combination of cultural, social, and economic factors that affect lifestyle. Currently, one out of every three Americans is considered to be obese. Obesity is the main driver for the onset of metabolic syndrome, which is a group of metabolic abnormalities that share the cardiovascular risk factors hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Presence of metabolic syndrome including obesity is a strong predictor for hepatic steatosis, defined as lipid deposition in hepatocytes. Its phenotype ranges from non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD), to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH - fatty changes with inflammation and hepatocellular injury or fibrosis), to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Similar to obesity, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions with a prevalence of 20% to 30% in western populations. Because NAFLD constitutes a risk factor for NASH, it is to be expected that the prevalence of complicated liver disease in patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome will rise. As such, prevention of metabolic syndrome is a therapeutic target and lifestyle changes for patients at risk should be encouraged.

The question then arises, how to detect liver steatosis? Ultrasound is by far the most frequently used modality to detect liver steatosis. Fatty filtration of the liver produces a diffuse increase in echogenicity (a bright liver) and blurring of vascular margins and the diaphragm. Ultrasound, however, has some inherent disadvantages, such as a limited sensitivity to detect steatosis when less than 30% of hepatocytes contains fat, and its accuracy is compromised in patients who are obese. In addition, ultrasound cannot identify relevant liver disease in the context of NASH, such as steatohepatitis or fibrosis.

The gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD and to differentiate it from NASH is liver biopsy. A liver biopsy should be considered in patients with liver steatosis on imaging who are at increased risk of steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis, such as patients with competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis (for example, diabetes mellitus) and with co-existing liver disease. However, the invasive nature of liver biopsy with its risk for major complications, such as bleeding in approximately 1% of cases, precludes widespread use. Therefore, an accurate, easy to conduct, and less invasive technique is needed in diagnosing NAFLD. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive modalities for quantifying steatosis. However, none of these imaging techniques have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to stage the disease and cannot distinguish between NAFLD and NASH.

Steatotic liver disease (MASLD) primary care FIB-4 triage — When the FIB-4 is < 1.3, patients can be followed in the primary care setting and reassessed periodically, with patients without prediabetes/T2DM and < 2 metabolic risk factors reassessed every 2–3 years, while more frequent FIB-4 monitoring (eg, every 1–2 y) should be considered for those with prediabetes/T2DM or ≥ 2 or more metabolic risk factors. In patients older than age 65, an FIB-4 cutoff of > 2.0 should be used, whereas FIB-4 has low accuracy in those under the age of 35 years; thus, secondary assessment should be considered in those < 35 years of age with increased metabolic risk or elevated liver chemistries. FIB-4 should not be used in acutely ill patients, and in patients with FIB-4 ≥ 1.3, a secondary assessment should be done (preferably VCTE or ELF initially).

AASLD NAFLD practice guidance — noninvasive steatosis and fibrosis assessment states that although standard ultrasound can detect hepatic steatosis, it is not recommended to identify hepatic steatosis due to low sensitivity across the NAFLD spectrum. CAP may be used to identify steatosis and MRI-PDFF can additionally quantify steatosis. For excluding advanced fibrosis, if FIB-4 is ≥ 1.3, VCTE, MRE, or ELF may be used. Highly elevated liver stiffness, FIB-4, and ELF scores can predict an increased risk of hepatic decompensation and mortality.

### Case definitions for inclusion and analysis of endpoints in clinical trials for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis through the lens of regulatory science [^113tL434]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging–estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI‐PDFF) quantify steatosis. Although magnetic resonance spectroscopy is highly accurate, it only measures fat in small regions of interest, while MRI‐PDFF allows mapping of the entire liver. 24, 25 Both have been validated against hepatic triglyceride content and histological assessment of steatosis 26, 27 and are sensitive to change. 25, 28 MRI‐PDFF is reproducible across scanners of varying field strength 24, 25, 28 and outperformed CAP in steatosis detection. 21, 22, 29 MRI‐PDFF is a validated modality that can be used in early‐phase studies to detect and assess change in steatosis (Table 2).

In summary, histological assessment represents the current standard for detecting hepatic steatosis. Non‐NASH is distinguished from NASH by having steatosis along with no or minimal disease activity. MRI‐PDFF is an accurate and sensitive method for steatosis assessment and quantification and useful in early‐phase studies evaluating drug efficacy on steatosis. FL, indeterminate steatohepatitis, and steatofibrosis are histological phenotypes whose natural histories are not well defined. These populations may be studied where specific questions regarding these phenotypes are posed or to confirm if responses to treatment are similar to those with NASH.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — identification of hepatic steatosis using imaging indicates that ultrasound provides a semiquantitative assessment and reports steatosis when it is "Detected". FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) uses a likely cut point of ≥ 288 dB/m. Magnetic resonance imaging–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) uses ≥ 5% for likely steatosis and < 5% for unlikely, is described as most sensitive across the spectrum of steatosis, and is accurate to assess dynamic change, while CAP has limited accuracy for quantification.
