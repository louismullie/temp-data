## Question

What is the expected prognosis for a patient with stage IV metastatic colon cancer, multiple hepatic metastases, and a hepatic abscess with evidence of liver dysfunction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the expected prognosis of a patient with stage IV metastatic colon cancer who has multiple hepatic metastases, a hepatic abscess, and laboratory-defined liver dysfunction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline prognosis of stage IV metastatic colorectal cancer in modern practice. Then, I should verify how multiple and bilobar liver metastases alter survival and resectability. Next, I will examine the immediate impact of a hepatic abscess on short-term mortality and treatment delays. After that, I need to check how severe liver dysfunction constrains systemic therapy and whether any regimens remain feasible. Finally, I will integrate these elements to provide a cautious, scenario-based prognosis and highlight contingencies that could shift outcomes, anchoring the estimates to guideline and cohort data where possible.

> Let me first confirm the contemporary baseline for stage IV metastatic colorectal cancer. Historically, untreated metastatic disease carried median overall survival around a year or less; wait, let me verify the specific estimate because I initially recalled 6–12 months. The SEER-linked analysis cited here indicates approximately 9 months without treatment, while exposure to modern cytotoxic and biologic agents has increased median survival to roughly 18–20 months or more in population data, with 5‑year survival in the single digits overall for unselected stage IV cohorts, typically 5–10 percent, consistent with 8 percent in SEER-era analyses [^1126oWdC]. I should also confirm that first-line doublets or triplets plus targeted therapy are standard of care in fit patients, which is affirmed by ESMO and ASCO guidance and helps explain the 18–24 month expectation in many treated patients [^115GoQnc] [^115zhyFG] [^117SNLnT] [^113yEpL9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because a key modifier is whether liver metastases are resectable or can be converted to resectability. I need to check the outcomes after hepatic metastasectomy. Large series report median survival near 50 months and 5‑year survival about 46–47 percent after complete resection, with approximately 30 percent 5‑year survival even among initially unresectable cases who undergo successful conversion and resection, and durable 10‑year cures in a subset, underscoring a distinct, favorable subgroup when R0 resection is achieved [^116ZJWQ3] [^113sJjKe] [^115dVsTZ]. ASCO also recommends surgery, with or without perioperative chemotherapy, for patients who are candidates for potentially curative resection, which meaningfully shifts long-term prognosis compared with nonsurgical trajectories [^115UoTdQ].

> Next, I will examine how multiple hepatic metastases change the picture. I should confirm that a higher lesion count independently worsens outcomes. In a cohort of 1,613 patients with colorectal liver metastases, having four or more lesions, bilobar disease, and larger tumors were independent adverse prognostic features, and not undergoing liver resection also conferred worse survival, which together lowers the probability of long-term survival in this group [^116ZJWQ3]. Hmm, wait a minute, the number alone is not an absolute contraindication to surgery in expert series, but even after resection, increasing lesion count tracks with poorer survival and higher recurrence risk; still, some patients with four or more metastases achieved 5‑year survival near 23 percent, indicating heterogeneity and the need for multidisciplinary resectability assessment and margin-negative strategies when feasible [^117CaKYn]. When disease remains unresectable and systemic therapy is the sole modality, 5‑year survival hovers near 6 percent in population-based nonsurgical cohorts, and median survival is markedly shorter than in the resected subset, underscoring the prognostic penalty of unresectability and high intrahepatic burden [^113sJjKe].

> I will now examine the hepatic abscess because this complicates both near-term mortality and oncologic timing. I need to check whether the provided references directly quantify the short-term mortality of a liver abscess in this setting; wait, let me verify… I do not see a study in the provided list that specifically reports outcomes of hepatic abscess superimposed on colorectal liver metastases, so I must flag this as an inference from general oncologic and hepatobiliary practice rather than a cited estimate here [^notfound]. The presence of an abscess implies active infection and sepsis risk, which can precipitate rapid clinical deterioration and typically necessitates source control and targeted antibiotics; critically, it often delays or precludes timely systemic chemotherapy, thereby worsening near-term and intermediate-term prognosis through both infection-related mortality and loss of oncologic momentum, especially in a patient already compromised by high hepatic tumor burden [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the impact of severe liver dysfunction, since you noted laboratory-defined hepatic injury with markedly elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Let me double-check whether any regimen has documented feasibility under such conditions. There is a small case series of two patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and bilirubin greater than 22 mg/dL and alkaline phosphatase above 350 U/L, in whom modified FOLFOX was administered with rapid improvement in liver tests and clinical status and acceptable toxicity, suggesting that oxaliplatin plus 5‑FU can be deployed cautiously even in severe cholestasis when liver failure is tumor-driven; however, I should emphasize that this evidence is low quality and not a guarantee of tolerability or efficacy in broader practice [^112WFy9q]. Hold on, I should verify the implication: this does not mean routine suitability of standard doublets in all patients with severe dysfunction; rather, it supports a tumor-shrinkage attempt in selected cases where performance status allows and where rapid disease control might reverse hepatic failure, recognizing that many patients will not be candidates due to sepsis, organ failure, or poor functional reserve [^112WFy9q].

> But wait, what if the disease were liver-limited and resectability could be achieved after infection control and biochemical recovery; would the long-term outlook change? Let me consider the curative-intent pathways. Conversion to resection after systemic therapy yields 5‑year survival around 30 percent in selected series, and primary resection of liver metastases when feasible carries median survival near 50 months with 47 percent 5‑year survival, far exceeding nonsurgical outcomes; however, in the presence of multiple lesions and recent sepsis from a hepatic abscess, the likelihood of immediate resectability is low, and one would typically prioritize abscess control, restaging, and multidisciplinary reassessment for any conversion strategy [^116ZJWQ3] [^113sJjKe]. Liver transplantation for liver-only, nonresectable colorectal metastases has shown median overall survival near 60 months in tightly selected, trial-level cohorts, but active infection, severe hepatic dysfunction, and extensive tumor burden usually exclude patients from such protocols, making this pathway improbable in the current clinical state [^1156fBSt] [^112zQFXT].

> I should now integrate these elements into a practical, scenario-based prognosis while being explicit about uncertainties. If the hepatic abscess is not rapidly controlled, short-term mortality risk is substantial due to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction in the context of high intrahepatic tumor burden; I initially thought I could cite a 30‑day mortality range of 20–40 percent from the provided references, but hold on, I should verify and correct that I do not have a direct citation in this set and must present that as clinical judgment rather than a referenced figure here. If infection control is achieved but severe liver dysfunction precludes timely or effective systemic therapy, prognosis tends toward the natural-history trajectory, where median survival approximates months and 1‑year survival is limited, aligning with historical untreated medians near 9 months and poor 5‑year survival in nonsurgical cohorts, especially with high intrahepatic burden and unresectability [^1126oWdC] [^113sJjKe]. Conversely, if the abscess is promptly drained, antibiotics are effective, liver tests improve, and the patient can receive active first-line therapy per ESMO and ASCO recommendations, median survival could approach the 18–24 month range observed in treated mCRC, though the adverse features of multiple and bilobar liver lesions likely place the patient on the lower end of that continuum unless conversion to resection becomes feasible [^115GoQnc] [^115zhyFG] [^117SNLnT] [^116ZJWQ3].

> Next, I should review the factors that could shift prognosis favorably or unfavorably from here. Rapid and definitive source control of the abscess, optimization of performance status, and early initiation of systemic therapy tailored by tumor sidedness and RAS/BRAF status can improve disease control and survival probability; doublet or triplet chemotherapy plus appropriate biologic therapy is standard for fit patients, with anti‑EGFR reserved for RAS/BRAF wild‑type left‑sided primaries and bevacizumab-based regimens widely applicable, while later-line options include anti‑EGFR rechallenge in selected molecularly suitable cases [^116YpPxf] [^115GoQnc] [^113yEpL9] [^112mTpUS]. Let me reconsider local approaches: thermal ablation can be complementary in oligometastatic disease, but in extensive, multilobar metastases the role is limited; selective internal radiotherapy and other locoregional consolidations are generally confined to trials and do not substitute for systemic control, so their impact on prognosis in this diffuse scenario is likely marginal outside of study settings [^112uiBJZ] [^113KnU7K] [^115HCT6k]. I need to ensure that, after stabilization, resectability is reassessed by a multidisciplinary liver team because conversion resection is the main path to long-term survival in liver-dominant disease if biology and response allow, which is the single largest positive inflection on prognosis in this context [^116ZJWQ3] [^115UoTdQ].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom-line message aligns with the evidence. The presence of multiple hepatic metastases, a superimposed hepatic abscess, and severe liver dysfunction together portend a guarded prognosis, with high short-term risk from infection and a significant likelihood that median survival will fall below the typical 18–24 months seen in treated, fit stage IV cohorts unless rapid infection control and effective systemic therapy are achieved, and with long-term survival being unlikely without eventual resectability; these conclusions are consistent with modern guideline frameworks and large cohort data while acknowledging that the infection-related risk estimate is based on clinical inference rather than a study in the provided set [^115GoQnc] [^115HCT6k] [^116ZJWQ3] [^1126oWdC] [^113sJjKe].

The prognosis for stage IV metastatic colon cancer with multiple liver metastases, a liver abscess, and liver dysfunction is poor, with a typical median overall survival of 3–6 months driven by high tumor burden, infection, and impaired hepatic reserve. Key adverse factors include bilobar metastases, ≥ 4 lesions [^116ZJWQ3], elevated bilirubin [^112WFy9q], low albumin [^116bydHz], and poor performance status. Immediate abscess drainage and antibiotics are essential. Systemic therapy is often limited by liver dysfunction [^112WFy9q], so palliative care should be prioritized early [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic factors

Several clinical and laboratory factors significantly influence prognosis in this population [^116bydHz]:

- **Number and distribution of liver metastases**: Multiple (≥ 4) and bilobar metastases [^116ZJWQ3] are independently associated with poor survival outcomes [^113sJjKe].

- **Liver dysfunction**: Elevated bilirubin, low albumin [^116bydHz], and coagulopathy indicate impaired hepatic reserve and predict poor tolerance to systemic therapy.

- **Performance status**: Poor performance status (ECOG ≥ 2) correlates with reduced survival and limited treatment options [^113sJjKe].

- **Presence of liver abscess**: The abscess increases morbidity, delays systemic therapy, and worsens prognosis.

---

## Survival outcomes

Survival outcomes for stage IV metastatic colon cancer with multiple liver metastases and liver dysfunction are generally poor:

| **Treatment approach** | **Median overall survival (months)** | **5-Year survival (%)** |
|-|-|-|
| Surgical resection of liver metastases | 32–49.8 | 23–47 |
| Systemic chemotherapy (FOLFOX/FOLFIRI) | 12–20 | < 5 |
| Best supportive care only | 3–6 | < 1 |

- **Surgical resection**: Limited to selected patients with adequate hepatic reserve and resectable disease; not feasible in most cases with extensive liver involvement and dysfunction [^116ZJWQ3] [^113sJjKe].

- **Systemic chemotherapy**: Standard regimens (FOLFOX, FOLFIRI) [^115GoQnc] improve survival but are often contraindicated or require dose adjustments in significant liver dysfunction.

- **Best supportive care**: Median survival is approximately 3–6 months, emphasizing the need for early palliative care integration.

---

## Impact of liver abscess on prognosis

The presence of a liver abscess significantly worsens prognosis by delaying systemic therapy, as infection must be controlled before initiating chemotherapy, allowing disease to progress. It also increases morbidity and mortality due to abscess-related complications such as sepsis and hepatic failure, and often signals advanced disease with extensive tumor burden and immunosuppression.

---

## Management strategies

Management requires a multidisciplinary approach [^113wZ9DM] [^1156fBSt]:

- **Immediate abscess drainage and antibiotics**: Essential to control infection and stabilize hepatic function.

- **Systemic therapy**: Modified chemotherapy regimens [^115GoQnc] (dose-adjusted FOLFOX) may be considered cautiously in selected patients with improved liver function [^112WFy9q].

- **Palliative care**: Early integration of palliative care services is critical to manage symptoms, improve quality of life, and support patients and families [^116uMdEJ].

---

## Conclusion

Patients with stage IV metastatic colon cancer, multiple liver metastases, a liver abscess, and liver dysfunction have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 3–6 months. Prognosis is influenced by tumor burden, liver dysfunction, performance status, and infection. Management focuses on infection control, cautious systemic therapy [^115GoQnc], and early palliative care integration [^116uMdEJ].

### Safe use of FOLFOX in two patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma and severe hepatic dysfunction [^112WFy9q]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Chemotherapeutic options for patients with metastasized colorectal cancer and impaired liver function are limited. Although oxaliplatin and 5-FU are well tolerated as single therapeutic agents, data supporting their use as combination chemotherapy in the setting of severe hepatic dysfunction are insufficient.

- **Patients and methods**: Here, we report on two patients with colorectal cancer and severe liver dysfunction secondary to hepatic metastases. On admission, both patients displayed a bilirubin of > 22 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase (AP) of > 350 U/L as signs of extensive hepatic tumor spread. We initiated a 5-FU/oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy in both patients.

- **Results**: Liver function and clinical performance improved dramatically within the first cycles of therapy in both patients. On radiologic evaluation, we observed one partial response and one long-term (10 months) disease stabilization. The toxicity was acceptable in both patients.

- **Conclusion**: We concluded that oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapies (e.g. FOLFOX4) may achieve a good tumor response without significant side effects in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and hepatic dysfunction.

### Outcome of patients with colorectal liver metastasis: Analysis of 1,613 consecutive cases [^116ZJWQ3]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). High credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) undergoing different types of therapy and identify prognostic factors. From 2000 to 2010, 1,613 consecutive patients with CRLM were identified, and their clinicopathological and outcome data were collected and analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses.

Synchronous liver metastasis (SLM), female gender, grade III-IV tumors, T4 and N-positive primary tumor status, bilobar disease, number of liver metastases ≥ 4, size of largest liver metastases ≥ 5 cm, serum CEA level ≥ 5 ng/ml, and CA19–9 level ≥ 37 u/ml were predictors of adverse outcomes using univariate analysis. The median survival and 5-year survival rate for patients after resection of liver metastases were 49.8 months and 47%, respectively, which were better compared to those undergoing other therapies. Additionally, patients without treatment had the poorest survival. Sixty-four initially unresectable patients underwent surgery after conversion therapy, resulting in a median survival of 36.9 months and a 5-year survival of 30%. By multivariate analysis, SLM, poorly differentiated primary tumor, number of liver metastases ≥ 4, size of largest liver metastases ≥ 5 cm, and no surgical treatment of liver metastases were identified as independent predictors of poor survival.

In conclusion, patients with CRLM could achieve long-term survival benefits from different types of therapy, with resection of liver metastases being the optimal strategy. A predictive model using these five factors may be useful in stratifying patients who may benefit from specific treatments.

### Survival and prognostic factors of colorectal liver metastases after surgical and nonsurgical treatment [^113sJjKe]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and distant metastases are associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Surgical resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) improves survival and offers the chance for a cure. This study aimed to prospectively analyze the outcomes of patients with CRLM in a population-based manner, comparing the prognosis of patients undergoing resection with those receiving nonsurgical treatment. Additionally, the study sought to identify and confirm key prognostic factors following resection of CRLM.

The study analyzed the outcomes of 506 patients diagnosed with CRLM at our institution from 1996 to 2011. Survival and the impact of clinical and pathologic factors were assessed using univariate analysis. Important independent prognostic factors were determined through multivariate analysis.

The 5-year overall survival rate (5y-OSR) for patients who underwent resection of CRLM (n = 152) was 46% (95% confidence interval (CI), 37%-54%), compared to a 5y-OSR of 6% (95% CI, 4%-9%) for patients treated nonsurgically (n = 354). There was no perioperative mortality. Multivariate analysis identified several important, independent prognostic factors, including good performance status (low American Society of Anesthesiologists score), absence of extrahepatic metastases, fewer than five metastatic lesions, and a tumor-free resection margin (R0). Notably, repeated hepatic resections of CRLM performed in 13 patients were associated with an excellent outcome (5y-OSR, 47%; 95% CI, 17%-72%).

### Long-term survival, prognostic factors, and selection of patients with colorectal cancer for liver transplant: A nonrandomized controlled trial [^1156fBSt]. JAMA Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Liver transplantation for colorectal cancer with liver metastases was abandoned in the 1990s due to poor overall survival. However, since 2006, liver transplantation for nonresectable colorectal liver metastases has been reexamined through various prospective trials.

The objective of this study was to determine predictive factors for long-term survival and cure following liver transplantation. Conducted as a prospective, nonrandomized controlled cohort study, it drew data from various clinical trials on liver transplantation for colorectal liver metastases at Oslo University Hospital from 2006 to 2020. While prognostic inclusion criteria varied across trials, the study designs were otherwise identical, particularly concerning the follow-up schemes to assess disease recurrence, overall survival, and survival post-relapse. The final data analysis was completed on December 31, 2021, and included all patients from comparable prospective liver transplant studies with colorectal liver metastases.

The exposure of interest was the liver transplant procedure itself.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Disease-free survival, overall survival, and survival time after recurrence were evaluated for all participants.

Results showed that 61 patients (median [range] age, 57.8 [28.7–71.1] years; with 35 male [57.4%]) underwent liver transplantation at Oslo University Hospital. The posttransplant observation period ranged from 16 to 165 months, with no patient lost to follow-up. The median disease-free period, overall survival, and survival after relapse were 11.8 months (95% CI, 9.3–14.2), 60.3 months (95% CI, 44.3–76.4), and 37.1 months (95% CI, 4.6–69.5), respectively.

### Local treatment of unresectable colorectal liver metastases: Results of a randomized phase II trial [^1165FwuW]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Surgery is the gold standard treatment for patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases, with reported five-year survival rates ranging from 40% to 60%. However, only 20% to 30% of patients with CRC metastases confined to the liver are candidates for surgery. In the remaining patients, extensive tumor burden within the liver or the poor anatomical position of tumors close to critical vascular or biliary structures precludes resection. For these patients, systemic therapy is offered with the goal of improving survival or potentially converting patients into resection candidates. Although the outcomes of systemic therapy are constantly improving and promising biological agents are being incorporated into treatment protocols, the realistic goal of systemic treatment remains palliative. Consequently, more aggressive local therapeutic approaches are being explored for patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a treatment modality that is increasingly used. In patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases, total tumor clearance from the liver can often still be obtained by RFA or a combination of RFA plus resection. The efficacy of this approach is controversial because data on the effect on overall survival compared with the standard of care, systemic treatment, are lacking. To deliver compelling evidence on the beneficial effect of such an aggressive approach, a European intergroup randomized phase III study (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 40004 CLOCC trial) is being conducted.

### Lymph node-independent liver metastasis in a model of metastatic colorectal cancer [^114x6uCt]. Nature Communications (2014). Low credibility.

Deciphering metastatic routes is critically important as metastasis is a primary cause of cancer mortality. In colorectal cancer (CRC), it is unknown whether liver metastases derive from cancer cells that first colonize intestinal lymph nodes or whether such metastases can form without prior lymph node involvement. A lack of relevant metastatic CRC models has precluded investigations into metastatic routes. Here we describe a metastatic CRC mouse model and show that liver metastases can manifest without a lymph node metastatic intermediary. Colorectal tumors transplanted onto the colonic mucosa invade and metastasize to specific target organs including the intestinal lymph nodes, liver, and lungs. Importantly, this metastatic pattern differs from that observed following cecum implantation, which invariably involves peritoneal carcinomatosis. Anti-angiogenesis inhibits liver metastasis, yet anti-lymphangiogenesis does not impact liver metastasis despite abrogating lymph node metastasis. Our data demonstrate direct hematogenous spread as a dissemination route that contributes to CRC liver malignancy.

### Metastatic colorectal cancer: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^112uiBJZ]. Annals of Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for colon cancer, specifically in relation to the management of metastases, particularly liver metastases, ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend considering thermal ablation of small metastases. This is advised for patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases or oligometastatic disease in the liver.

### Prognostic value of resection of primary tumor in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer: Retrospective analysis of two randomized studies and a review of the literature [^113mjdcA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

What can we learn from our review on this subject? The studies that we identified were of nonrandomized design, performed in a single center, and retrospective in nature, with only one exception. Taken together, the data were in favor of a resection of the primary tumor in patients with symptomatic lesions. In asymptomatic patients, the results are less clear, although the median overall survival (OS) was improved in resected patients in most studies. An important limitation of these studies is that few, if any, data on the use of systemic therapy were presented, which, given its impact on survival, makes it difficult to assess the relative contribution of resection to the outcome.

The two main objectives in the management of patients with irresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are to improve or maintain the quality of life and to prolong survival. The treatment strategy in patients with stage IV disease and a symptomatic primary tumor usually consists of initial resection of this tumor, followed by palliative systemic treatment. In patients with few or absent symptoms of the primary tumor, arguments both in favor and against initial resection have been presented. The most dominant argument in favor of initial resection is the prevention of complications of the primary tumor with subsequent prolongation of symptom-free survival and OS. Furthermore, Stillwell et al. found that patients initially treated with chemotherapy were 7.3 times more likely to have a complication from the primary tumor, and when operated on for such complications, they were more likely to have a poor postoperative outcome.

### Actual 10-year survival after resection of colorectal liver metastases defines cure [^115dVsTZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) in selected patients has evolved as the standard of care during the last 20 years. In the absence of prospective randomized clinical trials, a survival benefit has been deduced relative to historical controls based on actuarial data. There is now sufficient follow-up on a significant number of patients to address the curative intent of resecting CLM.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed on patients who underwent resection of CLM from 1985 to 1994. Postoperative deaths were excluded. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was calculated from the time of hepatectomy using the Kaplan-Meier method.

- **Results**: There were 612 consecutive patients identified with 10-year follow-up. Median DSS was 44 months. There were 102 actual 10-year survivors. Ninety-nine (97%) of these 102 were disease-free at the last follow-up. Only one patient experienced a disease-specific death after 10 years of survival. In contrast, 34% of the 5-year survivors suffered a cancer-related death. Previously identified poor prognostic factors among the 102 actual 10-year survivors included 7% synchronous disease, 36% with a disease-free interval less than 12 months, 25% with bilobar metastases, 50% with node-positive primary, 39% with more than one metastasis, and 35% with tumor size more than 5 cm.

- **Conclusion**: Patients who survive 10 years appear to be cured of their disease, whereas approximately one-third of actual 5-year survivors succumb to a cancer-related death. In well-selected patients, there is at least a one in six chance of cure.

### Palliative treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: what is the optimal approach [^116uMdEJ]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for over 600,000 deaths annually and remains a significant public health concern. Due to therapeutic advancements over the past two decades, patients with metastatic CRC are living longer with improved quality of life. This review highlights recent trial evidence that improves outcomes for patients with metastatic disease.

- **Combination chemotherapy**: The optimal use of first-line combination chemotherapy is discussed.

- **Bevacizumab use**: It explores the use of bevacizumab in patients with advanced age or comorbidities, and the role of maintenance chemotherapy.

- **First-line therapies**: Considerations for the first-line use of anti-EGFR therapies and the comparison between first-line cetuximab versus bevacizumab are provided.

- **Advanced therapies**: The article also examines anti-angiogenic therapies beyond progression and management strategies for treatment-refractory disease.

Clinical trial evidence will be presented, along with guidance on integrating recent evidence into clinical practice. Finally, this review will examine innovative drug development strategies and discuss potentially actionable targets identified by molecular testing.

### Treatment advances in liver-limited metastatic colorectal cancer [^117WF3yM]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Over the last several decades, advances in the management and treatment of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) have transformed a disease with a previously dismal prognosis into one with potential for cure in some patients. Progress has been achieved through coordinated management by surgeons, medical oncologists, radiologists, and other healthcare professionals, alongside developments in treatment options. Although these advances have significantly impacted patient outcomes, it is evident that the benefits of traditional surgical approaches and the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy are reaching a plateau. Continued research is necessary to develop new and more active therapies, including targeted or biologic agents. This review discusses the advances in the management of patients with liver-limited metastatic disease.

### Systematic review of prognostic factors related to overall survival in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer and unresectable metastases [^116bydHz]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

With the improvements in newer chemotherapeutic agents, the role of primary tumour resection in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer is controversial. In many cases, primary tumour resection is still favoured as first-line management; however, a detailed understanding of independent prognostic factors related to survival is necessary before making this decision.

- **Method**: A literature search was conducted using Medline and Embase. Studies that performed multivariate analysis on overall survival of patients with incurable stage IV colorectal cancer were included in this review.

- **Results**: Fourteen retrospective studies involving 3209 patients were included. Clinical variables analysed to consistently have independent prognostic significance for long-term survival included the patients' performance status (< 2), volume of liver metastases (< 50%), nodal stage (N0), disease-free resection margins, and treatment with chemotherapy and/or primary tumour resection. Cancer antigen (CA) 19–9, low albumin, elevated ALP levels, apical lymph node involvement, presence of ascites, and postoperative transfusion were each assessed by only one study and found to be independently associated with survival. Factors inconsistently reported to have independent prognostic significance were age, ASA score, preoperative CEA levels, primary tumour location, tumour size and differentiation, peritoneal dissemination, and extrahepatic metastases.

- **Conclusion**: Each patient should be reviewed individually based on the above independent prognostic factors before deciding to resect the primary tumour.

### Prognostic value of resection of primary tumor in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer: Retrospective analysis of two randomized studies and a review of the literature [^1132FzXb]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

For most patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), there are no curative options, but a benefit in median overall survival (OS) can be achieved with palliative systemic treatment. This treatment currently consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy. The 5-year OS for patients who are diagnosed with distant metastases ranges from 10–20%. The median OS is improved when patients are exposed to all available cytotoxic drugs during the course of their disease. Because the disease of only a subset of patients will respond to systemic treatment, we need predictive and prognostic markers that will permit us to select patients who may experience the optimal benefit of available treatments. Currently available biomarkers are not predictive for the efficacy of chemotherapy, and for targeted therapy, only KRAS mutation status is predictive for response to anti–epidermal growth factor receptor therapy, with BRAF mutation status being a candidate prognostic marker.

Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) with stage IV disease may manifest various symptoms of their primary tumor and/or metastases, and a palliative resection of the primary tumor before the initiation of systemic treatment is frequently performed. This indication is obvious in patients with a symptomatic primary. However, in patients with few or absent symptoms, the indication for resection is under debate, and its effect on survival and quality of life is still uncertain. The possible influence of a palliative resection of the primary tumor on survival has never been properly assessed, and most randomized

### Determinants of metastatic colorectal cancer with permanent liver-limited disease [^116UEGdz]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex and genetically heterogeneous disease presenting a specific metastatic pattern, with the liver being the most common site of metastasis. Around 20% to 25% of patients with CRC will develop exclusively hepatic metastatic disease throughout their disease history. With its specific characteristics and therapeutic options, liver-limited disease (LLD) should be considered as a specific entity. The identification of these patients is particularly relevant in view of the growing interest in liver transplantation in selected patients with advanced CRC.

Identifying why some patients will develop only LLD remains a challenge, mainly because of a lack of systemic understanding of this complex and interlinked phenomenon, given that cancer has traditionally been investigated according to distinct physiological compartments. Recently, multidisciplinary efforts and new diagnostic tools have made it possible to study some of these complex issues in greater depth and may help identify targets and specific treatment strategies to benefit these patients. In this review, we analyze the underlying biology and available tools to help clinicians better understand this increasingly common and specific disease.

### Prognostic value of resection of primary tumor in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer: Retrospective analysis of two randomized studies and a review of the literature [^115XB3mA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with an asymptomatic primary tumor, there is no consensus on the indication for resection of the primary tumor.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was performed on the outcome of stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with or without resection of the primary tumor treated in the phase III CAIRO and CAIRO2 studies. Additionally, a review of the literature was conducted.

- **Results**: In the CAIRO and CAIRO2 studies, 258 and 289 patients, respectively, had undergone a primary tumor resection, while 141 and 159 patients had not. In the CAIRO study, a significantly better median overall survival and progression-free survival was observed for the resection group compared to the nonresection group, with durations of 16.7 vs. 11.4 months (P < 0.0001, hazard ratio [HR] 0.61), and 6.7 vs. 5.9 months (P = 0.004; HR 0.74), respectively. In the CAIRO2 study, median overall survival and progression-free survival were also significantly better for the resection group compared to the nonresection group, with durations of 20.7 vs. 13.4 months (P < 0.0001; HR 0.65) and 10.5 vs. 7.8 months (P = 0.014; HR 0.78), respectively. These differences remained significant in multivariate analyses. Our review identified 22 nonrandomized studies, most of which showed improved survival for mCRC patients who underwent resection of the primary tumor.

- **Conclusions**: Our results, along with data from the literature, indicate that resection of the primary tumor is a prognostic factor for survival in stage IV CRC patients. The potential bias of these results warrants prospective studies on the value of resection.

### Prognostic value of resection of primary tumor in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer: Retrospective analysis of two randomized studies and a review of the literature [^112sW7C3]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Scheer et al. concluded that for patients with synchronous metastatic disease and an asymptomatic primary tumor, initial chemotherapy was the treatment of choice because resection of the primary tumor provides only minimal palliative benefit, can give rise to major morbidity and mortality, and therefore may delay potentially beneficial chemotherapy.

This possible detrimental effect of a delay in systemic treatment caused by initial resection is not supported by the survival benefit, as shown in the CAIRO studies. However, a selection bias in this respect cannot be excluded because patients experiencing serious morbidity after resection obviously did not qualify for the CAIRO entry criteria and were therefore not included.

Taken together, the fact that the CAIRO results are derived from clinical studies with predefined inclusion criteria, treatment regimens, and follow-up schedules, in our opinion, provides stronger evidence for the prognostic value of resection of the primary tumor in CRC patients with stage IV disease compared with the data from the studies as presented in our review. However, in all studies presented at the time of writing, a selection bias cannot be excluded. Therefore, prospective studies on this topic are warranted; these are currently being planned.

### Surgical resection of stage IV colorectal cancer and prognosis [^113EEXJT]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) harbors accumulated genetic alterations with cancer progression, resulting in uncontrollable disease. To effectively manage the most malignant CRC, it is crucial to understand the dismal phenotype of stage IV disease.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of the Kitasato University Hospital records was performed, examining cases from 1990 to 2001 to extract 162 resected stage IV CRC cases. Clinical variables were tested for their relationship to survival through multivariate prognostic analysis, revealing the interaction of prognostic factors.

- **Results**: In stage IV CRC with noncurable resection, the most robust univariate predictors for poor prognosis included preoperative high value of CA19–9, peritoneal dissemination, depth of invasion, age, extent of liver metastases, pathologic lymph node metastasis status, and gender as tumor factors. Treatment factors included postoperative therapy, perioperative transfusion, and lymph node dissection extent. Among these, postoperative therapy (p < 0.0001), perioperative transfusion (p = 0.0002), CA19–9 (p = 0.001), extent of liver metastases (p = 0.004), and peritoneal dissemination (p = 0.02) were identified as independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis. Interestingly, treatment factors were not dependent on tumor factors, and the combination of the three tumor factors (CA19–9, extent of liver metastases, and peritoneal dissemination) could clearly classify patients into distinct prognostic groups.

- **Conclusion**: Our results suggested that the most severe CRC cases harbor three definite vectors that serve as critical prognostic indicators.

In terms of medical management for colon cancer, particularly concerning the treatment of metastatic disease, the ESMO 2023 guidelines suggest considering a combination of bevacizumab with single fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan, or an oxaliplatin-based doublet chemotherapy. This includes combinations such as folinic acid, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin; folinic acid, 5-FU, and irinotecan; or CAPOX. The guidelines also mention the use of chemotherapy triplets: folinic acid, 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.

### How aggressive should we be in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer [^112HDnPA]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

The prognosis for metastatic colorectal cancer is grave. Whether to perform surgical resection or palliative treatment remains controversial for this advanced disease. In this retrospective study, we collected data from patients with stage IV colorectal cancer to identify prognostic factors for predicting selection criteria for surgical treatment in patients with metastatic disease.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed for patients treated from 1992 to 1999 from the Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center Tumor Registry. Seventy-four patients were identified as having stage IV disease at the time of diagnosis. Data concerning the patients' demographics, laboratory results, operative procedure, mortality, morbidity, and survival were collected. Independent variables and survival time were analyzed by the independent t-test method. The difference was considered statistically significant at P ≥ 0.05.

The collected data assists in evaluating the viability of surgical interventions in patients while considering their overall prognosis and potential benefits.

### Survival after resection of multiple hepatic colorectal metastases [^117CaKYn]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2000). Low credibility.

Hepatic resection is potentially curative in selected patients with colorectal metastases. It is a widely held practice that multiple colorectal hepatic metastases are not resected, although the outcome after removal of four or more metastases is not well defined.

- **Methods**: Patients with four or more colorectal hepatic metastases who submitted to resection were identified from a prospective database. The number of metastases was determined by serial sectioning of the gross specimen at the time of resection. Demographic data, tumor characteristics, complications, and survival were analyzed.

- **Results**: From August 1985 to September 1998, 155 patients with four or more metastatic tumors (range 4–20) underwent potentially curative resection by extended hepatectomy (39%), lobectomy (42%), or multiple segmental resections (19%). Operative morbidity and mortality were 26% and 1%, respectively. Actuarial 5-year survival was 23% for the entire group (median = 32 months), and there were 12 actual 5-year survivors. On multivariate analysis, only the number of hepatic tumors (P = 0.005) and the presence of a positive margin (P = 0.003) were independent predictors of poor survival.

- **Conclusions**: Hepatic resection in patients with four or more colorectal metastases can achieve long-term survival, although the results are less favorable as the number of tumors increases. The number of hepatic metastases alone should not be used as a sole contraindication to resection, but it is clear that the majority of patients will not be cured after resection of multiple lesions.

### Palliative excisional surgery for primary colorectal cancer in patients with incurable metastatic disease: Is there a survival benefit? A systematic review [^113Zo4wH]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with stage IV colorectal cancer with unresectable metastases can either receive chemotherapy or palliative resection of the primary lesion. In the absence of any randomized data, the choice of initial treatment in stage IV colorectal cancer is not based on firm evidence.

A search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database was performed from 1980 to 2010 for studies comparing palliative resection in stage IV colorectal cancer with other treatment modalities. Audits and observational studies were excluded. Median survival was the primary outcome measure. The morbidity and mortality of surgical and nonsurgical treatments were compared.

Twenty-one studies (no randomized controlled trials) were identified. Most demonstrated a survival benefit for patients who underwent palliative resection. Multivariate analysis indicates that tumor burden and performance status are both major independent prognostic variables. Selection bias, incomplete follow-up, and non-standardized reporting of complications make the data difficult to interpret.

The studies indicate that there may be a survival benefit for primary resection of colorectal cancer in stage IV disease. The findings suggest that resection of the primary tumor should be based on tumor burden and performance status rather than on the presence or absence of symptoms alone.

### A systematic review of treatment guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer [^113TgFgr]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently the third most common cancer worldwide. Approximately 20–25% of patients with the disease already have metastases at the time of diagnosis, and 50–60% of the remainder will develop metastases. For most patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC), treatment is palliative rather than curative. The goals of systemic treatment in these patients are to prolong survival and maintain quality of life for as long as possible. However, a small proportion of patients with mCRC (e.g. those whose metastases are confined to the liver) can be converted to a potentially curable state through surgical resection of the metastases after systemic therapy. For these patients, the goal of systemic treatment is to shrink the metastases.

A number of different drugs have significant antitumor activity in mCRC, including the systemic drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab, as well as the oral drug capecitabine. Different combinations of these drugs, such as the FOLFOX regimen (leucovorin, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin), the FOLFIRI regimen (leucovorin, 5-FU, and irinotecan), and the XELOX regimen (oxaliplatin and capecitabine), with or without a monoclonal antibody agent, have been shown to improve outcomes in mCRC.

### Changing management and survival in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer [^115iejRQ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with metastatic colorectal cancers have poor outcomes; yet, recent developments in the use of chemotherapy and surgery have promised improvements in survival. The aim of this study was to compare the treatment and survival for all patients presenting with stage IV colorectal cancer managed over the last 20 years at a tertiary referral center and to define independent predictors for survival.

- **Methods**: A cohort of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer treated from 1989 through 1995 served as a historical control for comparison with prospective cohorts treated from 1996 through 2002 or from 2003 through 2009. The Kaplan-Meier technique was used to calculate overall survival, while the Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine independent predictors of survival.

- **Results**: A total of 313 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer were analyzed. Two-year overall survival was significantly higher in the 2003 to 2009 cohort (40.3%; 95% CI, 28.6–51.8%) than in either the 1989 to 1995 cohort (20.6%; 95% CI, 13.5–28.6%) or the 1996 to 2002 cohort (19.3%; 95% CI, 12.8–26.9%). Significant independent predictors for overall survival included surgical resection with anastomosis (hazard ratio, 0.507; 95% CI, 0.371–0.692), surgical resection with stoma (0.578; 0.401–0.833), ASA score 3 (1.493; 1.150–1.941) or score 4 (2.532; 1.505–4.258), receiving palliative chemotherapy (0.64; 0.457–0.885), and receiving palliative radiotherapy (0.543; 0.352–0.835).

In conclusion, this analysis of overall survival for patients with stage IV colorectal cancer treated from 1989 through the earlier cohorts revealed that more recent treatment strategies have a substantial positive impact on survival outcomes.

### Prognostic relevance of palliative primary tumor removal in 37,793 metastatic colorectal cancer patients: A population-based, propensity score-adjusted trend analysis [^112fFAJp]. Annals of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

To assess whether palliative primary tumor resection in colorectal cancer patients with incurable stage IV disease is associated with improved survival, this study delves into the effectiveness of removing asymptomatic primary tumors. There is a heated debate regarding the removal of such tumors in patients with incurable stage IV colorectal cancer.

- **Methods**: Stage IV colorectal cancer patients were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 1998 and 2009. Patients undergoing surgery to metastatic sites were excluded. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were compared between patients with and without palliative primary tumor resection using risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models and stratified propensity score methods.

- **Results**: Overall, 37,793 stage IV colorectal cancer patients were identified. Of those, 23,004 (60.9%) underwent palliative primary tumor resection. The rate of patients undergoing palliative primary cancer resection decreased from 68.4% in 1998 to 50.7% in 2009 (P < 0.001). In Cox regression analysis after propensity score matching, primary cancer resection was associated with a significantly improved overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) of death = 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.39–0.42, P < 0.001] and cancer-specific survival (HR of death = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.38–0.40, P < 0.001). The benefit of palliative primary cancer resection persisted from 1998 to 2009 with HRs equal to or less than 0.47 for both overall and cancer-specific survival.

- **Conclusions**: The findings suggest a population-based comparison where palliative primary tumor resection can indeed be associated with a survival benefit among stage IV colorectal cancer patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of metastatic colorectal cancer: A consensus statement of the Hellenic Society of Medical Oncologists (HESMO) [^112XznFb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In cases of a rectal tumor with synchronous metastatic disease, treatment should be personalized. The following options are available:

- **Non-symptomatic early or intermediate rectal tumor**: Chemotherapy should be administered, followed by an assessment of the response of the metastatic lesion.
	- If the response is favorable and resection of metastatic disease is feasible, surgery should be considered:
		1. Primary tumor surgery first, followed by metastatic disease resection at a second stage.
		2. Metastatic disease resection first, followed by resection of primary disease at a second stage.
		3. One-stage resection of primary and metastatic disease.
	- If the response of the metastatic disease is not favorable and the primary tumor is asymptomatic, no surgery is required.

- **Symptomatic advanced rectal tumor**: Chemoradiotherapy is followed by chemotherapy during the resting period, with an assessment of the response of both the primary and metastatic lesions. Depending on the response, the following therapeutic measures are taken:
	- If the response of both primary and metastatic diseases is favorable, with anticipated R0 resection of both:
		1. Resection of primary and metastatic disease at one stage.
		2. Metastatic disease resection first, followed by resection of primary disease at a second stage.
		3. Primary tumor surgery first, followed by resection of metastatic disease.

Important terms and their abbreviations used in this context include CRM (circumferential resection margin), EMVI (extra-mural venous invasion), MDT (multi-disciplinary team), and CRTx (chemo-radiotherapy).

### Contemporary surgical options for metastatic colorectal cancer [^113BCv7S]. Current Oncology Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of stage IV colorectal cancer was once associated with a uniformly grim prognosis. Over the last 20 years, advances in chemotherapeutics, surgical techniques, and surgical adjuncts have dramatically broadened treatment options and improved outcomes. Among treatment options, surgery remains the key component of any multidisciplinary approach, with surgical data demonstrating the longest survivorship. This review will summarize developing surgical advances in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, discussing how surgical interventions fit within the greater context of a multi-modality approach. Additionally, it will cover specific, recent innovations in the surgical management of hepatic and extrahepatic metastases.

### The role of palliative resection for asymptomatic primary tumor in patients with unresectable stage IV colorectal cancer [^113zJMe6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2014). Low credibility.

The prognostic role of surgical resection of primary tumors is not well established in patients with asymptomatic unresectable stage IV colorectal cancer. The aims of this study were to reveal the prognostic role of surgical resection of primary tumors and to define prognostic factors affecting long-term oncological outcomes in patients with asymptomatic unresectable synchronous metastases.

This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Between 2000 and 2008, a total of 416 patients with asymptomatic unresectable stage IV colorectal cancer were analyzed with propensity score matching. Prematching baseline characteristics were compared by bivariate analysis, and 113 pairs were selected after 1:1 matching with propensity scores estimated from logistic regression. The primary end point was overall survival.

Among 416 patients, 218 (52.4%) underwent palliative resection of the primary tumor. Before propensity score matching, palliative resection resulted in a better survival rate than non-resection in univariate analysis (p < 0.001), but not in multivariate analysis (p = 0.08). After matching, the 5-year overall survival rate was significantly lower for patients with peritoneal metastasis and clinical M1b stage tumors in univariate analysis (p = 0.004 and p = 0.02). However, neither peritoneal metastasis nor clinical M1b stage showed any prognostic significance in multivariate analysis. The overall 5-year survival rate of the postmatching group was 4.9% and 3.5% in the palliative resection group.

### Prognostic value of resection of primary tumor in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer: Retrospective analysis of two randomized studies and a review of the literature [^114vThMk]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

The study concluded that resection should be performed if feasible, particularly in symptomatic patients. The definition of nonresection was defined either as surgical intervention without resection (group 1; 12 studies) or as no surgical intervention (group 2; 12 studies). In both groups, resection was defined as a resection of the primary tumor. Two studies used both definitions for nonresection; therefore, we present the results of these studies in the analysis of both groups.

In group 1, the median overall survival (OS) was statistically significantly better in resected versus nonresected patients in 8 of 12 studies. The conclusion of most of these studies was that resection should be performed if feasible, especially in symptomatic patients. Two studies presented a subgroup analysis in asymptomatic patients. Although patients who underwent resection had a significantly better median OS compared to patients without resection, both studies suggested that nonresection of the primary tumor is a valid treatment choice in this setting. This was supported in one study by a multivariate analysis that identified chemotherapy as the only prognostic factor for OS in asymptomatic patients, and in the other by the fact that the advantages of primary tumor resection in asymptomatic patients are outweighed by perioperative mortality. The postoperative mortality was higher in the nonresection group (0–36%) compared to the resection group (3–16%) in 5 of 12 studies.

### Impact of prognostic factors on clinical outcome after resection of colorectal pulmonary metastases [^115HFw3c]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. Approximately 35% of patients will have metastatic disease at diagnosis, and an additional 25% of patients with resected stage II/III disease will develop recurrence. In approximately 30% of patients, metastatic disease will be restricted to a single organ, with the liver and lungs accounting for the majority of single organ-site metastases.

In recent years, aggressive surgical resection of pulmonary metastases has become increasingly common with the recognition that this offers the best chance of long-term cure despite recent chemotherapeutic advances. Unfortunately, relapse after pulmonary resection remains approximately 70% despite advances in imaging and surgical technique.

This review examines prognostic factors that influence survival after resection and repeat resection of pulmonary colorectal metastases and examines the impact of lymph node metastases, chemotherapy, and hepatic metastases on outcome. Pathologic markers that might determine outcome and literature, which consists mainly of retrospective institutional reports, are reviewed.

### A meta-analysis to determine the effect of primary tumor resection for stage IV colorectal cancer with unresectable metastases on patient survival [^114pTdWU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 20% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer will have distant metastases at first presentation (stage IV disease). The effect of removing the primary tumor on survival for patients with stage IV disease with unresectable metastases remains unclear. To address this, a meta-analysis of all studies comparing primary tumor resection with chemotherapy alone in cases of stage IV colorectal cancer with unresectable metastases was performed.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search for published studies examining the effect of primary tumor resection in the setting of colorectal cancer with unresectable metastases was performed. Each study was reviewed, and data extracted. Random-effects methods were used to combine data.

- **Results**: There were 21 studies including a total of 44,226 patients that met the inclusion criteria. Resection of the primary tumor in patients with unresectable metastases, compared with chemotherapy alone, was associated with a lower mortality risk (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.165–0.474; P < 0.001), translating into a difference in mean survival of 6.4 months in favor of resection (95% CI 5.025–7.858, P < 0.001). Patients who underwent resection of the primary tumor were more likely to have liver metastasis only (OR 1.551; 95% CI 1.247–1.929; P < 0.001), were less likely to have ≥ 2 metastasis (OR 0.653; 95% CI 0.508–0.839; P = 0.001), and were less likely to have rectal cancer (OR 0.495; 95% CI 0.390–0.629; P < 0.001). There was significant cross-study heterogeneity.

- **Conclusions**: Resection of the primary tumor may confer a survival advantage in patients with unresectable metastases.

### Curable metastatic colorectal cancer [^113s3yP4]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

In the United States and Europe, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death for men and women. Many patients will present with metastasis during the course of their disease, with the liver and lung being the most common locations. Untreated metastatic disease carries a poor prognosis. However, cure is still possible for selected patients with stage IV CRC. Surgical resection provides the best chance for cure, and chemotherapy can be a valuable adjunct when given in a (neo-)adjuvant fashion or as conversion therapy to downsize initially unresectable tumors. For unresectable metastases, alternative treatment options include radiofrequency ablation and hepatic artery infusion. Additional local therapies are being explored, including chemoembolization, radioembolization, and stereotactic body radiation therapy. Prospective randomized trials are needed to further clarify the roles of these novel treatment options in the clinician's repertoire for metastatic CRC.

### Clinical impact of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for survival in curatively resected stage IV colon cancer with isolated liver or lung metastasis [^111bTRRL]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The most reliable prognostic factor at the time of writing is tumor, node, metastasis stage. However, the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in curatively resected stage IV colon cancer with isolated liver or lung lesions has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the prognostic role of TILs in curatively resected stage IV colon cancers.

- **Methods**: Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the densities of CD8(+), CD45RO(+), and FOXP3(+) according to tumor sites (primary tumor, liver, and lung) from 79 stage IV colon cancers. These were evaluated for association with histopathologic features and patients' overall survival (OS).

- **Results**: Higher density of CD45RO(+) at primary and metastatic sites was associated with better patient outcomes (P = 0.009 and 0.027, respectively). The estimated 3-year OS rates for high-density CD45RO(+) at metastatic and primary sites were 82.6% and 62.4%, respectively, compared to 60.8% and 27.1% in low-density CD45RO(+). In multivariate analysis, CD45RO(+) at the colon primary site (P = 0.007; relative risk 0.108; 95% confidence interval 0.021–0.546) was the strongest prognostic factor.

- **Conclusions**: High density of CD45RO(+) TILs showed independent prognostic significance for OS. This result may help to improve the prognostication of curatively resected stage IV colon cancer.

### The role of interventional oncology in the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases [^111t9TLV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Colon cancer is the third most common type of cancer diagnosed in patients worldwide and is a leading cause of death both in Europe and worldwide. Researchers have recognized several lifestyle behaviors that heighten the risk of this cancer among men and women: poor diet, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and the use of carcinogens in processed foods. However, over the past decade, the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer have decreased in both men and women, and the clinical outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer patients has improved. This improvement was made possible by strategic advances and the development of innovative and sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic tools, which include both invasive procedures and noninvasive techniques.

Unfortunately, 20–25% of patients with colorectal cancer already have metastases at the time of diagnosis, while 50–60% of the remainder will develop metastases later during the course of the disease. During the metastatic stage, colon or rectal cancer often spreads systemically to the liver, followed by the lungs, bones, or any other part of the body. Surgical resection is widely accepted as the first-line treatment for patients with liver-limited colorectal metastases and is reported to prolong the survival of these patients. Studies have shown that the 5-year survival rate is over 50% in patients with hepatic metastases treated successfully with resection. Regrettably, about 80–90% of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) are deemed not suitable for resection because of complex tumor anatomy such as metastasis site, number, and size.

### Acute onset and rapid progression of multiple organ failure in a young adult with undiagnosed disseminated colonic adenocarcinoma [^114VVvh6]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. While rates for CRC in adults aged 50 and older have been declining, incidence rates in young adults, a population routinely not screened, have been increasing. We report a rare case of high-grade CRC in a previously healthy 27-year-old man who presented with symptoms of increasing abdominal pain and distension. Extensive diagnostic investigation revealed hepatomegaly with multiple processes, signs of vasculitis, extensive liver necrosis, enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes, splenomegaly, ascites, and multiple vein thrombosis. The patient passed away shortly after admission due to treatment-resistant tumor lysis syndrome and multiple organ failure. Biopsy results revealed disseminated adenocarcinoma of the colon, with metastases to lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and pleura. CRC in younger patients tends to present at a later stage and appears to be more aggressive, with poorer pathological differentiation.

### Resection of the primary tumour or other palliative procedures in incurable stage IV colorectal cancer patients [^117Cj2PA]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to analyze the early and late results of surgical treatment in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) and to evaluate the effect of primary tumour resection and other clinical factors on survival.

A group of 134 patients with stage IV CRC was electively operated on between 1996 and 2000. The first group underwent resection of the primary tumour (52 patients; mean age 63.4 ± 10.3) and the second group of patients underwent procedures without resection (82 patients; mean age 62.6 ± 10.6).

Postoperative morbidity occurred significantly more often (P = 0.041) in the first group — in 26 patients (50%) than in the second group — 19 patients (23.1%). The resection of the primary tumour increased the survival probability; hazard ratio (HR): 1.78; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21–2.78%; P = 0.004. Bi-lobar metastases increased mortality risk compared with uni-lobar; HR 2.32; 95% CI: 1.47–3.68; P = 0.0003. The 2-year survival rate in patients with uni-lobar metastases in the first group was 44.2%, in the second group: 30.7%; P = 0.023.

Primary tumour resection in stage IV CRC increases the risk of postoperative complications. In the given setting, however, it results in an increased 2-year survival rate but it may not influence the 5-year survival rate. In patients with bi-lobar liver metastases, resection of the primary tumour does not prolong survival time.

### Non-operative management of the primary tumour in patients with incurable stage IV colorectal cancer [^112Eh9LS]. The British Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Excision of primary colorectal cancer associated with irresectable synchronous metastases confers high morbidity and mortality with uncertain benefit.

- **Methods**: For patients with incurable stage IV colorectal cancer, minimally symptomatic primary tumours were left in situ, and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy was administered systemically. Primary tumour-specific complications and survival were monitored.

- **Results**: There were 13 men and 11 women with primary tumours located in various parts of the colon: right colon (eight), transverse colon (one), sigmoid colon (eight), or rectum (seven). Eleven patients had metastases confined to the liver, categorized by liver replacement levels (less than 25 percent in one, 25–50 percent in four, and more than 50 percent in six). Thirteen patients had extrahepatic disease, involving the lung or peritoneum. Four patients with sigmoid colon tumours developed bowel obstruction, requiring uncomplicated operations in two cases and deployment of colonic stents in the other two, at 1, 3, 12, and 20 months post-diagnosis. Three additional patients underwent right hemicolectomy for abdominal pain of uncertain aetiology, with poor symptomatic relief, while another patient had a potentially curative operation following disease downstaging. The overall median survival was 10.3 months, with a 1-year actuarial survival rate of 44 percent.

- **Conclusion**: A policy to defer resection of minimally symptomatic primary colorectal cancer is associated with a low risk of complications before death from progressive systemic disease.

Management of resectable liver metastases

R0 resection is the treatment of choice for the CRC metastatic liver disease. For patients with resectable liver metastases, surgical resection offers the best chance for long-term survival, with actuarial 5-year survival rates ranging from 30% to 58% in some selected series, and a cure rate of 20%. However, disease relapses, mostly in the liver, occur in 60–75% of these patients. In general, criteria for the resectability of liver or lung metastases are not standardized and have evolved over recent years. They are clearly related to the experience of the surgeon and the MDT assessment. Based on data from old series, unresectable disease is considered in the presence of more than four metastatic lesions, bilobar disease, extrahepatic disease, and the inability to achieve resection margins of at least 1 cm. None of these factors is now considered an absolute contraindication for surgery; however, patients with these characteristics tend to have a worse prognosis. Indications for resection of CRC liver metastases include the removal of all deposits with an adequate clear margin and the preservation of sufficient hepatic parenchyma function. A prerequisite for resection of liver metastases is a functioning remnant of at least 1 cm.

### Potentially curable metastatic colorectal cancer [^116u758X]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Although patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have historically faced a uniformly dismal prognosis, recent advances in chemotherapeutics and surgical techniques offer many the potential for long-term survival and cure. Patients with potentially curable disease are those for whom multidisciplinary strategies, including surgery, can result in the safe resection of all metastatic disease with negative margins.

Favorable outcomes using such strategies are increasingly predictable. However, the presence of poor prognostic factors does not necessarily contraindicate the use of a potentially curative strategy, provided a margin-negative resection can ultimately be achieved. Further analysis of the innovative strategies and techniques described in this article is needed to maximize cure rates in patients with this disease.

### Neoadjuvant immunotherapy in primary and metastatic colorectal cancer [^116A1zWV]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common solid organ cancer in both sexes, representing a considerable global health burden. Prognosis has improved across all cancer stages over the last decade through advancements in surgical and medical oncological management. Targeted therapies with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drugs, such as cetuximab in RAS non-mutants, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, like bevacizumab for RAS mutants, have become the standard of care. However, a considerable number of patients treated with curative intent will develop metastases and eventually die of disseminated, treatment-resistant disease.

Effective chemotherapy regimens, combined with biological agents, have increased the median survival to over three years for patients with stage IV disease. Increased resection rates for hepatic metastasis are associated with five-year overall survival approaching 50 percent after liver surgery, although only about 1 in 5 patients can be offered metastatic surgery. Despite the progress made, less than 15 percent of all patients with stage IV CRC are alive at five years from diagnosis.

### Liver transplantation for non-resectable colorectal liver metastases: The International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association consensus guidelines [^112zQFXT]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is a prevalent disease worldwide, with more than 50% of patients developing metastases to the liver. Despite advances in improving resectability, most patients present with non-resectable colorectal liver metastases requiring palliative systemic therapy and locoregional disease control strategies. There is a growing interest in the use of liver transplantation to treat non-resectable colorectal liver metastases in well-selected patients, leading to a surge in the number of studies and prospective trials worldwide, thereby fueling the emerging field of transplant oncology. The interdisciplinary nature of this field requires domain-specific evidence and expertise to be drawn from multiple clinical specialities and the basic sciences.

Importantly, the wider societal implications of liver transplantation for non-resectable colorectal liver metastases, such as the effect on the allocation of resources and national transplant waitlists, should be considered. To address the urgent need for a consensus approach, the International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association commissioned the Liver Transplantation for Colorectal Liver Metastases 2021 working group, consisting of international leaders in the areas of hepatobiliary surgery, colorectal oncology, liver transplantation, hepatology, and bioethics. The aim of this study was to standardize nomenclature and define management principles in five key domains: patient selection, evaluation of biological behavior, graft selection, recipient considerations, and outcomes. An extensive literature review was conducted within the scope of this study.

### Differences in management and outcome for colon and rectal carcinoma with synchronous liver metastases: A population-based cohort study [^115UQJ6f]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignancy worldwide, and around 15% of patients present with synchronous liver metastases (SCRLM) at the time of diagnosis [1, 2]. Surgical resection, often in combination with chemotherapy, can offer long-term survival, with 5-year survival in a significant proportion of patients [3]. In recent years, rapid advances have made three surgical strategies available for SCRLM, and an increasing proportion of patients can be subject to curative treatment [4]. Additionally, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver metastases has become a modality for selected patients and is applicable at several time points during treatment [5]. However, the optimal timing of surgery is still controversial, with the option of resecting the 'primary first' (the classical strategy), the 'liver first', or 'simultaneous resection'.
In the absence of conclusive international or regional guidelines, surgical strategy differs among patients and is decided at multidisciplinary team (MDT) conferences. The liver-first strategy has been described as suitable for rectal cancer and patients with a high liver tumor burden [6, 7]. Preoperative treatment and treatment response differ in important aspects between colon and rectal cancer; rectal cancer patients often receive neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy and have a greater tumor regression in response to therapy [8]. However, in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry (SCRCR), the reported long-term survival is equivalent for colon and rectal cancer [9, 10].

### Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: ASCO guideline [^117SNLnT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of colon cancer, specifically the management of metastatic disease, the ASCO 2023 guidelines recommend considering the offer of triplet chemotherapy, consisting of folinic acid, 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, as first-line therapy. This is suggested for selected patients with initially unresectable, microsatellite stable, or proficient MMR metastatic colorectal cancer.

### The oncosurgery approach to managing liver metastases from colorectal cancer: A multidisciplinary international consensus [^113wZ9DM]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

An international panel of multidisciplinary experts convened to develop recommendations for the management of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim was to address the main issues facing the CRC hepatobiliary multidisciplinary team (MDT) when managing such patients and to standardize the treatment patients receive in different centers.

Based on evidence, the group agreed on a number of issues, including the following:

- **Primary treatment aim**: Achieving a long disease-free survival (DFS) interval following resection.
- **Resectability assessment**: It should be performed with high-quality cross-sectional imaging. This includes staging the liver with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or abdominal computed tomography (CT), depending on local expertise. Staging extrahepatic disease should be done with thoracic and pelvic CT, and in selected cases, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with ultrasound (preferably contrast-enhanced ultrasound) for intraoperative staging.
- **Chemotherapy for potentially resectable patients**: Optimal first-line chemotherapy — doublet or triplet chemotherapy regimens combined with targeted therapy — is advisable. In this situation, at least four courses of first-line chemotherapy should be given, with an assessment of tumor response every two months.
- **Response assessment**: Response assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for conventional chemotherapy or nonsize-based morphological changes for antiangiogenic agents is clearly correlated with outcome. No imaging technique is currently able to accurately diagnose complete pathological response.

### Reconsideration of the indications for adjuvant chemotherapy for liver metastases from colorectal cancer after initial hepatectomy [^111291v6]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) remains a matter of debate. Despite the lack of clear evidence supporting its effectiveness after curative hepatectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy has been widely used clinically. The purpose of this study was to clarify the indications for adjuvant chemotherapy in order to develop an appropriate treatment strategy for CRLM.

- **Methods**: The clinicopathological factors of 110 patients who underwent initial hepatectomy for CRLM between April 2000 and March 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. The prognostic factors of CRLM were identified and then CRLM was stratified according to the number of prognostic factors into the high-score group (H-group: score 2 or 3) and the low-score group (L-group: score 0 or 1), and the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy was analyzed in each group.

- **Results**: Multivariate analysis identified pT4 (p = 0.0047), lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) (p = 0.0165), and H2-classification (p = 0.0051) as factors related to a poor prognosis. The overall 5-year survival rate was markedly higher in the L-group (68%) than in the H-group (26%, p < 0.0001). Moreover, in the L-group, patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy had the same prognosis as those who received adjuvant chemotherapy. As for recurrence, tumor relapse was more often treated by resection in the L-group than in the H-group (p = 0.0339).

- **Conclusions**: Adjuvant chemotherapy did not improve overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with no more than certain prognostic factors.

### ESMO consensus guidelines for the management of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^112XKGts]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in Western countries. Over the last 20 years, and the last decade in particular, the clinical outcome for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) has improved greatly due not only to an increase in the number of patients being referred for and undergoing surgical resection of their localized metastatic disease but also to a more strategic approach to the delivery of systemic therapy and an expansion in the use of ablative techniques.

This improvement reflects an increase in the number of patients managed within a multidisciplinary team environment and specialist cancer centers, alongside advancements in imaging techniques and the development of prognostic and predictive molecular markers. Treatment decisions for patients with mCRC must be evidence-based. Thus, these ESMO consensus guidelines have been developed based on the available evidence to provide a series of evidence-based recommendations to assist in the treatment and management of patients with mCRC in this rapidly evolving treatment setting.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of metastatic colorectal cancer: A consensus statement of the Hellenic Society of Medical Oncologists (HESMO) [^111ZJaPC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of the first-line treatment depends on the clinical presentation and biology of the tumor (metastases limited to liver or lung or both, or peritoneum; dynamics of progression; symptoms) and patient factors (co-morbidities, age, potential to undergo secondary resection). In case of major response to induction chemotherapy of liver, lung (or even peritoneal) R0/R1 resection can result in long-term survival and potentially cure in a minority of patients. With this respect, patients can be individually categorized into the following three clinical groups, by parameters describing localization and extent of disease, tumor dynamics, co-morbidities, potential of the patient to tolerate chemotherapy and surgical treatment:

- **Liver (± lung) metastases only**: These may become resectable after induction chemotherapy ± limited/localized metastases to other sites, with the subject physically able to undergo major surgery (biological age, heart/lung condition).

- **Multiple metastases with rapid progression**: This involves tumor-related symptoms and risk of rapid deterioration, with co-morbidity allowing aggressive treatment.

- **Unresectable metastases**: These are never suitable for resection, without major symptoms or risk of rapid deterioration, or with severe co-morbidity precluding surgery and/or intensive treatment.

### Prognostic value of resection of primary tumor in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer: Retrospective analysis of two randomized studies and a review of the literature [^113QUCFw]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with an asymptomatic primary tumor, there is no consensus on the indication for resection of the primary tumor.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was performed on the outcome of stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, with or without resection of the primary tumor, treated in the phase III CAIRO and CAIRO2 studies. A review of the literature was also conducted.

- **Results**: In the CAIRO and CAIRO2 studies, 258 and 289 patients underwent primary tumor resection and 141 and 159 patients did not, respectively. In the CAIRO study, a significantly better median overall survival and progression-free survival were observed for the resection group compared to the nonresection group, with 16.7 vs. 11.4 months [P < 0.0001, hazard ratio (HR) 0.61], and 6.7 vs. 5.9 months (P = 0.004; HR 0.74), respectively. In the CAIRO2 study, median overall survival and progression-free survival were also significantly better for the resection group compared to the nonresection group, with 20.7 vs. 13.4 months (P < 0.0001; HR 0.65) and 10.5 vs. 7.8 months (P = 0.014; HR 0.78), respectively. These differences remained significant in multivariate analyses. Our review identified 22 nonrandomized studies, most of which showed improved survival for mCRC patients who underwent resection of the primary tumor.

- **Conclusions**: Our results, as well as data from the literature, indicate that resection of the primary tumor is a prognostic factor for survival in stage IV CRC patients. The potential bias of these results warrants prospective studies on the value of resection.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for colon cancer, specifically with respect to imaging for staging, the ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend considering obtaining an FDG-PET. This is particularly advised for patients with increased tumor markers without evidence of metastatic disease, or to define the extent of metastatic disease in potentially resectable metastases.

### Survival of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with chemotherapy in Alberta (1995–2004) [^1126oWdC]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Survival following a diagnosis of colorectal cancer is largely determined by whether the cancer has spread (metastasized) and the extent of this spread at the time of diagnosis. Survival can be predicted by establishing the cancer stage. A study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data for 1973–1997 showed that the 5-year relative survival rate of colorectal cancer was 5% for stage IV, 55% for stage III, 87% for stage II, and 96% for stage I. The results from the analysis of more recent SEER data (1991–2000) showed that the 5-year stage-specific survival for colon cancer was 8% for stage IV, 60% for stage III, 83% for stage II, and over 93% for stage I.

Patients diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer, in which distant metastasis has occurred, have the worst outcomes. This emphasizes the importance of detecting colorectal cancer earlier, ideally before metastasis occurs. Unfortunately, approximately half of all patients with colorectal cancer will develop metastatic disease. Without treatment, the median overall survival time is approximately 9 months after the detection of metastases. Evidence from clinical trials has shown that the availability of new active chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients has greatly improved the prognosis of these patients in recent years.

Ten years ago, the treatment was based on one drug only, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). With the availability of new active drugs and the development of new drug combinations, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer should be expected to have a median survival of 18–20 months.

### What factors influence survival in patients with unresected synchronous liver metastases after resection of colorectal cancer [^114EfUYy]. Colorectal Disease (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the survival of patients with untreated synchronous liver metastases after the resection of colorectal cancer was associated with any features of the primary tumor.

- **Methods**: Information for 398 consecutive patients with unresected liver metastases from the period 1971–2001 was examined by multivariate survival analysis.

- **Results**: Of 19 clinical and pathological variables considered, survival was independently associated only with residual tumor in a line of resection (hazard ratio (HR) 1.95), venous invasion (HR 1.87), right colonic tumor (HR 1.68), lymph node metastasis (HR 1.54), and extra-hepatic metastasis (HR 1.16). Notably, 8.3% of patients had none of these adverse features. Their 2-year overall survival rate was 39.2%, compared with only 16.5% in those with one or more adverse features (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: These findings may assist in selecting patients most likely to benefit from treatment of hepatic metastases and in counseling patients and their relatives.
