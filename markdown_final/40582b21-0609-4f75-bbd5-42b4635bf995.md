## Question

What is age criteria of young adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how "young adult" is defined in terms of age across medical and public health contexts, including oncology, pediatrics, neurology, cardiology, and developmental science, and what the practical implications are for care and research. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative and commonly used definitions. Then, I should verify how these vary by clinical specialty and why. Next, I will examine developmental and neurocognitive evidence that informs age cutoffs. After that, I should review international and policy variations. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic framework and note key caveats for clinical application and research reporting.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative and frequently cited definition. In oncology and global burden of disease analyses, adolescents and young adults (AYA) are typically defined as ages 15–39 years. This 15–39 range is endorsed by the US National Cancer Institute and the AYA Working Groups of ESMO and SIOPE, and it is used in high-credibility GBD publications, which also present narrower ranges like 15–29 for sensitivity analyses [^113Vf6vD] [^113Mg666].

> Wait, let me verify how pediatrics and transition medicine frame this. The American Academy of Pediatrics defines adolescence as roughly 11–21 years, and pediatric cardiovascular guidelines often extend their scope to 21 years, reflecting the need for developmentally appropriate care through the transition to adulthood; some pediatric outcome standards now explicitly include measures through 24 years to capture early adult transitions, which aligns with a broader "youth" concept rather than a hard pediatric cutoff at 18 [^113ME5Xb] [^117KRUuf] [^113gWvuH].

> I need to check neurology and stroke literature next. Stroke consortia commonly define "young adults with stroke" as 18–50 years, with some programs extending to 64 to encompass working-age adults. This operational choice reflects distinct etiologies, diagnostic needs, and socioeconomic consequences in this group compared with older adults [^112bpU2A] [^113nNPy7].

> Hold on, I should verify cardiology usage. The 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline explicitly addresses "young adults (20 to 39 years)" for ASCVD prevention, and cardiac conduction literature often uses "young adults" to mean under 50 years; these ranges reflect risk-factor accumulation and early disease expression relevant to prevention and surveillance strategies [^111kQPhb] [^112Sagge].

> Let me consider developmental science and cognitive maturation. Contemporary neurocognitive work shows executive function reaches adult-like levels by late adolescence, typically around 18–20 years, supporting the notion that "young adulthood" in cognitive terms begins after this plateau. This timing dovetails with Arnett's concept of emerging adulthood spanning roughly 18–30 years, with two phases often described as 18–24 and 25–30, which is echoed in diabetes transition literature and informs clinical expectations for autonomy and self-management [^111iNgWE] [^116MQZHo].

> I should double-check international and policy variations. WHO's adolescent health framework centers on 10–19 years, but many analyses extend "young people" to 10–24 years to capture delayed social role transitions; conversely, some countries and programs use narrower AYA ranges such as 13–24 in the UK or 18–35 in parts of Europe, underscoring that definitions are context- and system-dependent rather than universal [^111iNgWE] [^113Tn7AG].

> Next, I should review why these ranges differ by specialty. In oncology, the 15–39 AYA window captures unique tumor biology, care delivery gaps, and trial underrepresentation. In pediatrics, extending to 21–24 years supports structured transition and developmental appropriateness. In stroke, 18–50 (or 18–64) reflects working-age functional priorities and distinct etiologies. In cardiology, 20–39 or < 50 aligns with early atherosclerosis prevention and conduction disorder epidemiology. In mental health, 12–25 is the peak period of onset, guiding transdiagnostic staging and early intervention models [^113Vf6vD] [^113gWvuH] [^112bpU2A] [^111kQPhb] [^114cjUEX].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic framework while acknowledging overlap. A reasonable default for general medical and epidemiologic use is 18–39 years, aligning with oncology and many public health analyses. For oncology and GBD comparisons, 15–39 years is the accepted AYA standard. For pediatrics and transition programs, 18–24 years captures emerging adulthood. For stroke and some cardiology contexts, 18–50 or < 50 years is appropriate. And for neurocognitive and developmental framing, 18–30 years maps to emerging adulthood with two phases, while executive maturation stabilizes by about 18–20 years [^113Vf6vD] [^116MQZHo] [^112bpU2A] [^111iNgWE].

> But wait, what if a study uses a different cutoff — does that invalidate comparisons? I should confirm that heterogeneity is common and consequential. Multiple reviews emphasize that AYA definitions vary widely across studies, complicating cross-trial comparisons; therefore, authors should explicitly state the operational age range and, when possible, report results by standard bands (e.g., 15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39) to enhance comparability and interpretability [^116GK1yL].

> I need to ensure clinical implications are explicit. For oncology, using 15–39 years supports age-appropriate services, fertility preservation, psychosocial care, and targeted clinical trial access. For pediatrics and young adult chronic disease programs, extending care to 24–25 years can mitigate dropout during transition. For stroke and cardiology, recognizing "young adult" etiologies and prevention needs alters diagnostic workups and counseling. And for mental health, aligning with the 12–25 peak onset period improves early detection and staged care pathways [^113Vf6vD] [^113gWvuH] [^112bpU2A] [^114cjUEX].

> Hold on, I should verify one more nuance about the lower bound. Some pediatric oncology programs treat AYAs up to 30 years in pediatric settings, particularly for diseases like ALL, which operationalizes the principle that developmental stage and care model may matter more than a rigid age threshold; this reinforces the need to define context explicitly in protocols and publications [^111hCsfw].

> Final synthesis: there is no single universal definition of "young adult". The most authoritative and broadly applicable medical definition is 15–39 years in oncology and global burden analyses, while 18–39 years is a reasonable default for general clinical and epidemiologic contexts. Narrower bands such as 18–24, 18–30, and 18–50 are justified by developmental, disease-specific, and policy considerations. Authors should always specify the operational age range and, when feasible, analyze by 5-year bands to enable comparability and appropriate clinical inference [^113Vf6vD] [^116GK1yL].

The age range for young adults is **15–39 years** in oncology and epidemiology [^113Vf6vD] [^117KyJNA], reflecting unique cancer biology and care needs [^113Mg666]. In general medicine and public health, **18–39 years** is commonly used to align with legal adulthood and developmental transitions [^1167mzZt] [^1166qMh2]. Some fields use narrower bands (e.g. 18–25, 18–30, 20–39) to match specific clinical or research contexts [^116MQZHo] [^113X5An4] [^113xbFSi]. There is no universal standard; **definitions vary by discipline and purpose**, so authors should explicitly state the age range used [^116GK1yL].

## Commonly used age ranges for young adults

| **Field/context** | **Commonly used age range** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Oncology (AYA) | 15–39 years | - Captures unique cancer biology <br/> - Care needs <br/> - And survival disparities in this group [^113Vf6vD] [^113Mg666] |
| General medicine/public health | 18–39 years | - Aligns with legal adulthood <br/> - And developmental transitions [^111JdF3F] [^1166qMh2] |
| Psychology (emerging adulthood) | 18–25 years | Focuses on identity exploration and role transitions [^116MQZHo] |
| Cardiology | 18–39 or 20–39 years | Emphasizes early cardiovascular risk and prevention [^111kQPhb] [^113ARkYZ] |
| Neurology (stroke) | 18–50 years | Addresses unique etiologies and outcomes in younger stroke patients [^112bpU2A] [^113nNPy7] |

## Variability in definitions

- **Oncology**: 15–39 years is standard for AYA cancer, but some studies use 15–29 or 15–34 for narrower subgroups [^113Vf6vD] [^116GK1yL].
- **General medicine**: 18–39 years is typical, though some sources extend to 45 or 50 depending on context [^1167mzZt] [^114ryiLd].
- **Psychology**: Emerging adulthood (18–25) is common, with some extending to 30 [^116MQZHo] [^111TNbvL].
- **Neurology**: Stroke studies often use 18–50 to capture working-age adults with distinct risk profiles [^112bpU2A] [^113nNPy7].

---

## Clinical and research implications

- **Oncology**: AYA patients have unique psychosocial needs, diagnostic delays, and distinct cancer types, requiring specialized care [^113Mg666] [^114Wr7gB].
- **Cardiology**: Early risk factor identification and prevention are critical in young adults to reduce lifetime ASCVD risk [^111kQPhb].
- **Neurology**: Young adult stroke requires tailored evaluation for uncommon etiologies and long-term functional planning [^112bpU2A] [^113nNPy7].
- **Psychology**: Emerging adulthood research informs interventions for identity development and transition to independence [^116MQZHo] [^1135AH1E].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no universal age range** for young adults; definitions vary by field and purpose. Authors should **explicitly state the age range** used in their work to ensure clarity and comparability [^116GK1yL].

Introduction

Recently national adolescent and young adult (AYA) programs have been formed in an attempt to bridge the gap between the pediatric and adult oncology services and to address the unmet supportive care needs of the AYA cancer patient group. Definitions of the AYA have evolved over time and there are currently differing perspectives regarding the appropriate definition of the AYA age range between countries. In the UK, AYAs are considered to be patients aged between 13 and 24 years. In the USA, the spectrum of AYA includes patients aged 15–39 years of age; whilst in the Netherlands, where the present study was conducted, AYAs are typically defined as patients aged 18–35 years at cancer diagnosis. Regardless of the specific definition of AYA, a cancer diagnosis may have profound effects on the lives of AYA cancer patients, interfering with the attainment of normal developmental milestones. At a time when most AYAs are trying to make future plans for career, relationships, and children, the future can seem uncertain. Furthermore, cancer-related issues such as premature confrontation with mortality, changes in physical appearance, increased dependence on parents, disruptions of social life and school/employment because of treatment, and potential loss of reproductive capacity may become particularly distressing and could negatively impact their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Because the vast majority of AYA cancer patients will go on to be long-term survivors (relative 5-year survival of 82%), it is important to optimize the quality of their survival.

### Established adulthood: a new conception of ages 30 to 45 [^1174m1qC]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

In developed countries, the years from Age 30 to 45 are, for many, the most intense, demanding, and rewarding years of adult life. During this period of the life span most adults must negotiate the intersecting demands of progressing in a chosen career, maintaining an intimate partnership, and caring for children. Successes or difficulties in meeting these simultaneous demands have the potential to profoundly influence the direction of a person's adult life. As such, we believe that it is of critical importance to better understand this developmental period that we call established adulthood. This article provides a new theoretical conceptualization of established adulthood, outlining its distinctiveness from emerging adulthood and midlife in terms of physical health, well-being, cognitive development, and the career-and-care-crunch of competing work and family responsibilities. We also consider variations in the timing and experience of established adulthood, including variations by gender and social class, and provide suggestions for future research. As economic and social arrangements continue to evolve, so too will this developmental period, providing fertile ground for developmental theory and research.

† See Table 4.

Age-related aspects

To distinguish young people living with dementia from individuals who live with late-onset dementia, a cut-off age was defined in nearly all literature. In the majority of both the category 1 and the sample of category 2 literature, the age of 65 was regarded as the upper age limit (Table 3). Other upper age limits that were mentioned included the ages of 45, 50, 55, 60, and 70 years. The age of 45 years as an upper age limit was used as a comparison to the age of 65 to gain insight into the differences in etiologies between people aged below 45 and below 65 years living with dementia. Other authors did not mention a reason for choosing a specific upper age limit.

In addition to a cut-off age, a distinction between age at onset or age at diagnosis was made in half of the category 1 literature. In two-thirds of this literature, age at symptom onset was mentioned, whereas in four publications, the age at diagnosis was mentioned as a criterion. A similar ratio was observed in the sample of category 2 literature, with 18 publications using age at symptom onset and six publications using age at diagnosis. None of the authors mentioned an explicit rationale to support their decision. Furthermore, two additional criteria were identified in two publications, i.e. age at 'presentation at medical services', which to some extent resembles age at diagnosis, and a criterion 'died before the age of 65', which was used in a postmortem study.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^117KRUuf]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction to expert panel integrated cardiovascular (CV) guidelines for children and adolescents — scope and evidence review — states the goal as "development of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines addressing all of the major CV risk factors". Recommendations needed to address "the prevention of risk factor development — primordial prevention — and the prevention of future CVD by effective management of identified risk factors — primary prevention". The review covered an age range "from before birth to 21 years of age, including studies with follow-up into later adulthood", and, beyond randomized controlled trials, acknowledged that "much of the evidence for guidelines in youth is available from epidemiologic observational studies". Given the complexity of the body of evidence, "conclusions could be developed only by interpretation of the body of evidence", and "there was explicit Expert Panel involvement throughout the evidence review process". The Expert Panel "defined 14 critical questions for the literature search (Table 1–1) and the risk factors to be addressed (Table 1–2)".

### Classification and incidence of cancers in adolescents and young adults in england 1979–1997 [^113xWeSz]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

The morphology-based scheme presented above has been developed specifically for the 15 to 24 year age range and the diagnostic groups reflect the numerical importance of cancers observed. A number of the defined groups in the above scheme are comparable to the equivalent groups in the childhood cancer classifications and;) thereby facilitating comparisons of rates in children with those in adolescents and young adults. However, it would also be of interest to apply the scheme to cancers in children aged 10–14 years, since in this age group embryonal tumours are relatively rare.

We should like to propose the use of this classification scheme in future studies of cancers in adolescents and young adults to achieve a standard format for presentation of such data, to facilitate international comparisons, and to encourage an interest in research into these cancers.

In children aged less than 15 years, 33% of all malignancies are leukaemias, 25% are CNS tumours, 9% are lymphomas, 9% are bone and soft tissue sarcomas, and childhood embryonal tumours (neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour and hepatoblastoma), comprise 16%. Less than 2% of childhood cancers are carcinomas. It can be seen (Table 3) that the distribution of cancer types among the 15 to 19 year olds represents a transitional pattern between that seen in children and the pattern seen in the 20 to 24-year-olds which is somewhat more typical of older ages. In both age groups, lymphomas have the highest rates, but whereas leukaemia has the second highest rate in the younger group, it drops to fifth in the older group. Similarly, CNS tumours and bone tumours also drop in rank order in the older group but carcinomas, germ cell tumours and melanoma increase in numerical importance. Childhood embryonal tumours comprised only 0.3% of all cancers in the 15–24 year age range.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^112qP1ja]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Body mass index (BMI) definition — pediatric calculation and interpretation — is specified as follows: BMI is a measure used to screen for excess body adiposity and is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters. For children and teens, BMI interpretation is age- and sex-specific, and a child's BMI category (eg, healthy weight, overweight) is determined using an age- and sex-specific percentile for BMI rather than the BMI cut-points used for adult categories.

### Change in physical activity from adolescence to early adulthood: a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies [^113VHWrV]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

We believe that defining adolescence as 13–19 years old is appropriate. Although menarche may occur for some girls before age 13, socially, especially in developed countries (source of 95% of the data) 13 years old is classed as at least mid-adolescence. Our analysis design distinguishes this review as we focused on the transition out of adolescence into adulthood rather than change in physical activity during adolescence, which has been reviewed previously. As we used overlapping age groups, an included study may have two time-points that are arguably both in adolescence (such as 13 and 17 years old). The sensitivity analysis restricting to studies reporting data on < 15 years old (adolescence) and > 18 years old (adulthood) indicated a non-significant decline of −8.2 (−23.8, 7.5) min/day MVPA, but with only three studies included with this strict age criteria, we believe using broader age categories was appropriate to be as inclusive as possible.

A strength of this work is that sufficient homogenous data were present to perform a meta-analysis. However, data conversion was necessary, requiring assumptions that may have led to error in the absolute values used, although this should not have greatly influenced the within-study change estimates. Similarly, we used the data presented in each paper that was most similar to MVPA. Sometimes this was not directly comparable (eg, overall activity) but was converted to min/day. As most studies did not statistically test change in physical activity and only provided descriptive data, this conversion and meta-analysis was useful to gain a tangible overview of results.

The review aimed to characterise change in physical activity between adolescence and adulthood, therefore we did not use all time-points separately as they were condensed into broad adolescent and adulthood age periods; annual change has been examined throughout adolescenceand was beyond the scope of this review. We were keen to take study size into account so we believe it was most appropriate to use meta-analysis, rather than computing an estimate such as percentage annual change. The included studies were all published in English and mostly from North America, Europe and other high-income countries (95% of studies), so these results are not likely to be generalisable to LMICs. We only included peer-reviewed publications, which may be susceptible to publication bias; however, funnel plots did not indicate evidence of asymmetry.

### Antiretroviral therapy enrollment characteristics and outcomes among HIV-infected adolescents and young adults compared with older adults-seven African countries, 2004–2013… [^1174w5ie]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Study design was controlled for during analysis. Age at ART initiation was divided into three age categories: 15–24 years, 25–49 years, and ≥ 50 years. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics across age groups were assessed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and unadjusted linear regression models for continuous variables. Demographic and clinical characteristics of adults at ART initiation were compared across age groups by country. Age distribution was relatively constant across countries, with 5%–16% aged 15–24 years, 70%–86% aged 25–49 years, and 8%–14% aged ≥ 50 years. In two countries, the oldest age group had significantly higher rates of documented mortality than younger age groups, and older age remained a significant predictor of mortality even in multivariable analyses.

Available data suggest that this group of predominantly female adolescent and young adult ART enrollees represents a socially vulnerable population. Higher mortality in this oldest age group should probably be expected because of higher background rates of mortality in the older general population. However, HIV-related reasons for higher mortality in the oldest age group might include slower ART-induced CD4 restoration among older patients or incidence of HIV-associated noncommunicable diseases, especially atherosclerotic disease. The main finding of this report is that adolescent and young adult ART enrollees differ significantly from older adults in demographic and clinical characteristics and are at higher risk for LTFU.

Effective interventions to reduce LTFU for adolescent and young adult ART enrollees could help reduce mortality and HIV incidence in this age group. What is added by this report. Age-related differences in enrollment characteristics and outcomes were analyzed among 16, 421 patients aged ≥ 15 years starting ART in seven African countries during 2004–2012. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared across three age groups: adolescents and young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults.

### Global, regional, and national mortality among young people aged 10–24 years, 1950–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^1118X9u4]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Despite increased recognition of the importance of adolescent health to global development and future economic prosperity, these findings highlight an ongoing failure to adequately respond to health risks during the adolescent years, and of funding levels that remain insufficient. This is compounded by rapid demographic change in low-resource settings where mortality hazards for adolescents remain high. Indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic threaten to restrict progress even further. Approaches must be developed to address growing inequities in mortality in this age group, and to focus on regions of the world and causes of death where improvements have stagnated. To monitor progress reliably, improvements in the quality and availability of adolescent health data are also urgently required.

Mortality is a fundamental indicator of healthand mortality estimates provide a proxy for broader health outcomes with little or no high quality data. This is particularly pertinent for young people, where data scarcity presents a barrier to understanding health needs in many countries, and the process of determining which metrics best capture adolescent health priorities is ongoing. Earlier workillustrated that global adolescent mortality is greater than previously recognised and that improvements lagged behind those seen in younger children, despite a high proportion of adolescent deaths being from preventable causes.

### Global, regional, and national mortality among young people aged 10–24 years, 1950–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^113pUTPk]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

This poor progress in reducing mortality might reflect the omission of adolescents from most global health investments. Adolescents were largely absent from the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) agenda, and although they will have benefited from public health interventions aimed at other groups, they have not had the accelerated decreases in mortality seen in infants and younger children that is attributed to MDG programming. The SDGs include indicators that are highly relevant to young people, but do not provide a comprehensive mechanism to address the unique health needs of this age group, and a list of metrics to best capture global adolescent health priorities has not yet been defined. The 2016 Global Strategy for Women's, Children and Adolescents' Health and other initiatives have increased recognition of the crucial role of adolescents to the sustainable development agenda and global targets for Universal Health Coverage. However, investment remains inadequate, and specific challenges to improvement of adolescent health outcomes and achieving core Universal Health Coverage indicators in this age group continue to be overlooked.

### Global, regional, and national burden of gastric cancer in adolescents and young adults, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^116hNags]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study population

The subjects of this study are adolescent and young adult patients diagnosed with gastric cancer. Although there is currently no standardized definition for GCAYA internationally, previous studies have commonly defined GCAYA as occurring in patients aged 15–39 years. This age range corresponds with the age grouping in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, facilitating data analysis and comparison. In addition, patients within this age range have achieved stable biological and physiological maturity. Based on the aforementioned theory and previous research, this study specifically targets adolescent and young adult patients aged 15–39 years with gastric cancer.

Data collection

The gastric cancer diagnosis defined in this study corresponds to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes C16-C16.9, D00.2, D13.1, D37.1 (see Supplementary Documents, ICD code pp 1478). Data were obtained from the Global Health data Exchange, exporting data using the GBD Results Tool. The search parameters included "stomach cancer" for cause; "incidence, prevalence, deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for measurements; "all locations" for location; "1990–2019" for years; "number and rate" for metrics; "male, female, and both" for sex; and "age standardized, 15–39 years and corresponding 5-year bands" for age. We followed the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting guidelines for cross-sectional studies.

### Registration and classification of adolescent and young adult cancer cases [^117KyJNA]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Cancer registries are an important research resource that facilitate the study of etiology, tumor biology, patterns of delayed diagnosis and health planning needs. When outcome data are included, registries can track secular changes in survival related to improvements in early detection or treatment. The surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) registry has been used to identify major gaps in survival for older adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients compared with younger children and older adults. In order to determine the reasons for this gap, the complete registration and accurate classification of AYA malignancies is necessary. There are inconsistencies in defining the age limits for AYAs although the Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology Progress Review Group proposed a definition of ages 15 through 39 years. The central registration and classification issues for AYAs are case-finding, defining common data elements (CDE) collected across different registries and the diagnostic classification of these malignancies. Goals to achieve by 2010 include extending and validating current diagnostic classification schemes and expanding the CDE to support AYA oncology research, including the collection of tracking information to assess long-term outcomes. These efforts will advance preventive, etiologic, therapeutic, and health services-related research for this understudied age group.

### Young adult caregivers for older family members: setting a new research agenda [^111xqFXN]. Innovation in Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

Why Do Some Young Adults Become Caregivers?

Using a range of definitions, studies have identified common factors that explain why some young adults become caregivers, whereas others do not. The care recipient's needs and degree of disability help determine caregiving at all ages. Older adults experiencing dementia require more care than older adults experiencing other disabling conditions. As such, young adults may be more involved in caregiving when older family members experience cognitive impairments compared to other impairments. Studies also have shown that young adults become involved when older relatives have been hospitalized or are frail. Other demographic factors help determine which young adults engage in caregiving as well.

Gender and Marital Status

It is unclear whether caregiving in young adulthood varies by gender. In midlife and late life, more women than men provide care to aging relatives (Freedman et al. 2023). But a U.S. national study found young adult men were equally likely to provide care to an aging relative as were young adult women. Another U.S. study found men were slightly more likely to be caregivers for older relatives than were young women. By contrast, in a large sample from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, young women were more likely to provide care to older relatives than were young men. These contradictory patterns may partially reflect the definitions of caregiving and gender-based values in different countries, but also may stem from other structural factors.

Marital status also plays a role in whether a young person helps meet an older relative's needs. In their systematic review of the literature, found that single young adults were more likely to be caregivers than married young adults. In the past decade, the median age of first marriage rose to over 30 years for men and 28 years for women in the United States, such that unmarried young adults constitute a significant proportion of young adults. Moreover, the intersection of marriage and gender may be important; a slightly greater number of single young adult men may help account for apparent gender equity in early adult caregiving.

### Measuring population ageing: an analysis of the global burden of disease study 2017 [^112gx9T4]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

WHO's Global Strategy and Action Plan on Ageing and Health 2016–2020 urges countries to take action to ensure that all individuals have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life. Ongoing demographic changes, referred by some as the fourth stage of the epidemiologic transition, suggest that the size of the older population will only increase with time. Following some of the prominent literature on ageing that proposes using age-related diseases as biomarkers for ageing, we identified a set of age-related diseases from a comprehensive list of causes to construct this measure, instead of relying on a small set of physical, mental, and cognitive functions. This approach allows for measurement of both the longevity and health of populations and avoids setting arbitrary age thresholds to define older populations, assessing different factors that have led to changes in longevity and health over time and capturing the onset of age-related disease burden in populations. An improved ageing metric such as ours could inform policies around, for example, how older but healthier people might experience behavioural changes towards increasing saving rates or delayed retirement, how health systems should adapt to emphasise disease prevention and early detection instead of treatment, and how families organise themselves around care of older generations. Having an ageing metric that allows countries to track age-related burden over time could help to drive policy discussions on where to allocate resources, and comparing across countries could help us to understand why certain countries, despite similar income and development level, are better at preventing age-related diseases than others.

### An integrative literature review on the nomenclature and definition of dementia at a young age [^115fhxNb]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been growing interest in young people living with dementia. Future research requires consensus on the terminology and operational definition of this group.

Objective

The purpose of this integrative review was to explore and include all operational definitions used to define dementia at a young age.

Methods

On August 14, 2020, the PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, and PsycInfo databases were searched for empirical and theoretical literature using Google. Various terms to describe and define 'dementia' and 'at a young age' were used to collect literature concerning terminology; age-related aspects, including cut-off ages and criteria; and etiologies of dementia at a young age.

Results

The search yielded 6,891 empirical and 4,660 theoretical publications, resulting in the inclusion of 89 publications, including 36 publications containing an explicit discussion and 53 publications as confirmation. 'Young-onset dementia' was the most commonly used term of seven identified terms, in the last two decades. The age of 65 years at symptom onset was used most frequently when considering a total of six upper age limits and four criteria to define a cut-off age. Eight lower age limits and an option for subdivision based on age were included. We identified 251 different etiologies and 27 categories of etiologies.

Conclusion

Despite relative consensus on the term young-onset dementia and an age at symptom onset being used as a cut-off criterion, much is still unclear concerning possible etiologies of dementia at a young age. In the current study, controversies were detected for discussion in an international consensus study.

### AGA clinical practice update on young adult-onset colorectal cancer diagnosis and management: expert review [^115odwR5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Screening and initial management priorities for young adult–onset colorectal cancer: Young adult–onset CRC is increasing in incidence globally, particularly in developed countries. In the United States, among adults ≥ 50 years of age, early detection is the key to improving CRC-related outcomes, and the signs and symptoms that prompt consideration of a diagnostic colon exam for a person over 50 should prompt a diagnostic colonoscopy exam for the person < 50 years of age. Collecting family history and referring for genetic evaluation are important first steps for patients with young adult–onset CRC, though most do not have a known hereditary CRC syndrome. For patients without an apparent underlying genetic syndrome, more extensive surgery or more aggressive chemotherapy cannot be recommended at this point.

### Available, accessible, aware, appropriate, and acceptable: a strategy to improve participation of teenagers and young adults in cancer trials [^111SPfvf]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Under-representation of teenagers and young adults in clinical trials for cancer is acknowledged internationally and might account for the lower survival gains noted for this group. Little research has focused on strategies to increase participation of teenagers and young adults in clinical trials. We applied a conceptual framework for barriers to recruitment of under-represented populations to data for cancer clinical trials in teenagers and young adults. We did a systematic analysis of data for clinical trial enrolment in Great Britain over 6 years (2005–10), and reviewed the published work for the origins and scientific rationale of age eligibility criteria in clinical trials for cancer. Our Review revealed little scientific evidence for use of age eligibility criteria in cancer clinical trials. Participation in cancer trials fell as age increased. Between 2005 and 2010, participation rates increased for children and young people aged 0–24 years. The highest increase in participation was for teenagers aged 15–19 years, with smaller improvements in rates for 20–24 year olds. Improvements were related to five key criteria, the five As: available, accessible, aware, appropriate, and acceptable. In studies for which age eligibility criteria were appropriate for inclusion of teenagers or young adults or amended during the study period, participation rates for 15–19 year olds were similar to those for 10–14 year olds. We propose a conceptual model for a strategic approach to improve recruitment of teenagers and younger adults to clinical trials for cancer, with use of the five As, which is applicable worldwide for investigators, regulatory authorities, representatives in industry, policy makers, funders, and health-care professionals.

### Change in physical activity from adolescence to early adulthood: a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies [^112CuSS7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion was restricted to published longitudinal data with at least two data collection points within the age range; the mean age of at least one measurement was required to be in adolescence (13–19 year) and at least one in young adulthood (16–30 years). The overlapping age definitions enable inclusive definitions of both periods and avoid arbitrary cut-offs limiting our search results. Thirty years old has been suggested as the end of young adulthood, and adolescence is defined by the WHO as 10–19 years. Transitions from childhood into adolescence or throughout adolescence have been covered by previous reviews, so we begin our review at age 13 to capture transitions occurring from mid-adolescence to early adulthood. The physical activity measurements included in the papers had to be at least 1 year apart. We were interested in a wide variety of absolute measures of physical activity but excluded studies presenting only sedentary behaviour. Studies reporting no absolute physical activity over at least two time-points (including some tracking studies or those only reporting % participants meeting guidelines) were excluded. We did not approach authors for additional information as we did not want to bias this review in the event of differential author response. Contacting authors may help to ameliorate incomplete reporting of outcomes that may lead to potential bias in systematic reviews of trials; this is less of an issue in observational data. Moreover, previous reviews report limited response (42%) after multiple requests, with the data received biased towards more recent studies. All articles published in the English language in a scientific journal regardless of country of origin and containing data collected 1980 onwards were considered for inclusion. Inclusion criteria are presented in table 1.

Table 1
Inclusion criteria

Three reviewers (KC/EW/EvS) independently reviewed the same 1500 results from the initial title and abstract search (in 3 sets of 500). Iterative comparison and discussion allowed for development of a consistent screening approach; screening of all remaining titles/abstracts was divided between KC, EW and EvS. Subsequently, two reviewers (KC/RL) independently screened full texts for inclusion and discussed discrepancies to reach consensus. Hand searching of the references identified three additional full texts, none of which were included.

Where data from the same study was reported in multiple papers, the following decision hierarchy was applied: (1) the paper with most time-points; (2) additional papers with further time-points; (3) objective data (vs self-report); (4) largest number of baseline participants; (5) earliest publication date; and (6) largest number of follow-up participants.

### The global burden of adolescent and young adult cancer in 2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^113Vf6vD]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Definitions

Although the definition of the age range for adolescents and young adults varies, particularly in the upper age limit, we used the age range of 15–39 years in this study, since this is the most encompassing age range definition recommended in oncology, is endorsed by the US National Cancer Institute and the AYA Working Group of the European Society for Medical Oncology and the European Society for Paediatric Oncology, and allows for comparability with other studies on adolescent and young adult cancer. Individuals aged 15–39 years have also experienced the least progress in survival outcomes in most countries. Data for this age range are available online with theand for subsets of this age range with theor GBD Results Tool. As there are differences in the preferred age range used to define adolescents and young adults around the world, results of the narrower age range of 15–29 years are presented in the appendix (pp 115–122).

All malignant cancer types, as defined in the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases, chapter II (Neoplasms), were categorised into 32 cancer groups in this analysis, called causes in GBD and this Article. Non-melanoma skin cancers were excluded, since they are not a major cause of mortality in this age range. The cause "other malignant neoplasms" in GBD includes estimates for cancers not included in any other GBD cancer cause, such as bone cancers and soft tissue sarcomas (see appendix p 11 for more details about cancer mapping). The adolescent and young adult age group was compared to children (aged 0–14 years) and older adults (aged ≥ 40 years) in specific analyses. The focus of this analysis was on global and regional estimates, although GBD 2019 also produces estimates at the national and, for select countries, subnational level. National and subnational estimates are available in the GBD Compare and GBD Results tools online. Select results are presented by quintiles of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI; countries ranked and divided into five equal SDI groups), which is a composite measure of income per capita, total fertility rate (age < 25 years), and average educational fulfilment (for those aged ≥ 15 years), and is a useful summary measure of a country's overall social and economic development that allows for analyses of disease burden patterns across different resource contexts (appendix p 56). All cancer rates were reported per 100 000 person-years. The GBD world population standard was used for the calculation of age-standardised rates (appendix p 56).

### Diabetes care for emerging adults: recommendations for transition from pediatric to adult diabetes care systems: a position statement of the American diabetes association, with representation by the American college of osteopathic family physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Osteopathic Association, the centers for disease control and prevention, children with diabetes, the endocrine society, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, juvenile diabetes research foundation international, the national diabetes education program, and the Pediatric Endocrine Society (formerly lawson wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society) [^116MQZHo]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

EMERGING ADULTHOOD

For the purposes of this statement, we have chosen to focus on the age range of 18–30 years. The preceding period of adolescent growth and development is a stage of tremendous physical, social, and emotional change that challenges diabetes management for both youth and health care providers. During this stage of adolescent development, there is a need for ongoing family involvement in diabetes management in order to reduce the risk of deterioration in glycemic control that often accompanies adolescence.

In contrast to the views of traditional developmental psychology, contemporary thinking is that young adulthood does not immediately follow adolescence, but begins when youth are in their late 20s or early 30s and that the developmental stage between ages ∼l8 and 30 years defines a period called emerging adulthood. Recent cultural trends in America suggest that young people in their 20s delay assuming adult roles with respect to marriage, parenting, and work compared with young adults in earlier generations. Contemporary developmental theorist J.J. Arnett suggests that the postadolescent period is subdivided into an early phase corresponding to the years immediately after high school (∼18–24 years) and a later phase when more traditional adult roles are assumed (∼25–30 years). Thinking about the postadolescent period as consisting of two phases provides a valuable framework when considering diabetes management and may help to ensure that the clinician's approach and focus are appropriately matched to the emerging adult's life circumstances and readiness to become an active participant in his/her own diabetes management.

During the early phase of emerging adulthood, the person may be transitioning geographically, economically, and emotionally away from the parental home. Competing academic, economic, and social priorities often detract from a focused commitment to chronic disease management. Even as young adults face these competing demands, most do not believe that they have achieved all of the skills necessary to remain independent and accept these responsibilities on their own. Therefore, it may be unrealistic to expect the person with diabetes in the first phase of emerging adulthood to make major changes in their diabetes management strategies, or even to transition to a new adult diabetes health care provider. Conversely, for many this early phase is marked by feelings of invulnerability and a tendency to reject adult control, which may further limit receptiveness to recommendations for diabetes treatment.

### A canonical trajectory of executive function maturation from adolescence to adulthood [^116cEyYm]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Defining the adolescent period through a reproducible, canonical trajectory of executive function and significant periods of development

The development of executive function has been studied in relatively small (N's ~200,) independent investigations using a broad range of tasks or in relatively large studies (N's ~ 1000; although still smaller than the total sample used here: N = 10,766, total visits = 13,817)) with few, very narrow assessments of executive function in intelligence testing. Collectively, prior work demonstrates significant improvements from childhood through adolescence. but the precise magnitude, maturational timing, and significant periods of development in executive function during the transition from adolescence to adulthood has not been defined. With four, large independent datasets, and non-linear modeling techniques to identify specific periods of significant development, we provide reproducible and direct evidence that executive functions continue to develop into late adolescence, which has been widely suggested by theory,– but has rarely been directly tested in empirical research. Building from prominent neurodevelopmental,– and psychological, theories, these results highlight adolescence as an essential period of transition during which individuals reach maturity in goal-directed cognition. This suggests that while adolescents clearly possess complex cognitive abilities, including the ability to inhibit prepotent responses, maintain and update information in memory, and abstractly plan for future events, such abilities do not reach their full potential until 18–20 years old (late adolescence). Adolescent periods prior to this age-range (i.e. early to mid-adolescence ~10–15 years old, and mid to late adolescence ~15–18-years old) are therefore likely critical final stages of this type of cognitive development, where deviations from normative development may lead to poorer outcomes in adulthood. Identifying these sensitive, or even critical, periods of cognitive development is essential for advancing neurocognitive growth-charting to determine normative development and deviations from this normative development in health and disease, in designing developmentally informed interventions/preventions for youth –, and policy concerning adolescents.

### Cancer incidence and mortality among young adults aged 20–39 years worldwide in 2012: a population-based study [^113X5An4]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, the burden of cancer among young adults has rarely been studied in depth. Our aim was to describe the scale and profile of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide among 20–39 year-olds, highlighting major patterns by age, sex, development level, and geographical region.

Methods

We did a population-based study to quantify the burden of young adult cancers worldwide. We defined young adult cancers as those occurring between the ages of 20 and 39 years because these individuals will have passed puberty and adolescence, but not yet experienced the effects of hormonal decline, immune response deterioration, or organ dysfunction associated with chronic health conditions. Global, regional, and country-specific (n = 184) data estimates of the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths that occurred in 2012 among young adults were extracted in four 5-year bands from the International Agency for Research on Cancer's GLOBOCAN 2012 for all cancers combined and for 27 major types as defined by the International Classification of Disease, tenth revision. We report the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths overall and by sex alongside corresponding age-standardised rates (ASR) per 100000 people per year. We also present results using four levels of the Human Development Index (HDI; low [least developed], medium, high, and very high [most developed]), which is a composite indicator for socioeconomic development comprising life expectancy, education, and gross national income.

Findings

975396 new cancer cases and 358392 cancer-associated deaths occurred among young adults worldwide in 2012, which equated to an ASR of 43.3 new cancer cases per 100000 people per year and 15.9 cancer-associated deaths per 100000 people per year. The burden was disproportionally greater among women and the most common cancer types overall in terms of new cases were female breast cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, leukaemia, and colorectal cancer; in terms of deaths, female breast cancer, liver cancer, leukaemia, and cervical cancer were the main contributors. When assessed by development level and geographical region, the cancer profile varied substantially; generally, the burden of infection-associated cancers was greater in regions under transition. Cancer incidence was elevated in very high-HDI regions compared with low-HDI regions (ASR 64.5 vs 46.2 cancer cases per 100000 people per year); however, the mortality burden was 3 times higher in low-HDI regions (ASR 25.4 vs 9.2 cancer-associated deaths per 100000 people per year), reflecting differences in cancer profiles and inferior outcomes.

Interpretation

The global cancer burden among 20–39 year-olds differs from that seen in younger or older ages and varies substantially by age, sex, development level, and geographical region. Although the cancer burden is lower in this age group than that observed in older ages, the societal and economic effects remain great given the major effects of premature morbidity and mortality. Targeted surveillance, prevention, and treatment are needed to reduce the cancer burden in this underserved age group.

### 2018 AHA / ACC / AACVPR / AAPA / ABC / ACPM / ADA / AGS / APhA / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline on the management of blood cholesterol: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task Force on Clinical practice guidelines [^111kQPhb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Young adults (20 to 39 years of age) — Much of atherosclerosis begins in young adulthood, and progression of atherosclerosis thereafter becomes clinically manifest as ASCVD in middle age or later years; thus, prevention of clinical ASCVD optimally begins early in life. In children or adolescents, atherosclerosis may begin to appear in those with hypercholesterolemia, and in this age range, more aggressive cholesterol-lowering may be indicated. Development of atherosclerosis in young adults most commonly is multifactorial and occurs most rapidly in individuals with multiple risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and obesity.

### Global trends in insufficient physical activity among adolescents: a pooled analysis of 298 population-based surveys with 1. 6 million participants [^112kaqWf]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Physical activity has many health benefits for young people. In 2018, WHO launched More Active People for a Healthier World, a new global action on physical activity, including new targets of a 15% relative reduction of global prevalence of insufficient physical activity by 2030 among adolescents and adults. We describe current prevalence and trends of insufficient physical activity among school-going adolescents aged 11–17 years by country, region, and globally.

Methods

We did a pooled analysis of cross-sectional survey data that were collected through random sampling with a sample size of at least 100 individuals, were representative of a national or defined subnational population, and reported prevalence of of insufficient physical activity by sex in adolescents. Prevalence had to be reported for at least three of the years of age within the 10–19-year age range. We estimated the prevalence of insufficient physical activity in school-going adolescents aged 11–17 years (combined and by sex) for individual countries, for four World Bank income groups, nine regions, and globally for the years 2001–16. To derive a standard definition of insufficient physical activity and to adjust for urban-only survey coverage, we used regression models. We estimated time trends using multilevel mixed-effects modelling.

Findings

We used data from 298 school-based surveys from 146 countries, territories, and areas including 1.6 million students aged 11–17 years. Globally, in 2016, 81.0% (95% uncertainty interval 77.8–87.7) of students aged 11–17 years were insufficiently physically active (77.6% [76.1–80.4] of boys and 84.7% [83.0–88.2] of girls). Although prevalence of insufficient physical activity significantly decreased between 2001 and 2016 for boys (from 80.1% [78.3–81.6] in 2001), there was no significant change for girls (from 85.1% [83.1–88.0] in 2001). There was no clear pattern according to country income group: insufficient activity prevalence in 2016 was 84.9% (82.6–88.2) in low-income countries, 79.3% (77.2–87.5) in lower-middle-income countries, 83.9% (79.5–89.2) in upper-middle-income countries, and 79.4% (74.0–86.2) in high-income countries. The region with the highest prevalence of insufficient activity in 2016 was high-income Asia Pacific for both boys (89.0%, 62.8–92.2) and girls (95.6%, 73.7–97.9). The regions with the lowest prevalence were high-income western countries for boys (72.1%, 71.1–73.6), and south Asia for girls (77.5%, 72.8–89.3). In 2016, 27 countries had a prevalence of insufficient activity of 90% or more for girls, whereas this was the case for two countries for boys.

Interpretation

The majority of adolescents do not meet current physical activity guidelines. Urgent scaling up of implementation of known effective policies and programmes is needed to increase activity in adolescents. Investment and leadership at all levels to intervene on the multiple causes and inequities that might perpetuate the low participation in physical activity and sex differences, as well as engagement of youth themselves, will be vital to strengthen the opportunities for physical activity in all communities. Such action will improve the health of this and future young generations and support achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

Adolescence is the transitional bridge between childhood and adulthood; it encompasses developmental milestones that are unique to this age group. Healthy cognitive, physical, sexual, and psychosocial development is both a right and a responsibility that must be guaranteed for all adolescents to successfully enter adulthood. There is consensus among national and international organizations that the unique needs of adolescents must be addressed and promoted to ensure the health of all adolescents. This policy statement outlines the special health challenges that adolescents face on their journey and transition to adulthood and provides recommendations for those who care for adolescents, their families, and the communities in which they live.

### Getting health services right for 16–25 year-olds [^1172qjau]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2019 NHS England Long Term Plan set out the ambition to work across the 0–25 age range to support children and young people as they make the transition to early adulthood. Within this broad age bracket, how do we ensure we get health services right for 16–25 year-olds including the transfer to adult services? In this paper, we explore the evidence supporting youth-friendly and developmentally appropriate healthcare approaches and what these mean in practice for young people and healthcare professionals. Examples from primary and secondary care, as well as the perspectives of a young person, illustrate the challenges and solutions.

### Developmentally appropriate healthcare for young people: a scoping study [^11345whE]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is increasing recognition of the importance of providing quality healthcare to meet the biopsychosocial needs of young people. 'Developmentally appropriate healthcare' (DAH) for young people is one term used to explain what these services consist of. However, this term remains ill defined.

Aims

(i) To analyse the use of the term DAH in the scientific literature and (ii) to identify and explore the range of meanings attributed to the term in relation to young people.

Methods

A scoping review was conducted to map the presence of the term DAH in the literature. To analyse the use and meanings attributed to the DAH terminology, data underwent qualitative content analysis using a summative approach.

Results

62 papers were selected and subjected to content analysis. An explicit definition of DAH was provided in only 1 of the 85 uses of the term DAH within the data set and in none of the 58 uses of the prefix 'developmentally appropriate'. A link between the use of the term DAH and the domains of adolescent medicine, young people, chronic conditions and transitional care was identified; as were the core ideas underpinning the use of DAH.

Conclusions

There is a need for consistency in the use of the term DAH for young people, the related stage-of-life terminology and age range criteria. Consensus is now needed as to the content and range of a formal conceptual and operational definition.

### AGA clinical practice update on young adult-onset colorectal cancer diagnosis and management: expert review [^114ryiLd]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — young adult–onset colorectal cancer (CRC) is defined as CRC diagnosed in individuals 18 - < 50 years of age. With the rising incidence of people developing CRC before 50 years of age, diagnostic evaluation of the colon and rectum is encouraged for all patients, irrespective of age, who present with symptoms that may be consistent with CRC, including but not limited to: rectal bleeding, weight loss, change in bowel habit, abdominal pain, iron deficiency anemia. Clinicians should obtain family history of colorectal and other cancers in first and second degree relatives of patients with young adult–onset CRC and discuss genetic evaluation with germline genetic testing either in targeted genes based on phenotypic presentation or in multiplex gene panels regardless of family history. Clinicians should present the role of fertility preservation prior to cancer-directed therapy including surgery, pelvic radiation, or chemotherapy. Clinicians should counsel young patients on the benefit of germline genetic testing and familial cancer panel testing in the pre-surgical period to inform which surgical options may be available to the patient with young adult–onset CRC. Clinicians should consider utilizing germline and somatic genetic testing results to inform chemotherapeutic strategies. Clinicians should offer hereditary CRC syndrome specific screening for CRC and extra-colonic cancers only to young adult–onset CRC patients who have a genetically or clinically diagnosed hereditary CRC syndrome, and for patients with sporadic young adult-onset CRC, extra-colonic screening and CRC surveillance intervals are the same as for patients with older adult-onset CRC.

### Non-Hodgkin lymphoma across the pediatric and adolescent and young adult age spectrum [^114TYcyF]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

The non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) occurring in children and adolescents and young adults (AYA) are characterized by various age-related differences in tumor biology and survival. Children generally present with high-grade lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, whereas low-grade histologic subtypes, such as follicular lymphoma, occur more frequently with increasing age. Treatment outcome for children with NHL is generally superior to that observed in adults. Factors contributing to this discrepancy include psychosocial factors, patient factors, and differences in tumor biology and therapy. These factors will be reviewed, with particular attention to the biological features of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma and corresponding therapeutic challenges. Novel targeting agents have been developed, which have been shown to be active in some patients. There is clearly a need for treatment protocols with eligibility criteria that cover the full span of the pediatric and AYA age range and that incorporate detailed molecular characterization of the tumors.

### Current challenges and future directions for brain age prediction in children and adolescents [^112qLxot]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The difference between brain-predicted age and chronological age, termed brain age gap (BAG), indexes this deviation. A higher brain age than chronological age indicates an older-looking brain, often interpreted as accelerated maturation in childhood and adolescence, and as decline in adulthood and senescence. Inversely, a lower brain age may indicate delayed maturation in youth and potentially better brain health in adulthood and senescence.

Numerous studies have linked inter-individual variation in BAG to multiple phenotypes, including cognitive functioning, cardiometabolic health –, lifestyle factors, mental disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. stroke, Alzheimer's). However, most studies have focused on adult populations, rely on cross-sectional designs, and primarily use T1-weighted MRI data. Recent years have seen a slow but steady increase in brain-age prediction application in youth samples, but this expansion brings forth a new set of challenges that necessitate thorough discussion with its propagators and the neuroimaging field at large. The dynamic nature of age-related brain changes during youth poses significant challenges in interpreting BAG. Brain-age models may collapse complex, overlapping developmental patterns into one metric. In a unidimensional model, delayed or accelerated development in different regions can average out. Further concerns include differences in imaging modalities, scanner acquisitions, and model features, applying models outside their training ranges, limited longitudinal data, and ignoring key maturational processes (e.g. pubertal development) or socio-environmental factors (e.g. early-life adversity).

The objective of this Perspective is to discuss the advancement of brain-age prediction for child and adolescent research. We define childhood according to the pediatric staging in the AAP Bright Futures guidelinesand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developmental milestone framework, treating childhood as roughly 3–9 years (spanning early and middle-childhood stages). We define adolescence according to the World Health Organizationas 10–19 years. We use youth as an umbrella term covering both periods. Reviewing all studies is not within the scope of this paper, but we will outline key similarities, limitations, and offer recommendations for the field. We also discuss key methodological challenges when applying brain-age models to child and adolescent cohorts, while acknowledging that some of these challenges overlap with adult and lifespan issues.

### The global burden of adolescent and young adult cancer in 2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^113Mg666]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Adolescents and young adults represent a heterogenous population consisting of individuals aged 15–39 years. This formative time in life is unique, with several physical, emotional, and psychosocial changes, and with individuals potentially beginning or advancing their careers, higher education, relationships, and having children. The definitions and cutoffs of the age range for adolescents and young adults vary, but this age group is generally described as a subpopulation that is in transition between childhood and older adulthood.

Adolescents and young adults develop cancers commonly found and treated in the paediatric population as well as the more common carcinomas seen in adults. Additionally, some cancers are more prevalent in this age group than in younger or older individuals, such as Hodgkin lymphoma and gonadal germ cell tumours. As a consequence, from a health-care delivery perspective, adolescent and young adult patients with cancer might struggle to find care that is optimal for both their cancer type and their age-related treatment needs. Additionally, adolescent and young adult patients often face social and financial challenges, which might result in inequities in access to appropriate care, timely diagnosis, and treatment. Although adolescents and young adults have not seen the same improvements in cancer survival as younger and older cohorts for certain cancers, including acute myeloid leukaemia and soft tissue sarcomas, this population has not historically been a major focus of cancer control programmes and research development. Instead, based on historical precedent, adolescents and young adults are often grouped with adult patients in clinical care and clinical trials, and, as a consequence, comprehensive assessments of the cancer burden and epidemiological patterns in this age group are largely unknown or unreported in many settings.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^112FbNz5]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Expert Panel integrated cardiovascular risk guidelines — study inclusion criteria: Studies were included if they pertained to at least one specified risk factor and measured at least one predetermined outcome, related to at least one critical question, and focused on the target population (ages 0 to 21 years). For longitudinal or extended follow-up studies, participants had to be in this age range at initiation and identifiable for analyses, and for the Guidelines the target population was required to include at least part of this age range. Eligible studies were conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, or Israel.

### Young adult caregivers for older family members: setting a new research agenda [^1135AH1E]. Innovation in Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

Why Study Young Adult Caregivers Separately?

We start with a key question: Why consider young adult caregivers separately from midlife and older caregivers? We suggest that young adult caregivers have distinct experiences from midlife or older caregivers due to their position in the life course. Decades ago, Erikdiscussed stages involved in the establishment of identity and the need to form romantic ties during adolescence and into adulthood. Over the past few decades, the transition into adulthood has become increasingly prolonged for many groups, and research has shifted to consider developmental tasks that may vary by individual or cultural group, rather than defined stages.

As such, the parameters of young adulthood have become unclear, and this is particularly true in the caregiving literature. A burgeoning literature has focused on youth caregiving prior to age 18, under the age of 21, or under the age of 25. Other studies have examined caregivers across wider age ranges, such as 18 to 39 years or even older. Here, we focus primarily on young adult caregivers aged 18–29, recognizing that these boundaries are permeable, but are consistent with much of the developmental literature on emerging adulthood and transitions to adulthood.

At the turn of this century, theorists recognized "emerging adulthood" and "transitions to adulthood" as a period commencing around age 18 and enduring roughly through the 20s. This period involves the completion of education, commencement of paid jobs and/or start of a career, and formation of romantic partnerships. In general, young adulthood involves getting a foothold in new roles.

Some cultures view psychological autonomy and responsibility as key markers of adulthood. Yet, interdependence and sharing of family resources may be more normative markers of adulthood in many cultures, including minoritized ethnic and racial groups in the United States. In keeping with this view of interdependence, a meta-analysis of qualitative studies found that many young adult caregivers consider caregiving as an aspect of their identity, part of a transition to adulthood, rather than an impediment.

Due to the formative nature of this stage of life, caregivers may experience distinct stressors regarding the types of care they provide and their appraisals of burdens and rewards in providing that care. In order to understand these phenomena, we begin with a fundamental question regarding caregiving in young adulthood.

### Adolescents, young adults, and vaccine hesitancy: who and what drives the decision to vaccinate? [^111vSA7G]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Although vaccines are important for all age groups, issues of vaccine uptake and vaccine hesitancy have particular salience for the adolescent and young adult age group. This article reviews the importance of vaccination for adolescents and young adults, the variability in uptake of different vaccines, the reasons for vaccine hesitancy for this age group, and the legal framework for consent for vaccination. One important difference between vaccine hesitancy for adolescents and hesitancy for younger children or adults is the unique developmental, clinical, ethical, and legal context in which the decision to vaccinate is made.

### Standard set of health outcome measures for older persons [^116LjNrd]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

A specific cut off age was considered inappropriate due to the range in life expectancies around the world. During the working group discussions, it was agreed that the last 10 years of life captured a period in which a person might be regarded as being old across the world and potentially seeking healthcare. Therefore, rather than specifying a fixed cut-off age as the inclusion population for this standard set, the working group recommended subtracting 10 years from the estimated life expectancy at 60 years in each country or region. The inclusion population would be those who are at or above this age. For example, in South Africa, the life expectancy at age 60 is 76 years old, therefore the inclusion population would be all those over the age of 66. These can be utilised for any society in the world where a particular age is viewed as old if it does not fall within the definition above. The principles that apply to older people would be the same. This respects and accepts that each society can define what old age is to them.

### Global, regional, and national mortality among young people aged 10–24 years, 1950–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^1146EcZC]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The most recent systematic global analysis to focus on mortality in young people aged 10–24 years is now more than a decade old. Since then, there have been huge changes to patterns of health risk, population growth, and improvements in the availability and quality of mortality estimates. There has also been wider recognition of the importance of adolescent health to global development, and in harnessing the demographic dividend resulting from forecasted population change. Adolescents are now included within the UN Every Woman Every Child agenda, the Countdown to 2030 collaboration to track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the work of the Global Financing Facility. Despite this progress, there is also growing concern that global adolescent health priorities are still neglected. Global progress to improve health outcomes for young people has been slow, and major challenges remain in addressing social determinants of adolescent health and mortality, such as unmet contraception need, child marriage, and access to quality secondary education. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has ongoing consequences on the health of young people that are not fully understood. Although case fatality and morbidity due to COVID-19 is lower in young people than in older adults, this age group is particularly susceptible to indirect effects of the pandemic, with ongoing disruption to education and employment likely to further hinder progress in health.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and publicly available grey literature for the terms "ageing", functioning", "frailty", "measurement", and "metric" on May 1, 2018, without language or field restrictions. We further consulted with well recognised experts in this field for literature recommendations. We found that in both academic and policy communities, population ageing, including the measurement and promotion of concepts such as so-called healthy or successful ageing has been an ongoing interest for several decades. Some of the most common metrics of population ageing entail descriptions of increased longevity (such as rising life expectancy at older ages) and changes in the distribution of age groups (such as median age, proportion of older populations, and old-age dependency ratio). Many define old age by setting a universal age threshold, often originating from social policies or norms such as retirement ages, and consider all individuals above this age threshold as older populations. WHO and the UN Population Division commonly apply the age thresholds of age 60, 65, or 70 years. However, the age at which one is considered an older person should be based on objective measures and should take into account the health status of the individuals, including whether population ageing is accompanied by improvements or deterioration in health.

Added value of this study

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides estimation of health burden for a comprehensive and comparable list of diseases across time and geographies and offers a framework through which the limitations in current measures of population ageing can be addressed. First, using disability-adjusted life-years of age-related diseases of all adults to measure population ageing, our approach captures both the longevity and health of populations and avoids setting arbitrary age thresholds to define older populations. Second, given the consistent and systematic approaches taken by GBD in measuring health outcomes, we can compare changes in age-related disease burden across countries and over time and assess different factors that have led to changes over time. Finally, using GBD's age-specific health estimates, we are able to capture at which ages the burden of age-related diseases start to accumulate and compare results among countries with similar levels of overall age-related disease burden to explore whether some have an earlier onset of ageing burden than others.

### An integrative literature review on the nomenclature and definition of dementia at a young age [^114b4pUf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Throughout history, several different terms to refer to young people living with dementia have been used interchangeably, and a clear definition in terms of ages and etiologies is lacking. This causes ambiguity, which complicates comparing research and determining the number of young people living with dementia, representing a barrier to improving post-diagnostic support. The explication of an operational definition used in each study is recommended for future research. The current study identified three major key points that might help clarify these abovementioned issues: a commonly used term, a frequently used cut-off age and a comprehensive list of etiologies of dementia at a young age. A consensus study could help reach international agreement concerning the terminology and definition and should include space to elaborate, which in turn could aid in the clarification of this specific group of people living with dementia. A clear definition is beneficial for conducting research and for clinicians, for example to develop policies concerning the organization of age-appropriate post-diagnostic services.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^113JQPmc]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Young adults, ages 18–21 years — hypertension definitions and lifestyle therapy: Adult cutpoints for BP in this age group are used to define hypertension as per the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7), and the management of hypertension is as described in JNC 7. In this age range, institution of the adult Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is recommended for individuals with prehypertension or hypertension, with reduction of dietary sodium; overweight should be addressed by promoting weight reduction through enhanced energy expenditure coupled with reduced energy intake, and physical activity should be promoted since moderate-to-vigorous physical activity reduces BP levels in adults.

### Informed consent for paediatric clinical trials in Europe [^111JdF3F]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as everyone under 18, unless, 'under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier'. For children below that age, there are noticeable differences between national and organisational regulations on ethical consent in paediatric CTs. These concern specifically non-uniform age limits and age ranges, different definitions for legal consent and the requirement of parental or legal guardian signatures.

It appears that these criteria, for unknown reasons, are not uniformly defined in European guidelines or recommendations. We also found that the international and the ethics societies' guidelines and recommendations rarely detail consent or assent procedures for children, but often very generic instructions without specific definitions. For the greater part, these criteria do not seem to be based on the developmental stage of the child and his/her competency level for informed consent or assent. Competency, in addition to health condition, is important for determining further actions if trial subjects reach the age of majority during the study and need to give their own (legal) consent to continue.

The terms 'consent' and 'assent' are also not defined in general guidelines and are not harmonised across the EEA. Some European countries use the term consent for both minors (older children below legal adult age) and parents (legal guardians). Usually, the term assent refers to a child's or minor's agreement to the trial (not legally valid on its own), while consent is documented through legal signature(s) by the parents (guardians) or the child, when the child is above the legal age.

There are more than 1000 ECs in Europe, which result in substantial variability of EC compositions and practices, with consequently a certain degree of inconsistency in the required consent and assent documentation for multinational and multicentre trials. Moreover, much time and resources may be needed to obtain approvals. To manage these inconsistencies and to reduce the duplicative workload, sponsors are recommended to perform an iterative or sequential review at each participating institution or country.

### Intergenerational caring: a systematic literature review on young and young adult caregivers of older people [^115pbJvT]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

These two groups of terms were combined in search strings constructed using the Boolean operator "AND". Following this search strategy, a total of 3,947 articles were identified through database searching, 26 additional articles were added through bibliographic research and researchers' knowledge. From the 3,973 articles, 1,481 duplicates were identified manually and then removed. Four different eligibility criteria were applied for the selection of the articles. The first one was the age range of young and young adult caregivers. As Joseph et al. stated, there is no single definition of both young and young adult caregiver. In particular, as already mentioned in the Introduction, the analysis of the literature on young and young adult caregivers reveals that there is quite a bit of variation in the definition of the age range of these categories of individuals. For example, Aldridge et al. defined young caregivers as children, adolescents and teenagers under 18 years, while Beach defined them as young people aged 14 to 18 years. Later, Fruhauf et al. defined people aged 7 to 29 as young caregivers. The same happened for the definition of young adults. Dellmann-Jenkins et al. have defined subjects aged 18 to 40 years as young adult caregivers, whilst Becker et al. included in this category those aged 16 to 24.

Given these differences concerning the age brackets, the authors selected a wide age range, up to 40 years, in order to be as much inclusive as possible. Another eligibility criterion regarded the age of care recipients, set at 60 years onwards. Although there are commonly used definitions of old age (i.e. 65 years old), there is no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old. Given this lack of a standard numerical criterion, in this literature review we adopted the cutoff point of 60 years to refer to the older population, according to the United Nations. Moreover, the selected articles had to be focused on real life cases of caregiving, which means that, accordingly, studies merely focused on perceptions or beliefs about caregiving were excluded. Finally, this systematic literature review included articles written in English. These eligibility criteria were applied for the screening of the 2,492 studies. Thereafter, 2,192 articles were excluded through the analysis of both title and abstract and 300 full articles were assessed for eligibility. At the end of this selection process, the total number of articles included in the analysis was 10 (Fig. 1).

Results

Of 5051 retrieved titles and abstracts, 35 studies, with data on 42,934 children, adolescents, and young adults with long-lasting, post-viral infection symptoms, were eligible for inclusion. Fig. 1 shows a flow diagram of the study selection process for this review according to PRISMA guidelines. Retrieved articles with authors, country, publication year, study design, control group, inclusion criteria (from virus positivity to symptoms/from outcome link back to disease), setting, median follow-up duration, method of outcome reporting, definition of Long/post COVID or other post-viral condition, number of patients with post-viral condition, post-viral symptoms by main area, and outcomes have been organized by pathogen and age sub-group, as summarized in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. The definition of Long COVID, as reported in the included studies if provided, was not univocal (Table 1) for symptoms duration and reference source.

### Development of an international standard set of patient-centred outcome measures for overall paediatric health: a consensus process [^113gWvuH]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

In response to the latest debate on arbitrary age limits in paediatric care, which encourages including young adulthood, consensus was reached to include health outcome measures for newborns through 24 years of age (75%).

The OPH-SS: health outcomes and measures

Through the modified Delphi process, consensus was reached to include 22 outcomes in the standard set ranging across the whole spectrum of biopsychosocial health (table 1) and are measured by 15 different tools (table 2):

Five measures that are clinician-reported and often collected routinely in clinical practice: WHO Growth Charts — Early Years and School — Age Years versions, Visual Acuity Test — E-chart and Snellen-chart, Survival.
Nine measures that are patient-/parent-/proxy-reported.
One that is both parent/proxy and clinician-reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Developmental Milestone Checklist.

Table 1
Overview of the included health outcomes and instruments/tools for the specific ages with agreement from health professionals and parents

Table 2
Overview of the included outcomes, measures and case-mix variables (n = 6), age-range specific

The recommended age-group specific tool packages comprise between 5 and 6 instruments/measures, with 24–49 questions, taking between 15 and 40 min to complete.

Timepoints (in years) and frequency of measurements

At a minimum, measurements should be taken at the point of transition between developmental stages as defined by on the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Pediatric Terminology(ages 6, 12, 18, 21 and where appropriate, age 24) (figure 2). The WG recommends optional annual measurements up to 5 years of age due to rapid development and then at ages 9 and 15 years. Since child and adolescent development varies independently of age, the use of the selected measures lends flexibility to an individual's development. For example, if an adolescent is sexually active before the age of 18 years, a clinician could use the PROMIS Pool v2.0- Sexual Function and Satisfaction — Screener earlier than the age of 18 years.

### The prevalence of chronic pain in young adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xbFSi]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Previous systematic reviews have summarized the prevalence and impact of chronic pain in "average" pediatric (ie, school-age children) and adult (ie, middle-aged individuals) age groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the prevalence of chronic pain in the subgroup of individuals who fall in between established boundaries of "childhood" and "adulthood"-known as young adulthood. The goal of this research was to meta-analyze prevalence data on pain in young adults based on available data published between 2008 and 2020. Searches were identified with MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We included general population and university-based studies presenting prevalence estimates of chronic pain (pain lasting ≥ 3 months) in young adults. We identified 43 articles providing prevalence estimates across a combined population of 97,437 young adult respondents (age range: 15–34 years), with studies undertaken in 22 countries. Available data allowed for stratification of prevalence according to pain condition. The overall pooled random-effect prevalence rate of chronic pain in young adults was 11.6%, suggesting that 1 in every 9 young adults experience chronic pain worldwide. Prevalence rates varied considerably according to pain condition. Estimates did not vary according to sex, geographic location, and several study methodological characteristics (ie, population type, sampling area, sampling year, investigation period, and assessment method). Overall, young adult chronic pain is common and should be recognized as a major public health concern. Considering the difficulties young adults face accessing adult health care, greater attention is needed to develop transition programs and evidence-based treatments tailored to the unique needs of this age group.

### Communicating with adolescents and young adults about cancer-associated weight loss [^116GK1yL]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Defining Adolescents and Young Adults

The term "adolescents and young adults" has been variously described in the literature with differing age ranges. For example, previous cancer research has operationally defined AYAs as follows: 10–19 10–26; 11–21; 11–24; 13–21; 13 plus; 14–39; 15–25; 15–29; 15–30; 15–34; 15–39; 15–29; 16–29; 16–30; 18–25; 18–35; 18–39; 18–40; 18–44; 18–45.

No formal unified agreement of the age rage for AYAs exists within the literature reviewed. As a result, the aforementioned age ranges are used interchangeably and this makes comparisons across research studies all the more complex. However, what is clear is that this stage of life marks key transition years from adolescent to adulthood and for most persons are the most dynamic and confounding years of life. It is recognized that AYAs with cancer are a unique cohort due to their distinct biology, maturing hormonal and personal development, transitions in autonomy, demands in education and the workplace, and their place within the family/family responsibilities.

### Healthy aging: American Geriatrics Society white paper executive summary [^112pV1Qt]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). High credibility.

Impact of health promotion across the life span — older adults are highlighted as a priority population and multidimensional outcomes are advocated, as the document states that the burgeoning ranks of people age 65 and older is an ideal group to translate knowledge of health promotion into individual and community interventions supporting health throughout the life span, that it supports the strategies recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and advocates for approaches that go beyond prevention of a few established diseases or conditions, and that we advocate for strategies that also facilitate multidimensional health outcomes; it also cites the World Health Organization definition of "active ageing" as the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age, and notes the European Innovative Partnership's operational definition incorporating scales of function, well-being, participation in activities, quality of life, and diseases.

### Childhood vs adulthood attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder… [^116aPh3n]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures The ADHD status was first ascertained at 11 years of age using a screening instrument calibrated for a DSM-IV ADHD diagnosis based on clinical interviews with parents using the Development and Well-Being Assessment. At 18 to 19 years of age, ADHD diagnosis was derived using DSM-5 criteria, except age at onset. We estimated the overlap between these groups assessed at 11 and 18 to 19 years of age and the rates of markers of impairment in these 2 groups compared with those without ADHD. Results At 11 years of age, childhood ADHD was present in 393 individuals. At 18 to 19 years of age, 492 individuals fulfilled all DSM-5 criteria for young adult ADHD, except age at onset.

The DSM-5 scientific committee decided to change the criterion to require symptoms before 12 years of age based on evidence that this threshold would capture almost every case presented in childhood, without increasing the prevalence rate. 1, 5 Furthermore, DSM-5 introduced the concept of adulthood ADHD as a disorder that begins in childhood and requires symptoms to be present before 12 years of age. The assessment at 11 years of age included data on child mental health using the Brazilian Portuguese Version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, parent report and self-report. In the last assessment, individuals at 18 to 19 years of age were interviewed by trained psychologists using specific modules for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder modified from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview.

11 The ADHD assessment was performed with a structured interview according to DSM-5 criteria. 12 For the present study, we did not require DSM-5 criterion B for diagnosis of young adult ADHD. At 11 years of age, C-ADHD was present in 393 individuals. At 18 to 19 years of age, 492 individuals fulfilled all DSM-5 criteria for YA-ADHD, except age at onset. After comorbidities were excluded, the prevalence of YA-ADHD-WC decreased to 256 individuals.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^117VSpoi]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Detection of anaemia is crucial for clinical medicine and public health. Current WHO anaemia definitions are based on statistical thresholds (fifth centiles) set more than 50 years ago. We sought to establish evidence for the statistical haemoglobin thresholds for anaemia that can be applied globally and inform WHO and clinical guidelines.

Methods

In this analysis we identified international data sources from populations in the USA, England, Australia, China, the Netherlands, Canada, Ecuador, and Bangladesh with sufficient clinical and laboratory information collected between 1998 and 2020 to obtain a healthy reference sample. Individuals with clinical or biochemical evidence of a condition that could reduce haemoglobin concentrations were excluded. We estimated haemoglobin thresholds (ie, 5th centiles) for children aged 6–23 months, 24–59 months, 5–11 years, and 12–17 years, and adults aged 18–65 years (including during pregnancy) for individual datasets and pooled across data sources. We also collated findings from three large-scale genetic studies to summarise genetic variants affecting haemoglobin concentrations in different ancestral populations.

Findings

We identified eight data sources comprising 18 individual datasets that were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. In pooled analyses, the haemoglobin fifth centile was 104.4 g/L (90% CI 103.5–105.3) in 924 children aged 6–23 months, 110.2 g/L (109.5–110.9) in 1874 children aged 24–59 months, and 114.4 g/L (113.6–115.2) in 1839 children aged 5–11 years. Values diverged by sex in adolescents and adults. In pooled analyses, the fifth centile was 122.2 g/L (90% CI 121.3–123.1) in 1741 female adolescents aged 12–17 years and 128.2 g/L (126.4–130.0) in 1103 male adolescents aged 12–17 years. In pooled analyses of adults aged 18–65 years, the fifth centile was 119.7 g/L (90% CI 119.1–120.3) in 3640 non-pregnant females and 134.9 g/L (134.2–135.6) in 2377 males. Fifth centiles in pregnancy were 110.3 g/L (90% CI 109.5–111.0) in the first trimester (n = 772) and 105.9 g/L (104.0–107.7) in the second trimester (n = 111), with insufficient data for analysis in the third trimester. There were insufficient data for adults older than 65 years. We did not identify ancestry-specific high prevalence of non-clinically relevant genetic variants that influence haemoglobin concentrations.

Interpretation

Our results enable global harmonisation of clinical and public health haemoglobin thresholds for diagnosis of anaemia. Haemoglobin thresholds are similar between sexes until adolescence, after which males have higher thresholds than females. We did not find any evidence that thresholds should differ between people of differering ancestries.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^115BsvLP]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

AHRQ/Brown systematic review — eligibility and study selection for adolescents and young adults: The a priori age range for included studies was age 12 to 20 years inclusive, with behavioral studies excluded if they enrolled more than 20% of subjects older than the a priori upper age of 20 years; for pharmacologic interventions, the upper age inclusion was expanded to age 25 years inclusive, and reviewers also screened studies that included transition age young adults (aged 21–25 years) and adults (aged 18 years and above) for reported subgroups. The study timeframe was any publication date, and settings included primary care, school, hospital, residential, and juvenile justice, with a minimum follow-up of 1 month since intervention initiation. For benefits outcomes, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with n ≥ 2 per study group were included; for harms outcomes, prospective or retrospective nonrandomized comparative studies (n ≥ 100 per study group) and single-group studies (n > 200) were included; for alcohol use among college students, systematic reviews of RCTs were included. Overall, 118 studies in 217 articles and records were included, and comparators were waitlist, placebo, treatment as usual (TAU), and non–substance-related education or materials for key question 1, with any active intervention for key question 2.

### Renal albumin excretion in healthy young adults and its association with mortality risk in the US population [^116CD5qi]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Current classification systems do not specify a healthy normal range for urinary albumin excretion. Occult microvascular disease induced by a Western lifestyle may mean that normal values for apparently healthy adults exceed optimal levels defined by mortality risk.

Methods

Using a national population sample [the US Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) cohort; n = 11 887], the distributions of albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and fractional excretion of albumin (FEalb) were studied in healthy young adults [ages 20–40years, without cardiovascular disease (CVD) or risk factors]. The threshold for mortality risk prediction in the whole adult population sample was then studied across ACR/FEalb categories corresponding to quartiles for healthy young adults.

Results

ACR quartiles for healthy young adults were 2.7, 4.2 and 5.9mg/g in men and 3.8, 6.2 and 9.8mg/g in women. Increases in ACR below the medians for healthy young adults were not associated with increased mortality or with cardiovascular risk factors when tested in the whole adult population. Increases above this threshold were independently associated with mortality risk [hazard ratio 1.2 (95% confidence interval 1.1–1.4) and 1.8 (1.6–2.0) for Quartiles 3 and 4, respectively]. The prevalence of an optimal ACR below the mortality risk threshold was < 25% in the setting of diabetes, hypertension, age > 70years or CVD. Using FEalb to define quartiles of albuminuria gave the same findings.

Conclusion

Based on mortality risk in the whole adult population, there is an optimal range of albumin excretion (ACR < 6mg/g and 4mg/g for women and men, respectively). However, only half of even apparently healthy young US adults fall within this range.

### Young adult caregivers for older family members: setting a new research agenda [^115Ey3QD]. Innovation in Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

What Tasks Do Young Adults Perform When Caregiving?

Young adults engage in some of the same caregiving tasks as midlife and older adult caregivers.reported that nearly all young adult caregivers (98% to 100%) engaged in activities such as shopping, housework, transportation, and meal preparation, but rarely engaged in personal care. A study of nearly 3,000 college student caregivers in France found that their most frequent caregiving activities involved household chores. Household chores can range from everyday tasks to more intense tasks. But, used a large national U.S. sample of over 3,000 caregivers aged 18 to 25 and found that over half assisted an older care recipient with more intimate medical and personal care needs. When young adults provide personal care, they are more likely to define their role as true caregiving than when they only provide everyday support.

Several tasks that young adults are likely to perform are absent from common assessments of family caregiving. For example, many children in immigrant families engage in "language brokering", assisting an older relative who is not fluent in English to fill out medical forms or translate at a physician's appointment. Older adults depend on younger relatives to help with technologies, including purchases, installment of new devices, or problem-solving technology problems.

This range of tasks underscores the difficulty of defining caregiving. When young adults help with personal tasks (e.g. feeding, dressing), it is clearly caregiving. But other tasks are less clearly delineated. In a hypothetical example, a young adult helps a grandparent install an app as a normal form of support, but ongoing tracking and distributing medication regimes, filling out online medical forms, and managing an electronic calendar for appointments might be perceived as caregiving. Assessments of caregiving in young adulthood need to identify tasks that young adults consider to be beyond everyday family help.

### Global, regional, and national mortality among young people aged 10–24 years, 1950–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^116ydHBE]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed and Embase for studies to answer the research question: "What are current global patterns and previous trends in mortality in adolescents and young people". We used the following terms in titles or abstracts: ("adolescent" OR "young people" AND ("trends" OR "patterns") AND ("death" OR "mortality") AND ("world" OR "global" OR "international"). We found one study that focused on global mortality patterns in adolescents (10–24 years), published in 2009. Using data from 2004, this study reported the considerable burden of global adolescent mortality, and analysed geographic variation in outcomes, but did not explore trends over time. Two further studies reported trends in global mortality or years of life lost (YLLs) in adolescents and young people from 1990. As part of wider analyses of patterns of disease and risk factors in people aged 10–24 years, these studies found considerable variation in improvements in mortality and YLLs by country, age group, and sex. We identified other studies that examined adolescent deaths, but these either included smaller age groups (10–14 years, 10–19 years, or 15–24 years), focused on one region or group of countries, or were part of a wider study of mortality in other age groups and were not focused on adolescents. Although these studies provide useful insights into adolescent mortality, they do not provide a comprehensive global analysis of trends and burden of deaths in this age group.

Added value of this study

This is a comprehensive update of global mortality in young people aged 10–24 years, and the first analysis we are aware of to include estimates for 204 countries and territories, including all members and associate members of WHO. We found huge changes to adolescent mortality over the study period and increasing variation in outcomes. Mortality in people aged 10–24 years is increasing in many regions, particularly in males, and sex differences have widened in most regions of the world. Adolescent mortality rates were strongly associated with level of development. Demographic change and differences in mortality improvements are shifting the global burden of adolescent mortality towards sub-Saharan Africa, however, where communicable and maternal causes of death continue to predominate. We were able to identify countries with good adolescent mortality outcomes relative to their level of socioeconomic development, which can inform global health strategies for this age group.

### An integrative literature review on the nomenclature and definition of dementia at a young age [^111g8zMz]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

In one-third of all category 1 literature, the importance of distinguishing young people living with dementia from those with childhood or developmental disorders is emphasized, and a lower age limit is defined by the authors. However, in none of the publications was a reason for the use of such a lower age limit given. The way in which such a lower age limit was mentioned varied from the use of explicit ages to a more narrative description. For instance, some authors mentioned ages between 16 and 20 years or between 30 and 45 years, while other authors more implicitly used descriptive terms such as "from early adulthood", "covers the period from. ", and "typically afflicts patients between". Additionally, in the sample of category 2 literature, a lower age limit of 21 years was found in two publications, although no explanation for this age limit was given. Some publications mentioned the youngest patient in their study as a lower age limit without mentioning a specific lower age limit in the methodology section.

Finally, seven publications described a subdivision within the group of young people living with dementia. All seven described a division into two age groups: people younger and older than 45 years. Such a subdivision was primarily used for research purposes based on the etiological differences between these two groups, e.g. a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the youngest group. In one publication, the group of people aged below 45 was divided into two groups: younger and older than 35 years. According to these authors, metabolic and childhood etiologies characterized the youngest group, whereas degenerative disorders caused dementia in most cases in people aged 35 years and over. In the verification process using the random sample of category 2 literature, seven publications were found that used a subdivision at the age of 45 years.

### National, regional, and global causes of mortality in 5–19-year-olds from 2000 to 2019: a systematic analysis [^116NYRAM]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Older children and adolescents (aged 5–19 years) make up a quarter of the world population. Investments in the survival and health of this age group bring triple dividends: their health now, their future health, and the health of the next generation. However, 1.48 million deaths occurred in this age group globally in 2019, nearly all from preventable causes. Following the achievements made in reducing mortality in children younger than 5 years in the Millennium Development Goals era (2000–15), the survival of older children and adolescents has gained attention. Sustainable Development Goal 3 emphasises healthy lives and wellbeing for all ages, and has targets for reducing premature mortality from maternal, communicable, and non-communicable causes, and injuries for 2016–30. The Global Strategy for Women's, Children's, and Adolescent's Health (2016–30) has survival as a main objective and adolescent mortality as one of its 16 core indicators. These and other global initiatives, have recognised that interventions aimed at these crucial years can lead to far-reaching, multisectoral benefits in promoting lifetime survival and health, alleviating poverty, and stimulating economies.

### A canonical trajectory of executive function maturation from adolescence to adulthood [^1112iH5S]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Adolescent executive function development has been studied in relatively small (N's ~200,) independent investigations using a broad range of tasks or in relatively large studies (N's ~ 1000), using very narrow assessments of executive function. No large-scale, multi-assessment, multi-dataset reproducibility investigations of adolescent executive function development have been performed. Further, common analytic approaches do not quantitatively define maturational timing and/or plateaus toward adult-levels of performance. The magnitude of executive function changes during adolescence, the precise timing of when adolescents reach adult-levels, and the potential diversity of processes assessed by varying executive function tasks, thus remains widely debated.

Empirical research suggests that while adolescents can perform complex, goal-directed behaviors that rely on executive functions, their performance is not as accurate or as fast as adults. Age-related increases in correct response rates (accuracy) and decreases in the speed of responses (i.e. latency/reaction time) have been observed for a broad range of laboratory-based and neuropsychological executive function tasks (e.g. working memory, response inhibition, switching, planning) during adolescence (see refs. for reviews). Theoretical models built from these observations and related observations in animal studies, as well as broaderand historical perspectives of psychological development, have led to hypotheses suggesting that cognitive development continues through adolescence and may reach maturity in the second decade of life (e.g. by 20 years old,) or later (e.g. ≥ 25 years old,) in humans. A range of methodological, analytic, and data availability challenges, however, have thus far prevented direct and comprehensive testing of the maturational timing of adolescent executive function development and the specific age when executive functions reach adult-levels. Nevertheless, understanding not just whether behaviors are changing with age, but also their shape and form, is fundamental to developmental science,– and corresponding health policies and intervention/prevention strategies for adolescents. Defining the shape and form of cognitive development likewise has key implications for research on mechanisms of ongoing (potentially critical period) plasticity and factors influencing the opening and closing of the adolescent period.

### Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer-NCI… [^116UoD3M]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

Types of cancer in adolescents and young adults An estimated 85, 480 adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15 to 39 will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States in 2025. This accounts for about
4. 2% of all cancer diagnoses. The most common cancers in adolescents and young adults are: Other cancers in adolescents and young adults include brain and other central nervous system tumors, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcomas. Learn how many different types of cancer are diagnosed and treated: A to Z cancer types. Most common cancers by age group in adolescents and young adults The incidence of specific cancer types varies according to age. Some cancers are more common in adolescents, while others are more common in young adults.

In 15 to 19 year olds: thyroid cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, brain and central nervous system tumors, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma are the most common cancer types. In 20 to 29 year olds: thyroid cancer, testicular cancer, melanoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma are the most common cancer types. In 30 to 39 year olds: breast cancer, thyroid cancer, melanoma, and colon and rectum cancer are the most common cancer types. Young adults who have a cancer that typically occurs in children and adolescents, such as brain tumors, leukemia, osteosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma, may be treated by a pediatric oncologist. These doctors are often affiliated with a hospital that is a member of the Children's Oncology Group.

However, young adults who have cancers that are more common in adults, such as breast cancer or colorectal cancer, are often treated by a medical oncologist through hospitals that are affiliated with an NCI-Designated Cancer Center or a clinical research network such as the National Clinical Trials Network or NCI Community Oncology Research Program. Cancer treatment choices The type of treatment you receive is based on factors such as:

- the type of cancer
- how advanced the cancer is, including its stage or grade
- biomarker and genetic test results for some types of cancer
- your age and overall health
- personal preferences Treating cancer in adolescents and young adults. Learn about unique ways that you can cope and find support: Emotional Support for Young People with Cancer. Survivorship care planning.

### Age limit of pediatrics [^114XHLEm]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatrics is a multifaceted specialty that encompasses children's physical, psychosocial, developmental, and mental health. Pediatric care may begin periconceptionally and continues through gestation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Although adolescence and young adulthood are recognizable phases of life, an upper age limit is not easily demarcated and varies depending on the individual patient. The establishment of arbitrary age limits on pediatric care by health care providers should be discouraged. The decision to continue care with a pediatrician or pediatric medical or surgical subspecialist should be made solely by the patient (and family, when appropriate) and the physician and must take into account the physical and psychosocial needs of the patient and the abilities of the pediatric provider to meet these needs.

### A canonical trajectory of executive function maturation from adolescence to adulthood [^111iNgWE]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Here we aggregate four large-scale, independent datasets to construct a comprehensive set of executive function data spanning the entire adolescent period as well as the relative transitional periods of late childhood and early adulthood (total age range: 8–35, total N = 10,766, total visits = 13,817) that includes 23 executive function measures from 17 distinct tasks. In addition to large-scale replication, we directly address prior challenges in defining the maturational timing and domain-generality of adolescent executive function development with multiple large independent cohorts (two longitudinal, two cross-sectional), non-linear modeling approaches that directly define maturational timing, and the inclusion of a broad executive function battery that permit the investigation of both potential unitary and diversity processes. Taken together, this work identifies a canonical non-linear developmental trajectory of executive function maturation that generalizes across datasets and assessments, with rapid age-related change from late childhood to early adolescence (10–15 years old), small but significant changes in mid-adolescence (15–18 years old), before stabilizing to adult-levels in late adolescence (18–20 years old). The similarity in developmental trajectories is well accounted for by domain-general processes consistent with theories of unitary executive function and fluid cognition. The insights and data developed here can inform neuroscientific and psychological theories of the adolescent period and guide future translational research in health and disease.

### Young adult oncology: the patients and their survival challenges [^114Wr7gB]. CA (2007). Low credibility.

One in every 168 Americans develops invasive cancer between age 15 to 30 years. During this age interval, cancer is unique in the distribution of types that occur and rarely related to either environmental carcinogens, a recognizable inherited predisposition, or a family cancer syndrome. Patients in this age group have the lowest rate of health insurance coverage, frequent delays in diagnosis, and the lowest accrual to clinical trials. Their psychosocial needs are unique and generally less well attended to than in any other age group. Despite an intrinsically equal ability to tolerate chemotherapy, older adolescents and young adults frequently receive lower dose intensities than do younger patients, and at times less than in older patients. Whereas the 15- to 29-year age group once had a better overall survival rate than either younger or older patients, a relative lack of progress has resulted in the majority of cancers in the age group having a worse overall survival rate than in younger patients, and several of these having a worse prognosis than in older patients. Against this background, young adults with cancer have unique survival challenges — medically, psychosocially, and economically — that are now beginning to be appreciated and addressed with a national initiative.

### Preconception HbA1c levels in adolescents and young adults and adverse birth outcomes… [^112ftu3G]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Pediatric prediabetes, an intermediate stage of glucose intolerance before type 2 diabetes diagnosis, affects nearly 1 in 5 US adolescents aged 10 to 19 years and 1 in 4 young adults aged 20 to 24 years. 1, 2 A separate study3 examining trends among US youth found. diabetes in the next decade, with linear increases in absolute risk over time. 12–14 Rates of gestational diabetes among young people have increased in recent years, from 16. 0 to
22. 4 cases per 1000 live births among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years and 29. 9 to
40. 7 cases among those aged 20 to 24 years between 2011 and 2019. 15 These statistics suggest an escalation of the diabetes epidemic in later adulthood. The onset of puberty initiates dynamic cardiometabolic changes, including transient insulin resistance.

20, 21 Some cohorts of children and adolescents with obesity have demonstrated lower discrimination ability of HbA1c screening test, which is a nonfasting blood test that provides information about a person's average blood glucose. This age period has been both considered part of adolescence26, 27 and included in adult guidelines. The optimal threshold for HbA1c prediabetes to identify the association with cardiometabolic-related complications in pregnancy in both adolescence and young adulthood has yet to be well characterized. We adopt the definition of 10 to 24 years to correspond with adolescent growth, which extends into early adulthood26; however, results disaggregated by 10- to 19-year-old and 20- to 24-year-old age cohorts are presented in the eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1. Birth records with missing data were excluded, as missing birth record data are unlikely to satisfy the missing at random assumption for multiple imputation.

Prior evidence that adolescent childbearing is more likely in geographic areas marked by high socioeconomic disadvantage and a shortage of health professionals49 further underscores the potential of efforts to expand more generalized HbA1c screening into routine preventive services. We also identified the same HbA1c thresholds across BMI subgroups for identifying gestational diabetes risk and by age group. Previous guidelines1 have included the age period 20 to 24 years in adult recommendations, whereas our findings suggest a slightly lower threshold than that of the ADA.

### Clinical practice guidelines: pediatric amplification [^115sbVSj]. AAA (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric amplification guideline — population scope, age segmentation considerations, and evidence basis: the pediatric population is defined as birth to 18 years of age, and possible segmentation is listed as Infants (birth to two), Pre-school (2.5 to 5), School Age (5.5 to 12), and Young adult/Adult (12.5 to 18), although the current guideline does not separate the age groups and in many cases the evidence base is coming from children 5 years or older. Evidence-based independent prescriptive methods are described for pediatric fittings, and validation studies indicate high levels of speech recognition in controlled and real world environments when hearing aids are fit using both prescriptive targets and individualized fittings methods that employ verification of audibility using specific real-ear probe microphone measures and level-dependent signal processing. The document emphasizes clinical judgment, stating it is incumbent on the practicing clinician to interpret the evidence base for the individual patient, and notes that in the future it may be prudent to produce individual guidelines or to incorporate the evidence base by age range.

### Defining early vascular aging in youth: an expert consensus document from the youth vascular consortium [^113A5ToY]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The concept of early vascular aging (EVA) was introduced to identify adults at risk of developing premature cardiovascular disease. EVA, or the dissociation between chronologic and biologic age of large arteries, is an evolving concept. In this review, we propose that EVA in youth characterizes the early life biological and environmental risk factors that precede overt EVA. During early infancy, childhood and/or adolescence, structural and/or functional characteristics of the macrovascular and/or microvascular system may deviate from that expected for the chronological age of the individual. Assessing vascular aging from a young age may help detect and prevent the early onset of cardiovascular disease. This consensus document from the Youth Vascular Consortium outlines the principles of EVA in youth (birth to 24years), examines factors influencing vascular growth, and identifies current knowledge gaps. It also provides an expert consensus on defining EVA in youth. Supplementary Tables 1–3, http://links.lww.com/HJH/C733, http://links.lww.com/HJH/C734, http://links.lww.com/HJH/C735 supply key references for risk factors associated with EVA at different points in development; 1. Neonates to childhood; 2. Adolescence; 3. Young adults. Supplementary Table 4, http://links.lww.com/HJH/C736 displays reference ranges of EVA in adults.

### Definition matters: assessment of tolerance to the effects of alcohol in a prospective cohort study of emerging adults [^116Yubmw]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Future research could replicate these findings with larger sample sizes, in different populations (e.g. clinical treatment samples), with wider age ranges and with longer‐term follow‐ups. Such research could provide more empirical guidelines for assessing tolerance in the context of AUD for adolescents and young adults. For prevention and intervention of AUD, sharpened clinical assessment and rating of tolerance could identify individuals at risk for new onset of AUD and persistence of AUD who might benefit from targeted intervention. Moreover, other AUD criteria may also suffer from issues of definition and/or interpretation with young adults (e.g. larger/longer) and deserve similar attention. Another important line of inquiry is to investigate differences between natural developmental tolerance and pathological tolerance in adolescents and young adults. For instance, do these different manifestations of tolerance have different risk factors and correlates? Answers to such questions could further inform which assessments of tolerance are important indicators of risk for AUD in young adults.

### Transdiagnostic clinical staging in youth mental health: a first international consensus statement [^114cjUEX]. World Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Recognizing that current frameworks for classification and treatment in psychiatry are inadequate, particularly for use in young people and early intervention services, transdiagnostic clinical staging models have gained prominence. These models aim to identify where individuals lie along a continuum of illness, to improve treatment selection and to better understand patterns of illness continuity, discontinuity and aetiopathogenesis. All of these factors are particularly relevant to help-seeking and mental health needs experienced during the peak age range of onset, namely the adolescent and young adult developmental periods (i.e., ages 12–25 years). To date, progressive stages in transdiagnostic models have typically been defined by traditional symptom sets that distinguish "sub-threshold" from "threshold-level" disorders, even though both require clinical assessment and potential interventions. Here, we argue that staging models must go beyond illness progression to capture additional dimensions of illness extension as evidenced by emergence of mental or physical comorbidity/complexity or a marked change in a linked biological construct. To develop further consensus in this nascent field, we articulate principles and assumptions underpinning transdiagnostic clinical staging in youth mental health, how these models can be operationalized, and the implications of these arguments for research and development of new service systems. We then propose an agenda for the coming decade, including knowledge gaps, the need for multi-stakeholder input, and a collaborative international process for advancing both science and implementation.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^112dv9Sr]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The impact and prevalence of post Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) condition, known as "Long/post COVID", in children are unclear due to the lack of high-quality studies and a clear clinical case definition. There may be an increased risk in children older than ten years and those with certain underlying medical conditions. However, severe COVID-19 is generally uncommon in children, so it is not known if post COVID symptoms are as frequent in the pediatric population as they are in adults and with the same clinical phenotype. Furthermore, it is unclear whether post COVID differs from chronic conditions after other viruses in children, adolescents, and young adults. Different definitions for Long/post COVID have been formulated by the major international organizations, and therefore the term is often being used in a generally comprehensive manner by researchers, indicating the persistence of symptoms after Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

### Review of burden, clinical definitions, and management of COVID-19 cases [^112gDE23]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

BURDEN AND CASE FATALITY OF COVID-19

Since the first cases were recognized in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread around the world, with cases and fatalities increasing by the thousands daily. While attempting to define the burden and case fatality of the disease, efforts have been complicated by different case definitions and testing procedures, asymptomatic cases that may go unrecognized and the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic.

Studies of hospitalized patients have reported fatality rates ranging from 1.4% to 18.9%, and as high as 61.5% among those who were critically ill. – Case fatality rates were reportedly higher among older adults and the elderly than among young adults and children. Reported rates include 1.0% among adults aged 50–59 years, 3.5% among 60–69 years, 12.8% among 70–79 years, and 20.2% among 80 years or older. Among critically ill patients, the case fatality is reportedly higher, reaching 50% among adults aged 40–49 years and 87.5–100% among those older than 70 years. The precise case fatality rate for countries affected by the disease is unknown — although some models allowing for mild and asymptomatic cases estimated it at 0.51%. Despite this uncertainty, several risk factors for significant outbreaks of severe and fatal illness have been identified. These include patient characteristics, disease phenotype, and laboratory biomarkers.– See Factors associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality for factors associated with morbidity and mortality.

### Features of and preventive measures against hypertension in the young [^113ARkYZ]. Hypertension Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Definitions and diagnostic criteria of hypertension in youth

Although chapters regarding hypertension in children and hypertension in the elderly are published in "The Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2014)", a chapter regarding hypertension in adolescents and youth does not exist. That is, hypertension in youth remains undescribed, in contrast to hypertension in children or the elderly, and is included under the same category as adult essential hypertension or secondary hypertension. Furthermore, hypertension in youth has never been attributed to a specific pathophysiology.

The definition determining the age range of young hypertension is very ambiguous. Even a 15-year-old (a junior high school student) is usually considered a child, and the period between adolescence and 18 years of age is considered the age between childhood and youth. In the JSH 2014, hypertension in high school students is partly discussed in the chapter relative to hypertension in children. Since Japanese doctors of internal medicine usually target a patient population that includes high school students, we also focus on a population beyond high school students as a target of research. Similarly, an upper limit of age is not clear, and hypertension in individuals below age 35 or 40 is usually classified as young hypertension in many cases. Thus, our research mainly focused on high school students to young adults below the age of 40 years.

The diagnostic criteria for young hypertension in high school students are usually set at 140 mm Hg or more for systolic BP (SBP) or 85 mm Hg or more for diastolic BP (DBP). For university students (aged 18 or older), a SBP of 140 mm Hg or more or a DBP above 90 mm Hg is defined as hypertension.

### What's distressing about having type 1 diabetes? A qualitative study of young adults' perspectives [^111TNbvL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Drawing on the work of Arnett diabetes researchers argue that young adulthood is a divided developmental stage, composed of an early transitional phase (approximately 18–22 years of age) but also a later one (approximately 23–30 years of age) that is characterized by increased lifestyle stability. Young adults in their twenties are more future conscious and concerned about their diabetes management than their younger counterparts. They tend to lose their adolescent sense of invulnerability.

Young adults in this range also experience distress, and some experience increased distress as they transition through their twenties. Why these older individuals experience diabetes distress is an issue that has not receive significant attention from researchers, though existing research provides some indications. One reason may be that the mid to late twenties may be just as unstable a life period for some young people as the late teens and early twenties. Arnett notes that residential mobility is actually at its maximum for young people in their mid-20s, and that the 20s can be years of frequent changes in occupation, educational status and personal relationships. Young adults in this age range are transitioning to parenthood, to long-term personal relationships, to careers, to general adult health services, all the while trying to effectively manage their diabetes. These competing health and developmental priorities can lead some young people to feel overwhelmed. While clinicians have put substantial efforts into helping younger adults with Type 1 diabetes manage distress, for example by developing specialist young adult services, distress in young adults in their mid to late 20s has not received the same attention. Young people in this age are generally treated in adult services where psychological support is lacking.

This qualitative study investigates factors that cause diabetes distress in young adults with Type 1 diabetes aged 23–30 (the age range that diabetes researchers refer to as the 'second phase of emerging adulthood'). Understanding the factors that drive distress is crucial for constructing appropriate interventions to combat it.

### An integrative literature review on the nomenclature and definition of dementia at a young age [^112XGUp9]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background:

There has been growing interest in young people living with dementia. Future research requires consensus on the terminology and operational definition of this group.

Objective:

The purpose of this integrative review was to explore and include all operational definitions used to define dementia at a young age.

Methods:

On August 14, 2020, the PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, and PsycInfo databases were searched for empirical and theoretical literature using Google. Various terms to describe and define 'dementia' and 'at a young age' were used to collect literature concerning terminology; age-related aspects, including cut-off ages and criteria; and etiologies of dementia at a young age.

Results:

The search yielded 6,891 empirical and 4,660 theoretical publications, resulting in the inclusion of 89 publications, including 36 publications containing an explicit discussion and 53 publications as confirmation. 'Young-onset dementia' was the most commonly used term of seven identified terms, in the last two decades. The age of 65 years at symptom onset was used most frequently when considering a total of six upper age limits and four criteria to define a cut-off age. Eight lower age limits and an option for subdivision based on age were included. We identified 251 different etiologies and 27 categories of etiologies.

Conclusion:

Despite relative consensus on the term young-onset dementia and an age at symptom onset being used as a cut-off criterion, much is still unclear concerning possible etiologies of dementia at a young age. In the current study, controversies were detected for discussion in an international consensus study.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^117Q8arb]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

For young adults, ages 18–21 years, adult cutpoints for BP are used to define hypertension as per the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guidelines, and the management of hypertension is as described in JNC 7. In this age range, institution of the adult DASH diet is recommended for individuals with prehypertension or hypertension, as is reduction of dietary sodium. Overweight continues to be a major concern in this age group; weight reduction should be promoted through enhanced energy expenditure coupled with reduced energy intake. Physical activity should be promoted, since moderate-to-vigorous physical activity reduces BP levels in adults.

### Do we need distinct pediatric classification criteria for rheumatic diseases that affect both children and adults? [^112yFhmB]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of chronic inflammatory arthritis across the lifespan

Using the same classification criteria for children and adults with RMDs could harmonize research across age groups and facilitate the inclusion of both pediatric and adult populations in clinical trials. This approach could potentially expedite the approval and availability of new therapeutic options. However, standardizing the classification of RMDs is highly dependent on the particularities of the diagnostic label used in children compared with adults, which may reflect more or less heterogeneous disease phenotypes. For example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reflects a relatively homogeneous inflammatory arthritis phenotype in adults, whereas juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an umbrella diagnosis in children, encompassing several subtypes of childhood arthritis characterized by heterogeneous pathogenesis and clinical presentation.

The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria, commonly used for classifying JIA, have several limitations. These include arbitrary age and joint count cut‐offs as well as mutually exclusive features that can complicate the classification for individuals who exhibit overlapping signs and symptoms. Moreover, the ILAR classification criteria do not address the genetic or molecular similarities among different JIA subtypes, which can impact the adequate treatment selection and accurate risk‐stratification of individuals with JIA. The ILAR subgroup of nonsystemic JIA that shares clear genetic and pathogenic mechanisms with their adult corresponding phenotype is the seropositive poly‐JIA group, which often affects adolescent girls and resembles seropositive RA. The pathogenesis of early onset forms of chronic arthritis observed in young patients is less well‐defined.

### Building centers of excellence for the care of young adults with stroke [^112bpU2A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Young adults with stroke are a unique subgroup of patients with age‐specific considerations in clinical practice, but there are few US guidelines or broadly implemented management approaches in the United States that tailor care to this population. As compared with older adults, young adults manifest different acute symptoms, have a broader variety of stroke mechanisms often requiring extensive diagnostic testing, and engage ramifications of stroke prevention, recovery, rehabilitation, and adaptation over longer durations of life expectancy. In the absence of systematic efforts to improve the care of young adults with stroke, many individuals may be misdiagnosed or have a delayed diagnosis initially, undergo incomplete diagnostic investigations, or receive poorly calibrated guidance or therapy aimed at prevention and maximizing recovery.

In 2023, the Stroke and Young Adults Consortium was established to bring clinician experts, patient and caregiver stakeholders, and researchers together to advance the care of young adults with stroke in the United States. Most research studies in the United States define this age group as people aged 18 to 50 at stroke onset (with variation in age thresholds around the world), but we decided as a consortium to include a broader range from ages 18 to 64 (pre‐Medicare eligibility, working age) in research, education, and advocacy efforts. In this Viewpoint, we describe our shared vision for the essential elements needed to build centers of excellence for the care of young adults with stroke given unique challenges they face (Figure).

### Do we need distinct pediatric classification criteria for rheumatic diseases that affect both children and adults? [^115LBziD]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatic diseases (RMDs) represent a diverse group of conditions that can affect individuals of any age. Although pediatric and adult rheumatologists develop specialized expertise in the recognition, diagnosis, and management of these diseases, individuals diagnosed with RMDs at distinct stages in their life face age and developmentally distinct challenges, which necessitate a comprehensive approach to health care. This approach must encompass coordinated and integrated care, including effective transition protocols for adolescents, as well as access to high‐quality research at every stage in life. Developmental factors play a key role in shaping the immune system, resulting in age‐related differences in disease risk, outcomes, and treatment responses, emphasizing the necessity for age‐tailored approaches in both research and clinical care. This is particularly crucial because genetic predispositions, environmental influences, and socioeconomic conditions can heavily impact RMD presentation and outcomes.

The need for improved evidence‐based health care in rheumatology requires high‐quality, multicenter studies with suitable geographic and ethnic representation across the lifespan. Accurate classification criteria help identify homogeneous disease populations, which is vital for advancing the understanding of the disease pathogenesis and for the development and testing of tailored therapeutic strategies. Moreover, adequate classification criteria can enhance the identification of disease subtypes with different outcomes and treatment responses, paving the way for more individualized management approaches.

Although there are similarities in the presentation and management of RMDs between distinct age groups such as children and adults or younger and older adults, significant differences in pathogenesis, clinical phenotype, disease progression, and outcomes often necessitate age‐specific classification criteria. However, this distinction has only been made for children rather than adults with certain RMDs, using an arbitrary age cut‐off of 16 or 18 years. Two main strategies have been employed in the classification of pediatric RMDs: one involves adapting adult classification criteria for use in pediatric populations with similar disease phenotypes, whereas the other focuses on developing and validating criteria specifically tailored to children.

### BMI-for-age percentile curves for older adults [^1151eX9A]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

In this manuscript, we present a novel approach for defining obesity using BMI‐for‐age percentile curves in older adults (ages 45–90 years). BMI‐for‐age percentile curves are a novel descriptive tool that incorporates information on BMI, age, and sex. BMI‐for‐age percentile curves facilitate a better understanding of how an individual's BMI value compares with values from a standard reference population, as well as how BMI changes with aging. The use of BMI‐for‐age percentile curves helps to overcome a key methodological challenge when assessing obesity in older adults related to the use of a fixed cut point to define obesity status.

### Geriatric emergency department guidelines [^1151wwas]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Geriatric emergency department (ED) age definitions — population thresholds and categories are detailed as follows: in 1985 the "oldest old" were identified as 85 years of age and older, and subsequent categorizations divided older adults into young old (often 65–74), middle old (75–85), and oldest old (> 85), while the World Health Organization defined the older population starting at age 60. For operational scope, the guideline states that age 65 and older is the geriatric population for the Geriatric ED, but entry age can be literature-based at age 60 or 65 or set by hospitals, with examples including age 55, 65 years of age, and 75 years of age as starting thresholds for their Geriatric ED.

### Cardiac conduction disorders due to acquired or genetic causes in young adults: a review of the current literature [^112Sagge]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac conduction disorders (CCDs) encompass a wide range of clinical conditions characterized by cardiac conduction abnormalities, including both acquired and hereditary forms, which can occur either alone or in association with structural heart abnormalities. The Heart Rhythm Society, the European Heart Rhythm Association, and the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society unanimously define CCDs in young adults, defined as those aged < 50 years, as the presence of unexplained progressive conduction abnormalities in structurally normal hearts and in the absence of skeletal myopathies. However, the clinical profile and prognosis of younger adults with CCDs aged < 50 years has been poorly investigated. Available epidemiological data reported that CCDs in young adults represent about 13% of all conduction disorders. However, this estimate likely underestimates the magnitude of the problem. Additionally, the incidence, causes, and outcome of a larger part of CCDs remains of unknown origin and labeled as idiopathic. Doubtless, advances in genetic screening over the past 2 decades have aimed to define the prevalence and clinical characteristics of these patients. Nonetheless, their clinical management and diagnosis often remain a challenge due to the need for early diagnosis, effective and personalized treatments, and long‐term follow‐up. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update on the epidemiology, cause, diagnosis, and management of young adults with CCDs also focusing on the current unmet needs of these patients and suggesting potential strategies to resolve these gaps in our knowledge.

### The age of adolescence [^1166qMh2]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Adolescence is the phase of life stretching between childhood and adulthood, and its definition has long posed a conundrum. Adolescence encompasses elements of biological growth and major social role transitions, both of which have changed in the past century. Earlier puberty has accelerated the onset of adolescence in nearly all populations, while understanding of continued growth has lifted its endpoint age well into the 20s. In parallel, delayed timing of role transitions, including completion of education, marriage, and parenthood, continue to shift popular perceptions of when adulthood begins. Arguably, the transition period from childhood to adulthood now occupies a greater portion of the life course than ever before at a time when unprecedented social forces, including marketing and digital media, are affecting health and wellbeing across these years. An expanded and more inclusive definition of adolescence is essential for developmentally appropriate framing of laws, social policies, and service systems. Rather than age 10–19 years, a definition of 10–24 years corresponds more closely to adolescent growth and popular understandings of this life phase and would facilitate extended investments across a broader range of settings.

### Risk factors and causes of ischemic stroke in 1322 young adults [^113nNPy7]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

An estimated 10% to 15% of all strokes occur in young adults (18–49 years), resulting in about 2 million young adults who are affected by stroke worldwide every year, with incidence increasing over the past decade. – Stroke at young age comes with high socioeconomic costs and patients encounter lifelong consequences. Rapid identification of causes and risk factors of ischemic stroke in young adults is key to optimize treatment and prevent recurrence. Still, in up to one-third of all cases with ischemic stroke at young age, no clear cause is identified after thorough clinical work-up and the use of stroke classification schemes such as the TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification and the ASCOD (atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, cardiac pathology, other causes, dissection) classification. –

However, these classifications have been developed for ischemic stroke patients often older than 65 years. They have gradually been implemented in clinical practice of patients with stroke at younger ages, without any formal evaluation and validation in this specific domain. This may result in unjustified classification of patients with a cryptogenic stroke, while in fact causes or risk factors for stroke are present that are not recognized as such within the conventional developed classification schemes. In addition, the currently used classifications lump patients with diverse and rare causes and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms into 1 other determined category, thereby ignoring the possible different long-term prognosis of stroke depending by the different causes.

In contrast to the classification schemes used in adults, the classification developed for childhood- and adolescent stroke by the IPSS study (International Pediatric Stroke Study) designates not 1 single cause of stroke. The IPSS allows multiple risk factor categories that are not mutually exclusive and recognizes age-specific presumed risk factors and etiologies that are not included in the TOAST and ASCOD. Although a risk factor is not necessarily synonymous with a cause, rapid identification of risk factors is an important step to initiate treatment and counseling of patients.

We therefore investigated the causes and risk factors of stroke in young adults in a prospective cohort study of young patients with imaging proven ischemic stroke according to the TOAST, ASCOD, and IPSS criteria to search for clues that help find potential causes in cryptogenic stroke.

### CKD: a call for an age-adapted definition [^116JG2p8]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Current criteria for the diagnosis of CKD in adults include persistent signs of kidney damage, such as increased urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio or a GFR below the threshold of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² This threshold has important caveats because it does not separate kidney disease from kidney aging, and therefore does not hold for all ages. In an extensive review of the literature, we found that GFR declines with healthy aging without any overt signs of compensation (such as elevated single-nephron GFR) or kidney damage. Older living kidney donors, who are carefully selected based on good health, have a lower predonation GFR compared with younger donors. Furthermore, the results from the large meta-analyses conducted by the CKD Prognosis Consortium and from numerous other studies indicate that the GFR threshold above which the risk of mortality is increased is not consistent across all ages. Among younger persons, mortality is increased at GFR < 75 ml/min per 1.73 m², whereas in elderly people it is increased at levels < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m² Therefore, we suggest that amending the CKD definition to include age-specific thresholds for GFR. The implications of an updated definition are far reaching. Having fewer healthy elderly individuals diagnosed with CKD could help reduce inappropriate care and its associated adverse effects. Global prevalence estimates for CKD would be substantially reduced. Also, using an age-specific threshold for younger persons might lead to earlier identification of CKD onset for such individuals, at a point when progressive kidney damage may still be preventable.

### BMI-for-age percentile curves for older adults [^11328FdB]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of BMI categories to define obesity in older adults may lead to misclassification of true obesity status. Numerous authors have encouraged caution when using BMI > 30 to define obesity in older adults,]. The American Medical Association Council on Science and Public Health recently concluded that the standard BMI classification system is flawed and may lead to inaccurate conclusions. Prior research has demonstrated that misclassification of obesity status, defined using a BMI cut point of 30, increases with age. In light of this evidence, obesity researchers and clinicians are faced with a challenging situation: BMI has broad utility as a simple and inexpensive anthropometric measure, but it is clear that using a BMI cut point of 30 to define obesity status across the life‐span is not accurate.

In pediatric populations, BMI‐for‐age percentile curves are used instead of fixed BMI categories in recognition of the rapid physical changes that occur as children grow and progress through childhood and adolescence. Older adults also experience many physical changes in late life, but these are not considered when using standard BMI categories to assess obesity. It is important to consider age‐related change in body size at both ends of the age distribution. The BMI‐for‐age percentile curves that we have developed for older adults are a descriptive tool to facilitate comparison among individuals in the population and track individual‐level change over time relative to the population. Their application in clinical settings could be similar to the pediatric reference curves developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Importantly, our BMI‐for‐age percentile curves are a growth reference (i.e. a tool that provides a common basis for comparison) and not a growth standard, which makes specific value judgments about normal growth targets. The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes growth charts based on international data that are intended to serve as a growth standard for children worldwide, i.e. a basis for defining ideal, healthy growth in children. Our BMI‐for‐age curves and the CDC BMI‐for‐age curves are used for a different purpose than the WHO growth standard charts as they are descriptive, not prescriptive. They are a tool for comparison, to monitor individual growth, for screening purposes, and to prompt discussion regarding the potential need for intervention due to body weight. The BMI‐for‐age curves presented in this manuscript are not intended to be used as a standard to define an ideal or normal level of BMI; they are a descriptor of "what is" rather than a value judgment about "what should be".

### The dilemma of the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents: disease or distraction? [^114Pb1r9]. Pediatric Diabetes (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The alarming increase of obesity in children occurring globally is raising concern about the implications for development, at earlier ages, of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and is driving efforts to evaluate and predict risk in the young. A major component of this undertaking has been directed to adapting for children the criteria described in adults as the metabolic syndrome (MS).

Methods

This article briefly examines the status of and controversy about definition of the MS in adults and its value, and then it moves on to review the descriptions of the MS in the pediatric age group. This is done primarily from the point of view of its usefulness to the clinician. The ranges of the criteria used by different investigators, the differences in their prevalence and their effectiveness in predicting cardiovascular risk are discussed. Current information about cardiovascular risk factors in children, their progression into adulthood and their correlation with atherosclerosis in children and young adults is outlined. Finally, the current information and recommendations for treatment, in children, of cardiovascular risk factors including those composing the MS are reviewed.

Conclusions

One conclusion is that there needs to be consensus about the criteria for defining the MS in children if its use as a diagnosis is to be helpful in this age group. A second conclusion questions the value of using this syndromic collection of risk factors in children rather than concentrating on the risk factors themselves, evaluating their importance in early cardiovascular risk and assessing the safety and efficacy of intervention in early life.

### Preventing myocardial infarction in the young adult in the first place: how do the national cholesterol education panel III guidelines perform? [^1158eaL1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of the new National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) III guidelines in a group of young adults.

Background

These guidelines have been hailed as an improvement in their potential to identify individuals at risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) complications. Compared with the NCEP II, the new guidelines will increase the number of patients who qualify for medical management. However, the effectiveness of these guidelines to identify young adults at risk for a cardiac event is yet to be studied.

Methods

A retrospective review of clinical data from young adults (age ≤ 55 years for men and ≤ 65 years for women) hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction over a three-year period was conducted. Patients with a history of CHD or CHD equivalent were excluded. Using the NCEP III guidelines, we calculated a 10-year risk for coronary events on all patients.

Results

A total of 222 patients met criteria for inclusion. The mean age was 50 years and 25% were women. Mean lipid levels were all within the normal range; however, rates of smoking and obesity were high. When the 10-year risk of these patients was stratified by the number of risk factors and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, only 25% met criteria to qualify for pharmacotherapy. For women in this population, only 18% met criteria for treatment.

Conclusions

The new guidelines offer multiple new features but have a tendency to underappreciate the risk for disease in young adults. To improve performance in young adults, statistical adjustments may be necessary.

### Defining and measuring child and youth thriving: a scoping review [^1145Zx9N]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Promoting positive child and youth health and development requires clear definitions and comprehensive measures of child and youth thriving. The study's objectives were to identify the scope, range, and gaps in definitions and measures of thriving for children or youth (birth through young adult).

Methods

Systematic searches of Pubmed, PsycInfo, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, Education Resources Information Center, and Scopus were conducted for articles that included definitions, conceptual frameworks, or measures of child and youth thriving. Inclusion criteria were that the articles: (1) provided a new definition or measure of child thriving, flourishing, or well-being; (2) focused on normally developing children 0 to 24 years old; and (3) were published between 2009 and 2022 in an English language peer-reviewed journal. Studies were categorized by child age, study type, population, and community-identified domains of thriving.

Results

Of the 14920 articles identified, 113 met inclusion criteria: 34 unique definitions or frameworks, 66 validated measures, and 12 articles presenting both a framework and measure. One-third of the articles focused on early childhood (0–5 years old); 47% on middle childhood (6–11 years old); 72% on adolescence (12–17 years old), and 22% on young adults (18–24 years old).

Conclusions

Current child thriving definitions, frameworks, and measures could be expanded in their coverage of age and key domains, such as racial equity and safety. Additional frameworks and measures focused on early childhood (0–5 years) and assessing thriving over time are needed.

### The global burden of adolescent and young adult cancer in 2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^117KJE8b]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Adolescents and young adults with cancer represent a transition population within the cancer continuum between children and older adults. As adolescents and young adults with cancer are treated by a variety of specialists, their unique epidemiology and clinical care needs are often overlooked. Although improvements in survival for children and adults with cancer are reported in high-income countries, less incremental progress has been observed among adolescents and young adults. Added complexities of cancer in this age group include the potential impact of a cancer diagnosis on starting or caring for their families and careers, access to care, diagnostic delays, and abandonment of therapy — issues that exist globally. Previous work assessing the global burden of adolescent and young adult cancer has focused on incidence and mortality, and has occasionally used a more restrictive age range than presented in this study. International adolescent and young adult cancer incidence patterns across time have been reported with data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents reports, and national-level estimates have been reported from select, primarily high-income, countries. These publications have begun to raise awareness of adolescents and young adults as a distinctive population within the oncology community globally. However, to our knowledge, no previous publication has incorporated the impact of morbidity or done a comparative analysis of cancer within the broader context of the adolescent and young adult disease burden. We searched PubMed for English-language research articles describing the global burden of adolescent and young adult cancers between Jan 1, 2010, and Feb 1, 2021, using the terms "adolescent and young adult or adolescent or young adult or AYA" and "oncology or cancer or neoplasm or tumor or malignancy" and "global or worldwide or international" and "incidence or mortality or morbidity or burden or prevalence or survival", and identified no additional comprehensive adolescent and young adult global cancer estimate reports.

### Work-focused interventions that promote the labour market transition of young adults with chronic disabling health conditions: a systematic review [^115f9iFY]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Relevance screen

Articles were included if they were primary research, published1990, focused on a work-specific intervention, within an OECD country, and where the sample of interest was young adults (18–35 years) with any chronic disabling health condition. We included studies when the sample's mean age fell between 18 and 35 years, and age range was < 45 years or > 16 years. Articles which had a broader age range were only included when sample characteristics and intervention effects were reported for young adults. Our operationalisation of young adulthood aligns with theoretical research on the young adult life phase and enabled us to capture various definitions used in the literature. Intervention studies could be randomised or non-randomised designs but had to have a comparator or control group. All languages were included in our search. Exclusion criteria comprised (1) non-intervention studies (eg, observational research); (2) secondary research (eg, systematic reviews); (3) non-work-focused interventions (eg, clinical interventions where employment was not an intended outcome); (4) commentary/editorial or case studies; and (5) studies where no statistical intervention effect was recorded. While previously published systematic reviews or meta-analysis studies were not eligible, their references were checked to identify relevant articles.

Titles and abstracts of references identified in the search were divided among three reviewers for relevance screening, such that each reference was screened by two reviewers independently. A quality control step was implemented to ensure inter-rater reliability and limit bias; 5% of titles and abstracts were examined by two reviewers and findings were compared. Reviewers came to consensus on any disagreements and consulted the third reviewer in cases that could not be resolved. Articles that met the first level of screening were carried forward for a full-text review. Two independent reviewers applied the same inclusion and exclusion criteria to examine each article. Disagreements between the two reviewers were discussed in team meetings. Moderate–high inter-rater reliability was identified in title/abstract and full-text reviews, suggesting that reviewers were consistently applying inclusion/exclusion criteria to the screening processes.

### Return to employment after stroke in young adults: how important is the speed and energy cost of walking? [^114kNn6w]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

A quarter of individuals who experience a stroke are under the age of 65 yearsand up to 44% of these people will be unable to return to work, with the resulting loss of productivity costing the United Kingdom ≈$1.9 billion. This high economic cost and particularly significant effect on quality of life relative to functional requirements following stroke in young adults (defined as those of working age and under the age of 65 years) is an important health issue justifying particular focus on this age group.

Many young adults who have had a stroke are unable to return to work, education, or participate in social activities because of their difficulties walking and completing activities of daily living. However, nearly all stroke literature to date has focused on older adults who have very different functional requirements and potentially do not need to return to work, in contrast to young adults.

Previous literature, has established that young adults who have had a stroke walk markedly slower (range, 0.39–0.78 m/s) and have a higher metabolic cost of walking (0.63 mL/kg/m) compared with age-matched healthy-able-bodied participants (1.27–1.34 m/s – and 0.16 mL/kg/m, respectively). Although reports of decrements to walking performance seem similar in nature to those of older adults who have had a stroke, Platts et aland Nadeau et alincluded a large age range in participants and small sample sizes (27–54 and 18–73 years, respectively). A focus on young adults specifically and further grouping into age subgroups will help to elucidate any age-specific effects of stroke and to further understand the physiological and biomechanical sources of the high within-group variability, potentially helping to uncover important mechanisms. Important factors to consider include the type and cause of stroke, region of brain affected by the stroke, level of physical and cognitive disability, the intensity and duration of rehabilitation, and motivation of the individual.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113ME5Xb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

### The effectiveness of psychological therapies for anxiety disorders in adolescents: a meta-analysis [^1147DkBn]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, we were unable to draw conclusions about potential adverse effects of treatment as only two studies reported adverse events. Clinical trials of psychological interventions have been identified as insufficiently reporting harm arising from treatment, as unlike with drug trials, this is not mandatory (Duggan et al.). In a review of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded trials, none of the psychological intervention studies reported adverse events in their final reports, and where adverse events were mentioned (e.g. within trial protocols), reporting guidelines for drug trials were used, which may not be suitable for psychological treatments (Duggan et al.). To date, the focus of research examining psychological interventions has been on the benefits of therapy, but in future must also include the potential harm it might cause (e.g. worsening of symptoms, self-harm, suicide).

The strengths of this review include its specific focus on studies of the adolescent age range, examination of developmental adaptations used in treatments for adolescents, and examination of both diagnostic and symptom severity outcomes and potential moderators of symptom severity. For diagnostic outcomes, we were able to analyse ITT and completer data separately, allowing us to conclude that treatment effects were consistent across ITT and completer analyses for diagnostic outcomes. Nevertheless, our definition of the adolescent age range is a limitation that needs consideration. While we defined the adolescent age range as 11–18 years for the reasons outlined earlier, adolescence is an arbitrary definition and can be defined in multiple ways depending on the theoretical framework adopted (e.g. biological or psychosocial) (Curtis,), anywhere between 9 and 26 years (American Psychological Association,), with this upper end of the age span reflecting the neural development that continues beyond the age of 18 (Paus et al; Pfefferbaum et al.). Older adolescents may have more in common with young adults than younger adolescents in terms of neurological development (Waters et al.), and in the future, it will be important to consider the effectiveness of treatment for older adolescents and young adults, and at what stage adult-focussed treatment approaches become appropriate.

### What do young people with rheumatic disease believe to be important to research about their condition? A UK-wide study [^114TQvmV]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The involvement of people of all ages including young people in research is now widely advocated but prioritisation of research topics is still driven largely by professional agendas. Evidence from adult literature has reported a mismatch between a researcher and patient generated list of research topics. There have been no studies to date exploring the priorities of young people with long term conditions other than in SLE. The study aimed to explore the research priorities of young people across the UK with respect to rheumatic conditions.

Methods

Focus groups were undertaken with young people aged 11–24 years with rheumatic conditions recruited across the UK via members of the Barbara Ansell National Network for Adolescent Rheumatology BANNAR and relevant national charities. Data was analysed using a Framework approach. Participants discussed their beliefs about what should be researched in: Basic Science; Clinical Medicine; Health Services, Psychosocial, and Public Health. They were then invited to prioritize these areas in terms of how much funding they should receive.

Results

Thirteen focus groups were held involving 63 participants (18 males: 45 females, mean age 16 years, range 10 to 24) in all four nations of the UK. Young people's research priorities were influenced by whether they felt research would achieve benefits for all or just some patients and long or short term goals. Another influence was whether participants felt that research areas were already well funded.

Across all groups, Basic Science was a key priority and participants felt that psychosocial research should be prioritized more. Health Services Research was a lower priority, as the majority of participants were happy with their care. Clinical medicine was not a high priority as young people were happy with their medication or uncomfortable with trying new ones. Finally, for nearly all groups, Public Health was a low priority. Differences were also observed between the two age groups and across the geographically diverse focus groups.

Conclusion

Understanding young people's research priorities is important to develop research that is in tune with their needs. The results highlight the importance of considering the whole age range of adolescence and young adulthood as well as geographical diversity. The findings from this work will inform the future research of the Barbara Ansell National Network for Adolescent Rheumatology BANNAR in the UK.

### Prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of young-onset hypertension in Malaysia, 2006–2015 [^1167mzZt]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The influence of cultural factors across ethnic populations cannot be ignored in respect of addressing the issue of adherence to medication compliance and lifestyle changes, especially in a multiracial country such as Malaysia. It would be worthwhile to undertake further research to identify the genetics contributing to these disparities and explore how healthcare utilization uptakes and treatment adherence differ across these ethnicities. Throughout the process of conducting this study, defining an age range for YOH was challenging as there are no specific guidelines for defining the term "young adult". While the definition of 18–39 years is contextually relevant to young Malaysian adults, further examination and standardization of the definition of young adults in the global context is recommended, for example, those between the ages of 18 and 25 years.

Summary

What is known about this topic

Prospective epidemiological studies have shown that BP has a continuous, graded adverse effect on the risk of developing future cardiovascular events. In short, the earlier the onset of hypertension, the longer its duration, and the greater the risk for future cardiovascular events.
Recognizing the importance of the health of young adults in relation to hypertension, some communities and countries have already begun examining YOH to highlight this issue in their local setting. In the USA alone, it has been elucidated that nearly one in five young adults have hypertension and measures are already underway to expound and address this.

What this study adds

Utilising data from the NHMSs over 10 years from 2006 to 2015, this study reveals the pervasiveness of YOH in Malaysia. Data on trends of YOH are important to monitor the burden of cardiovascular outcomes, and assess the effectiveness of available public health interventions over time.
Subgroup analysis reveals important target groups and focused areas on the management and prevention of hypertension among young adults.

### An integrative literature review on the nomenclature and definition of dementia at a young age [^116zkfzx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Implications

In this review, we identified many elements considered in the nomenclature and definition of dementia at a young age. The largest research gap is the explication of underlying considerations, such as from what perspective (e.g. psychosocial or biological) age-related criteria and included etiologies were defined in the various publications. The predominantly interchangeable use of terms and definitions has four major consequences. First, whether a biological or psychosocial perspective was used influenced the choice in terminology. The term early-onset dementia is reserved by some authors to refer to young people living with dementia caused by typical old-age etiologies aged below 65 years — based on retirement and thereby chosen from a psychosocial perspective. Others reserved early-onset dementia to refer to people living with dementia aged below 65 years but above 45 years — because there are etiological differences compared to the group of people below 45 years living with dementia and thereby chosen from a biological perspective. Second, the choice between the age at symptom onset or at diagnosis as a cut-off criterion has significant consequences for determining the number of people living with dementia considered young, as it can take up to 4.7 years between the onset of first symptoms and final diagnosis of the type of dementia. Next to the amount of people that might be referred to post-diagnostic services, there also needs to be policy developed for these services regarding inclusion or exclusion of people with age of onset somewhere ambiguous around the age of 65 years. Third, although awareness of young people living with dementia is increasing, dementia services remain primarily focused on the needs of older people living with dementia, and a subdivision could scatter the awareness and the amount of age-related services. On the other hand, such a subdivision could be beneficial from a biological or research perspective to identify specific disease mechanisms in dementias with onset at a young age. Last, the inclusion of all etiologies found in this review as possible causes would significantly increase the determination of the number of young people living with dementia at a young age, which would have an effect on the number of post-diagnostic care facilities needed for this specific group of patients. On the one hand, it seems reasonable that people living with dementia at a young age and their caregivers might have similar needs regardless of the etiology, resulting in, for instance, multiple system atrophy as etiology. On the other hand, specialized care for etiologies and categories, such as Down's syndrome and other developmental disorders or Huntington's chorea, are often already embedded in other care systems and are financed differently. New insights might add to the discussion; for instance, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration and might be a potential etiology.

Age

There is no generally agreed criterion for definition of 'older people'. A cut-off of over 60 or 65 years is often used. However, in the developed world, the syndromes most relevant to geriatricians (e.g. dementia, frailty) are most common after age 80. In other areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa, 'older people' may be defined as over age 50. It is important to be clear which studies will be eligible for inclusion: those with participants at all ages, or only those which include older people. Reviewers should predetermine how they will deal with studies, particularly randomised controlled trials, which have different recruitment strategies relating to age. Many studies exclude patients over a certain age (e.g. 75 years), in which case geriatricians will be wary about extrapolating the results to their clinical practice. If there is no age restriction, can results be examined specifically for older people (e.g. > 65; 75; 85 years)? Even if older people are recruited, is there evidence of selection bias, i.e. are included patients different from those in routine clinical practice? Research studies generally recruit people who are healthier, better educated and of higher (less deprived) socioeconomic status. It is important to include a baseline table of participant characteristics so that readers can determine if the results are directly relevant to their own patients or extrapolations need to be made. Many studies will not present the overall age range, with mean and SD, but instead split the sample into age decades, or other categories. This can make it difficult to compare findings between studies — and authors of systematic reviews should attempt to obtain original information from study authors. We would encourage authors of individual studies to include overall age range, mean and SD as well as reporting in categories, and to make the individual-participant data available for reuse as soon as possible. For reviews, as a minimum, mean or median age (in years) and a description of the distribution (standard deviation, range or inter-quartile range) is required. If there is a wide age range, then it is helpful to report the numbers and proportion over 65 years. Also, reviewers should consider providing information on the numbers of the oldest participants, e.g. numbers and proportion of those aged over 80 or 85 years.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first review presenting both key aspects concerning terminology and definition of dementia at a young age as well as an inclusive list of etiologies. In recent years, there seems to be relative consensus on the term young-onset dementia, which has become the most commonly used term to refer to young people living with dementia. The age of 65 years at symptom onset was used most widely to distinguish this group from people living with dementia in old age. Furthermore, over 251 different etiologies were identified that might cause dementia at a young age. Most etiologies and overarching categories were mentioned frequently, and the remaining few etiologies and categories could be considered controversial. However, large heterogeneity and several controversies were observed regarding age-related criteria and the inclusion of various etiologies.

The fact that the term young-onset dementia was used most often in the last two decades is not only a historical evolution, but content-driven. Most frequently given reasons for the use of this particular term, rather than presenile dementia, were of biological origin, as young-onset dementia incorporates typical etiologies found in old-age dementia, rare etiologies found in middle-aged dementia and late-onset forms of childhood neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, many authors did not provide argumentation to explain the use of a specific term. Additionally, the term early onset dementia, which was the most commonly used until 2013, is still used by some authors. This might be explained by the fact that some authors reserve this particular term to refer to young people living with typical old-age causes of dementia, while others used this term to refer to people aged between 45 and 65 as comparison with people below age 45.
