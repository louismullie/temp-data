## Question

Management of hyperkalemia 5.7

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of a serum potassium of 5.7 mmol/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hyperkalemia and excluding pseudohyperkalemia. Then, I should classify severity and risk stratify based on potassium level, ECG findings, and comorbidities. Next, I will decide on the appropriate care setting and monitoring cadence. After that, I will outline immediate interventions, including medication review, intracellular shifting, and potassium removal strategies. Finally, I will address RAAS inhibitor management, dietary counseling, and follow-up planning, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the potassium value and exclude pseudohyperkalemia, because hemolysis, delayed processing, cold storage, and tube contamination can falsely elevate potassium. I should repeat the test promptly, ideally within 3 days if this was an unexpected outpatient finding, and ensure proper sample handling before making treatment decisions [^111t4bJ8] [^111Fa4pA].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and risk factors, including CKD stage, heart failure, diabetes, baseline eGFR, current medications that raise potassium (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs, NSAIDs, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements), and any recent changes in renal function or acid-base status, because these factors both increase hyperkalemia risk and influence the aggressiveness of management and the need for urgent evaluation [^116pRo5x] [^116AU5Ci] [^112kmFAC].

> I will now classify severity. Wait, let me verify the cutoffs because different societies use slightly different thresholds. By UK Renal Association guidance, 5.5–5.9 mmol/L is mild hyperkalemia, 6.0–6.4 mmol/L is moderate, and ≥ 6.5 mmol/L is severe; ESC uses a lower threshold for "severe" at ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, so I should document which framework I am using and communicate it clearly, noting that 5.7 mmol/L sits in the mild range by UKKA but would be moderate by ESC definitions [^116mZYBi] [^111rrGqp] [^1172XMC2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about urgency. I need to check for ECG changes because membrane stabilization is prioritized when there are peaked T waves, PR prolongation, QRS widening, or conduction abnormalities. Although ECG sensitivity is imperfect and some patients with severe hyperkalemia may have minimal ECG findings, any ECG abnormality at this potassium level warrants escalation and continuous cardiac monitoring while treatment proceeds [^1124Vteu] [^115Lhcuz].

> Now, I should determine the care setting. For an outpatient with potassium 5.7 mmol/L and no ECG changes or acute illness, urgent but non-emergent management is appropriate, with expedited follow-up and repeat labs. Whereas if the patient is acutely unwell, has CKD with AKI, or shows ECG changes, I should arrange emergency department evaluation and continuous ECG monitoring. If potassium were ≥ 6.5 mmol/L, admission would be indicated regardless of symptoms [^116mZYBi] [^111pfUau] [^111rrGqp].

> Let me consider immediate outpatient interventions. First, I should review and modify medications that raise potassium, including holding or reducing RAAS inhibitors when potassium is 5.5–5.9 mmol/L, stopping potassium supplements and NSAIDs, and reassessing diuretic therapy to ensure adequate distal sodium delivery if eGFR allows. I need to ensure I do not abruptly stop beneficial RAAS inhibitors without a plan to restart, given their cardiorenal benefits, and I should involve nephrology if considering continuation despite potassium > 5.5 mmol/L [^113pqGhr] [^116AU5Ci] [^116VQePY].

> Next, I should address intracellular shifting. Insulin with dextrose is effective, but wait, I should verify the indication here. Initially, I thought to give 10 units of regular insulin with 25 g dextrose IV right away, but hold on, that regimen is guideline-supported for severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.5 mmol/L) or when ECG changes are present. For 5.7 mmol/L without ECG changes, I should reserve IV insulin/dextrose for clinical deterioration or if potassium rises toward 6.0 mmol/L, and instead prioritize oral strategies and close monitoring first [^115bePMV].

> I should confirm potassium removal options. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is reasonable for persistent hyperkalemia in CKD or heart failure patients on suboptimal RAAS inhibitor doses, and it can be used acutely for moderate elevations or emergently for severe hyperkalemia. Patiromer is an alternative binder for chronic management, and both can facilitate continued RAAS inhibitor therapy when hyperkalemia is a barrier to GDMT optimization [^116L8Ux5] [^115QssEw] [^114XyM8w] [^111VP5QC].

> Let me think about adjuncts. Nebulized salbutamol 10–20 mg can lower potassium by about 0.5–1.3 mmol/L and is reasonable as adjunctive therapy, particularly if there is bronchospasm or if insulin is contraindicated, but I should monitor for tremor and tachycardia and recognize variable response, especially in patients with beta-blocker use [^113p5yDq] [^114mdtLH].

> I need to ensure acid-base status is addressed. In non-hospitalized CKD patients with serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L, sodium bicarbonate can be considered to improve potassium shift and overall metabolic acidosis, but I should confirm there is no risk of sodium overload in heart failure before prescribing it [^111EprnF].

> Next, I should review RAAS inhibitor strategy. I should confirm baseline potassium and eGFR before initiation, recheck potassium within 1 week of starting or changing dose, and then monitor every 1–3 months initially. If potassium is 5.5–5.9 mmol/L, I should consider dose reduction and increase monitoring frequency, and if potassium reaches or exceeds 6.0 mmol/L, I should hold the agent and reassess. Importantly, KDIGO advises managing hyperkalemia to preserve RAAS inhibitors rather than reflexively discontinuing them, and in selected cases continuation with close monitoring and binders may be appropriate with nephrology input [^114WwTAf] [^1176vexx] [^116VQePY] [^116AU5Ci].

> I will now examine dietary management. I should arrange referral to a renal dietitian for patients with CKD and persistent potassium > 5.5 mmol/L, focusing on practical strategies to reduce bioavailable potassium intake, including limiting processed foods with potassium additives, moderating high-potassium produce portions, and addressing constipation, which can impair colonic potassium excretion. I need to balance this against the cardiovascular benefits of plant-forward diets and individualize advice [^111GoG94] [^116EoAM1] [^114sTgDs].

> Let me verify the monitoring plan. For an outpatient with 5.7 mmol/L, I should repeat potassium within 3 days to confirm the trend, sooner if symptoms develop or medications change, and if potassium rises to 6.0–6.4 mmol/L, I should repeat within 1 day. If the patient is hospitalized or has ECG changes, continuous ECG monitoring is warranted, with escalation to a higher-dependency setting for severe hyperkalemia or unstable ECGs [^111t4bJ8] [^112gR5dH] [^1124Vteu].

> But wait, what if the patient is on hemodialysis? In that case, I should consider dialysate potassium individualization, dietary counseling, and, for severe hyperkalemia with toxic ECG changes, administer IV calcium even if dialysis is imminent, because membrane stabilization reduces arrhythmia risk during correction. Pre-dialysis potassium targets are generally 4.0–6.0 mmol/L, but personalization of dialysate potassium and binder use is recommended to mitigate peridialytic arrhythmias [^111KzM2S] [^111cZZL1] [^112Ruzdf].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with guideline-directed therapy for heart failure and CKD. SGLT2 inhibitors can mitigate hyperkalemia risk and should be prioritized when feasible, and potassium binders can enable RAAS inhibitor optimization, which improves outcomes. I need to ensure patient education on sick-day rules, medication adherence, and when to seek urgent care if symptoms like weakness or palpitations occur [^111VP5QC] [^116AU5Ci].

For potassium 5.7 mmol/L, **confirm true hyperkalemia** and **obtain an ECG** to assess cardiac risk [^115Lhcuz] [^1124Vteu]. If ECG is normal, manage as **non-emergent**: stop potassium-raising drugs, consider a potassium binder (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) [^115h7Ejq], and recheck potassium in 1–3 days [^111t4bJ8]. If ECG shows peaked T waves or other changes, treat as **urgent**: give IV calcium gluconate, insulin with dextrose, and nebulized albuterol, then use a binder and arrange nephrology follow-up [^111ncDVe] [^115h7Ejq] [^114mdtLH]. Address underlying causes and monitor closely; **dialysis is reserved** for refractory cases or severe renal failure [^117RNkBj].

---

## Confirm true hyperkalemia and assess cardiac risk

- **Confirm true hyperkalemia**: Rule out pseudohyperkalemia from hemolysis, fist clenching, or delayed processing by repeating the test and ensuring proper sample handling [^111Fa4pA].

- **Obtain an ECG**: Identify peaked T waves, PR prolongation, QRS widening, or sine-wave morphology, which indicate higher risk and guide urgency [^114ypRXH].

- **Risk stratification**: Potassium 5.7 mmol/L is moderate; risk rises with CKD, heart failure, diabetes, or RAAS inhibitors [^1172XMC2].

---

## Non-emergent management (normal ECG)

### Medication review and adjustment

Medication review and adjustment should prioritize **stopping or reducing potassium-raising drugs** — such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs, NSAIDs, potassium supplements, and trimethoprim — when feasible [^112sDH5S]. Continue or initiate **loop or thiazide diuretics** if volume status allows to enhance renal potassium excretion [^114N7A4i].

---

### Potassium-lowering therapies

- **Potassium binders**: Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are first-line for persistent hyperkalemia; patiromer is preferred in CKD or heart failure [^notfound].

- **Dietary potassium restriction**: Refer to a renal dietitian for individualized counseling [^111GoG94].

- **Sodium bicarbonate**: Consider if metabolic acidosis is present (serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L) [^111EprnF].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **rechecking potassium within 1–3 days** after interventions [^111t4bJ8] and **continuing regular monitoring** until stable, then at routine intervals based on risk.

---

## Emergent management (abnormal ECG or severe symptoms)

### Immediate stabilization

Immediate stabilization includes **IV calcium gluconate** (10 mL of 10% solution over 2–5 minutes) to stabilize cardiac membranes; repeat if ECG changes persist [^114N7A4i]. Also administer **insulin with dextrose** (10 units regular insulin with 25 g dextrose IV) to shift potassium intracellularly; monitor for hypoglycemia [^115bePMV]. Add **nebulized albuterol** (10–20 mg) as adjunctive therapy to enhance intracellular potassium shift [^113p5yDq].

---

### Potassium removal

Potassium removal includes **potassium binders** — sodium zirconium cyclosilicate or patiromer — after stabilization to reduce total body potassium [^111VP5QC]. Initiate or optimize **diuretics** if effective renal function is present [^116pRo5x].

---

### Indications for dialysis

Dialysis is indicated for **refractory hyperkalemia**, severe renal failure (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²), or life-threatening ECG changes despite medical therapy [^115h7Ejq].

---

## Address underlying causes and contributing factors

Address underlying causes by identifying and treating **acute kidney injury**, correcting metabolic acidosis, and managing uncontrolled diabetes [^116EoAM1]. Review and adjust medications that raise potassium or impair excretion, and provide dietary counseling with a focus on potassium intake and hidden sources (e.g. processed foods) [^116EoAM1].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **serial potassium checks** every 1–3 days until stable, then at regular intervals based on risk and comorbidities. Track renal function with regular eGFR and creatinine assessments, and maintain continuous ECG monitoring during acute treatment or if ECG changes are present [^1124Vteu].

---

## Summary of management steps for potassium 5.7 mmol/L

1. Confirm true hyperkalemia and obtain ECG
2. If ECG normal, manage non-emergently; if abnormal, treat emergently
3. Stop or reduce potassium-raising medications
4. Consider potassium binders (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate)
5. Implement dietary potassium restriction
6. Address underlying causes (AKI, acidosis, medications)
7. Recheck potassium in 1–3 days; monitor closely thereafter

---

Potassium 5.7 mmol/L requires **confirming true hyperkalemia**, assessing cardiac risk with an ECG, and applying a stepwise approach: stop offending drugs, use binders, restrict potassium, and treat underlying causes. Escalate to urgent therapy if ECG changes occur, and reserve dialysis for refractory cases.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Potassium homeostasis and management of dyskalemia in kidney diseases: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^112kmFAC]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Potassium disorders are common in patients with kidney disease, particularly in patients with tubular disorders and low glomerular filtration rate. A multidisciplinary group of researchers and clinicians met in October 2018 to identify evidence and address controversies in potassium management. The issues discussed encompassed our latest understanding of the regulation of tubular potassium excretion in health and disease; the relationship of potassium intake to cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, with increasing evidence showing beneficial associations with plant-based diet and data to suggest a paradigm shift from the idea of dietary restriction toward fostering patterns of eating that are associated with better outcomes; the paucity of data on the effect of dietary modification in restoring abnormal serum potassium to the normal range; a novel diagnostic algorithm for hypokalemia that takes into account the ascendency of the clinical context in determining cause, aligning the educational strategy with a practical approach to diagnosis; and therapeutic approaches in managing hyperkalemia when chronic and in the emergency or hospital ward. In sum, we provide here our conference deliberations on potassium homeostasis in health and disease, guidance for evaluation and management of dyskalemias in the context of kidney diseases, and research priorities in each of the above areas.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111cZZL1]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.1 - Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Rationale

Historically, it was often difficult to remove the potassium accumulated between dialysis sessions, so dialysate potassium between zero and 2mmol/L was common. The requirement for dialysate with potassium levels that are close to, or within, the normal range reflects the increased efficiency of modern dialysis and the increased age of the modern patient. In most units dialysate potassium is determined by the choice of acid concentrate: zero potassium is no longer used, and suppliers offer concentrates with potassium between 1 and 4mmol/L.

Removal of accumulated potassium by intermittent haemodialysis inevitably leads to a fluctuating profile of serum potassium with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias at both high and low concentrations. This probably contributes to the clustering of sudden cardiac death around the peridialytic period, and at the end of the weekend gap.

Management of hypertension in diabetes and chronic kidney disease — recommended follow-up intervals specify that after initiation or changes in antihypertensive therapy, reassess in < 4 wk when systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) is ≥ 140 or < 120, when GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) is < 60, and for serum potassium (mEq/L) if on ACE inhibitor or ARB > 4.5 or if on a diuretic ≤ 4.5; otherwise reassess at 4–12 wk for systolic blood pressure 120–139, for GFR ≥ 60, for potassium if on ACE inhibitor or ARB ≤ 4.5, or if on a diuretic > 4.5. After blood pressure is at goal and drug doses are stable, monitor at 1–6 mo for GFR < 60, GFR decline (mL/min/1.73 m²/y) ≥ 4, or when risk factors for faster CKD progression or acute GFR decline are Yes, and at 6–12 mo when GFR is ≥ 60, GFR decline is < 4, and risk factors are No.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: routine potassium replacement to achieve goal serum potassium ≥ 4.0 mmol / L in patients with acute myocardial infarction [^112zgMXp]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Internists routinely replete potassium to a high-goal serum level of ≥ 4mmol/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction to reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality. Recent literature demonstrates that a potassium goal of > 3.5mmol/L likely coincides with the lowest risk of mortality. Based on these data, internists should individualize potassium goals rather than routinely aiming for a high-goal serum level of ≥ 4mmol/L.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111GvgLG]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with diabetes, multiple studies have reported that treatment with MR blockers, ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or a direct renin inhibitor is associated with an increase in potassium levels and a risk of severe hyperkalemia in a small number of patients. In patients with systolic heart failure, large randomized studies investigating ACE inhibitors or ARBs have demonstrated significant increases in serum potassium during treatment. In one study, the mean serum potassium level increased by 0.2 mEq/L during treatment with enalapril, and the proportion of patients with a serum potassium level > 5.5 mEq/L was significantly higher in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (6.4% vs. 2.5%; p < 0.01). Similarly, the rate of hyperkalemia leading to treatment discontinuation was higher in the candesartan group than in the placebo group in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) (1.9% vs. 0.3%; p = 0.0005).

Combination therapy has the potential to further worsen the risk of hyperkalemia. In one study, the addition of spironolactone or losartan to ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and albuminuria was associated with significant increases in serum potassium level compared to the outcome in the placebo group (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.03, respectively). In parallel-group RCTs of spironolactone added to an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB, increases in serum potassium ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 mEq/L. Corresponding increases in serum potassium in crossover RCTs were 0.1–0.3 mEq/L, and in nonrandomized trials, they were 0.1–0.4 mEq/L.

Management of hyperkalemia in hypertension

To ensure patient safety, it is important to monitor and manage potassium at a personalized level owing to interindividual variations in risk, symptoms, and treatments.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1136PaYq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the management of hyperkalemia in these patient populations may include reduction or discontinuation of RAASi, this may have a negative impact on outcomes. Adverse cardiorenal outcomes have been observed to increase with RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation, particularly in cohorts with CKD and HF. 50 Therefore, optimizing the therapeutic dosage of RAASi is encouraged, despite any difficulties in managing hyperkalemia. Due to the high prevalence of comorbidities among patients with HF, there is a risk that target doses of the disease‐modifying drugs cannot be achieved, reducing the effectiveness of the therapy.

Although the problem of hyperkalemia in these patients appears significant, one if its clear causes are the lack of sufficient control of potassium levels in primary care, which leads to the hyperkalemia rates described above, together with their complications. Nilsson et al. examined patients starting MRA therapy between 2007 and 2010 in Sweden and found that only 24% were adequately monitored at the recommended intervals. 51 The prompt recognition of hyperkalemia usually leads to its treatment, improving the rates of optimum treatment in HF patients.

In general, HF patients with renal dysfunction, high potassium levels (> 5.0 mEq/L) or bilateral renal stenosis might need a rechecking of potassium levels within 1 to 2 weeks after the initiation of RAASi and then every 3 to 5 months, while treatment may be stopped or the dose reduced when potassium is > 5.5 mEq/L. Regarding MRAs in these patients, potassium is checked after 1 week, then 4, and then every 3 months; again, treatment is stopped or tapered when the potassium level reaches > 5.5 mEq/L.

In every case, we should try to restart treatment. HF treatment guidelines do not encourage MRAs use in patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² or serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L. In addition, it is important to instigate dietary counseling regarding potassium and reappraise concomitant medications (eg, potassium supplements, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, etc.) in those patients.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^1127bgax]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) — potassium alterations during hypothermia and rewarming are characterized as follows: Hypothermia induces hypokalemia by shifting potassium from the extracellular to intracellular or extravascular spaces, and patients cooled to a goal temperature of 33 °C showed a potassium nadir of 3.2 ± 0.7 mmol/L at 10 h after cooling initiation; in another cohort, 13% and 18% of patients cooled to 36 and 33 °C, respectively, had hypokalemia. There appears to be a correlation between nadir potassium levels < 3.0 mmol/L and risk of premature ventricular contractions. Rebound hyperkalemia is of concern during rewarming, and hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias have been associated with maintaining potassium levels above 3.5 mmol/L during the cooling maintenance phase; therefore, maintaining serum potassium levels between 3.0 and 3.5 mmol/L during induction and maintenance phases may prevent arrhythmias and reduce the risk of rebound hyperkalemia during rewarming.

### Management of hyperkalaemia in chronic kidney disease [^114C8jgq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in part because of the effects of kidney dysfunction on potassium homeostasis and in part because of the cluster of comorbidities (and their associated treatments) that occur in patients with CKD. Owing to its electrophysiological effects, severe hyperkalaemia represents a medical emergency that usually requires prompt intervention, whereas the prevention of hazardous hyperkalaemic episodes in at-risk patients requires measures aimed at the long-term normalization of potassium homeostasis. The options for effective and safe medical interventions to restore chronic potassium balance are few, and long-term management of hyperkalaemia is primarily limited to the correction of modifiable exacerbating factors. This situation can result in a difficult trade-off in patients with CKD, because drugs that are beneficial to these patients (for example, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system antagonists) are often the most prominent cause of their hyperkalaemia. Maintaining the use of these beneficial medications while implementing various strategies to control potassium balance is desirable; however, discontinuation rates remain high. The emergence of new medications that specifically target hyperkalaemia could lead to a therapeutic paradigm shift, emphasizing preventive management over ad hoc treatment of incidentally discovered elevations in serum potassium levels.

HFrEF — management of hyperkalemia to enable guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): Abnormal kidney function and/or hyperkalemia are common barriers to initiation and titration of GDMT; in patients with hyperkalemia, education regarding a low-potassium diet should be provided as a first step; use of SGLT inhibitors should be prioritized because these agents help to mitigate hyperkalemia; newer potassium binders (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) may be considered; in the DIAMOND trial, patiromer maintained lower serum potassium with a lower incidence of severe hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mEq/L) and allowed for 85% of participants to be optimized on GDMT.

Management of torsades de pointes with QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics — monitoring high-risk patients during initiation and recognizing the syndrome early are emphasized; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 and 5 mEq/L shortens QT, although no specific data are available on the efficacy of potassium repletion to prevent torsades de pointes; intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes even when serum magnesium is normal; magnesium toxicity can occur when concentrations reach 6 to 8 mEq/L but is a very small risk with doses usually used, 1 to 2 g intravenously; temporary pacing is highly effective for recurrent torsades after potassium repletion and magnesium supplementation, and isoproterenol can also be used to increase heart rate and abolish postectopic pauses; anecdotes have reported that lidocaine, verapamil, and even occasionally amiodarone have been effective, although amiodarone may itself cause torsades de pointes, albeit much less commonly than with other QT‑prolonging antiarrhythmics.

### Serum potassium levels and mortality in acute myocardial infarction [^112a5MdK]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Clinical practice guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium levels between 4.0 and 5.0 mEq/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). These guidelines are based on small studies that associated low potassium levels with ventricular arrhythmias in the pre-β-blocker and prereperfusion era. Current studies examining the relationship between potassium levels and mortality in AMI patients are lacking.

Objective

To determine the relationship between serum potassium levels and in-hospital mortality in AMI patients in the era of β-blocker and reperfusion therapy.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective cohort study using the Cerner Health Facts database, which included 38,689 patients with biomarker-confirmed AMI, admitted to 67 US hospitals between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008. All patients had in-hospital serum potassium measurements and were categorized by mean postadmission serum potassium level (< 3.0, 3.0- < 3.5, 3.5- < 4.0, 4.0- < 4.5, 4.5- < 5.0, 5.0- < 5.5, and ≥ 5.5 mEq/L). Hierarchical logistic regression was used to determine the association between potassium levels and outcomes after adjusting for patient- and hospital-level factors.

Main Outcome Measures

All-cause in-hospital mortality and the composite of ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.

Results

There was a U-shaped relationship between mean postadmission serum potassium level and in-hospital mortality that persisted after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the reference group of 3.5 to less than 4.0 mEq/L (mortality rate, 4.8%; 95% CI, 4.4%-5.2%), mortality was comparable for mean postadmission potassium of 4.0 to less than 4.5 mEq/L (5.0%; 95% CI, 4.7%-5.3%), multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04–1.36). Mortality was twice as great for potassium of 4.5 to less than 5.0 mEq/L (10.0%; 95% CI, 9.1%-10.9%; multivariable-adjusted OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.68–2.36), and even greater for higher potassium strata. Similarly, mortality rates were higher for potassium levels of less than 3.5 mEq/L. In contrast, rates of ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest were higher only among patients with potassium levels of less than 3.0 mEq/L and at levels of 5.0 mEq/L or greater.

Conclusion

Among inpatients with AMI, the lowest mortality was observed in those with postadmission serum potassium levels between 3.5 and < 4.5 mEq/L compared with those who had higher or lower potassium levels.

### Tolvaptan [^111o5g72]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6	Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium

Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium > 5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels.

5.7 Acute Urinary Retention with Outflow Obstruction

Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example, patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing acute retention. Do not administer tolvaptan in patients with uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction.

### Potassium phosphates [^114xZWQf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2	Important Administration Instructions

Check serum potassium and calcium concentrations prior to administration. Normalize the calcium before administering Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is only for administration to a patient with a serum potassium concentration less than 4 mEq/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, use an alternative source of phosphorus.
Do not infuse with calcium-containing intravenous fluids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
The 100 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol (phosphorus 0.15 mmol/mL) and potassium 22 mEq (potassium 0.22 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central vein.
The 250 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol and potassium 22 mEq (phosphorus 0.06 mmol/mL and potassium 0.088 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central OR peripheral vein.

2.3 Recommended Dosage

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose of potassium phosphates and are intended for most patients who weigh 40 kg or greater. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose.
The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Consider overall volume status of the patient when determining whether Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is an appropriate product for phosphorus replacement.
Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

Selection of the ready-to-use container solution concentration and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter. The infusion rate may also be adjusted based on patient characteristics and the specific institution policy.

The maximum recommended concentration and infusion rates for Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection are shown in Table 2 for adults and pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or greater.

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates higher than potassium 10 mEq/hour.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of additional doses, assess the patient clinically, obtain serum phosphorus, calcium, and potassium concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

### Potassium disorders – clinical spectrum and emergency management [^113AgffA]. Resuscitation (2006). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are common and may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias or cardiopulmonary arrest. They are an anticipated complication in patients with renal failure, but may also occur in patients with no previous history of renal disease. They have a broad clinical spectrum of presentation and this paper will highlight the life-threatening arrhythmias associated with both hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. Although the medical literature to date has provided a foundation for the therapeutic options available, this has not translated into consistent medical practice. Treatment algorithms have undoubtedly been useful in the management of other medical emergencies such as cardiac arrest and acute asthma. Hence, we have applied this strategy to the treatment of hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia which may prove valuable in clinical practice.

### Treatment of hyperkalemia… [^1169uo2j]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Potassium is a key cation with tightly regulated extracellular concentration. Hyperkalemia, commonly considered present if the potassium concentration exceeds 5. 0 mEq/L, appears to be a relatively rare event. Although representative data on hyperkalemia in the overall population are lacking, a study of US veterans indicated a hyperkalemia event rate of approximately 4 per 100 person-years, with the majority of events occurring during hospitalizations. 1 Individuals in this study were required to have at least 1 hospitalization and 1 outpatient creatinine measurement; thus, it is likely that the population was at higher risk for hyperkalemia.

In contrast to the low rate of hyperkalemia in the general population, individuals with certain comorbid conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or congestive heart failure have been shown to be highly prone to developing hyperkalemia, especially if receiving treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which are often recommended in such patients. For example, in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of losartan in patients with diabetic nephropathy, the cumulative incidence of hyperkalemia was 38. 4% in the losartan group. 2 Winkelmayer WC.

### Pharmacological interventions for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults [^114mdtLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death. Renal replacement therapy is known to be effective in treating hyperkalaemia, but safe and effective pharmacological interventions are needed to prevent dialysis or avoid the complications of hyperkalaemia until dialysis is performed.

Objectives

This review looked at the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used in the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults. This review evaluated the therapies that reduce serum potassium as well as those that prevent complications of hyperkalaemia.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 18 August 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at any pharmacological intervention for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults were included in this review. Non-standard study designs such as cross-over studies were also included. Eligible studies enrolled adults (aged 18 years and over) with hyperkalaemia, defined as serum potassium concentration ≥ 4.9 mmol/L, to receive pharmacological therapy to reduce serum potassium or to prevent arrhythmias. Patients with artificially induced hyperkalaemia were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

All three authors screened titles and abstracts, and data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by at least two authors. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Authors were contacted when information about results or study methodology was missing from the original publication. Although we planned to group all studies of a particular pharmacological therapy regardless of administration route or dose for analysis, we were unable to conduct meta-analyses because of the small numbers of studies evaluating any given treatment. For continuous data we reported mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included seven studies (241 participants) in this review. Meta-analysis of these seven included studies was not possible due to heterogeneity of the treatments and because many of the studies did not provide sufficient statistical information with their results. Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies. No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias; however there is evidence that several commonly used therapies effectively reduce serum potassium levels. Salbutamol administered via either nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) significantly reduced serum potassium compared with placebo. The peak effect of 10 mg nebulised salbutamol was seen at 120 minutes (MD -1.29 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.94) and at 90 minutes for 20 mg nebulised salbutamol (1 study: MD -1.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.82). One study reported 1.2 mg salbutamol via MDI 1.2 mg produced a significant decrease in serum potassium beginning at 10 minutes (MD -0.20 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and a maximal decrease at 60 minutes (MD -0.34 mmol/L, P < 0.0001). Intravenous (IV) and nebulised salbutamol produced comparable effects (2 studies). When compared to other interventions, salbutamol had similar effect to insulin-dextrose (2 studies) but was more effective than bicarbonate at 60 minutes (MD -0.46 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.10; 1 study). Insulin-dextrose was more effective than IV bicarbonate (1 study) and aminophylline (1 study). Insulin-dextrose, bicarbonate and aminophylline were not studied in any placebo-controlled studies. None of the included studies evaluated the effect of IV calcium or potassium binding resins in the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the acute pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia is limited, with no clinical studies demonstrating a reduction in adverse patient outcomes. Of the studied agents, salbutamol via any route and IV insulin-dextrose appear to be most effective at reducing serum potassium. There is limited evidence to support the use of other interventions, such as IV sodium bicarbonate or aminophylline. The effectiveness of potassium binding resins and IV calcium salts has not been tested in RCTs and requires further study before firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^114ypRXH]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^112fF8mn]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte management in ventricular arrhythmias — administration of potassium and magnesium has been proposed as helpful adjuncts in the prevention of VA; in patients with torsades de pointes, intravenous magnesium is first-line therapy, and when both potassium and magnesium are deficient, magnesium should be replaced to facilitate potassium repletion. For potassium targets, some recommend keeping the potassium level between 4.5 mmol/L and 5 mmol/L to prevent VA and SCD; in acute MI, the lowest death rates were seen with serum potassium between 3.5 mmol/L and < 4.5 mmol/L, and the rates of VA did not rise unless potassium was < 3.5 mmol/L or ≥ 5 mmol/L. A large randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous magnesium in the post-MI period demonstrated no benefit in 30-day mortality, and it remains quite reasonable to monitor potassium and magnesium during aggressive diuresis and in the post-MI period.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Controversies in management of hyperkalemia [^114N7A4i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that can result in morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately.

Objectives

This review evaluates the classic treatments of hyperkalemia and discusses controversies and new medications for management.

Discussion

Potassium (K+) plays a key role in determining the transmembrane potentials of "excitable membranes" present in nerve and muscle cells. K+ is the predominant intracellular cation, and clinical deterioration typically ensues when patients develop sufficiently marked elevation in extracellular fluid concentrations of K+ (hyperkalemia). Hyperkalemia is usually detected via serum clinical laboratory measurement. The most severe effect of hyperkalemia includes various cardiac dysrhythmias, which may result in cardiac arrest and death. Treatment includes measures to "stabilize" cardiac membranes, to shift K+ from extracellular to intracellular stores, and to promote K+ excretion. Calcium gluconate 10% dosed 10 mL intravenously should be provided for membrane stabilization, unless the patient is in cardiac arrest, in which case 10 mL calcium chloride is warranted. Beta-agonists and intravenous insulin should be given, and some experts recommend the use of synthetic short-acting insulins rather than regular insulin. Dextrose should also be administered, as indicated by initial and serial serum glucose measurements. Dialysis is the most efficient means to enable removal of excess K+. Loop and thiazide diuretics can also be useful. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not efficacious. New medications to promote gastrointestinal K+ excretion, which include patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, hold promise.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia can be deadly, and treatment requires specific measures including membrane stabilization, cellular shift, and excretion.

### Real world evidence for treatment of hyperkalemia in the emergency department (REVEAL-ED): a multicenter, prospective, observational study [^114cwdHY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Contemporary emergency department (ED) standard-of-care treatment of hyperkalemia is poorly described.

Objective

Our aim was to determine the treatment patterns of hyperkalemia management in the ED.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, observational study evaluated patients aged ≥ 18 years with hyperkalemia (potassium [K +] level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in the ED from October 25, 2015 to March 30, 2016. K + -lowering therapies and K + were documented at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after initial ED treatment. The primary end point was change in K + over 4 h.

Results

Overall, 203 patients were enrolled at 14 U.S.-based sites. The initial median K + was 6.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.7–6.8) mmol/L and median time to treatment was 2.7 (IQR 1.9–3.5) h post-ED arrival. Insulin/glucose (n = 130; 64%) was frequently used to treat hyperkalemia; overall, 43 different treatment combinations were employed within the first 4 h. Within 4 h, the median K + for patients treated with medications alone decreased from 6.3 (IQR, 5.8–6.8) mmol/L to 5.3 (4.8–5.7) mmol/L, while that for patients treated with dialysis decreased from 6.2 (IQR 6.0–6.6) mmol/L to 3.8 (IQR 3.6–4.2) mmol/L. Hypoglycemia occurred in 6% of patients overall and in 17% of patients with K + > 7.0 mmol/L. Hyperkalemia-related electrocardiogram changes were observed in 23% of all patients; 45% of patients with K + > 7.0 mmol/L had peaked T waves or widened QRS. Overall, 79% were hospitalized; 3 patients died.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia practice patterns vary considerably and, although treatment effectively lowered K +, only dialysis normalized median K + within 4 h.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department management of acute hyperkalemia [^111ncDVe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The normal range for potassium is within narrow limits. Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte disorder that frequently affects patients in the emergency department (ED), and can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated rapidly.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the management of hyperkalemia, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Methods

We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles in English published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed up until May 2020. We used multiple search terms, including hyperkalemia, potassium, acute hyperkalemia, emergency department, dyskalemia, potassium disorders, kidney disease, epidemiology, electrolyte disturbance, severe hyperkalemia, and emergency management.

Discussion

In the ED, interventions aimed to protect patients from the immediate dangers of elevated serum potassium are divided into the following: stabilizing cardiac membrane potentials, reducing serum potassium levels through shift from the extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid, and elimination of potassium through excretion via urinary or fecal excretion. Calcium is widely recommended to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane, but additional research is necessary to establish criteria for use, dosages, and preferred solutions. Redistribution of potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cells is based on intravenous insulin or nebulized β2-agonists.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in the ED. Because of the risk of fatal dysrhythmia due to cardiac membrane instability, hyperkalemia is a medical emergency. There is a lack of scientific evidence on the optimal management of hyperkalemia and more research is needed to establish optimal strategies to manage acute hyperkalemia in the emergency department.

### Potassium chloride (potassium chloride for oral solution) [^112jCLAA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116AU5Ci]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

RAASi/MRA management in CKD with hyperkalemia includes a stepwise approach: Optimize serum bicarbonate levels; Consider potassium-exchange agents; Third-line (Last resort): Reduce or discontinue RAASi/MRA; restart in future if patient condition allows. Providers may consider reducing or stopping ACEI/ARB when eGFR drops below a given eGFR threshold or when hyperkalemia develops, but hyperkalemia associated with use of ACEI/ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping ACEI/ARB. Protocols for RCTs of finerenone held the medication at potassium > 5.5 mmol/L; however, it may be appropriate to continue these medications in people with potassium of 5.5–6.0 mmol/L. We recommend involvement of nephrology when there is consideration of continuing ACEI/ARB/MRA when potassium > 5.5 mmol/L. The International Society of Nephrology provides an Optimization of RAASi Therapy Toolkit that includes guidance for managing hyperkalemia in patients on RAASi.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^116wEk37]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions of hyperkalemia

Definitions of hyperkalemia vary by geographic region. In Europe, mild hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium 5.0–5.4 mEq/L, moderate as 5.5–5.9 mEq/L, and severe as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L. The American Heart Association uses cutoffs of 5–6 mEq/L (mild), 6–7 mEq/L (moderate), and > 7 mEq/L (severe). However, in this review, we refer to the standard potassium values specified in the guidelines published by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare entitled "Classification criteria for the seriousness of adverse drug reactions of medical agents", wherein serum potassium values of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L and < 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 2 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and values of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 3 ADRs. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Japanese nephrology guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mEq/L to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia. Of note, mild to moderate hyperkalemia generally cannot be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; a study in hospitalized patients indicated that the first ECG changes occurred at serum potassium levels above 7.2 mEq/L, a level that already indicates severe hyperkalemia.

### Hypokalaemia: improving the investigation, management and therapeutic monitoring of hypokalaemic medical inpatients at a district general hospital [^114gR2qr]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Problem

High incidence of hypokalaemia was noted amongst acute medical inpatients during ward rounds at a 700 bed district general hospital. Although potassium replacement medication use was widespread, inconsistency in appropriate dosing, drug preparations, and the monitoring of treatment responses was evident.

With no local guidelines on the management of hypokalaemia, informal survey of the junior doctors highlighted uncertainty of appropriate investigation and management within our hospital. Consequently, haphazard potassium replacement regimes were in place leading to patient safety concerns, especially for inadequate management of dangerously low potassium values. Medication reviews to address potential causes for hypokalaemia were not routine and ECGs infrequently requested to assess for arrhythmic complications in moderate to severe hypokalaemia. Additionally, lack of serum blood monitoring and clear medication review dates increased the risk of patients remaining on potassium replacement beyond acceptable time frames, predisposing to hyperkalaemia.

Service evaluation and quality improvement was required to improve patient safety and standardise the treatment of hypokalaemia.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^111ziYaz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

DIALYSATE POTASSIUM

An unresolved issue is whether predialysis hyperkalaemia or a high dialysate–serum potassium gradient is the most important risk factor for adverse outcomes in haemodialysis patients (Figure 1). The most commonly used dialysate potassium concentration varies widely per country with some countries using predominantly 1–2 mmol/L and other countries using 3–4 mmol/L. Pun and Middleton reviewed the nine retrospective studies that analysed the association between the dialysate potassium concentration and outcome, which usually was sudden cardiac death or all-cause mortality. Although five studies identified an increased risk of adverse outcomes with lower dialysate potassium (defined as < 2 or < 3 mmol/L), two studies found no association, and two studies found associations that favoured lower dialysate potassium. Using sales data, Mercadal et al. show that over time a lower dialysate potassium concentration was being used less frequently. For example, the percentage of centres using < 2 mmol/L decreased from 57% to 49%, whereas the use of 3 mmol/L or ≥ 4 mmol/L increased from 89% to 91% and from 3% to 13%, respectively. This trend seems to echo the recent literature in which most studies linked a low dialysate potassium to an increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, this was not a universal finding, because Mercadal et al. also showed that the occasional use of dialysate potassium < 2 mmol/L was associated with lower mortality compared with no use. This heterogeneity seems to suggest that it is impossible to select one ideal dialysate potassium concentration, and that the dialysate potassium prescription needs to be personalized, as proposed by others previously. The data by Mercadal et al. confirm this impression, because centres that used more dialysate potassium concentrations had lower mortality rates. A limitation of the study by Mercadal et al. was that serum potassium measurements were not included, and that therefore analysis of the dialysate–serum potassium gradient was not possible. That aside, Mercadal et al. and others have called to change the practice of 'the regrettable routine use of a single dialysate potassium concentration'. Equally regrettable is the fact that the evidence for a positive effect of a more personalized approach has not yet reached clinical practice. Redaelli et al. performed a randomized cross-over trial to compare a fixed dialysate potassium concentration with a strategy during which the dialysate potassium concentration was adjusted to obtain a constant dialysate–serum potassium gradient. The latter approach reduced the arrhythmogenic effect of a fixed dialysate potassium concentration. It is important to emphasize that not only low dialysate potassium but also low calcium and magnesium contribute to this arrhythmogenic effect. In addition to the arrhythmogenic effect, a lower dialysate potassium concentration may also affect blood pressure during and after dialysis (Figure 1). Gabutti et al. showed that the risk of intra-dialysis hypotension was inversely correlated to the potassium concentration in the dialysate. Conversely, dialysate potassium concentrations of 1 and 2 mmol/L produce 'rebound hypertension' 1 h after dialysis, a phenomenon that was not observed with a dialysate potassium concentration of 3 mmol/L. In summary, the inclination to lower the dialysate potassium concentration in haemodialysis patients with recurring hyperkalaemia may in itself be harmful by imposing a higher dialysate–serum potassium gradient. In this era of artificial intelligence, it must be feasible to design more individualized dialysate potassium prescriptions that receive feedback from serial measurements of serum potassium. Indeed, mathematical modelling of potassium profiling has been proposed and may benefit from emerging technologies using in-line monitoring of potassium with optical ion-selective microsensors. Because less potassium is removed with a more constant dialysate–serum potassium gradient, this also implies that potassium management in haemodialysis patients should not solely rely on the dialysate potassium concentration.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1162h5y3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that has acquired pandemic dimensions, affecting more than 38 million people worldwide. 1 In addition, the progressive nature of HF makes it a leading cause of hospitalization, due to the deleterious effects of sustained neurohormonal activation and comorbidities. 2 Electrolytic disturbances, most usually of potassium levels, very often accompany HF, are a hindrance to the optimization of medication and impose a further burden on the patient. Since potassium plays a major role in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias, dyskalemia is an important clinical problem that is associated with significant life‐threatening complications. 3, 4 Although the definition is not consistent always, hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L and can be further classified as mild (5.6‐6.0 mEq/L), moderate (6.1‐7.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 7.0 mEq/L). Potassium secretion is highly dependent on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and renal perfusion, as well as sodium availability to the distal nephron. Hyperkalemia represents both a direct risk for cardiovascular morbidity and a potential biomarker of adverse prognosis and disease severity. Patients with HF are at particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely to reflect some medical comorbidity, especially renal dysfunction. In addition, it is one of the most common factors that impede the optimum pharmaceutical approach to HF, leading to underuse of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), which are the drugs that offer the most help and have changed the outcomes of HF patients. 5 Unfortunately, some additional independent risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced age and renal insufficiency, that exacerbate all‐cause and in‐hospital mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients, also further increase the risk of hyperkalemia. At the opposite end of the scale is hypokalemia, which can also be observed in HF patients and can increase the risk of mortality, mainly via arrhythmogenic complications. 6, 7, 8 Thus, both high and low potassium levels are unacceptable in HF patients. Data from the literature highlight the need for careful potassium monitoring, especially in the presence of comorbidities, with special emphasis being placed on patients with a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 5

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

DIETARY POTASSIUM INTAKE

Rather than binding potassium after dietary intake, a more direct strategy against hyperkalaemia could be to prescribe a low potassium diet (Figure 1). In patients with a tendency to develop hyperkalaemia, a dietary potassium intake of < 3 g/day (< 77 mmol/day) is recommended. Of note, the general population and patients with CKD already consume a relatively low potassium diet. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of lower and higher dietary potassium intake in patients with CKD (including patients treated with dialysis) on serum potassium and mortality. This review found that a potassium-restricted diet (1295 mg/day) lowered serum potassium by 0.22 mmol/L compared with an unrestricted — but still low potassium — diet (1570 mg/day). Furthermore, a low potassium diet (1670 mg/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in mortality hazard compared with higher dietary potassium intake (4414 mg/day). However, the evidence to support these effects was classified as very low-quality evidence. A small randomized controlled trial analysed the effect of dietary potassium restriction for 2 years on nerve function in patients with CKD Stage G3 or G4. The intervention caused modest but significant reductions in dietary potassium intake (3272 versus 3874 g/day) and serum potassium (4.6 versus 4.8 mmol/L), which was sufficient to improve the total neuropathy score (the primary outcome). This study illustrates that dietary potassium restriction may have benefits beyond lowering serum potassium, although the study had several limitations. At the same time, emerging evidence indicates that higher dietary potassium intake may be beneficial, even for patients with CKD. To date, 11 cohort studies analysed the association between urinary potassium excretion (as a proxy for dietary intake) and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD. Although the majority of these studies showed that a higher urinary potassium excretion was associated with a lower risk of adverse kidney outcomes or mortality, this was not a consistent finding. To address the possibility of a causal link between dietary potassium depletion and kidney outcomes, we are currently conducting a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial with potassium supplementation in patients with CKD. Higher dietary potassium intake has been shown to reduce blood pressure and the risk of stroke in subjects without CKD and prevents kidney damage in experimental models of CKD. Because a high potassium diet usually consists of fruits and vegetables, potassium-independent factors such as low animal protein, high-fiber content and an alkaline diet may also play a role. Indeed, a randomized clinical trial showed that both alkali treatment and fruits and vegetables can reduce kidney injury in patients with CKD. To take advantage of these effects, the need for clinical trials comparing a potassium-restricted diet with the combination of a potassium-liberalized diet and potassium binders in patients treated with haemodialysis has recently been emphasized.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^115m9UAn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The regulation of potassium homoeostasis changes dramatically in patients with kidney failure who are treated by haemodialysis. With the kidney largely out of the equation, haemodialysis patients rely on potassium removal during each dialysis session to prevent hyperkalaemia. In addition, the gut becomes an important accessory organ for potassium excretion. Despite these adaptations, hyperkalaemia (defined as serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L) remains a common electrolyte disorder occurring in approximately 14% of haemodialysis patients. Although seemingly counterintuitive, a minority of haemodialysis patients is hypokalaemic (serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L), and this is usually related to poor dietary intake. The target serum potassium in haemodialysis is unknown, but one study suggests that a serum potassium between 4.6 and 5.3 mmol/L is associated with the greatest survival. Of note, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), this optimal serum potassium range seems to be lower (4.0–4.5 mmol/L). Furthermore, when analysing serum potassium in haemodialysis patients, it is important to factor in when it was measured (after the long or short interdialytic interval, time of day and seasonality), and to analyse serial measurements to exclude transient hyperkalemia. Nephrologists can manage potassium balance in haemodialysis patients in three ways, including (i) by modifying the dialysate potassium concentration, (ii) by prescribing potassium binders and (iii) by modifying dietary potassium intake (Figure 1). The reason to implement such interventions is usually driven by recurring predialysis hyperkalaemia and the related risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Although the prevention of acute complications is important, another relevant question is how these interventions affect long-term outcomes in haemodialysis patients. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of randomized controlled trials in this area. Therefore, instead, we need to rely on registries, which often provide useful insights into how real-world management influences long-term outcomes. A good example of such a registry is the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN). In this issue, Mercadal et al. use this registry to analyse the effect of prescription patterns of dialysate potassium and potassium binders on survival in over 25 000 patients who started haemodialysis in 2010–13 and were followed until the end of 2014. Using Cox proportional hazard models, the investigators show that dialysis centres that used two or three dialysate potassium concentrations had a lower mortality risk than centres that only used one formula. In addition, patients who used the potassium binder sodium or calcium polystyrene sulphonate in a dose of 4–8 or ≥ 8 g/day had a lower mortality risk than patients who did not use potassium binders. Conversely, patients who used potassium binders in a dose < 4 g/day had a higher mortality risk. Oral potassium supplements, which were used in 6% of patients, were not associated with a survival benefit. What does this study teach us on potassium management in haemodialysis patients and what are the implications for clinical practice?

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### Can succinylcholine be used safely in hyperkalemic patients? [^113F6s2d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The use of succinylcholine in hyperkalemic patients (serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L) is often viewed as relatively contraindicated, although there are no systematic data to define what preoperative potassium level is safe. We retrospectively reviewed more than 40,000 general anesthetics administered over 70 mo in which succinylcholine was given at the induction. This search yielded 38 patients with a preoperative potassium of 5.6 mEq/L or greater. Survival of the anesthetic was 100%, and no dysrhythmias or other major morbidity were documented upon manual review of the intraoperative automated record keeper charts or the patient medical records. These data allow a 95% confidence interval assessment of maximal risk for an event of 7.9%, which is not negligible, but which almost certainly grossly overestimates the risk for patients with moderately increased potassium levels. A prospective trial to definitively assess the safety margin for succinylcholine use in hyperkalemic patients would be difficult. Therefore, these data, taken in the context of a compelling case for rapid intubating conditions without long-term paralysis, suggest safety in succinylcholine use in patients with modest hyperkalemia.

Implications

In a review of more than 40,000 general anesthetics in which succinylcholine was given at induction, 38 patients had a preoperative potassium of 5.6 mEq/L or greater. All patients survived the anesthetic with no dysrhythmias or other major morbidity documented. Succinylcholine may be appropriate and safe for use in certain patients with moderate hyperkalemia.

### Serum potassium influencing interacting drugs: risk-modifying strategies also needed at discontinuation [^114sDAGP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although the discontinuation of a medication may have important clinical consequences, there is generally much less attention given to medication surveillance when a drug is stopped than when it is started.

Objective

To investigate the consequences on serum potassium levels of discontinuing a drug that increases the serum potassium level (PID↑) and a drug that decreases the serum potassium level (PLD↓) in patients taking both.

Methods

Patients who were hospitalized in the University Medical Centre Utrecht in 2004–2009 and were using both a PID↑ and a PLD↓ were included when one of these drugs was discontinued during hospitalization. Serum potassium levels measured before (potassium(1)) and after (potassium(2)) discontinuation were compared in patients who stopped the PLD↓ and in patients who stopped the PID↑.

Results

In the group of patients who stopped the PLD↓ (ie, continued the PID↑), mean serum potassium levels increased 0.19 mEq/L (range -0.9 to 1.8 mEq/L). After discontinuation of the PLD↓, serum potassium levels increased in 91 (59%) patients. Five patients (3.2%) developed hyperkalemia (potassium(2) > 5.5 mEq/L). In the group of patients who stopped the PID↑ (ie, continued the PLD↓), mean serum potassium levels decreased 0.40 mEq/L (range -2.6 to 0.7 mEq/L). Serum potassium levels decreased in 61 (70%) patients after discontinuation of the PID↑. Fifteen patients (17%) developed hypokalemia (potassium(2) < 3.5 mEq/L). Results were not influenced by length of stay, age, sex, renal function, and type of medication discontinued.

Conclusions

The effects of serum potassium-influencing drugs need to be monitored not only after starting but also after stopping the medication. The same may hold true for the effects of other drugs. Clinical risk management should therefore focus on the risks not only when new medication is prescribed, but also when medication is stopped.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disturbances — potassium and magnesium management in ventricular arrhythmias: Potassium (and magnesium) salts are useful in treating ventricular arrhythmias secondary to hypokalemia (or hypomagnesemia) resulting from diuretic use in patients with structurally normal hearts (Level of Evidence: B). Class IIa guidance states it is reasonable to maintain serum potassium levels above 4.0 mM/L in any patient with documented life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and a structurally normal heart (Level of Evidence: C) and to maintain serum potassium levels above 4.0 mM/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) (Level of Evidence: B). Magnesium salts can be beneficial in the management of ventricular tachycardia (VT) secondary to digoxin toxicity in patients with structurally normal hearts (Level of Evidence: B). Supporting context notes that hypokalemia (less than 3.5 mM) and hypomagnesemia are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), hypomagnesemia is classically associated with polymorphic VT or torsades de pointes and may respond to intravenous magnesium, and significant hypokalemia can prolong the QT interval.

### Acute treatment of hyperkalemia… [^117LTsys]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best acute treatment of an elevated serum potassium level. Evidence-Based Answer According to disease-oriented evidence, insulin and intravenous glucose, inhaled albuterol, and dialysis are the best treatment options; the first two may be given in combination. Bicarbonate or resins are not recommended for routine use, particularly without one of the more effective agents listed above. Practice Pointers Acute treatment of hyperkalemia falls into the still considerable "widely used but little studied" category of medical interventions. No study has reported outcomes that matter to patients, such as the likelihood of death or cardiac arrhythmias. The available literature focuses largely on the ability of interventions to lower serum potassium levels acutely. The Cochrane review by Mahoney and colleagues applies to patients with a significantly elevated potassium level.

Each patient acts as his or her own control, so it is possible to have a much smaller sample size and still obtain statistically significant results. Only four studies used blinding, and only four concealed allocation to treatment groups adequately. Most of the patients studied had acute or chronic renal failure and were receiving hemodialysis. Nebulized or inhaled albuterol proved effective; a dose of 20 mg was more effective than 10 mg in lowering potassium levels, and both doses were better than placebo. Intravenous albuterol and levalbuterol were no more effective than inhaled albuterol. The combination of insulin with intravenous glucose was effective, as was dialysis. In one study, the combination of insulin, glucose, and inhaled albuterol was more effective than insulin and glucose alone. Although potassium-binding polystyrene resins such as Kayexalate are widely used, only one study evaluated their effectiveness in the acute setting, and they proved ineffective.

Adding bicarbonate to insulin and glucose was helpful in one study but not in another. A review of the National Guideline Clearinghouse Website did not identify any practice guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. Recommendations from textbooks vary considerably. For example, Griffith's 5-Minute Clinical Consult 2005 1 recommends dextrose and insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and polystyrene resins but does not mention inhaled beta agonists.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111LZUAQ]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of hyperkalemia during antihypertensive treatment with esaxerenone

Clinical data from phase III studies showed that serum potassium levels returned to normal after withdrawal of esaxerenone, and no additional treatment was required. In the J301 and J302 studies, esaxerenone treatment was discontinued in five and four patients, respectively, with serum potassium measurements of ≥ 6.0 or ≥ 5.5 mEq/L on two consecutive occasions. In all patients, potassium levels normalized within 28 days.

Available clinical study data can be used to develop a profile of patients at higher risk of developing hyperkalemia, allowing appropriate selection of patients for esaxerenone therapy. Based on patient factors such as lower renal function (reduced eGFR, albuminuria) and older age, gradually increasing the esaxerenone dosage from 1.25 to 2.5–5 mg/day has been suggested as a good strategy to reduce the risk of developing hyperkalemia compared with starting treatment at a fixed dosage.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K + > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Current international guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and there is a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations in relation to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists, covering monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K + binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that K + binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed in areas including whether reduced-K + diets or treatment with K + binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^112Sp5EZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111Fa4pA]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^112fayVP]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — electrolyte management during refeeding in at-risk adults — advises to "Check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition" and to "Monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients. May be more frequent based on clinical picture". It directs to "Replete low electrolytes based on established standards of care" and notes "No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal". If electrolytes "become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during the initiation of nutrition", it advises to "decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation", with the caveat that "cessation of nutrition support may be necessary when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously".

### Potassium food additives and dietary management of serum potassium: proposed best-practice recommendations [^11512hWd]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The contribution of potassium food additives to total dietary potassium intake is unknown. This poses challenges for individuals living with kidney disease who may need to monitor their potassium intake. Additionally, different countries have varying regulations regarding the reporting of dietary potassium content in foods. This article examines the potential of published food databases to assist clinicians in helping individuals with kidney disease manage their serum potassium levels. It uses the United States Department of Agriculture's Branded Food Products Database as an example. Evidence for potassium additive content in database entries, along with their bioavailability, is discussed, and best-practice recommendations are made based on current evidence. Clinical practice and future research priorities are suggested.

### Utilization of potassium binders for the management of hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease: a position statement by US nephrologists [^113fXfCY]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Two potassium (K +) binders-patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate-are recommended by international guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. There is, however, no universally accepted best practice for how to appropriately utilize K + binders in the long-term clinical management of CKD. A panel of eight US-based nephrologists convened in October 2022 to develop a consensus statement regarding utilizing K + binders in clinical practice to help manage patients with nonemergent, persistent/recurrent hyperkalemia in CKD. Consensus was reached on the following topics: (1) identifying risk factors for hyperkalemia; (2) serum K + monitoring before and during K + binder use; (3) utilizing K + binders in patients receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and dialysis; and (4) when to initiate K + binders and their duration of use. These consensus statements for the use of K + binders may assist the nephrology community in optimizing management of hyperkalemia in patients across the spectrum of CKD.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: probably not O"K" [^111b1mZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is routinely defined as a serum potassium level > 5 mmol/L and is a common occurrence in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF). For example, prior work has demonstrated that hyperkalemia is present in ≈9% of patients admitted for acute HF, 1 and the total annual charges for Medicare admissions related to a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia are substantial, with estimates as high as $697 million in 2011. 2 Elevated potassium levels may affect the activity of myocardial potassium channels, leading to more rapid membrane depolarization. The downstream effects of this may translate into slower myocardial electrical conduction, resulting in malignant tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Hyperkalemia, especially with potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L, has been consistently linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF. 3, 4 Recent estimates from the PARADIGM‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial suggest the incidence of hyperkalemia in a trial population receiving treatment with renin‐angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) was ≈16% over a median follow‐up time of 27 months, despite a highly selected and carefully monitored clinical trial population. 5 Similarly, in a large cohort from the United Kingdom of 19 194 patients with new‐onset HF, 11% developed hyperkalemia during a 4‐year follow‐up. 6 Multiple prior analyses of clinical trials and population‐based studies identify renal dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) and RASi as major risk factors for hyperkalemia. Given that 5.7 million people in the United States alone have HF and this number is increasing, there is an overwhelming number of patients at risk for hyperkalemia and associated adverse events. 7 Patients with HF are at a particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely reflective of their medical comorbidity, including renal dysfunction. In addition, several of the current medical therapies for the management of HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) add to this risk. These include cornerstone therapies, such as the following: (1) RASi, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor inhibitors with or without neprilysin inhibition; and (2) MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone. Whether a consequence of a real or perceived risk of hyperkalemia, evidence supports that these therapies are underused, and when used there is suboptimal dose titration. 8, 9 Although there are data to support that mild hyperkalemia (potassium level, 5–5.5 mmol/L) in the setting of RASi and MRA therapy might not be associated with poor clinical outcomes, hyperkalemia in HF remains a major clinical dilemma. 3, 10

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines — general measures for patients with current or prior symptoms of heart failure: Moderate sodium restriction with daily weight measurement is indicated to permit effective use of diuretic drugs, and immunization with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines may reduce respiratory infection risk; physical activity should be encouraged except during acute exacerbations or suspected myocarditis. Three classes of drugs can exacerbate HF and should be avoided in most patients — antiarrhythmic agents (with only amiodarone and dofetilide shown not to adversely affect survival), calcium channel blockers (with only the vasoselective ones shown not to adversely affect survival), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can cause sodium retention, peripheral vasoconstriction, and attenuate the efficacy and enhance the toxicity of diuretics and ACEIs. Patients with HF should be monitored carefully for changes in serum potassium, every effort should be made to prevent hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, and many experts believe serum potassium concentrations should be targeted in the 4.0 to 5.0 mmol per liter range; in some patients deficits may require supplementation of magnesium and potassium, whereas in others (particularly those taking ACEIs alone or with aldosterone antagonists) routine potassium salts may be unnecessary and potentially deleterious. Patient education and close supervision, including surveillance by the patient and family, can reduce nonadherence and enable early detection of changes in body weight or clinical status to allow treatments that can prevent clinical deterioration.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes — electrolyte optimization and medication precautions include that intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes of torsades de pointes without necessarily shortening QT, repeated doses may be needed, and the risk of magnesium toxicity is very small with the doses usually used to treat torsades de pointes, 1 to 2 g intravenously; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 mEq/L and 5 mEq/L shortens QT and may reduce the chance of recurrent torsades de pointes. QT-prolonging medications are not used in patients with congenital or acquired long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative or the benefit greatly exceeds the risk, episodes of torsades de pointes can be precipitated by exposure to a QT-prolonging medication with increased risk when the QT is already prolonged from genetic and clinical risk factors, and implicated medication classes include antiarrhythmics, antihistamines, antibiotics, antifungals, antidepressants, antipsychotics, opiates, and anticancer agents.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life threatening.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^111y82gd]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

A recent study indicates that infusing 1 mmol/kg of potassium chloride over 1–2 h is likely safe for young children in intensive care units with mild to moderate hypokalemia, however, those with severe hypokalemia may require additional supplementation. When administering potassium via peripheral veins, the concentration should not exceed 40 mmol/L to prevent phlebitis and pain. For higher concentrations, central venous lines are recommended, however, this does not apply to life-threatening conditions. Importantly, potassium dextrose-containing solutions must be avoided, as dextrose stimulates insulin secretion and can potentially worsen hypokalemia. Additionally, it is important when removing dextrose from intravenous fluids in ill children not eating as this can also increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to manage potential hypoglycemia in these patients. Potassium replacement should be scaled back when the serum potassium concentration exceeds 3.5 mmol/L. During this replacement approach, serum potassium checks are recommended every 1–2 h. Continuous ECG monitoring is essential, along with regular monitoring of blood gases and potassium levels. Additionally, concurrent hypomagnesemia in children with hypokalemia requires attention as it contributes to potassium wasting and lowers tubular potassium reabsorption. Management should focus on correcting low magnesium levels since hypokalemia is refractory until magnesium levels are within the range of 0.7–1 mmol/L. In specific conditions such as correcting electrolyte imbalances or acid–base disorders, alternative forms of potassium supplementation may be considered. These scenarios include potassium phosphate in diabetic ketoacidosis or potassium citrate in renal tubular acidosis.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

### Hypokalemia / hyperkalemia and hyponatremia / hypernatremia [^115uaRV3]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Recommendations concerning aldosterone antagonists — scope, thresholds, and combination cautions — state that "the addition of low-dose aldosterone antagonists should be considered" in carefully selected patients with moderately severe or severe heart failure or "LV dysfunction early after MI". Trial enrollment generally excluded patients with creatinine "in excess of 2.5 mg per dL", and "few patients were actually enrolled with serum creatinine levels over 1.5 mg per dL"; in the MI trial, the "average serum creatinine" was "1.1 mg per dL, above which there was no demonstrable benefit for survival". To minimize life-threatening hyperkalemia, patients "should have initial serum creatinine less than 2.0 to 2.5 mg per dL" and "serum potassium less than 5.0 mEq per dL". For some with mild to moderate symptoms, "it may be reasonable to consider" adding aldosterone antagonists to loop diuretics, but the committee notes "insufficient data or experience to provide a specific or strong recommendation", and "it is not currently recommended" to give aldosterone antagonists without other concomitant diuretic therapy in chronic HF. Use with both ACEIs and ARBs is cautioned, as "this combination cannot be recommended".
