## Question

What is the best treatment for scalp psoriasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best treatment for scalp psoriasis is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "best" in terms of efficacy, safety, durability, and patient-centered outcomes. Then, I should verify disease severity and location-specific considerations that shift the treatment ladder. Next, I will appraise the evidence hierarchy for topical therapies, followed by systemic and biologic options. After that, I need to integrate guideline recommendations and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and state a cautious conclusion with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framing, because "best" depends on how severe the scalp disease is and how it impacts quality of life. Scalp psoriasis is common, often chronic, and can be disproportionately burdensome despite small surface area, so severity should incorporate both objective measures and patient-reported impact, including itch, sleep disturbance, and psychosocial distress, not just BSA or PASI thresholds [^ca62392d] [^c4d0500e].

> I will now examine topical therapy as first-line for most patients, since guidelines and high-quality evidence consistently support topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues as foundational therapy for scalp disease. Wait, let me verify the comparative efficacy signals: multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show that potent or very potent corticosteroids outperform vitamin D monotherapy, and fixed-dose combinations of calcipotriene plus betamethasone outperform either component alone, with meaningful absolute differences and favorable NNTs, though the incremental benefit of the combination over steroid alone is modest in some analyses [^40bca43a] [^2a892d90] [^61040aca] [^13a3c082].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monotherapy versus combination. I should double-check the magnitude of benefit. The Cochrane review indicates that the two-compound combination is superior to steroid monotherapy for clearance and response, but the additional benefit is small, and steroid monotherapy remains highly effective and safe for short-term use, which supports either approach depending on access, cost, and tolerability considerations [^40bca43a] [^2a892d90].

> Next, I should review formulation and vehicle, because adherence and cosmetic acceptability drive real-world outcomes in hair-bearing scalp. Foam, solution, spray, and shampoo vehicles improve usability compared with creams or ointments, and newer options like roflumilast foam and fixed-combination gels or suspensions can enhance adherence and outcomes. I need to ensure I cite the strongest data: roflumilast 0.3% foam achieved significantly higher scalp IGA success than vehicle in phase 3, with early itch improvement, and calcipotriene foam has RCT-proven benefit versus vehicle in scalp psoriasis [^2299c972] [^44b04a0d].

> Let me consider steroid potency and safety. Very potent corticosteroids such as clobetasol in shampoo or spray formulations are effective for induction, but I should confirm duration limits to mitigate atrophy risk. Guidelines and labeling support short courses, typically up to 2–4 weeks, with reassessment and rotation or taper to avoid chronic steroid exposure, and this risk–benefit balance is acceptable when used intermittently [^d1891b90] [^6887db52].

> For patients with more extensive scalp disease or high-impact symptoms despite optimized topicals, I need to check escalation pathways. Targeted phototherapy with excimer laser or light is a reasonable intermediate option with supportive guideline endorsement and evidence of efficacy in localized scalp disease, though access and cumulative dose considerations apply [^4dd1fd32] [^7c263160].

> Now, I should review systemic therapy thresholds. Severe scalp psoriasis can justify systemic therapy even when BSA is low, given disproportionate QoL impact, so I should confirm that guidelines endorse systemic agents for high-burden scalp disease. Conventional options like methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin are used off-label for scalp-dominant disease, but I need to emphasize that high-quality scalp-specific RCTs are sparse and selection should be individualized to comorbidity and monitoring capacity [^f00688e6] [^3e92af03].

> Biologics are where scalp-specific efficacy is most compelling, so I will examine the highest-quality data. Anti-IL-17 agents such as secukinumab and ixekizumab have prospective RCTs and guideline support demonstrating robust scalp clearance, with ixekizumab showing high rates of complete scalp resolution in some analyses. Anti-IL-23 agents like guselkumab and tildrakizumab also show excellent scalp outcomes in RCTs and real-world cohorts, and dual IL-17A/F inhibition with bimekizumab appears particularly effective in difficult-to-treat sites, though head-to-head scalp trials are limited and cost and access remain barriers [^d4c95cd7] [^b50a6780] [^dd7077f3] [^0529f3d1] [^36f912f5].

> But wait, what if oral small molecules are preferred to avoid injections? Apremilast has RCT-level evidence in scalp psoriasis showing sustained improvements in PSSI, itch, and QoL through 32 weeks, making it a reasonable non-biologic systemic option when biologics are not suitable or available, though gastrointestinal adverse effects can limit tolerability in some patients [^a6f3924e] [^630fc5d8].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations separately. For adolescents 12 years and older, guidelines support topical corticosteroids and calcipotriene, including fixed-dose combinations, with attention to safety and duration limits. Adolescent studies of calcipotriene plus betamethasone gel demonstrate good efficacy and tolerability, reinforcing topical-first strategies in this age group [^9b5f7478] [^fa36def1].

> Next, I should review maintenance strategies, because durability matters for "best" treatment. Evidence supports induction with daily therapy followed by step-down maintenance, such as intermittent corticosteroid or twice-weekly calcipotriene plus betamethasone, to prolong remission and reduce steroid exposure. This proactive approach is more effective than purely reactive use and should be planned from the outset [^e180f582].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while I double-check alignment with guidelines. For mild scalp psoriasis, start with a topical corticosteroid of appropriate potency for 2–4 weeks, then rotate to calcipotriene or a steroid-sparing agent for maintenance. For moderate disease or if steroid monotherapy is insufficient, use a fixed-dose calcipotriene plus betamethasone gel or suspension for 4–8 weeks, then step down to intermittent maintenance. For severe, refractory, or high-burden scalp disease, escalate to targeted phototherapy or systemic therapy, selecting among apremilast, anti-IL-17, or anti-IL-23 agents based on comorbidity, speed of response desired, and access, with shared decision-making about risks, benefits, and costs [^d1891b90] [^89fe6e5f] [^4dd1fd32] [^f00688e6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to call the fixed-dose calcipotriene plus betamethasone combination "the best" across the board, but I should correct that to be more precise. The highest-quality evidence shows that potent or very potent corticosteroids are the most effective topical monotherapy, the two-compound combination offers a modest incremental benefit over steroid alone, and biologics provide the highest likelihood of complete and durable scalp clearance in appropriate candidates, so "best" must be individualized by severity, access, and patient preferences rather than a single universal answer [^40bca43a] [^2a892d90] [^d4c95cd7] [^dd7077f3].

> Final answer, with caveats: for most patients with scalp psoriasis, a potent topical corticosteroid used intermittently is the most cost-effective and evidence-based first-line therapy. For enhanced efficacy and tolerability, a fixed-dose calcipotriene plus betamethasone gel or suspension is preferred, and for severe or refractory disease, anti-IL-17 or anti-IL-23 biologics achieve the highest rates of scalp clearance and should be considered when topical strategies fail or are impractical, all within a maintenance framework to sustain response and minimize adverse effects [^40bca43a] [^89fe6e5f] [^d4c95cd7] [^dd7077f3] [^e180f582].

---

The best treatment for scalp psoriasis is **topical corticosteroids** (especially very potent agents like clobetasol) [^40bca43a] as first-line therapy for rapid symptom control, with **calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate** [^89fe6e5f] as the preferred fixed-dose combination for enhanced efficacy and tolerability [^61040aca]. For refractory or severe disease, **biologics** (ixekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab, risankizumab) [^67dce1f9] [^2c732cbd] [^9c78f0bd] or apremilast [^a6f3924e] are effective options [^04690473]. Excimer laser or targeted UVB phototherapy [^4dd1fd32] is a useful alternative when topical therapy is insufficient or not tolerated [^7c263160]. Treatment should be individualized based on severity, patient preference, and access, with attention to adherence and safety [^d1891b90].

---

## Topical therapies

Topical therapies are **first-line** for scalp psoriasis because of their efficacy, safety, and accessibility [^d1891b90].

---

### Topical corticosteroids

- **First-line therapy**: High- or very-high-potency corticosteroids (e.g. clobetasol propionate 0.05%) are recommended for initial and maintenance therapy [^d1891b90] [^8ac409c1].
- **Efficacy**: Rapid improvement in erythema, scaling, and pruritus; clobetasol spray achieved 85% success (clear or almost clear) at 4 weeks in RCTs [^a0c7f665].
- **Safety**: Short-term use (≤ 4 weeks) is generally safe; monitor for local adverse effects (atrophy, telangiectasia, folliculitis) [^d1891b90].

---

### Vitamin D analogues

Calcipotriene (calcipotriol) is effective and often combined with corticosteroids to enhance efficacy and reduce steroid exposure [^31c739b0]. Calcipotriene foam is **well tolerated and effective** in scalp psoriasis [^44b04a0d].

---

### Fixed-dose combination therapy

Calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate gel is the **most effective topical therapy** [^31783709], with superior efficacy to either component alone and good tolerability [^61040aca] [^13a3c082]. Guidelines recommend use for 4–12 weeks in mild-to-moderate scalp psoriasis [^89fe6e5f] [^0bc5e171].

---

### Keratolytic agents

Salicylic acid 6% foam is effective for **reducing scale** and enhancing penetration of other topicals; it is well tolerated and can be used alone or with corticosteroids [^a2c26126].

---

## Phototherapy

Phototherapy is a **valuable alternative** when topical therapy is insufficient or not tolerated [^4dd1fd32].

Excimer laser/targeted UVB is effective for scalp psoriasis, with **70% of patients achieving PASI 75** in meta-analyses [^7c263160]. It is administered 2–3 times weekly, with erythema and burning as common adverse effects [^7c263160].

---

## Systemic therapies

Systemic therapies are indicated for **moderate-to-severe or refractory scalp psoriasis** [^f00688e6].

---

### Biologic agents

- **IL-17 inhibitors**: Secukinumab and ixekizumab are highly effective for scalp psoriasis, with rapid onset and high clearance rates [^d4c95cd7] [^b50a6780].
- **IL-23 inhibitors**: Guselkumab and risankizumab provide durable scalp clearance and are recommended for moderate-to-severe disease [^9c78f0bd] [^38a157bd].
- **TNF-α inhibitors**: Etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab are effective options, particularly with psoriatic arthritis [^6c1188b6] [^34c695c8].

---

### Oral systemic agents

Methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine are effective but have **significant adverse effects** and require monitoring [^notfound]. Apremilast is effective and well tolerated for scalp psoriasis, with sustained improvements in itch and quality of life [^a6f3924e] [^630fc5d8].

---

## Emerging therapies

Roflumilast foam 0.3% is a **new topical PDE4 inhibitor** with promising efficacy and tolerability in scalp psoriasis [^2299c972] [^f0d63eeb].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

- **Severity and extent**: Mild disease is managed with topicals; moderate-to-severe or refractory disease may require phototherapy or systemic therapy [^d1891b90] [^f00688e6].
- **Patient preference**: Formulation, ease of application, and cosmetic acceptability affect adherence and outcomes [^d4d391ac].
- **Comorbidities**: Psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome influence systemic therapy selection [^63845e92].
- **Cost and access**: Biologics are highly effective but costly; access and insurance coverage vary [^3e92af03].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Topical corticosteroids (high or very high potency) or calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate gel for 4–12 weeks [^d1891b90] [^89fe6e5f].
- **Maintenance**: Intermittent topical therapy or rotational regimens to minimize adverse effects [^e180f582].
- **Refractory disease**: Biologics (IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors) or apremilast for moderate-to-severe or refractory cases [^67dce1f9] [^a6f3924e].
- **Alternative therapy**: Excimer laser or targeted UVB phototherapy for patients unable to use or tolerate topicals [^4dd1fd32].

The best treatment for scalp psoriasis is **individualized**, with topical corticosteroids or calcipotriene plus betamethasone as first-line therapy, and biologics or apremilast for refractory disease.

An estimated 2% of the UK population has psoriasis. For many patients this affects the scalp. Particular challenges in managing scalp psoriasis include choosing an appropriate treatment option, difficulties of applying topical treatments and deciding how to treat severe disease. Moreover, there is a lack of good-quality evidence on which to base treatment decisions. Here, we offer some practical advice, taking into account the available evidence.

### Topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis of the scalp: a systematic review [^4e5b0a93]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis and is characterized by redness, thickness and scaling. First-line management is with topical treatments.

Objectives

Our objective was to establish the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of topical treatments for people with chronic plaque psoriasis of the scalp, assessing placebo-controlled trials of all treatments and head-to-head trials that assessed vitamin D analogues.

Methods

As part of a Cochrane review of topical treatments for psoriasis, we systematically searched electronic databases for randomized controlled trials. The review included 26 randomized controlled trials of treatments for psoriasis of the scalp with 8020 participants. Trials used several measures to assess changes in psoriasis severity: these were combined using the standardized mean difference metric and interpreted by reporting as a six-point global improvement score.

Results

On effectiveness grounds, very potent or potent steroid treatments should be preferred to vitamin D3 analogue with approximately an average 10% additional improvement on a six-point scale. Vitamin D3 analogue combined with potent steroid appears slightly more effective than potent steroid monotherapy (3% additional improvement on a six-point scale). Rates of withdrawal from treatment and adverse events in trials were generally low and similar to those for placebo. There remains uncertainty about the atrophic potential of corticosteroid treatments for scalp psoriasis.

Conclusions

Corticosteroids are more effective than vitamin D analogues and similarly tolerated. However, further research is needed to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.

### Therapeutic update of biologics and small molecules for scalp psoriasis: a systematic review [^04690473]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Scalp psoriasis represents the most common difficult-to-treat area in psoriasis patients. Its presence is linked to severe discomfort and impairment of quality of life given the associated symptoms (most of all, scaling and pruritus) and the location in a highly visible area, thus a prompt treatment is required. Its management may be challenging as the scalp is quite sensitive to long-term treatment with topical corticosteroids and usually resistant to topical and systemic agents. Likely, the currently available therapeutic armamentarium has been enriched with biologicals and small molecules that revolutionized psoriasis treatment and that of scalp psoriasis. Nevertheless, the lack of international dedicated guidelines pushed us to perform a comprehensive review on the efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecules on scalp psoriasis with the aim to put the basis for a therapeutic algorithm. After reviewing all the available evidence on the short-term and long-term efficacy of biologics and small molecules on scalp psoriasis the use of the newest biologics (anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-23) seems to be linked to the highest clinical performances in controlling scalp psoriasis. However, head-to-head comparisons between different biologics or biologics and small molecules are lacking. Hence, treatment selection should always be individualized.

### Treatment of severe scalp psoriasis: from the medical board of the National Psoriasis Foundation [^6a281384]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The scalp is the most commonly affected part of the body in patients with psoriasis. Signs and symptoms of scalp psoriasis vary significantly for individual patients.

Objective

A task force of the National Psoriasis Foundation was convened to evaluate treatment options. Our aim was to achieve a consensus for scalp psoriasis therapy.

Methods

Reports in the medical literature were reviewed regarding scalp psoriasis therapy.

Limitations

There is a paucity of evidence-based and double-blind studies in the treatment of scalp psoriasis particularly for long-term therapy. Many of the studies in scalp psoriasis were designed to attain Food and Drug Administration approval for a medication and not to provide treatment guidance.

Conclusions

The recommended short-term or intermittent therapy for scalp psoriasis is topical corticosteroids. The primary alternatives are topical retinoids, vitamin D analogues, and salicylic acid. Combination therapy has many advantages. The choice of an appropriate vehicle is crucial to increase patient compliance. While scalp psoriasis can often be adequately treated with topical therapy, recalcitrant disease may require more aggressive approaches, including systemic agents.

### Topical treatments for scalp psoriasis [^40bca43a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with chronic plaque psoriasis often have lesions on the scalp. Hair makes the scalp difficult to treat and the adjacent facial skin is particularly sensitive to topical treatments.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical treatments for scalp psoriasis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to August 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, screened abstracts of six psoriasis-specific conferences and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel-group, cross-over or within-patient design of topical treatments for people of all ages with scalp psoriasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment. Disagreements were settled by reference to a third author. To assess the quality of evidence, we focused on the following outcomes: 'clearance' or 'response' as assessed by the investigator global assessment (IGA), improvement in quality of life, adverse events requiring withdrawal of treatment and 'response' as assessed by the patient global assessment (PGA). We expressed the results of the single studies as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. If studies were sufficiently homogeneous, we meta-analysed the data by using the random-effects model. Where it was not possible to calculate a point estimate for a single study, we described the data qualitatively. We also presented the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB). We categorised topical corticosteroids according to the German classification of corticosteroid potency as mild, moderate, high and very high.

Main Results

We included 59 RCTs with a total of 11,561 participants. Thirty studies were either conducted or sponsored by the manufacturer of the study medication. The risk of bias varied considerably among the included studies. For instance, most authors did not state the randomisation method and few addressed allocation concealment. Most findings were limited to short-term treatments, since most studies were conducted for less than six months. Only one trial investigated long-term therapy (12 months). Although we found a wide variety of different interventions, we limited the grading of the quality of evidence to three major comparisons: steroid versus vitamin D, two-compound combination of steroid and vitamin D versus steroid monotherapy and versus vitamin D. In terms of clearance, as assessed by the IGA, steroids were better than vitamin D (RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.18; four studies, 2180 participants, NNTB = 8; 95% CI 7 to 11; moderate quality evidence). Statistically, the two-compound combination was superior to steroid monotherapy, however the additional benefit was small (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.36; four studies, 2474 participants, NNTB = 17; 95% CI 11 to 41; moderate quality evidence). The two-compound combination was more effective than vitamin D alone (RR 2.28; 95% CI 1.87 to 2.78; four studies, 2008 participants, NNTB = 6; 95% CI 5 to 7; high quality evidence). In terms of treatment response, as assessed by the IGA, corticosteroids were more effective than vitamin D (RR 2.09; 95% CI 1.80 to 2.41; three studies, 1827 participants; NNTB = 4; 95% CI 4 to 5; high quality evidence). The two-compound combination was better than steroid monotherapy, but the additional benefit was small (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25; three studies, 2444 participants, NNTB = 13; 95% CI 9 to 24; moderate quality evidence). It was also more effective than vitamin D alone (RR 2.31; 95% CI 1.75 to 3.04; four studies, 2222 participants, NNTB = 3; 95% CI 3 to 4; moderate quality evidence). Reporting of quality of life data was poor and data were insufficient to be included for meta-analysis. Steroids caused fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than vitamin D (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.42; four studies, 2291 participants; moderate quality evidence). The two-compound combination and steroid monotherapy did not differ in the number of adverse events leading withdrawal (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.88; three studies, 2433 participants; moderate quality evidence). The two-compound combination led to fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than vitamin D (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.36; three studies, 1970 participants; high quality evidence). No study reported the type of adverse event requiring withdrawal. In terms of treatment response, as assessed by the PGA, steroids were more effective than vitamin D (RR 1.48; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.72; three studies, 1827 participants; NNTB = 5; 95% CI 5 to 7; moderate quality evidence). Statistically, the two-compound combination was better than steroid monotherapy, however the benefit was not clinically important (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.20; two studies, 2226 participants; NNTB = 13; 95% CI 9 to 26; high quality evidence). The two-compound combination was more effective than vitamin D (RR 1.76; 95% CI 1.46 to 2.12; four studies, 2222 participants; NNTB = 4; 95% CI 3 to 6; moderate quality evidence). Common adverse events with these three interventions were local irritation, skin pain and folliculitis. Systemic adverse events were rare and probably not drug-related. In addition to the results of the major three comparisons we found that the two-compound combination, steroids and vitamin D monotherapy were more effective than the vehicle. Steroids of moderate, high and very high potency tended to be similarly effective and well tolerated. There are inherent limitations in this review concerning the evaluation of salicylic acid, tar, dithranol or other topical treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

The two-compound combination as well as corticosteroid monotherapy were more effective and safer than vitamin D monotherapy. Given the similar safety profile and only slim benefit of the two-compound combination over the steroid alone, monotherapy with generic topical steroids may be fully acceptable for short-term therapy. Future RCTs should investigate how specific therapies improve the participants' quality of life. Long-term assessments are needed (i.e. 6 to 12 months).

### Topical treatments for scalp psoriasis: summary of a cochrane systematic review [^2a892d90]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

People with chronic plaque psoriasis often have lesions on the scalp that are difficult to treat. This report is a summary of a Cochrane review on the efficacy and safety of topical treatments for scalp psoriasis. For quality-of-evidence assessment, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group approach. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS; ongoing trials; indexes of included studies and screened abstracts of six psoriasis-specific conferences up to August 2015. We included 59 RCTs, with 11 561 participants overall. Most findings were limited to short-term treatments (< 6 months). According to the clinician and patients' self-assessment, a corticosteroid-vitamin D combination (e.g. betamethasone dipropionate plus calcipotriol) and corticosteroids of high and very high potency were better than vitamin D. The two-compound combination was superior to the corticosteroid alone, but the additional benefit was small. Reporting of quality-of-life data was insufficient. The two-compound combination and corticosteroids caused fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than vitamin D. There was no difference between the two-compound combination and corticosteroid monotherapy concerning this outcome. Overall the evidence was of moderate quality. Evaluation of other topical treatments was limited. Given the comparable safety profile and only slim benefit of the two-compound combination over the corticosteroid alone, monotherapy with generic topical corticosteroids of high and very high potency may be fully acceptable for short-term therapy. More quality-of-life data and long-term assessments are needed.

### Scalp psoriasis: an overview of the disease and available therapies [^2657c421]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The scalp is one of the regions of the body most commonly affected by psoriatic lesions. While the head represents only 10 percent of the body's surface area, the consequences of scalp psoriasis are disproportionate to the area, as it can be seriously debilitating and presents social and emotional distress to the affected individual. Scalp lesions are often well-demarcated and may have thick gray or white scale; patients with scalp psoriasis frequently complain of pruritus and shedding of scale. Current treatment modalities — including phototherapy, topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogues and conventional systemic therapies — have produced unsatisfactory results for patients with moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis due to difficulties in administration to the disease site, poor compliance, toxicity and inadequate long-term efficacy. The emergence of biologic therapies as an effective modality for the treatment of plaque psoriasis may provide another option for patients suffering from plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

### Guselkumab for moderate to severe scalp psoriasis across all skin tones: cohort B of the VISIBLE randomized clinical trial [^dd7077f3]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy and safety of guselkumab for the treatment of moderate to severe scalp psoriasis in individuals with diverse skin tones?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 108 participants with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis, through 48 weeks of treatment, approximately 80% of VISIBLE Cohort B study participants achieved absent or very mild scalp disease, and approximately 70% achieved complete scalp clearance; mean percentage improvements in scalp surface area and Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index were greater than 92%. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; infections were the most common adverse events (reported in 33.3% of guselkumab-randomized participants), but no serious infections were reported.

Meaning

Guselkumab is a highly effective, durable scalp psoriasis treatment across all skin tones.

### Managing scalp psoriasis: an evidence-based review [^3e92af03]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Scalp psoriasis is commonly the initial presentation of psoriasis, and almost 80% of patients with psoriasis will eventually experience it.

Objective

Although several systematic reviews and guidelines exist, an up-to-date evidence-based review including more recent progress on the use of biologics and new oral small molecules was timely.

Methods

Of the 475 studies initially retrieved from PubMed and the 845 from Embase (up to May 2016), this review includes 27 clinical trials, four papers reporting pooled analyses of other clinical trials, ten open-label trials, one case series, and two case reports after excluding non-English literature.

Results

To our knowledge, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are conducted specifically in scalp psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids provide good effects and are usually recommended as first-line treatment. Calcipotriol-betamethasone dipropionate is well tolerated and more effective than either of its individual components. Localized phototherapy is better than generalized phototherapy on hair-bearing areas. Methotrexate, cyclosporine, fumaric acid esters, and acitretin are well-recognized agents in the treatment of psoriasis, but we found no published RCTs evaluating these agents specifically in scalp psoriasis. Biologics and new small-molecule agents show excellent effects on scalp psoriasis, but the high cost of these treatments mean they may be limited to use in extensive scalp psoriasis.

Conclusions

More controlled studies are needed for an evidence-based approach to scalp psoriasis.

### Scalp psoriasis [^2f15d376]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, debilitating disease that commonly involves the scalp. Despite a wide range of therapy options, scalp psoriasis remains difficult to treat, highlighting a long-standing unmet need for the safe and effective treatment of scalp psoriasis. Many topical therapies for scalp psoriasis are also difficult or unpleasant to apply, resulting in decreased adherence and efficacy. In brief, the high level of patient dissatisfaction with currently available treatments for psoriasis supports the need for new, effective and well-tolerated treatment options for scalp psoriasis. This article aims to review the efficacy and safety of new formulations and treatment options available to control scalp psoriasis. For example, a new formulation of calcipotriene/betamethasone scalp solution has a rapid onset of action with once daily dosing that improves compliance. The CalePso study examines the safety profile of otherwise established Clobetasol propionate (CP) shampoo 0.05%, and reports that CP shampoo is safe and efficacious in the long-term management of scalp psoriasis. A new foam formulation of coal tar is shown to be cosmetically acceptable and easier to apply.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 6. guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: case-based presentations and evidence-based conclusions [^d4d391ac]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Scalp psoriasis — treatment challenges and formulation considerations are outlined for topical therapy. Psoriasis frequently manifests initially on the scalp, and the presence of hair makes the use of ointments and cream-based products particularly difficult and messy; the recent availability of shampoo, gel, solution, oil, foam, and other formulations has allowed for easier to use and more acceptable scalp therapies. Scalp psoriasis remains one of the most frustrating, difficult to manage, and resistant forms of the disease, and this is not easily explained by poor penetration because the normal scalp has a weak barrier function compared with normal-appearing skin. Koebnerization of the scalp from repetitive scratching frequently leads to unilateral fixed, well-circumscribed hypertrophic plaques, causing further difficulties in control with resistance to therapy aggravated by poor adherence related to time restraints, frustration, and lack of clinical response.

### Topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: an abridged cochrane systematic review [^56a67e3e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis and is characterized by redness, thickness, and scaling. First-line management is with topical treatments.

Objective

We sought to undertake a Cochrane review of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis.

Methods

We systematically searched major databases for randomized controlled trials. Trials reported improvement using a range of related measures; standardized, pooled findings were translated onto a 6-point improvement scale.

Results

The review included 177 randomized controlled trials with 34,808 participants, including 26 trials of scalp psoriasis and 6 trials of inverse and/or facial psoriasis. Typical trial duration was 3 to 8 weeks. When compared with placebo (emollient base), the average improvement for vitamin-D analogues and potent corticosteroids was approximately 1 point, dithranol 1.2 points, very potent corticosteroids 1.8 points, and combined vitamin-D analogue plus steroid 1.4 points once daily and 2.2 points twice daily. However, these are indicative benefits drawn from heterogeneous trial findings. Corticosteroids were more effective than vitamin D for treating psoriasis of the scalp. For both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause skin irritation.

Limitations

Reporting of benefits, adverse effects, and safety assessment methods was often inadequate. In many comparisons, heterogeneity made the size of treatment benefit uncertain.

Conclusions

Corticosteroids are as effective as vitamin-D analogues and cause less skin irritation. However, further research is needed to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.

Psoriasis systemic therapy thresholds — although a minimum body surface area, eg, 10%, has been traditionally used as a prerequisite to starting a systemic therapy for psoriasis, severe psoriasis of the palms and soles or severe scalp psoriasis affects less than 5% of the body surface area and the significant negative affect on the quality of life of the patient makes a systemic approach to treatment appropriate.

### Treatment of scalp psoriasis [^31783709]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Scalp involvement is seen in a majority of individuals with psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune skin disease with variable phenotypes. Occasionally, isolated scalp involvement is observed; and this causes significant psychosocial morbidity. Management of scalp psoriasis is difficult, in part due to the difficulty of applying topical agents and its refractory nature. Various treatment options are available with variable efficacy. Topical agents include topical steroids, keratolytics, tar and anthralin compounds, vitamin D analogues, and vitamin A derivatives. The combination treatment of topical betamethasone and calcipotriene is the most effective topical therapy. Systemic agents include conventional agents such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and oral retinoids. Biologics offer a greater efficacy, with near complete or complete clearance of the scalp. In this article we review the published literature on adult and scalp psoriasis to highlight its treatment. Articles published in peer-reviewed journals were included for qualitative analysis of the literature, including reviews, clinical trials, case series, case reports published in the electronic database (MEDLINE/PubMed) through June 2021, cross references of respective articles, and trials from clinicaltrials.gov. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(8):833–837. doi:10.36849/JDD.6498.

### Topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis [^1c31be42]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, and it is characterised by redness, thickness, and scaling. First-line management of chronic plaque psoriasis is with topical treatments, including vitamin D analogues, topical corticosteroids, tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, relative to placebo, and to similarly compare vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) with other topical treatments.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to February 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1948), EMBASE (from 1980), Science Citation Index (from 2008), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (from 2008), BIOSIS (from 1993), Dissertation Abstracts via DialogClassic (all publication years), and Inside Conferences (all publication years). We identified ongoing and unpublished studies from the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. We checked the bibliographies of published studies and reviews for further references to relevant trials, and we contacted trialists and companies for information about newly published studies. A separate search for adverse effects was undertaken in February 2011 using MEDLINE and EMBASE (from 2005). Final update searches for both RCTs and adverse effects were undertaken in August 2012. Although it has not been possible to incorporate RCTs and adverse effects studies identified through these final searches within this review, we will incorporate these into the next update.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing active topical treatments against placebo or against vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) in people with chronic plaque psoriasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author extracted study data and assessed study quality. A second author checked these data. We routinely contacted trialists and companies for missing data. We also extracted data on withdrawals and on local and systemic adverse events. We defined long-term trials as those with a duration of at least 24 weeks.

Main Results

This update added 48 trials and provided evidence on 7 new active treatments. In total, the review included 177 randomised controlled trials, with 34,808 participants, including 26 trials of scalp psoriasis and 6 trials of inverse psoriasis, facial psoriasis, or both. The number of included studies counted by Review Manager (RevMan) is higher than these figures (190) because we entered each study reporting a placebo and an active comparison into the 'Characteristics of included studies' table as 2 studies. When used on the body, most vitamin D analogues were significantly more effective than placebo, with the standardised mean difference (SMD) ranging from -0.67 (95% CI -1.04 to -0.30; 1 study, 119 participants) for twice-daily becocalcidiol to SMD -1.66 (95% CI -2.66 to -0.67; 1 study, 11 participants) for once-daily paricalcitol. On a 6-point global improvement scale, these effects translate into 0.8 and 1.9 points, respectively. Most corticosteroids also performed better than placebo; potent corticosteroids (SMD -0.89; 95% CI -1.06 to -0.72; I² statistic = 65.1%; 14 studies, 2011 participants) had smaller benefits than very potent corticosteroids (SMD -1.56; 95% CI -1.87 to -1.26); I² statistic = 81.7%; 10 studies, 1264 participants). On a 6-point improvement scale, these benefits equate to 1.0 and 1.8 points, respectively. Dithranol, combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid, and tazarotene all performed significantly better than placebo. Head-to-head comparisons of vitamin D for psoriasis of the body against potent or very potent corticosteroids had mixed findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, combined treatment with vitamin D and corticosteroid performed significantly better than vitamin D alone or corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D generally performed better than coal tar, but findings relative to dithranol were mixed. When applied to psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D was significantly less effective than both potent corticosteroids and very potent corticosteroids. Indirect evidence from placebo-controlled trials supported these findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause local adverse events, such as burning or irritation. Combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid on either the body or the scalp was tolerated as well as potent corticosteroids, and significantly better than vitamin D alone. Only 25 trials assessed clinical cutaneous dermal atrophy; few cases were detected, but trials reported insufficient information to determine whether assessment methods were robust. Clinical measurements of dermal atrophy are insensitive and detect only the most severe cases. No comparison of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids perform at least as well as vitamin D analogues, and they are associated with a lower incidence of local adverse events. However, for people with chronic plaque psoriasis receiving long-term treatment with corticosteroids, there remains a lack of evidence about the risk of skin dermal atrophy. Further research is required to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.

### Efficacy and safety of tildrakizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp: week 52 results from a phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^0529f3d1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the primary analysis of a phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis affecting the scalp (NCT03897088), tildrakizumab, an anti-interleukin-23 p19 antibody, met the primary efficacy endpoint at week 16.

Objective

To evaluate maintenance of tildrakizumab efficacy and safety for the treatment of scalp psoriasis from the week 52 full analysis.

Methods

Patients randomized to tildrakizumab continued receiving tildrakizumab 100 mg every 12 weeks; patients randomized to placebo (analyzed separately) switched to tildrakizumab 100 mg at week 16. Efficacy endpoints included Investigator Global Assessment modified 2011 (scalp) score of 0 or 1 with ≥ 2-grade improvement and ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index score from baseline. Safety was assessed from adverse events.

Results

In patients originally randomized to tildrakizumab versus placebo, Investigator Global Assessment modified 2011 (scalp) and ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index score response rates, respectively, improved from 49.4% versus 7.3% and 60.7% versus 4.9% at week 16 to 62.9% versus 56.1% and 65.2% versus 57.3% at week 52; > 80% of week 16 responders to tildrakizumab maintained response. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred.

Limitations

Results were obtained under controlled clinical conditions.

Conclusion

Efficacy and safety of tildrakizumab for the treatment of scalp psoriasis are sustained long-term.

### Topical therapies for the treatment of plaque psoriasis: systematic review and network meta-analyses [^56986476]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of people with psoriasis have localized disease, where topical therapy forms the cornerstone of treatment. We set out to summarize evidence on the relative efficacy, safety and tolerability of different topical treatments used in plaque psoriasis. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized trial data of U.K.-licensed topical therapies. The primary outcome was clear or nearly clear status stratified for (i) trunk and limbs; and (ii) scalp. Network meta-analyses allowed ranking of treatment efficacy. In total, 48 studies were available for trunk and limb psoriasis, and 17 for scalp psoriasis (22,028 patients in total); the majority included people with at least moderate severity psoriasis. Strategies containing potent corticosteroids (alone or in combination with a vitamin D analogue) or very potent corticosteroids dominated the treatment hierarchy at both sites (trunk and limbs, scalp); coal tar and retinoids were no better than placebo. No significant differences in achievement of clear or nearly clear status were observed between twice- and once-daily application of the same intervention or between any of the following: combined vitamin D analogue and potent corticosteroid (applied separately or in a single product), very potent corticosteroids, or potent corticosteroids (applied twice daily). Investigator and patient assessment of response differed significantly for some interventions (response rates to very potent corticosteroids: 78% and 39%, respectively). No significant differences were noted for tolerability or steroid atrophy, but data were limited. In conclusion, corticosteroids are highly effective in psoriasis when used continuously for up to 8 weeks and intermittently for up to 52 weeks. Coal tar and retinoids are of limited benefit. There is a lack of long-term efficacy and safety data available on topical interventions used for psoriasis.

### Psoriasis of the scalp. diagnosis and management [^07072f19]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Psoriasis of the scalp is a frequently occurring condition affecting approximately 2% of the Western population. The sharply demarcated erythematosquamous lesions with silver-white scaling characterize scalp psoriasis. Quality of life can be seriously reduced by this condition and therefore long term treatment is needed in most patients. Coal tar shampoos, containing 2 to 10% coal tar solution, are effective in scalp psoriasis. However, no double-blind studies are available to support such an assumption. Salicylic acid 5 to 10% has a pronounced keratolytic effect. Salicylic acid should be formulated in an ointment, which can be washed off easily. Crude coal tar is the most effective tar available for the treatment of psoriasis. An important feature of coal tar is its potent efficacy against pruritus. At the scalp, the application of crude coal tar is difficult. Therefore coal tar solution is the most frequently applied tar preparation in scalp psoriasis. Dithranol 0.1 to 3% is manufactured in various formulations. Treatment is initiated at a low concentration and the concentration is increased stepwise until a slight irritation, the feeling of warmth, is reached. In the treatment of scalp psoriasis, cream formulations are used. Imidazole antifungals have been used with success in scalp psoriasis. Overgrowth of the scalp with pityrosporon is a well-known feature of scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. In case of resistance to other topical treatments use of a topical or systemic imidazole derivative might be helpful. So far, topical corticosteroids are the most frequently used treatments for psoriasis of the scalp. Corticosteroids inhibit epidermal proliferation, inhibit inflammation and modulate immune functions. Topical corticosteroids are fast acting: within 3 to 4 weeks maximal efficacy is reached. No data are available to support the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids during long term use. However, from epidemiologic surveys we know that these treatments are used by the majority of patients for more than 8 weeks. Since 1992 vitamin D3 formulations have been developed for the treatment of psoriasis. Calcipotriol is available in most countries. Tacalcitol is available in Japan and several other countries. Vitamin D3 analogues inhibit epidermal proliferation, enhance cornification and inhibit inflammation. Therefore, vitamin D3 analogues have a substantial antipsoriatic effect. Systemic treatments such as methotrexate, cyclosporine and acitretin are indicated in patients with recalcitrant disease. Management of scalp psoriasis requires long term strategies in order to reach an optimal improvement of the condition, while avoiding the adverse effects associated with the long term use of treatments.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^11839ece]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Psoriasis of the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails is often underdiagnosed, and disease management can be challenging. Despite the small surface area commonly affected by psoriasis in these locations, patients have disproportionate levels of physical impairment and emotional distress. Limitations in current disease severity indices do not fully capture the impact of disease on a patient's quality of life, and, combined with limitations in current therapies, many patients do not receive proper or adequate care. In this review, we discuss the clinical manifestations of psoriasis in these less commonly diagnosed areas and its impact on patient quality of life. We also examine clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of therapies on psoriasis in these regions. This article highlights the need to individualize treatment strategies for psoriasis based on the area of the body that is affected and the emerging role of biologic therapy in this regard.

### Psoriasis treatment in difficult locations: scalp, nails, and intertriginous areas [^b2a59bc4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Psoriasis comprises a broad spectrum of different clinical courses among which the chronic stable psoriasis by far occurs most frequently. The clinical presentation ranges from mild disease to more serious forms involving large areas of skin and/or joint disease. A number of modifying factors may impact on treatment choice in individual cases (eg, location of the lesions, disease phase, treatment history, response to previous treatments, comorbidity). Aside from this consideration, there are special localizations that remain some of the most difficult regions to control. Such entities are the scalp, nails, and intertriginous areas. Topical treatment of such different-to-treat areas has to be considered as a first-line intervention strategy, at least in those patients who are presenting an exclusively isolated involvement. In some situations (eg, in severe psoriasis or in patients who are refractory to topical treatment), however, a systemic treatment is indicated. Most obvious difficulties in treating these locations are due to unrealistic expectations from the patients' perspectives, time-consuming applications, side effects, cosmetic injuries, and restricted bioavailability of active compounds. Aside from hair care, initial use of keratolytics for scalp psoriasis, corticosteroids, and vitamin D3 and analogues are currently standard treatments. Recently developed new formulations of both active ingredients such as foam or gel appear to be more acceptable to patients than traditional creams or ointments. Current treatment options for nail psoriasis are very often poorly efficacious, associated with undesirable effects, or time consuming. Success has to be measured in terms of months. Topical treatments (eg, corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, tazarotene) are mainly used, but impressive improvement rates mostly will be achieved by systemic treatment of conventional and biologic agents. Finally, the usefulness of corticosteroids, vitamin D and analogues, and calcineurin inhibitors in treating intertriginous psoriasis clearly is demonstrated. Especially the use of calcineurin inhibitors exhibits efficacy in intertriginous regions and therefore may be seen as a promising treatment option in the future. Besides the important innovations in the last years, there is a need for new effective and well-tolerated treatment modalities, especially for long-term use in the 3 difficult-to-treat locations, which encompass cosmetic acceptability.

### The effect of secukinumab on moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis: results of a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3b study [^d4c95cd7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis has not been evaluated in prospective trials of patients without moderate-to-severe body psoriasis.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis.

Methods

In this 24-week, double-blind, phase 3b study, 102 patients were randomized 1:1 to subcutaneous secukinumab 300 mg or placebo at baseline, weeks 1, 2, and 3, and then every 4 weeks from week 4 to 20. The primary efficacy variable was 90% improvement of Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI 90) score from baseline to week 12.

Results

At week 12, PSSI 90 (secukinumab 300 mg vs placebo, 52.9% vs 2.0%) and Investigator's Global Assessment modified 2011 scalp responses of 0 or 1 (secukinumab 300 mg vs placebo, 56.9% vs 5.9%) were significantly greater with secukinumab 300 mg than placebo (P < .001 for both). In addition, significantly more patients achieved complete clearance of scalp psoriasis at week 12 with secukinumab 300 mg than placebo (35.3% vs 0%; P < .001). The median time to 50% reduction in PSSI score was 3.29 weeks with secukinumab 300 mg. The safety profile of secukinumab was consistent with previous phase 3 studies.

Limitations

There was no active comparator arm.

Conclusion

Secukinumab is efficacious and well-tolerated for patients with extensive moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis.

### An open-label study evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of alefacept for the treatment of scalp psoriasis [^95503283]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Almost 50% of patients with psoriasis also have scalp psoriasis. Although alefacept is safe and effective for the treatment of generalized plaque psoriasis, its efficacy specifically for treating scalp psoriasis has not been formally evaluated.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of alefacept in treating scalp psoriasis.

Methods

Patients (n = 30) with psoriatic plaques covering 30% or more of scalp surface received 15 mg of intramuscular alefacept once weekly for 16 weeks (course 1), followed by 12 weeks of rest. Patients were evaluated for the condition of their scalp psoriasis using the scalp Physician's Global Assessment, a modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index for the scalp, and scalp Patient's Global Assessment 6 weeks after course 1. Patients who had scalp Physician's Global Assessment scores greater than or equal to 1 at any time between this evaluation and 5 months after the rest period received an additional 12-week course of once-weekly intramuscular alefacept (15 mg) (course 2). Treatment success was defined as attaining scalp Physician's Global Assessment of clear (0) or almost clear (1) at 6 weeks after either treatment course.

Results

Six weeks after course 1, 5 (16.7%) patients achieved clear or almost clear status of their scalp psoriasis. All 3 patients whose scalp psoriasis cleared remained clear until the end of the study. Six weeks after course 2, cumulatively, 8 (26.7%) patients achieved treatment success. Not all patients received both courses. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events.

Limitations

This was a single-arm, open-label, noncomparative trial.

Conclusion

Alefacept is effective in a subset of patients with scalp psoriasis and is well tolerated.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 1. overview of psoriasis and guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis with biologics [^02e95f44]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of psoriasis treatment — assessment tools and trial populations — Most large double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psoriasis treatments include chronic stable plaque psoriasis and exclude involvement of the palms and soles, scalp, intertriginous areas, erythrodermic psoriasis, and pustular psoriasis; severity is commonly measured with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which assesses body surface area (BSA) and erythema, induration, and scaling, and is calculated before, during, and after treatment; a 75% improvement in the PASI score (PASI-75) is predominantly used to document effectiveness in trials, but the PASI is considered less sensitive with lower BSA involvement (< 10%); other tools include the Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) and target plaque scores with percent BSA, with the PGA usually using a 7-point scale, and Lattice System-PGA where 1% of BSA approximates the patient's open handprint.

### Efficacy and safety of apremilast in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp: results up to 32 weeks from a randomized, phase III study [^a6f3924e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

During the apremilast‐exposure period (0–32 weeks), 284 patients received at least one dose of apremilast; total apremilast exposure was 126·2 person‐years. Most adverse events (AEs) during the apremilast‐exposure period were mild or moderate in severity and consistent with the placebo‐controlled periodand known safety profile of apremilast. The most common AEs (≥ 5% during the apremilast‐exposure period) were diarrhoea (76 of 284, 26·8%), nausea (55 of 284, 19·4%), headache (28 of 284, 9·9%) and vomiting (15 of 284, 5·3%).

Scalp involvement must be considered when selecting the optimal therapy for patients with psoriasis.STYLE demonstrated the efficacy of apremilast in treating psoriasis of the scalp, a common and highly visible location for plaque psoriasis. Clinically and statistically significant improvements in scalp psoriasis, scalp and whole body itch, and QoL were sustained for up to 32 weeks in patients continuing apremilast treatment and in patients initially randomized to placebo who switched to apremilast. The efficacy of apremilast was also demonstrated across multiple clinically relevant patient subgroups. Although the discontinuation rate over the extension phase was low, this may limit the generalizability of the overall findings. The safety profile in STYLE was consistent with prior apremilast studies. Some systemic, injectable treatments have reported efficacy in scalp psoriasis, but comparisons are difficult as these studies used different definitions of scalp psoriasis and improvement measures. In summary, the STYLE phase III study supports apremilast as an effective treatment for scalp psoriasis in different types of patients, including those with scalp psoriasis inadequately controlled by other therapies.

Psoriasis topical corticosteroids — randomized, vehicle- or placebo-controlled trials report efficacy signals: In non-scalp psoriasis, betamethasone valerate foam (class IV) achieved greater than 50% improvement in 70% versus 24% with placebo (P < .001) in a placebo-controlled trial of 40 patients; in a 3-week, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study of 190 patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, hydrocortisone 17-butyrate 21-propionate cream (class V) achieved excellent or good improvement in 41% as compared to 18% with vehicle (P = 0.002); and in severe scalp psoriasis, a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 3-week trial of 89 patients showed 83% with fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% oil (class VI) versus 36% with vehicle had good or better improvement from baseline (P < .001). A large systematic review reported that potent and very potent topical corticosteroids were more efficacious than mild or moderate corticosteroids.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^c8575131]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Although additional data are necessary to determine the role of agents targeting IL‐17 for routine management of psoriasis in other areas and nonplaque subsets, they may offer improved care and outcomes for patients whose needs are not met by available therapies. Raising the awareness of psoriasis on the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails is critical for comprehensive assessment of psoriasis. Currently, more targeted systemic therapies are available for psoriasis than in the past, and use of drugs discussed in this manuscript is important for improving clinical outcomes of all patients, regardless of affected body region. We recommend addressing the current gap in comprehensive psoriasis management through the development of better measurement tools that include all psoriasis phenotypes and incorporate the patient perspective as patient‐reported outcomes, so that clinical trials can be conducted using these new psoriasis indices.

### Topical therapies for the treatment of localized plaque psoriasis in primary care: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^372fdf05]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Topical therapies are a mainstay of psoriasis treatment, but they vary substantially in terms of cost.

Objectives

To determine the cost-effectiveness and optimal treatment sequence for psoriasis of the trunk, limbs and scalp.

Methods

Probabilities of response from a network meta-analysis were used to determine the short-term efficacy of topical therapies. Longer-term outcomes, including relapse, were informed by published evidence and clinical opinion. Benefits of treatment were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Direct costs included topical agents, primary and secondary care visits and second-line therapies for treatment failures.

Results

For the trunk and limbs, initial treatment with a two-compound formulation (TCF) product containing vitamin D and potent corticosteroid provided the most QALYs, followed by separate morning and evening application of vitamin D and potent corticosteroid [two-compound application, TCA (am/pm)], and then twice-daily potent corticosteroids. The use of twice-daily potent corticosteroids was the most cost-effective first-line strategy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio £ 20,000 per QALY), followed by TCA (am/pm) (£ 22,658 per QALY) and TCF product (£ 179,439 per QALY). For scalp psoriasis, initial treatment with very potent corticosteroids generated the most QALYs, followed by TCF product and then potent corticosteroids. Very potent corticosteroids were the most cost-effective treatment but, if too aggressive, potent corticosteroids were optimal followed by TCF product (£ 219,846 per QALY). The cost-effectiveness of second- and third-line topical agents varied with the assumptions made.

Conclusions

Potent corticosteroids, used alone or in combination with vitamin D, are the most cost-effective treatment for patients with psoriasis of the trunk and limbs. Potent or very potent corticosteroids are the most cost-effective treatment for patients with scalp psoriasis.

### Safety and efficacy of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel in the treatment of scalp psoriasis in adolescents 12–17 years of age [^fa36def1]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Background

Plaque psoriasis has a relatively high prevalence in adolescence, resulting in a significant impact on quality of life, including social interactions.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the safety of once-daily application of fixed-combination calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel in adolescent scalp psoriasis. Assessment of efficacy was a secondary objective.

Methods

This phase II, multicentre, single-arm, open-label, 8-week trial included patients aged 12–17 years with moderate-to-very severe scalp psoriasis according to Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) (≥ 10% of the scalp area affected).

Results

Seventy-eight patients received treatment. Twenty-seven patients (35%) reported a total of 64 adverse events (AEs); most were mild (33/64) or moderate (22/64) in severity and there were no serious AEs. No cases of hypercalcaemia were reported, and the mean changes from baseline to end of treatment in albumin-corrected serum calcium (0·00 mmol L −1), 24-h urinary calcium excretion (−0·03 mmol per 24 h) and urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio (−0·12 mmol g −1) were not considered clinically relevant. At the end of treatment 66 patients (85%) were clear or almost clear according to IGA. There was an 80% improvement in mean Total Sign Score from baseline to end of treatment. In total, at the end of treatment, 87% of patients rated their scalp psoriasis as clear or very mild, and 75 (96%) had no or mild pruritus compared with 14 (18%) at baseline.

Conclusions

Once-daily calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel is well tolerated and efficacious for scalp psoriasis in adolescents.

What's already known about this topic?

Calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel is a well-tolerated and efficacious treatment for scalp and body psoriasis in adults.
Psoriasis can present during childhood or adolescence and may negatively impact quality of life.

What does this study add?

Calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel is well tolerated and shows efficacy for treatment of scalp psoriasis in an adolescent population.

### Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for psoriasis of the scalp and body: the ARRECTOR phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^732b1dc0]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Plaque psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that negatively affects quality of life for patients with limited or extensive disease involvement. The scalp is one of the most common sites of plaque psoriasis, with approximately half of patients with psoriasis reporting involvement of the scalp. Topical treatment of scalp psoriasis can be challenging, and patients with psoriasis affecting both the body and scalp may require polypharmacy to address different application considerations. Scalp psoriasis is complicated by the presence of hair, which affects application of topical agents, especially cream or ointment formulations. Often, these formulations are cosmetically unacceptable or are incompatible with hair care practices, resulting in reduced treatment adherence. Newer topical formulations, including foams, are more compatible with hair care practices and can be applied to both hair-bearing and non–hair-bearing skin. This versatility may improve treatment outcomes by increasing adherence.

### Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray for the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp: results from a randomized controlled trial [^a0c7f665]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray is available for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis; however, there is limited information with plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life impact of clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

Methods

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study involving 81 men and women with moderate-to-severe (Global Severity Score [GSS] = 3 or 4) plaque psoriasis of the scalp. Eligible patients were treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray or vehicle spray, which was applied twice daily for up to four weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the GSS of psoriasis of the scalp after four weeks. Safety assessments included local tolerability, presence of Cushing's syndrome, and adverse events.

Results

At the end of treatment, 85 percent (35/41) of patients in the clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray group achieved success (GSS clear or almost clear), compared with 13 percent (5/40) in the vehicle spray group (P is less than .001). The proportion of patients treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray who achieved a rating of clear (GSS = 0) after two weeks and at the end of treatment was 12 percent and 51 percent, respectively. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events or reported cases of folliculitis or Cushing's syndrome.

Conclusion

Treatment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray for up to four weeks is effective and well tolerated for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

### Systemic pharmacologic treatments for plaque psoriasis… [^86970664]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the most effective treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Evidence-Based Answer Infliximab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab are the most effective medications for achieving a 90% reduction in symptoms among patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

1. Practice Pointers Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disorder involving the skin and other organ systems. It affects an estimated 3. 2% of people older than 20 years in the United States. 2 Psoriasis can present significant challenges due to its variable clinical manifestations, potential for comorbidities, and the evolving landscape of treatment options.
3. This Cochrane review included 179 randomized controlled trials with a total of 62, 339 participants and evaluated 20 unique treatments.

1 The patient population included adults older than 18 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score was used to assess psoriasis severity. The PASI instrument is completed by examiners, and the score considers the extent and severity of skin involvement, including factors such as redness, scaling, and thickness of psoriatic lesions in four body regions. PASI 90 describes when a patient has symptoms of psoriasis that have improved by 90% or more compared with their initial baseline PASI score and is, therefore, a measure of treatment effectiveness. Of the studies included in this review, 56% were placebo-controlled, and at least 77% were industry-sponsored.

### Once-daily roflumilast foam 0.3% for scalp and body psoriasis: a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase IIb study [^f0d63eeb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Scalp psoriasis affects most patients with psoriasis, but it can be difficult to treat.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast foam 0.3% on scalp and body psoriasis.

Methods

In a phase IIb randomized controlled trial, adults and adolescents aged ≥ 12years with scalp and body psoriasis were randomized (2: 1) to roflumilast foam 0.3% or vehicle for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was scalp Investigator Global Assessment (S-IGA) success (score of 'clear' or 'almost clear' plus ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline) at week 8. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

Results

Significantly more roflumilast-treated patients (59.1%) than vehicle-treated patients (11.4%) achieved S-IGA success at week 8 (P < 0.001); differences favoured roflumilast as early as the first postbaseline visit at week 2 (P < 0.001). Significant improvements were also seen for secondary endpoints, including body IGA success, Scalp Itch Numeric Rating Scale and the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index. The safety of roflumilast was generally similar to vehicle. Patients treated with roflumilast experienced low rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), with few discontinuations due to an AE. Few patients with skin of colour (11%) and few adolescents (0.7%) were included.

Conclusions

The results support the further development of roflumilast foam for treating scalp and body psoriasis.

### Clobetasol propionate shampoo 0.05%: a new option to treat patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis [^6d6df3c0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, papulosquamous condition that affects up to 2% of the U.S. population. Approximately 50% of patients with psoriasis have involvement of the scalp. This was a multicentre, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-masked and parallel-group study. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% versus its corresponding vehicle in subjects aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis over a treatment period of 4 weeks. Recurrence of scalp psoriasis was assessed during a two week follow-up period. A total of 142 subjects were treated. Results after 4 weeks demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% was with a similar safety profile significantly more effective than its vehicle. The novel short contact shampoo formulation of clobetasol propionate is convenient and efficacious and minimizes systemic exposure while being efficient, safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp psoriasis.

### A new scalp formulation of calcipotriene plus betamethasone compared with its active ingredients and the vehicle in the treatment of scalp psoriasis: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^61040aca]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

New topical treatments in scalp psoriasis are needed because many current topical treatments are disliked by patients and associated with poor compliance.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily, two-compound scalp formulation containing calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate with the individual components in the same vehicle and the vehicle alone.

Methods

In this 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, patients with scalp psoriasis were randomized to treatment with the two-compound scalp formulation (calcipotriene 50 microg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g, as dipropionate) (n = 541), betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate) in the same vehicle (n = 556), calcipotriene 50 microg/g in the same vehicle (n = 272), or vehicle alone (n = 136).

Results

More patients achieved "absent" or "very mild" disease at week 8 with the two-compound scalp formulation (71.2%) compared with betamethasone dipropionate in the same vehicle (64.0%, p = .011), calcipotriene in the same vehicle (36.8%, p < .0001), or the vehicle (22.8%, p < .0001).

Limitations

Efficacy of the active comparators in the study has not been established in relation to calcipotriene and betamethasone formulations available for clinical use.

Conclusion

Calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate scalp formulation was more effective than either of the individual components or the vehicle alone.

### Comparative efficacy of deucravacitinib and adalimumab for scalp psoriasis: an indirect treatment comparison [^1b9c451c]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Plaque psoriasis of the scalp, a common psoriasis location, remains difficult to manage. The comparative efficacy of newer oral agents, such as deucravacitinib, versus traditional first-generation biologics has not been characterized in the treatment of scalp psoriasis. This study indirectly compared the long-term efficacy of deucravacitinib versus that of adalimumab for the treatment of scalp psoriasis.

Methods

A literature review identified trial publications reporting long-term efficacy (&ge;48 weeks) of adalimumab in patients with scalp psoriasis. Based on a feasibility assessment, summary-level adalimumab data (VOYAGE 1 trial [NCT02207231]) were deemed suitable for comparison to patient-level deucravacitinib data (POETYK PSO-1 trial [NCT03624127]). Unadjusted analyses and adjusted analyses using an unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) approach were used to describe and compare baseline characteristics and efficacy outcomes in terms of rates of achievement of clear or almost clear scalp psoriasis (scalp-specific Physician Global Assessment score of 0/1 [ss-PGA 0/1]) at weeks 16, 24, and 48.

Results

Cross-trial differences were observed in age, race, severe scalp psoriasis, and quality of life scores. A larger percentage of patients achieved ss-PGA 0/1 at week 48 with deucravacitinib (unadjusted: 76.7%; adjusted: 73.0%) versus adalimumab (60.5%). Similarly, a larger percentage of patients achieved ss-PGA 0/1 at weeks 16 and 24 with deucravacitinib versus adalimumab.

Conclusions

In this study, treatment with deucravacitinib was effective in treating scalp psoriasis and, when compared with adalimumab, was also associated with a larger percentage of patients achieving ss-PGA 0/1 over 48 weeks.

### Nail psoriasis in older adults: intralesional, systemic, and biological therapy [^dc82801a]. Dermatologic Clinics (2021). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis may affect the skin, scalp, joints, and nails and is common in older adults. Intramatrical injections with triamcinolone acetonide are safe and effective in older individuals. Conventional systemic medications are relatively effective, but side effects, including laboratory abnormalities and drug interactions, are particularly common among older adults. Biologic medications have shown excellent efficacy in treating nail psoriasis. Their safety profile is favorable, but data assessing long-term safety are lacking. Randomized controlled trials in older adults exclusively are necessary to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines in this population.

### Safety and efficacy of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel in the treatment of scalp psoriasis in adolescents 12–17 years of age [^c6cce244]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriasis vulgaris is one of the most common chronic skin diseases, affecting 1–3% of the general population. The total prevalence of psoriasis in children aged < 18 years is approximately 0·7%, and the rate increases linearly with age from 0 to 18 years. Within the adolescent age group, quality of life may be significantly compromised, with social development being especially impaired. The overt visibility of plaques can prove particularly troublesome, and lesions of the scalp frequently present within this age group, which may result in alopecia in severe cases.

Topical vitamin D analogues and corticosteroids are established first-line treatments for scalp psoriasis, although safety concerns may accompany their use. Vitamin D analogues can cause skin irritation and hypercalcaemia, while corticosteroids are associated with local adverse events (AEs), including skin atrophy, striae and telangiectasia, as well as systemic AEs such as adrenal suppression. Combination of these topical agents capitalizes on their beneficial clinical characteristics and can allay side-effects. A fixed combination of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate in a single product is well tolerated and effective in treating psoriasis in adults and has demonstrated superior efficacy to monotherapy with its individual components.–Greater anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects are evident than for either active ingredient alone, and the onset of action is more rapid.–

Nonadherence to topical agents can limit their effectiveness, and, among adolescents, adherence to topical treatments is particularly poor owing to social pressures and inconvenience of using medication. The formulation prescribed can influence patients' day-to-day use, and poor cosmetic characteristics, including greasy and sticky application, are frequently cited as discouraging the use of psoriasis treatments. A more cosmetically acceptable and easy-to-use treatment in the form of a fixed-combination lipophilic, alcohol-free gel has demonstrated favourable patient-related benefits in adults, and may have increased acceptability in adolescents with psoriasis. The objective of this trial was to investigate safety, with particular focus on calcium metabolism and the effectiveness of once-daily calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel in an adolescent population. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01120223).

### Efficacy of betamethasone valerate mousse in comparison with standard therapies on scalp psoriasis: an open, multicentre, randomized, controlled, cross-over study on 241 patients [^75d1f1a5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The scalp is a common area for plaque psoriasis. Corticosteroid-based lotions are the most widely used therapy in this clinical setting. A new formulation of betamethasone valerate 0.12% in a thermophobic, low-residue foam vehicle (Bettamousse trade mark, Mipharm, Italy; BVM) is available for the treatment of scalp dermatoses.

Objectives

In an open, investigator-blinded, multicentre (28 dermatology clinics), randomized, cross-over study, the efficacy, safety and patient acceptability of BVM in scalp psoriasis were evaluated in comparison with standard therapies (ST, i.e. corticosteroids or vitamin D analogues). ST were chosen by each centre according to its usual therapeutic protocols.

Methods

In total, 241 patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis participated in the trial. After a 2-week run-in period, each active treatment (BVM or ST) was applied for 4 weeks, with a wash-out period between the two active treatment phases of at least 4 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated by investigators unaware of treatment sequence analysing a 'target' lesion for erythema, scaling, itching and burning using a five-point grading score. Patient treatment acceptability and assessment of the influence on Psoriasis Disability Index were evaluated using an eight-item modified Finlay-Khan questionnaire at baseline and at the end of each treatment period. Safety was evaluated by recording any adverse event occurring during the study duration. BVM was applied twice daily, and ST were applied once or twice daily, according to the approved scheduled regimens.

Results

Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Two hundred and ten patients concluded the study. Fifteen patients withdrew from the study during BVM treatment, and 16 during ST (not significantly different). Both treatments were well tolerated. At baseline, the mean ± SD clinical global score (the 'Sum' score = erythema + scaling + itching + burning) was 7.6 ± 2.6. The ST chosen were topical corticosteroids (55% of cases; mainly mometasone and betamethasone dipropionate) or calcipotriol lotion (45% of cases). At the end of active treatments, BVM was significantly superior to ST (P < 0.001) in reducing, as compared with baseline, the mean ± SD Sum score (1.5 ± 1.9 with BVM and 3.1 ± 2.7 with ST). During BVM treatment, 88% (95% confidence interval, CI 82–94%) of patients had a complete or nearly complete resolution of scaling in comparison with 66% (95% CI 58–74%) during ST therapy (P < 0.001). BVM was also considered an easier and more convenient formulation to use in comparison with ST (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

BVM is more effective than lotion-based ST commonly used in the treatment of scalp psoriasis, and has higher patient acceptability.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^f1167eda]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

3 DISCUSSION

It is important for physicians to consider the debilitating nature of psoriasis of the scalp, face, nails, genitals, intertriginous, and palmoplantar regions when evaluating treatment strategies. The initial diagnosis of psoriasis in these regions may be more complicated because (a) physicians may not appreciate the full burden of disease in these areas and/or (b) patients may be reluctant to discuss disease affecting these areas unless specifically asked.

Another challenge stems from the inability of commonly used scoring systems to comprehensively detect disease severity in these regions due to the small surface area affected. Further, traditional scoring systems do not measure the impact of disease on a patient's emotional and physical well‐being. New scoring systems that consider QoL measures in addition to the severity of psoriatic lesions can provide better guidance for determining the level of care required. For example, the Brigham Scalp Nail Inverse Palmoplantar Psoriasis Composite Index is comprised of patient‐derived/patient‐reported outcomes equally weighted with physician‐assessed disease activity index scores to determine overall disease severity (Patel, Liu, Qureshi, & Merola, 2014).

Patient concerns and therapy limitations cause many commonly used agents to not be acceptable for treatment of psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, flexural/intertriginous, and palmoplantar regions (Table 2). The application of topical agents can be challenging and not cosmetically tolerable to many patients. Further, traditional systemic therapies may require different drug concentrations to be effective at the afflicted areas; thus, toxicity can be a major concern. Also, treatment may be further complicated by lack of response due to nonadherence because of difficulty in maintaining application schedules or other reasons. In addition, treatment selection is hampered by a lack of robust clinical trial data for psoriasis in these areas (Table 1). To determine the best treatment strategies, future trials may consider including individuals with psoriasis only in challenging‐to‐treat areas and incorporate QoL measures.

### Halobetasol propionate / tazarotene lotion for scalp psoriasis: efficacy in itch reduction, disease clearance, and hair appearance [^63b2ecaa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Scalp involvement in plaque psoriasis is accompanied by itching and scaling that reduce quality of life and exacerbate psoriatic-associated hair loss. Challenges for the topical treatment of scalp psoriasis include messy formulations that reduce patient adherence and dermal penetration in hair-bearing areas. This open-label study evaluated the efficacy of fixed-combination halobetasol propionate (0.01%) and tazarotene (0.045%) lotion (HP/TAZ, indicated for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults) in subjects with moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis. Subjects applied HP/TAZ to the scalp once daily for 12 weeks and were evaluated at 4-week intervals. Endpoints included subject-reported scalp itch, investigator-reported psoriasis scalp severity index (PSSI), and investigator- and subject-reported hair and scalp assessments. From baseline, subjects experienced significant reductions in scalp itch and PSSI by week 12 (-49% and -93%, respectively; P&le;0.001). Similarly, ratings for all investigator- and subject-assessed hair and scalp parameters were significantly improved from baseline at week 12 (P&le;0.002 for all). No adverse events were reported. HP/TAZ is an efficacious treatment for scalp psoriasis, and reductions in psoriatic disease and itch may reduce scratching, leading to improvements in hair and scalp health.

### A new scalp formulation of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate compared with each of its active ingredients in the same vehicle for the treatment of scalp psoriasis: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^13a3c082]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There is a need for new treatments for scalp psoriasis, as many topical treatments are cosmetically unacceptable and difficult to apply, resulting in poor compliance.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of a new, once-daily, two-compound scalp formulation (Xamiol; LEO Pharma A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) containing calcipotriol 50 microg g(-1) plus betamethasone 0.5 mg g(-1) (as dipropionate), with the active ingredients as single compounds in the same vehicle.

Methods

This 8-week, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study, randomized adult patients with scalp psoriasis involving > 10% of the scalp to the two-compound scalp formulation (n = 568), betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg g(-1) (n = 563), or calcipotriol 50 microg g(-1) (n = 286). The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with 'absence of disease' or 'very mild disease' according to investigators' assessments at week 8.

Results

The proportion of patients with 'absence of disease' or 'very mild disease' at week 8 was significantly higher in the two-compound group (68.4%) than the betamethasone dipropionate (61.0%, P = 0.0079) or calcipotriol (43.4%, P < 0.0001) groups. The proportion of patients rating their scalp psoriasis as 'clear' or 'almost clear' was significantly higher for the two-compound scalp formulation (69.6%) than for betamethasone dipropionate (59.9%, P = 0.0006) or calcipotriol (44.7%, P < 0.0001). The incidence of lesional/perilesional adverse events was lower in the two-compound and betamethasone dipropionate groups than the calcipotriol group.

Conclusions

The two-compound scalp formulation was well tolerated and more effective in the treatment of scalp psoriasis than either of its individual components in the same vehicle.

Vitamin D analogues — plaque-type psoriasis indication, dosing, efficacy, safety, and populations are summarized: dosing is "Twice daily to affected areas" for "Indication: Plaque-type psoriasis." In plaque-type body psoriasis, "70% to 74%" on calcitriol or calcipotriene ointment achieved "either 75% improvement or marked improvement to clearing" versus "18% to 19%" with placebo; in scalp psoriasis, "Sixty percent" on calcipotriene solution improved versus "17%" with placebo. For the combination calcipotriene/betamethasone ointment over 4 weeks, "48%" achieved absent or mild psoriasis compared with "16.5%" on calcipotriene, "26.3%" on betamethasone, and "7.6%" on placebo. "Use in combination with topical corticosteroids gives added benefit." Adverse effects include "Irritation in lesional and perilesional skin that is transient" and "Reversible elevation of serum calcium — more likely to occur patients treated with greater than 100 g/wk," and although it "Causes photosensitivity," there are "no contraindications to combining with UVB phototherapy" while corticosteroid-related effects "may occasionally occur." Pregnancy is "Category C" with "No information on excretion in breast milk," and "Pediatric use: Appears to be safe."

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^ca62392d]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Psoriasis severity measures — body surface area (BSA) thresholds and Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) are defined as follows: less than 3% BSA is considered mild, 3% to 10% BSA moderate, and greater than 10% severe; psoriasis can still be severe irrespective of BSA when it has serious emotional consequences or occurs in select locations including, but not restricted to, the hands, feet, scalp, face, or genital area, or when it causes intractable pruritus. PASI quantifies severity by incorporating not only BSA but also the intensity of redness, scaling, and plaque thickness, producing a score from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease severity); PASI is used for monitoring response to treatments in clinical trials and as a research tool, and it is rarely used by dermatologists in clinical practice to guide management.

### Calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis vulgaris on the body: a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial [^a9118a98]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

A combination topical suspension/gel containing calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate has been developed as a safe and effective treatment for patients with psoriasis vulgaris of the scalp. This same preparation has the potential to be a convenient, effective, and cosmetically appealing formulation for psoriasis on the body. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a topical suspension containing calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate compared with its constituent components and topical suspension vehicle in the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis on the trunk and limbs.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 4-arm trial in 1,152 subjects. The co-primary efficacy end points were the proportion of subjects achieving controlled disease based on the Investigators' Global Assessment of disease severity at weeks 4 and 8. Adverse events, vital signs, and clinical laboratory measurements were also assessed.

Results

At week 4, a greater proportion of subjects in the calcipotriene plus betamethasone group achieved controlled disease compared with subjects in the calcipotriene-only and vehicle-only treatment groups. At week 8, a statistically significantly (P < .01) greater proportion of subjects in the calcipotriene plus betamethasone group achieved controlled disease compared with subjects in the 3 other treatment groups. Adverse events and other safety assessments were similar between the groups.

Conclusion

The topical suspension containing calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate traditionally used for scalp psoriasis is also a safe and effective once-daily treatment for psoriasis vulgaris on the body.

### A case of scalp psoriasis resistant to ixekizumab treated with bimekizumab [^36f912f5]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Scalp psoriasis is linked to severe discomfort and impairment of quality of life given the associated symptoms, such as scaling and pruritus, the location in a highly visible area and in some cases even the development of psoriatic alopecia. Therefore, it requires effective and prompt treatment so as to reduce discomfort and improve patients' quality of life. A retrospective, observational, single-center, real-life study on 127 patients affected by scalp psoriasis compared the efficacy of anti–IL-23 drugs (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab) and anti–IL-17 or anti–IL-17RA biologics (secukinumab, ixekizumab, and brodalumab). Results showed that both anti–IL-17 and anti–IL-23 appeared to be effective on scalp psoriasis. In particular, patients treated with anti–IL-17 drugs reached a faster significant reduction of the lesions. Bimekizumab has been recently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. It differs from other anti–IL-17 drugs because it selectively inhibits IL-17F in addition to IL-17A. Dual inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F is a highly effective therapeutic option for the treatment of psoriasis, both for naïve patients and for those resistant to previous biologic treatments. Data from 3 phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-, and comparator-controlled clinical trials (BE READY, BE SURE, BE VIVID, BE RADIANT) have been published to date, showing bimekizumab superior efficacy over adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab., There are data regarding the efficacy of bimekizumab for scalp psoriasis also in clinical trials. In particular, BE VIVID, a 52-week, phase 3, randomized, ustekinumab, and placebo-controlled study included, among the efficacy end points, scalp Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 response at week 16 in patients with scalp psoriasis at baseline (baseline scalp IGA score of ≥ 2). At week 16, bimekizumab-treated patients had a higher IGA response versus ustekinumab and placebo (IGA 0/1: 83.1% vs 65.4% and 11.8%, respectively). To date, no real-life experiences or significant case reports regarding bimekizumab for scalp psoriasis are available in literature because of its very recent approval.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, vs vehicle foam in the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis of the scalp [^44b04a0d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Calcipotriene ointment and cream are effective treatments for psoriasis, but many patients with scalp psoriasis prefer lighter, less messy vehicles.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, for plaque-type psoriasis of the scalp.

Methods

Subjects (n = 363) were randomized into an 8-week, multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3b study of calcipotriene foam, 0.005% (NCT01139580). Primary end point was the proportion of subjects with an Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at week 8 for scalp involvement. Body involvement, target lesion score, and improvement for erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness were also assessed. < BR >

Results

At week 8, more subjects in the calcipotriene foam, 0.005% group (40.9%) met the primary end point vs the vehicle foam group (24.2%; intent-to-treat [ITT] population; P < .001); a significant difference between groups was also observed at weeks 2 (P = 0.041) and 4 (P < .001). No significant difference was observed between treatment groups for ISGA of body psoriasis (ITT population; P = 0.544). In the per-protocol population, but not the ITT population, more subjects in the calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, group than the vehicle foam group met the secondary end points for scaling (P = 0.019) and plaque thickness (P = 0.027). Incidence of adverse events in both treatment groups was low; calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, was associated with erythema.

Limitations

An 8-week study provides limited safety and efficacy data. < BR >

Conclusion

Calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, was more effective than vehicle foam for improving scalp psoriasis over an 8-week period, with improvements evident from week 2, and had a similar safety profile to vehicle foam.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^f37c697d]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Improvement in scalp psoriasis with systemic agents occurred in trials of etanercept, adalimumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, and apremilast (Table 1) (Bagel et al. 2017, 2012; Langley et al. 2015; Moore et al. 2007; Paul et al. 2012; Reich et al. 2017; Rich et al. 2016; Thaci, Unnebrink, Sundaram, Sood, & Yamaguchi, 2015; Tyring et al. 2013). Similarly, a recent retrospective cohort study demonstrated the efficacy of infliximab and ustekinumab in addition to etanercept and adalimumab (Fotiadou et al. 2016). Most reports were post hoc analyses of moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis trials (Langley et al. 2015; Reich et al. 2017; Rich et al. 2016; Thaci et al. 2015). To date, only 1 prospective clinical trial was conducted specifically in patients with moderate‐to‐severe scalp psoriasis without a requirement to have body‐surface‐area involvement ≥ 10% (Bagel et al. 2017). This placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, phase 3b trial demonstrated the superiority of secukinumab compared with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (Bagel et al. 2017).

Table 1
Selected clinical trials of approved agents for psoriasis in difficult‐to‐treat areas a

A large proportion of patients with severe scalp psoriasis presents with minimal chronic plaque psoriasis on the body and, hence, may not receive systemic therapy indicated for moderate‐to‐severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The adjunctive use of keratolytic and tar‐based shampoos, along with topical therapy (steroids and vitamin D analogs), may suffice initially, but long‐term compliance can be poor. Localized ultraviolet B therapy using fiber‐optic hair brushes is successful for patients, but these devices are expensive and patients need high allowances on their durable medical equipment insurance to obtain them. Use of methotrexate and biologics is much needed in these patients. However, approval through payers can prove difficult as current on‐label indications require significant body‐surface‐area coverage or a high‐enough PASI score to qualify for these systemic agents.

Limitations

The current trial has a few limitations. Only 2.3% of patients who participated were 17 years or younger. Trial duration was 8 weeks, so interpretation of the results was limited to this time frame, although durable efficacy has been demonstrated in long-term trials of roflumilast cream in patients with psoriasis. In addition, the lack of an active comparator prevented comparing efficacy of roflumilast foam with roflumilast cream or other currently available treatments.

### Safety and efficacy of calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in the treatment of extensive scalp psoriasis in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years [^c9fb47fc]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that is associated with serious comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, depression, and psoriatic arthritis. Approximately 35% of patients with psoriasis develop the disease before the age of 20 years and 25% are diagnosed between 10 and 19 years of age. In this adolescent age group, psoriasis can have a particularly significant impact on quality of life, including social interactions. In particular, scalp lesions are a common manifestation in younger individuals with psoriasis vulgaris and may represent a serious concern to patients because of the visibility of lesions and scaling, accompanied by feelings of stigmatization.

Current guidelines for the first-line treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis recommend the topical use of vitamin D analogues and corticosteroids. Safety concerns typically associated with these mono therapies include skin irritation and hypercalcemia for vitamin D analogues, and skin atrophy, adrenal suppression, and stunted growth with long-term use for corticosteroids. A fixed-combination topical preparation containing the vitamin D analogue calcipotriene and the corticosteroid betamethasone dipropionate has been developed and is well tolerated, with superior efficacy than the individual components for treatment of adult psoriasis vulgaris –. Therapeutic benefit is achieved with the fixed combination, promoting greater anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects than for either active ingredient alone, coupled with a faster response and potentially fewer safety concerns than with monotherapies.

The choice of topical treatment vehicle influences patient adherence and is a key factor that impacts upon effectiveness. Certain formulations, such as ointments, are often perceived as being messy, with time-consuming application that can deter patients from adhering to their treatment regimens. Adherence to skin disease treatments is particularly poor in adolescents, who often choose not to use medications as the result of social pressures and inconvenience. A fixed-combination lipophilic, alcohol-free topical suspension formulation may offer a beneficial treatment option for adolescents, providing cosmetic acceptability, convenience, and ease of use, but no specific clinical investigation of this fixed-combination formulation has previously been performed in an adolescent population.

This trial investigated the safety, with particular focus on calcium metabolism, as well as hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis function through dynamic testing, and efficacy of once-daily use of calcipotriene 0.005% plus betamethasone dipropionate (0.064%) topical suspension in adolescents with extensive psoriasis vulgaris of the scalp.

### A case of scalp psoriasis resistant to ixekizumab treated with bimekizumab [^af56a3e1]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic systemic inflammatory skin disease that deeply impacts patients' lives with a chronic-recurrent course. Globally, it has a prevalence of 3% in the general population, with possible differences between countries. Scalp involvement is observed in up to 79% of patients with psoriasis. Scalp psoriasis is a social impediment in approximately 50% of patients, causing significant psychosocial morbidity. Scalp falls within difficult-to-treat areas, being hardly suitable for topical agents use as well as often showing resistance to conventional treatments. Several treatment options are available with variable efficacy, such as topical agents (topical steroids, keratolytics, and vitamin D analogs), systemic conventional agents (methotrexate, cyclosporine, fumarates, and oral retinoids), small molecules (oral phosphodiesterases 4 inhibitors), and biologics. In recent years, after the introduction of biologic drugs, a number of more effective alternatives are available for the treatment of scalp psoriasis; however, there is no universally agreed consensus on first-line treatment, and even the new effective biologics, such as anti-interleukin (IL) 17 and IL-23, may experience primary or secondary failure. Bimekizumab is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits both IL-17A and IL-17F. These 2 ILs have been shown to be functionally dysregulated in lots of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Based on these assumptions, bimekizumab was developed to provide a better clinical response by blocking both IL-17A and IL-17F than by inhibiting IL-17A alone with secukinumab or ixekizumab. It was recently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients, with studies showing superiority to adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab. Here, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of scalp psoriasis resistant to ixekizumab treatment, rapidly and successfully treated with bimekizumab.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with phototherapy [^7c263160]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Targeted UVB phototherapy for localized psoriasis — excimer laser and excimer light — shows efficacy with defined dosing and adverse-effect profiles. A systematic review found that targeted UVB therapy "requires fewer treatments and a lower cumulative dose than nontargeted phototherapy." For palmoplantar disease, excimer modalities were effective, with "up to 57% of patients achieving complete clearance with a laser and more than 40% achieving substantial improvement with light." The ideal frequency "is twice to thrice weekly," and a study reported a 'medium-dose' excimer laser regimen "starting at 200% of the MED with 25% dose increments" was more efficacious than a 'low-dose' regimen "starting at 70% of the MED with 20% dose increments" but increased adverse effects. Adverse effects include "Painful erythema and blistering" with incidence "ranging from 0% to 92%… and a pooled weighted estimate of 16% incidence," plus "pruritus, burning, hyperpigmentation, and transient perilesional edema." In a meta-analysis of "13 studies," excimer laser was "the most effective of the 3 targeted UVB therapies (70% of patients achieved a PASI 75), followed by the excimer light (59% rate of achievement of PASI 75) and then targeted NB-UVB light (49% rate of achievement of PASI 75)." The same analysis reported "3 RCTs" in which "topical PUVA is comparable to excimer light in efficacy and superior to targeted NB-UVB light," and for scalp psoriasis, "Excimer lasers have been used with great efficacy… and this treatment may represent a viable intermediate treatment option."

### An open-label pilot study to investigate safety and efficacy of fixed combination tazarotene 0.045% and halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion for the treatment of scalp psoriasis [^eb2eb571]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Up to 80% of individuals with plaque psoriasis have scalp involvement, which can have a significant impact on the quality of life of affected individuals. Despite advancements in psoriasis therapeutics, management of scalp involvement remains a challenge. This12-week, open-label pilot study assessed the safety and efficacy of fixed combination tazarotene 0.045% and halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis with scalp involvement. Among 20 patients who were followed through 12 weeks, there were significant improvements in the primary endpoint (Investigator&rsquo; s Global Assessment (IGA)) and most secondary endpoints (Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI), body surface area (BSA), and scalp IGA (sIGA)). Treatment was well-tolerated. Further placebo-controlled double-blinded study for confirmation of our results is recommended. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(11): 1191–1194. doi:10.36849/JDD.0102.

### Efficacy and safety of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate scalp formulation compared with calcipotriol scalp solution in the treatment of scalp psoriasis: a randomized controlled trial [^c99cb4aa]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Current topical therapies for scalp psoriasis are difficult or unpleasant to apply, resulting in decreased adherence and efficacy.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily treatment with a combination of calcipotriol 50 microg g(-1) plus betamethasone 0.5 mg g(-1) (as dipropionate) (Xamiol; LEO Pharma A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) and twice-daily calcipotriol 50 microg mL(-1) scalp solution in patients with scalp psoriasis.

Methods

This 8-week, multicentre, randomized, investigator-blind, parallel-group study compared two-compound calcipotriol/betamethasone scalp formulation with calcipotriol scalp solution in patients with moderately severe scalp psoriasis. Primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved 'clear' or 'minimal' disease severity according to investigator's global assessment of disease severity at week 8. Secondary efficacy outcomes and adverse events were also evaluated. Relapse and rebound were assessed in an 8-week, post-treatment observation phase.

Results

In total, 207 patients received the two-compound scalp formulation and 105 patients received calcipotriol scalp solution. The proportion of patients with 'clear' or 'minimal' disease at week 8 was significantly greater in the two-compound scalp formulation group (68.6%) than in the calcipotriol scalp solution group (31.4%; P < 0.001). Improvement was more rapid with the two-compound scalp formulation than with calcipotriol scalp solution. Further evidence of the superiority of the two-compound scalp formulation over the scalp solution was demonstrated through greater improvements in clinical signs and fewer adverse events.

Conclusions

A once-daily combination of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate was significantly more effective and better tolerated than twice-daily calcipotriol scalp solution in the treatment of scalp psoriasis.

### Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for psoriasis of the scalp and body: the ARRECTOR phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^2299c972]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3%, improved psoriasis across multiple efficacy end points in patients with psoriasis of the scalp and body when used as monotherapy. Investigator-reported outcomes (S-IGA, B-IGA, PASI, and PSSI) significantly improved with roflumilast compared with vehicle. Importantly, these improvements were also reflected in patient-reported outcomes (SI-NRS, WI-NRS, and PSD), suggesting clinical improvements observed in those treated with roflumilast may translate into clinically meaningful outcomes for patients. Of note, pruritus improved early, with significantly greater proportions of patients achieving SI-NRS success in the roflumilast group compared with the vehicle group. Significant improvement in pruritus with roflumilast as compared with vehicle was observed as early as 24 hours after treatment initiation. Early improvement in patient-reported outcomes is advantageous because patient satisfaction with therapy can enhance adherence to treatment, particularly when the areas affected by psoriasis are difficult to treat. In both study groups, patients experienced low rates of TEAEs, with few TEAEs leading to trial discontinuation. Roflumilast foam and vehicle had similar investigator- and patient-rated local tolerability assessments.

Results from the current trial are consistent with previous trials comparing roflumilast cream, 0.3%, with vehicle cream in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2demonstrated a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients treated with roflumilast cream achieving IGA success (clear or almost clear status plus at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline on a scale of none [0] to severe [4]) compared with vehicle. Foam formulations are intended to make application to the scalp and other hair-bearing areas easier; in the current trial, success in both investigator- and patient-reported outcomes supports the use of the foam formulation. In addition, using a single topical product suitable for both hair-bearing and non–hair-bearing regions is more convenient than using separate products for different body parts. The investigator- and patient-reported outcomes suggest that the foam formulation should help improve patient satisfaction, adherence to therapy, and quality of life.

### Efficacy and safety of apremilast in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp: results up to 32 weeks from a randomized, phase III study [^630fc5d8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

, Scalp psoriasis is common and often severe enough to negatively impact quality of life (QoL). In STYLE (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03123471), oral apremilast 30 mg twice daily demonstrated significantly greater improvements in moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp, scalp itch, whole body itch and QoL vs. placeboduring the 16‐week, placebo‐controlled phase; safety and tolerability were consistent with the known safety profile of apremilast. We report the efficacy and safety of apremilast during the apremilast extension phase of STYLE (weeks 16–32). During the extension phase, patients initially randomized to placebo were switched to apremilast [placebo/apremilast (P/A) group; with titration during week 16] and patients initially randomized to apremilast continued active treatment [apremilast/apremilast (A/A) group; with dummy titration during week 16] through week 32. We also present apremilast efficacy at week 16 in subgroups based on baseline demographics and treatment characteristics (Figure 1).

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^b1ecc153]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

2 METHODS

PubMed literature searches were conducted with the following terms: psoriasis and face/facial, psoriasis and palmoplantar, psoriasis and intertriginous or inverse, psoriasis and genital, psoriasis and scalp, and psoriasis and nail. Abstracts from English‐language articles in the last 10 years were screened for relevance.

2.1 Scalp

Scalp involvement occurs in 45–56% of individuals with psoriasis (Merola, Li, et al. 2016). It is typically among the first affected areas of the body, with the frequency of lesion formation increasing with disease duration. The diagnosis of scalp psoriasis can be delayed due to overlapping features with other papulosquamous disorders of the scalp, particularly seborrheic dermatitis (Treadwell, 2011). Psoriasis lesions on the scalp are usually asymmetrical and sharply demarcated, and exhibit silvery‐white scaling.

The symptoms of scalp psoriasis can result in decreased QoL by causing pain, itching, bleeding, feelings of embarrassment, and restricting clothing choices (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014). QoL is more adversely affected in women than men, and individuals younger than 40 years are more adversely affected compared with patients 60 years or older (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014).

Common treatment options for patients with scalp psoriasis include topical agents such as vitamin D analogs, corticosteroids, and coal tar. However, these agents are challenging to use on the scalp because hair makes application burdensome, and many patients find them cosmetically unacceptable (Menter et al. 2011). These issues can lead to nonadherence and dissatisfaction with treatment options.

In a recent systematic review of topical therapies for chronic plaque psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy, and corticosteroid monotherapy were found to be more effective and safer than vitamin D monotherapy (Schlager et al. 2016). However, monotherapy with generic topical steroids may be acceptable for short‐term therapy due to the slim efficacy benefit of vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy over steroid therapy alone. Targeted phototherapy with an excimer laser can provide an effective alternative to topical therapy when used with a blower device that displaces hair (Menter et al. 2010).

### Efficacy and safety of apremilast in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp: results up to 32 weeks from a randomized, phase III study [^1f7831e5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

At week 32, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) total score improvements were maintained in the A/A group and occurred in the P/A group after switching to apremilast. The mean change (improvement) in DLQI total score was –6·8 in the A/A group and –8·0 in the P/A group at week 32, exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of four‐point improvement from baseline (Figure 1d). Subgroup analyses evaluating ScPGA response, NRS‐Scalp Itch response and NRS‐Whole Body Itch response at week 16 demonstrated treatment effects mostly in favour of apremilast vs. placebo in subgroups based on sex, baseline body mass index category, number of prior conventional systemic treatments and number of failed prior topical scalp psoriasis or shampoo treatments.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with awareness and attention to comorbidities [^c4d0500e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Definition — psoriasis severity criteria and scoring — Psoriasis vulgaris is described as a chronic inflammatory skin disease with well-demarcated, red plaques with silvery scale that commonly involve the scalp, elbows, knees, and presacral region, though any area may be affected including the palms, soles, nails, and genitalia; severity by body surface area (BSA) uses thresholds of < 3% BSA for mild, 3%-10% BSA for moderate, and > 10% BSA for severe disease, but psoriasis can be severe irrespective of BSA when it has serious functional consequences or occurs in selected locations (hands, feet, scalp, face, or genital area) or when it causes intractable pruritus; the Psoriasis Area Severity Index quantifies extent and severity by incorporating BSA plus intensity of redness, scaling, and plaque thickness, producing a score from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease severity), is used for monitoring response to treatments in clinical trials and as a research tool to judge severity, and is rarely utilized by dermatologists in clinical practice to guide management; cutaneous forms include vulgaris (plaque), guttate, palmoplantar, inverse, and pustular.

Table 2
Considerations for the treatment of psoriasis by body region

Recent advances in systemic treatments may benefit patients for whom topical approaches pose challenges. Through a more targeted approach directed at the underlying pathophysiology of lesion formation, new agents may offer greater efficacy in managing psoriasis of the head, flexures, and extremities, especially compared with traditional systemic agents that have limited distribution to certain areas. The development of biologic agents that target cytokines downstream of tumor necrosis factor‐α could produce more rapid and more complete clearing of psoriatic lesions than current therapies. The implication of IL‐17 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has led to the development of new therapeutics aimed at IL‐17 blockade, and these agents (e.g. secukinumab, ixekizumab) have strong efficacy and good safety in late‐phase clinical trials for moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis (Langley et al. 2014; Leonardi et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2013; Papp et al. 2012). Additionally, the expression of IL‐17A is increased in the palms and soles of patients with palmoplantar pustular psoriasis, and targeting of IL‐17A with secukinumab is efficacious in patients with moderate‐to‐severe palmoplantar psoriasis (Bissonnette et al. 2014; Gottlieb et al. 2017). In contrast, targeting IL‐12/23 has limited efficacy in palmoplantar psoriasis (Bissonnette et al. 2014). Secukinumab also significantly improved moderate‐to‐severe scalp psoriasis in a prospective phase 3b trial (Bagel et al. 2017). Results are awaited from a prospective phase 3 trial of secukinumab in nail psoriasis (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01807520; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02267135).

### Safety and efficacy of calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in the treatment of extensive scalp psoriasis in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years [^8a44fa7f]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

A treatment success rate (according to the IGA) of 55% was achieved in this study. In adult studies in scalp psoriasis, 68% to 72% of patients achieved treatment success according to the IGA at week 8, although eligibility criteria tended to include all disease severities and ≥ 10% total scalp involvement –. The 58% treatment success according to the PaGA achieved here compares with 69% to 83% in 8-week studies in adults –. Treatment success was already demonstrated by week 2, at which point 45% of patients reported treatment success (PaGA) and 32% were assessed as showing treatment success by the investigator (IGA). The evidence of early efficacy of the fixed-combination topical suspension in adolescents is consistent with findings in adult studies –.

Clinically relevant relief of pruritus, as assessed by patients, was also observed in this study, with 90% reporting mild or no itching by the end of treatment, compared with 65% at baseline. Pruritus is a common distressing aspect of psoriasis, and it may be particularly disturbing on the scalp. It can cause pronounced discomfort, often associated with a loss of sleep, and can negatively affect daily activities, such as the ability to attend school or work and a reduction in productivity. Alleviation of pruritus can therefore afford significant improvement to a patient's quality of life and is an important feature of symptom relief with the calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension that goes beyond the direct objective of improving skin lesions.

Data concerning topical psoriasis treatments in adolescent patients are limited. Only four reported pediatric studies have investigated topical psoriasis products for a minimum duration of 8 weeks –. Calcipotriene ointment was well tolerated and effective in two 8-week studies in children ages 2 to 14 years and one 12- to 106-week study in 8- to 15-year-olds, although the latter included only 12 patients –. Calcipotriene ointment was reported to be of benefit over 8 weeks in four adolescent patients (ages 13–17 years). In the current study we assessed efficacy and safety after treatment with calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension specifically in adolescents spanning the full age range of 12 to 17 years. Previous studies have included adolescents within the wider setting of childhood, not addressing this specific age group.

### Safety and efficacy of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel in the treatment of scalp psoriasis in adolescents 12–17 years of age [^92e9f108]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Topical psoriasis treatments are typically associated with low adherence rates and there is patient preference for more cosmetically elegant products. In this study, the amount of drug used was higher than that seen in adult studies (the mean weekly amount used over the entire treatment period being 36 g compared with 17–20 g in adult studies), and remained high throughout the treatment period, with the majority of patients adherent to drug application. This suggests that patients were not inconvenienced by using the fixed-combination gel, although interpretation is limited by the short duration of the study and the clinical trial setting. Such regular use of medication is encouraging given that adolescents generally have poor adherence rates. Poor adherence rates seen in real-world settings have recently been reviewed, and recommendations include employing a patient-centric approach to improve adherence to topical psoriasis therapies.

In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel is a well-tolerated and effective once-daily treatment regimen for scalp psoriasis vulgaris in adolescents. This study is one of two (the other being U.S. A. based) to assess the safety and efficacy of the topical gel in adolescents with at least moderate scalp psoriasis.

### Psoriasis: a review… [^63845e92]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Observations Plaque psoriasis is the most common variant of psoriasis. The most rapid advancements addressing plaque psoriasis have been in its pathogenesis, genetics, comorbidities, and biologic treatments. Plaque psoriasis is associated with a number of comorbidities including psoriatic arthritis, cardiometabolic diseases, and depression. For patients with mild psoriasis, topical agents remain the mainstay of treatment, and they include topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, calcineurin inhibitors, and keratolytics. The American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines recommend biologics as an option for first-line treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis because of their efficacy in treating it and acceptable safety profiles. Specifically, inhibitors to tumor necrosis factor α include etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, and infliximab.

Other biologics inhibit cytokines such as the p40 subunit of the cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, IL-17, and the p19 subunit of IL-23. Biologics that inhibit TNF-α, p40IL-12/23, and IL-17 are also approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Oral treatments include traditional agents such as methotrexate, acitretin, cyclosporine, and the advanced small molecule apremilast, which is a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor. The most commonly prescribed light therapy used to treat plaque psoriasis is narrowband UV-B phototherapy. Conclusions and Relevance Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease that is associated with multiple comorbidities and substantially diminishes patients' quality of life. Topical therapies remain the cornerstone for treating mild psoriasis.

Therapeutic advancements for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis include biologics that inhibit TNF-α, p40IL-12/23, IL-17, and p19IL-23, as well as an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Effectiveness of ixekizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis with involvement of difficult-to-treat areas: a 52-week multicenter retrospective study [^ab83377e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biological drugs have dramatically changed the approach to treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, achieving excellent skin clearance and safety outcomes. However, the management of difficult-to-treat areas (e.g., scalp, palms/soles, nails, and genitalia) still represents a challenge in psoriasis treatment. Data in the literature on difficult-to-treat sites are limited and, frequently, no specific analysis is performed during clinical trials. We conducted a 52-week, retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of ixekizumab in 120 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of at least one difficult-to-treat area (scalp, palmoplantar surfaces, nails, and genitalia). Ninety-nine patients had scalp psoriasis, 35 had involvement of the palms or soles, 27 were affected by genital psoriasis, and 22 patients reported involvement of the nails. After 1year of treatment, 96% of patients with scalp involvement, 95.6% of patients with palmoplantar psoriasis, 95.2% of patients with genital psoriasis, and 85% of patients with nail involvement achieved a site-specific Physician's Global Assessment of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear). No serious adverse events were observed during the study. Our study supports the effectiveness of ixekizumab in plaque psoriasis involving difficult-to-treat sites.

Abstract

Biological drugs have dramatically changed the approach to treating moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis, achieving excellent skin clearance and safety outcomes. However, the management of difficult‐to‐treat areas (e.g. scalp, palms/soles, nails, and genitalia) still represents a challenge in psoriasis treatment. Data in the literature on difficult‐to‐treat sites are limited and, frequently, no specific analysis is performed during clinical trials. We conducted a 52‐week, retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of ixekizumab in 120 patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis of at least one difficult‐to‐treat area (scalp, palmoplantar surfaces, nails, and genitalia). Ninety‐nine patients had scalp psoriasis, 35 had involvement of the palms or soles, 27 were affected by genital psoriasis, and 22 patients reported involvement of the nails. After 1 year of treatment, 96% of patients with scalp involvement, 95.6% of patients with palmoplantar psoriasis, 95.2% of patients with genital psoriasis, and 85% of patients with nail involvement achieved a site‐specific Physician's Global Assessment of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear). No serious adverse events were observed during the study. Our study supports the effectiveness of ixekizumab in plaque psoriasis involving difficult‐to‐treat sites.

Targeted, systemic treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, ixekizumab, secukinumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, and apremilast effectively improved symptoms of nail psoriasis (Table 1) (Langley et al. 2015; Merola, Tatulych, et al. 2016; Ortonne et al. 2013; Paul et al. 2014, 2012; Rich et al. 2014, 2016; Thaci et al. 2015; van de Kerkhof et al. 2017). Results suggest that these patients could benefit from new agents that produce high levels of clearance in shorter periods. In 2015, the National Psoriasis Foundation issued the following best practice recommendations for the treatment of nail psoriasis (Crowley, Weinberg, Wu, Robertson, & Van Voorhees, 2015). For patients with psoriasis limited to the nails, high‐potency topical corticosteroids alone or in combination with calcipotriol were highly recommended, and intralesional corticosteroids can be considered. For patients with psoriasis limited to the nails who had failed topical therapy, the following therapies were recommended in order of preference: adalimumab, etanercept, intralesional corticosteroids, ustekinumab, methotrexate, and acitretin (Crowley et al. 2015). Although biologics are the most effective option for nail psoriasis, their price can limit their use (Demirsoy et al. 2013).

Nail psoriasis can be challenging to treat. Frequently, patients will first be treated with topical steroids, but this is often not sufficient. Intralesional corticosteroids are effective, but painful. Radiotherapy, although not frequently employed, can be used for nonresponsive nails. In cases of severe nail psoriasis, systemic treatments — of which biologics are most effective — can be used.

### Guselkumab for moderate to severe scalp psoriasis across all skin tones: cohort B of the VISIBLE randomized clinical trial [^8e86cc70]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

Cohort B of the VISIBLE randomized clinical trial enrolled participants from 45 sites (32 in the US and 13 in Canada). The protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by appropriate institutional review boards or independent ethics committees. Advarra in Columbia, Maryland, is the central US institutional review board. Prior to any study-related activity, all participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, current Good Clinical Practice, and International Council on Harmonisation guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and sponsor policy. We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline. Data were collected from September 2022 to June 2024.

The primary objectives of VISIBLE Cohort B were to evaluate guselkumab efficacy and safety vs placebo in participants with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis. The study was designed to enroll at least 50% of participants with Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) IV to VI.

Detailed inclusion criteria have been reported previously. Briefly, VISIBLE Cohort B included participants (18 years or older) who self-identified their race or ethnicity as a category other than White and who had one of the following: (1) a diagnosis of plaque psoriasis (with or without psoriatic arthritis) for at least 6 months before the first administration of study drug, (2) an expert panel–confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis based on clinical photographs, or (3) biopsy-confirmed psoriasis. Participants reported race or ethnicity using a questionnaire that included predefined categories and the option for open-ended response. Participants in VISIBLE Cohort B were required to have moderate to severe scalp psoriasis, defined as scalp surface area (SSA) involvement of at least 30%, Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) of at least 12, and scalp-specific Investigator's Global Assessment (ss-IGA) of at least 3, and were candidates for phototherapy or systemic treatment for psoriasis. There were no minimum requirements for overall body surface area (BSA) involvement, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), or IGA, but participants were required to have at least 1 psoriasis plaque outside the scalp to ensure differentiation from other scalp disorders, including seborrheic dermatitis.

### Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for psoriasis of the scalp and body: the ARRECTOR phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^b9261896]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Clinical data for roflumilast demonstrates its safety and efficacy as a once-daily cream or foam for long-term management of various dermatologic conditions, including chronic plaque psoriasis (cream, 0.3%), atopic dermatitis (cream, 0.15% and 0.05%), and seborrheic dermatitis (foam, 0.3%). Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, was adapted from the high-water content formulation (approximately 48% water) of roflumilast cream, 0.3%, and includes addition of a propellant. Roflumilast foam differs from other topical foam formulations because it contains excipients that maintain the skin barrier, are used in cosmetic products but are novel to prescription topical products, and ensure its suitability for a wide variety of skin and hair types. Additionally, roflumilast foam does not contain ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, formaldehyde-releasing agents, or fragrances that can irritate skin, damage hair, or lead to contact sensitization.

In a phase 2b trial for psoriasis of the scalp and body, roflumilast foam, 0.3%, was well tolerated and improved patients' psoriasis signs and symptoms, including pruritus. The objective of this phase 3 trial was to assess efficacy and safety of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, vs vehicle administered once daily for 8 weeks in adolescent and adult patients with psoriasis of the scalp and body.

### Risankizumab shows high efficacy and maintenance in improvement of response until week 52 [^38a157bd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The scalp, folds, palms, nails, and genitals have traditionally been considered difficult sites in the treatment of psoriasis due to the reduced efficacy or difficult application of topical treatment. Systemic treatment including biological treatment should lead to better results in these sites. Hjuler et al. in an observational study found that sites traditionally considered difficult responded well to biologic therapy, except for the scalp, identifying the lower legs and elbow as the most resistant sites. In our study a high percentage of patients had involvement of difficult sites (73%) compared to the registration and other real‐life studies, however, not all sites we considered as difficult were evaluated as such by other studies. In our population, there was no substantially difference between the population with at least one of the difficult sites involved and the population without the involvement of these, only in the achievement of PASI 90 at week 16 we observed differences (47% vs. 69%, p = 0.012). In two studies, Megna et al. showed that the scalp was the site with the best response to risankizumab, followed by the plantar‐palm area; only the nail area showed a slower improvement, without significant differences between each site. These results, in line with those shown by the UltIMMA‐1 and ‐2 and IMMhance studies, describe Risankizumab as highly effective on difficult sites in both trials and real life settings.

### Use of biologic agents in combination with other therapies for the treatment of psoriasis [^e17281ab]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, which affects approximately 3% of the general population in the USA. The most common form of the disease, plaque psoriasis, is characterized by the development of chronic erythematous plaques covered with silvery white scales, which most commonly appear on the elbows, knees, scalp, umbilicus, and lumbar regions. Psoriasis has been associated with a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life, due to the disfiguring effect of the skin lesions and, for some, the functional impairment resulting from joint pain. Additionally, individuals with psoriasis are more susceptible to specific debilitating comorbidities, including cardiometabolic dysfunction, fatigue, and depression.

The treatment strategy for psoriasis depends on a variety of factors (e.g. the medical history, tolerability of therapies and potential for side effects, and disease severity). Regarding disease severity, there is no commonly accepted definition of mild versus moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Moreover, a patient may have mild disease on the basis of body surface area (BSA) involvement, but localization of lesions in vulnerable areas (e.g. the face, feet, hands, and/or genitals) may warrant systemic therapy. Some guidelines provide specific criteria to help evaluate the severity of a patient's psoriasis, but all recognize the importance of assessing both the physical and psychosocial burden when considering the best treatment approach.

The US National Psoriasis Foundation recommends that patients with BSA involvement < 5% should be considered candidates for topical therapy, whereas those with BSA ≥ 5% should be considered candidates for systemic therapy alone or in combination with phototherapy. A "rule of tens" has also been proposed, whereby BSA > 10%, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) > 10, or Dermatology Life-Quality Index (DLQI) > 10 identify patients with severe disease. More recently, a European consensus meeting defined mild psoriasis as BSA ≤ 10%, PASI ≤ 10, and DLQI ≤ 10; and moderate-to-severe psoriasis warranting systemic therapy as BSA or PASI > 10 and DLQI > 10. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines present a treatment decision tree based on the presence or absence of psoriatic arthritis and categorization of psoriasis as "limited" or "extensive" disease, but specific definitions of these terms are not provided.

### Salicylic acid 6% in an ammonium lactate emollient foam vehicle in the treatment of mild-to-moderate scalp psoriasis [^a2c26126]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Scalp psoriasis is a common life-altering skin condition causing a great deal of distress. It significantly affects quality of life and is difficult to manage. Treatment can provide variable results, often impacting patient compliance with therapy. Salicylic acid is used as adjunctive therapy to other topical treatments because of its marked keratolytic effect. Its effectiveness as a monotherapy is not fully understood. An emollient foam formulation of 6% salicylic acid (Salkera) in an ammonium lactate vehicle has recently become available. Efficacy, tolerability and patient acceptability of salicylic acid 6% emollient foam were assessed in an open-label pilot study of 10 subjects with scalp psoriasis. All psoriasis severity parameters were reduced with a significant decrease in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) score from 15.3 to 3.0 after four weeks of monotherapy (P < 0.001). Sixty percent of subjects were either "completely cleared" or "almost cleared" of their psoriasis. No adverse events (AEs) were reported. All signs and symptom tolerability measures demonstrated statistically significant score decreases with the exception of oiliness severity and patient-reported burning tolerability. Salicylic acid 6% emollient foam provides a useful option in the treatment of psoriasis that is highly effective, well tolerated and acceptable to patients.

### Emerging paradigm shift toward proactive topical treatment of psoriasis: a narrative review [^e180f582]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

An alternative to continuous long‐term therapy involves rapidly gaining disease control with daily topical therapy and then stepping down to less frequent dosing. This approach has been demonstrated effective at maintaining long‐term remission. In scalp PsO, once daily induction with clobetasol propionate shampoo for 4 weeks followed by 6 months of twice‐weekly maintenance therapy was shown to prolong time to relapse by 141 days compared to a vehicle control. Studies involving fixed‐dose combinations of TCS and vitamin D 3 analogs also support a step‐down strategy to maintain remission in patients with stable disease. A large European and Canadian study in patients with scalp PsO demonstrated that twice‐weekly application of Cal/BD gel was significantly more effective at maintaining remission and preventing relapse compared to a reactive strategy (i.e. "on demand" daily application). A smaller study conducted in China compared once or twice weekly maintenance treatment with Cal/BD ointment versus calcipotriol ointment daily for 12 weeks in patients with stable body PsO. The twice‐weekly Cal/BD maintenance regimen provided comparable efficacy as daily treatment with calcipotriol, and both regimens were significantly more effective than once weekly Cal/BD ointment. Patients with limb or trunk PsO who achieved disease control after 8 weeks of daily treatment with Cal/BD gel were randomized to either maintain once daily treatment continuously or as needed, or to twice weekly treatment on weekends for a further 8 weeks in a small Korean study. Long‐term daily treatment used either continuously or as‐needed was significantly more effective at maintaining remission than weekend‐only therapy. It should be noted that this study had a relatively short duration of maintenance therapy (i.e. 8 weeks) compared to other long‐term trials.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis in pediatric patients [^9b5f7478]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric psoriasis topical combination therapy recommendations — strengths and dosing parameters are: The combination of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment applied once daily for up to 4 weeks at a time is recommended as a safe and effective treatment for children ages 12 years and older with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis (strength of recommendation B). The combination of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate suspension applied once daily for up to 8 weeks at a time is recommended as a safe and effective treatment for children ages 12 years and older with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis of the scalp (B). The use of emollients (at the same time or different time of day) with topical calcipotriene may be considered to reduce irritation and enhance the efficacy of calcipotriene (C). Rotational therapy with topical vitamin D analogues, topical calcineurin inhibitors, emollients, tar-based therapies, and topical corticosteroids may be considered in children as steroid-sparing regimens that may reduce potential adverse effects from overreliance on topical steroid therapy (C).

Psoriasis What is Psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disease that speeds up the growth cycle of skin cells. How is psoriasis diagnosed and treated. Psoriasis often has a typical appearance that a primary care doctor can recognize, but it can be confused with other skin diseases, so a dermatologist is often the best doctor to diagnose it. The treatment of psoriasis usually depends on how much skin is affected, how bad the disease is, or the location. Treatments range from creams and ointments applied to the affected areas to ultraviolet light therapy to drugs. Many people who have psoriasis also have serious health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and depression. Some people with psoriasis also have an inflammatory condition which affects their joints, called psoriatic arthritis.

Psoriatic arthritis has many of the same symptoms as other types of arthritis, so a rheumatologist is often the best doctor to diagnose it. The treatment of psoriatic arthritis usually involves the use of drugs. Psoriatic disease may be treated with drugs or a combination of drugs and creams or ointments. What is CDC doing about psoriasis. In 2010, CDC worked with experts in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and public health to develop a public health perspective that considers how these conditions affect the entire population. The resulting report is Developing and Addressing the Public Health Agenda for Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis. You can read a short article about the agenda in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Psoriasis causes patches of thick red skin and silvery scales.

Patches are typically found on the elbows, knees, scalp, lower back, face, palms, and soles of feet, but can affect other places. The most common type of psoriasis is called plaque psoriasis. What causes psoriasis. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, meaning that part of the body's own immune system becomes overactive and attacks normal tissues in the body.
