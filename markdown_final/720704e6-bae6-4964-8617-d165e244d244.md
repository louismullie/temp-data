## Question

new data on sglt2 inhibitors in ckd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the new data on SGLT2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease, including what has changed, how guidelines have evolved, who benefits most, safety nuances, and practical implementation details. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative recent guidelines and meta-analyses. Then, I should verify the pivotal trials that shifted practice. Next, I will examine risk-stratified benefits and safety signals. After that, I need to check implementation gaps and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and confirm key thresholds and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative sources anchoring current practice. The 2024 BMJ clinical practice guideline provides risk-stratified recommendations and is accompanied by a high-quality meta-analysis, while KDIGO 2024 and the 2025 ADA Standards of Care codify initiation thresholds and cardiorenal indications. The ESC and ESH also integrate SGLT2 inhibitors into hypertension/CKD care, and the UK Kidney Association offers pragmatic implementation guidance, so I should align conclusions with these sources to ensure consistency and credibility [^116Y6FA9] [^114ea2Wc] [^1113Xymz] [^112qgKSX] [^117ExuaL] [^116Zy5YB].

> Next, I should review the pivotal trials that truly changed practice. CREDENCE established kidney and cardiovascular benefits in type 2 diabetes with albuminuric CKD, DAPA-CKD extended benefits to non-diabetic CKD, and EMPA-KIDNEY demonstrated efficacy down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and included participants without albuminuria, which collectively enabled the broad, diabetes-agnostic indications we see today. I need to ensure I cite the primary publications and key subgroup findings accurately [^112RswSU] [^112kjQJi] [^11689eE4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal benefit; I should verify the risk-stratified absolute effects. The 2024 BMJ meta-analysis shows consistent relative risk reductions across outcomes, but absolute benefits scale with baseline risk: in very high-risk CKD, estimated absolute reductions include about 48 fewer deaths, 58 fewer kidney failures, and 25 fewer heart failure hospitalizations per 1000 treated over 5 years, whereas in low-risk CKD, benefits are smaller and some outcomes show little or no effect, reinforcing the need to individualize decisions and use shared decision-making tools [^113M6nP7] [^113iE1pn].

> I need to check the core guideline shifts and thresholds. KDIGO 2024 recommends initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in adults with CKD and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², particularly when albuminuria is ≥ 200 mg/g or heart failure is present, and suggests considering initiation even with lower albuminuria in eGFR 20–45. Importantly, initiation does not require altering CKD monitoring frequency, and the initial eGFR dip is expected and not a reason to stop therapy. The ADA 2025 Standards similarly endorse use down to eGFR 20 and emphasize benefits independent of glycemic control, which I should confirm explicitly [^1132dYfA] [^114ea2Wc] [^114sKiVq] [^1113Xymz].

> Wait, let me verify safety and monitoring nuances so I don't overstate tolerability. Across trials and meta-analyses, serious adverse events are uncommon. Relative increases in genital infections, euglycemic ketoacidosis, and symptomatic hypovolemia are observed but absolute risks remain low, and the initial reversible eGFR decline of about 3–5 mL/min/1.73 m² typically stabilizes thereafter. I should also note that SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce anemia incidence compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists, which is a useful secondary signal in CKD care [^113M6nP7] [^116APRys] [^112rrtEJ].

> I will now examine special populations and implementation gaps. Benefits appear consistent across diabetes status, baseline eGFR down to 20, and a range of albuminuria, though effects are attenuated in non-albuminuric CKD. There is emerging but still limited evidence in advanced CKD below eGFR 20, dialysis, and transplant, so guidelines generally advise continuation until KRT if already on therapy but caution about initiation in these settings pending stronger data. Importantly, real-world uptake remains suboptimal, with underuse particularly affecting women and other underserved groups, which I should highlight to guide equity-focused implementation [^113M6nP7] [^112VjVXT] [^117JpnvG] [^1149UZKH] [^112UTWFr].

> Let me consider mechanistic implications that explain benefits beyond glycemia. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce intraglomerular pressure via afferent effects from proximal tubular sodium delivery and tubuloglomerular feedback, lower systemic blood pressure, and may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation; these hemodynamic and metabolic actions plausibly underpin the consistent kidney and heart failure benefits seen across diverse etiologies, which helps reconcile why effects persist even as eGFR declines and glycemic efficacy wanes [^113vsjnm] [^1132wMib].

> But wait, what if I'm overstating the case for very low eGFR initiation? I should double-check the current stance. While some guidance allows continuation below eGFR 20 if already on therapy, initiation below 20 remains investigational pending ongoing trials like RENAL LIFECYCLE; thus, I should avoid recommending initiation in eGFR < 20 outside trials and instead frame it as a research frontier with encouraging signals but unproven initiation benefit [^112VjVXT] [^116A1hRH].

> Next, I should review how guidelines have evolved over time so the "new data" are contextualized. Early guidance centered on type 2 diabetes with preserved eGFR, then CREDENCE prompted expansion to albuminuric CKD with eGFR ≥ 30, and subsequently DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY drove adoption of the ≥ 20 eGFR threshold and diabetes-independent indications. I need to ensure I reflect this sequence and cite the key updates accurately [^112RswSU] [^11689eE4] [^112kjQJi] [^114GBnZa].

> Now, let me translate this into a practical, stepwise approach while verifying each step against guidelines. First, screen and risk-stratify CKD by eGFR and albuminuria and identify comorbid heart failure. Second, prioritize initiation in high and very high risk groups, and consider initiation in moderate and low risk with shared decision-making given smaller absolute benefits. Third, start at standard doses with no need to alter CKD monitoring cadence, counsel on genital infections and volume depletion, and plan insulin or sulfonylurea dose adjustments if used for glycemia. Fourth, anticipate and do not stop therapy for the initial eGFR dip. Fifth, continue until dialysis or transplant if tolerated, and reassess if prolonged fasting, surgery, or acute illness increases ketoacidosis risk [^116Y6FA9] [^1132dYfA] [^114xfYwD] [^116APRys].

> I should confirm the key clinical thresholds and caveats to avoid misapplication. Initiation is recommended at eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², with strongest support when albuminuria is ≥ 200 mg/g or heart failure is present. Effects on glycemia diminish as eGFR falls below 45, so glycemic dosing may require adjustment even as kidney-protective dosing continues. And while benefits persist across subgroups, non-albuminuric CKD has smaller absolute benefits, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly [^112VjVXT] [^114ea2Wc] [^114xfYwD] [^113M6nP7] [^112UTWFr].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise and reference-aligned. New data from DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY, integrated with updated meta-analyses and guidelines, establish SGLT2 inhibitors as foundational CKD therapy down to eGFR 20, independent of diabetes, with risk-stratified absolute benefits and favorable safety. Implementation remains the critical next step, with attention to equity, monitoring, and patient education to translate trial gains into population-level improvements [^116Y6FA9] [^113M6nP7] [^112kjQJi] [^11689eE4].

The latest data show that SGLT2 inhibitors provide **consistent kidney and cardiovascular benefits** [^113iE1pn] across CKD stages and etiologies, including in patients without diabetes [^113M6nP7]. Benefits include **reduced risk of kidney failure** [^113iE1pn], sustained eGFR decline, and fewer cardiovascular events, with the greatest absolute gains in higher-risk patients [^116Y6FA9]. Guidelines now recommend **initiating SGLT2 inhibitors** in adults with CKD who have eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², regardless of diabetes status, and continuing therapy even if eGFR falls below 20 unless dialysis or transplant is needed [^114ea2Wc] [^112VjVXT]. Safety is favorable, with low risks of serious adverse events, and the initial eGFR dip is expected and not a reason to stop therapy [^1132dYfA] [^116Y6FA9].

## Recent clinical trials and key findings

Recent trials have **confirmed and extended the evidence** base for SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD:

| **Trial** | **Population** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| EMPA-KIDNEY | CKD with/without diabetes; eGFR ≥ 20 | - 28% reduction in kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death [^112kjQJi] <br/> - Benefits regardless of diabetes status [^111jFD2C] |
| DAPA-CKD | CKD with/without diabetes; eGFR ≥ 25 | - 39% reduction in sustained eGFR decline, kidney failure, or cardiovascular death [^notfound] <br/> - Benefits consistent across subgroups [^113M6nP7] |
| CREDENCE | T2DM with CKD; eGFR 30–90 | - 30% reduction in kidney failure, doubling of creatinine, or kidney/cardiovascular death [^112dz9DV] <br/> - Cardiovascular benefits including reduced heart failure hospitalizations [^113M6nP7] |

---

Collectively, these trials demonstrate **consistent benefits** across diverse CKD populations, including those without diabetes [^113M6nP7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines have been updated to reflect the **growing evidence**:

- **KDIGO 2024**: Initiate SGLT2 inhibitors in adults with CKD and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², regardless of diabetes status [^notfound].
- **ADA 2025**: Recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for T2DM with CKD and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^1113Xymz] [^112TtxQw].
- **UK Kidney Association 2023**: Consider SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD patients with eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m², acknowledging limited but emerging evidence [^112jjyMz] [^112twXGq].

---

## Mechanisms of action relevant to CKD progression

SGLT2 inhibitors confer **renoprotection** through multiple mechanisms:

- **Reduced intraglomerular pressure**: By inhibiting proximal tubular sodium and glucose reabsorption, they lower intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration, slowing CKD progression [^113vsjnm] [^116LNTwJ].
- **Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects**: Modulation of inflammatory pathways and fibrosis contributes to kidney protection [^1132wMib].
- **Improved renal hemodynamics**: Enhanced renal blood flow and reduced oxidative stress further support kidney function preservation [^112zXgzN] [^1132wMib].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

SGLT2 inhibitors have a **favorable safety profile** in CKD:

- **Common adverse effects**: Genital mycotic infections, mild volume depletion, and a transient initial eGFR decline are observed but are generally manageable [^113M6nP7] [^116APRys].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare events include euglycemic ketoacidosis and acute kidney injury, with no significant increase in fractures or amputations [^113M6nP7] [^116Y6FA9].
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of kidney function and electrolytes is recommended, but the initial eGFR dip is expected and not an indication to discontinue therapy [^1132dYfA] [^116APRys].

---

## Subgroup analyses and special populations

Subgroup analyses indicate **consistent benefits** across populations, with particularly large absolute risk reductions in patients with higher baseline risk (e.g. lower eGFR, higher albuminuria) [^113M6nP7] [^116Y6FA9]. Limited but growing evidence suggests potential benefits in advanced CKD (eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m²), dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients, warranting further study [^112jjyMz] [^116A1hRH].

---

## Comparison with other CKD therapies

SGLT2 inhibitors provide **additive benefits** when combined with standard therapies:

- **RAAS inhibitors**: SGLT2 inhibitors offer additional kidney and cardiovascular protection beyond RAAS blockade [^112dz9DV] [^115orhaz].
- **Nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs)**: Combination therapy with nsMRAs (e.g. finerenone) is under investigation and may further enhance cardiorenal outcomes [^112HdPox] [^116qdivk].
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: While beneficial for cardiovascular risk reduction, SGLT2 inhibitors have more robust kidney-specific benefits in CKD [^112TtxQw] [^112VEpub].

---

## Current gaps in knowledge and ongoing research

Despite substantial progress, **gaps remain**:

- **Advanced CKD**: Further research is needed to clarify the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m², dialysis, and transplant populations [^116o4LHa] [^116A1hRH].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Longer-term data on sustained kidney protection and mortality are needed [^notfound].
- **Combination therapies**: Optimal sequencing and combinations with other CKD therapies require further study [^117C6qGi] [^1117MdRd].

---

## Practical clinical implications

Clinically, **practitioners should**:

- **Initiate therapy**: Start SGLT2 inhibitors in eligible CKD patients with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², regardless of diabetes status [^114ea2Wc] [^114sKiVq].
- **Continue therapy**: Maintain therapy even if eGFR declines below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², unless dialysis or transplant is initiated [^112VjVXT].
- **Monitor**: Regularly monitor kidney function, electrolytes, and volume status, and manage adverse effects proactively [^1132dYfA] [^116APRys].

---

SGLT2 inhibitors represent a **major advance** in CKD care, providing consistent kidney and cardiovascular benefits across diverse populations. Guidelines endorse their use in eligible patients, and ongoing research aims to refine their role in advanced CKD and in combination regimens.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) was updated in 2022, just 2 years after the previous update. The need for this rapid update is reflective of the recent and unprecedented positive results of numerous clinical trials aimed at reducing kidney and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) work group for diabetes in CKD, convened by the National Kidney Foundation, provides herein a commentary on these changes, particularly the implications for health care in the United States. Changes to the KDIGO guideline mirror the evolution of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists from purely antihyperglycemic agents to cardiorenal-metabolic therapeutics, and the lower estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥ 20mL/min/1.73m 2 for SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. New data have also brought the addition of the first-in-class, Federal Drug Administration-approved nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone as an agent to reduce cardiorenal end points. While there has been significant progress in innovation, there remain serious challenges to implementation, particularly in the United States where inequities in insurance coverage and high costs limit their use, particularly in vulnerable populations, ultimately widening health care disparities.

### Editorial: the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the management of chronic kidney disease [^117WbcGA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The kidneys play an important role in maintaining glucose homoeostasis through the production of glucose via gluconeogenesis. They not only filter and reabsorb plasma glucose, but also use glucose as a metabolic fuel. These physiologic processes have been studied for a long time but have become an area of renewed and intense research interest in recent years as a result of the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular outcomes and delaying the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The kinetics of glucose reabsorption was first studied in the early 1930s. These early studies demonstrated that renal glucose transport in the tubules can reach a maximum beyond which glucose is excreted in the urine. Wright et al. demonstrated in the 1990s that the SGLT1 and SGLT2 transporters are responsible for the glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

Phlorizin was the first inhibitor of the SGLT transporters, but it never entered clinical practice due to its gastrointestinal side effects and metabolism to phloretin, which inhibits glucose transporters. Phlorizin's poor tolerability and the molecular characterization of the SGLT transporters in the 1990s stimulated further development of small molecules that selectively inhibit the SGLT2 transporter. Interestingly, in hindsight, early studies demonstrated the potential of first-generation SGLT2 inhibitors to slow CKD progression. The first selective SGLT2 inhibitor, T-1095, showed profound reductions in urinary albumin excretion in experimental studies, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors could indeed protect the kidney. Further early evidence for possible kidney protective effects came in the early 1990s from elegant micropuncture studies using phlorizin. Pollock et al. demonstrated that single nephron hyperfiltration, which has been associated in experimental and clinical studies with CKD progression, is associated with SGLT2-mediated tubular sodium reabsorption and tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) in experimental models of type 1 diabetes. Intriguingly, Pollock et al. demonstrated that the hyperfiltering state could be reversed with phlorizin, supporting a potential role for SGLT2 inhibition in the treatment of CKD.

SGLT2 inhibitors

In addition to the benefits described for secondary kidney outcomes in SGLT2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), three dedicated kidney outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in CKD have been completed to date (Table 1). The first trial published was the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial. CREDENCE reported a 30% relative risk reduction for its primary kidney composite outcome (Table 1). The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) and the Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) trials quickly followed, thus establishing a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors for kidney protection. Importantly, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY included participants without diabetes, with lower eGFRs (baseline eGFRs down to 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and with wide variations in baseline albuminuria (Table 1). Subgroup analyses from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial found no heterogeneity of relative effect based on CKD cause or baseline eGFR. Similarly, a meta-analysis of large SGLT2 inhibitor outcome trials reported kidney benefit in patients with CKD or HF irrespective of baseline diabetes status or kidney function. In consideration of these remarkably consistent findings of kidney and CV benefit, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy for CKD by organizations including the American Diabetes Association (ADA), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE). SGLT2 inhibitors are currently recommended in people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibition is currently recommended once a patient progresses to dialysis or kidney transplant. However, a potential therapeutic role of SGLT2 inhibitors for patients treated by dialysis or kidney transplant is under study. The Renal Lifecycle Trial (NCT05374291) will assess the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney failure, HF, mortality and safety in patients with eGFR ≤ 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2, chronic dialysis or kidney transplant with an eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Conclusions

In individuals with chronic kidney disease, regardless of diabetes status, SGLT-2 inhibitors improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes and survival; associated harms were small. Absolute effects were anticipated to vary based on an individual's risk of cardiovascular and kidney-related complications, which might be estimated based on their baseline glomerular function and degree of albuminuria; individual level risk stratification is therefore warranted to inform clinical decision making.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: new horizons for rheumatologists [^112zXgzN]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

HOW DO SGLT2 INHIBITORS DIFFER FROM ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS?

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have long been used as standard of care therapy in chronic kidney disease, hypertension and heart failure and have well defined roles in the treatment paradigm. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby decreasing vasoconstriction of arterioles, and decreasing release of aldosterone. Normal aldosterone release causes reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the tubules followed by water. RAAS blockade leads to efferent arteriole vasodilation. By blocking aldosterone, ACE inhibitors decrease the effective circulating volume and blood pressure. Meta-analyses have identified particular benefits in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease with reductions in rate of progression to end-stage renal disease. In current practice, ACE inhibitors are standard of care for patients with proteinuric renal disease due to underlying autoimmune disease such as lupus nephritis.

As summarized above, the effects of SGLT2 inhibition are concentrated in the proximal tubule and downstream macula densa. SGLT2 inhibition leads the system to see a higher glomerular perfusion and as a result decreases intraglomerular pressure. ACE inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors target separate processes integral to modulating stress on the kidney.

Mechanisms, indications and common side effects of ACE inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors are summarized in Table 3.

### SGLT2 inhibition for the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease: a review [^117LBhtp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States and the world alike, and there is a great unmet need for treatments to reduce DKD development and progression. Inhibition of sodium/glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubule of the kidney has emerged as an effective antihyperglycemic treatment, leading to regulatory approval of several first-generation SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In follow-on clinical trials for the cardiovascular safety of the SGLT2 inhibitors, secondary effects to prevent or reduce albuminuria and decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate spurred further investigation into their potential application in DKD. This review summarizes the current understanding of mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors block glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule and improve systemic glucose homeostasis, the hypothesized mechanisms for kidney-protective effects of SGLT2 inhibition, and current recommendations for use of this class of antihyperglycemic agents in diabetic patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rates. Results of ongoing clinical trials in patients with DKD are eagerly awaited to expand knowledge of how SGLT2 inhibitors might be used for prevention and treatment.

### KDOQI commentary on the KDIGO 2022 update to the clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^116qdivk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2022 diabetes management in chronic kidney disease — key take-home directives are to initiate a multistep approach with lifestyle intervention and agents approved to improve cardiorenal metabolic clinical outcomes; prescribe a renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor (either an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and persistent albuminuria and titrate to the maximally tolerated dose; initiate a sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor in T2DM with CKD at eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 with indication to reduce risk of CKD progression, heart failure, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases regardless of whether blood glucose is already controlled; use a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) in T2DM with CKD with elevated albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) > 30 mg/g, consistently normal potassium, and already on standard of care therapies including an SGLT2 inhibitor, and monitor serum potassium and kidney function; use metformin in T2DM with CKD when eGFR is ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; use a long-acting GLP1-RA when individualized glycemic targets persist despite metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor or if these are not tolerated, noting that long-acting GLP1-RA therapies are also indicated for weight loss; and employ a team-based integrated approach focused on regular assessment, control of multiple risk factors, and structured education in self-management to protect kidney function and reduce risk of complications.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to SGLT-2 inhibitors, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate SGLT-2 inhibitors to slow the rate of kidney function decline in patients with an eGFR of 20–45 mL/min/1.73 m² and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio < 25 mg/mmol.

### SGLT2 inhibition in chronic kidney disease: a preventive strategy against acute kidney injury at the same time? [^115SB6bf]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are known to slow down progression of chronic kidney disease. However, theoretical concerns still exist that SGLT2 inhibitors could increase the risk of acute kidney injury. Heerspink et al. revealed that dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of abrupt declines in kidney function during the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. Their findings may serve to reassure clinicians prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117Rv4Kc]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — use of a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2; a glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist is recommended to reduce cardiovascular risk and kidney disease progression; and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) is recommended if eGFR is ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m^2, with potassium levels monitored.

### Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes: the size of the problem, addressing residual renal risk and what we have learned from the CREDENCE trial [^112dz9DV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a global challenge; progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with advancing nephropathy are a significant source of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. Until recently, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade was the mainstay of pharmacotherapy in diabetic kidney disease (DKD), representing a therapeutic paradigm shift towards interventions that delay disease progression independently of antihypertensive effects. However, a significant residual risk of DKD progression persisted in patients established on RAS blockade, highlighting the need for additional treatment options. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, originally licensed as glucose-lowering agents in people with T2DM, serendipitously demonstrated beneficial renal and cardiovascular outcomes in clinical trials designed primarily to evaluate their cardiovascular safety. The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial was the first to study the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on a primary composite renal endpoint of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal or cardiovascular death in 4401 people with T2DM and CKD established on RAS blockade. The trial was stopped early due to efficacy, demonstrating a 30% relative risk reduction in the primary endpoint in the canagliflozin group (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.59–0.82; p = 0.00001). Through discussion of the primary analysis from CREDENCE, and selected post hoc analyses, we review the significant benefits highlighted by this landmark study, its role in shaping clinical guidelines, and in re-establishing interest in interventions that reduce the residual risk of progression of DKD, alongside its interrelation with cardiovascular morbidity and heart failure. We also provide a brief narrative summary of key renal outcome trials since CREDENCE, which indicate emerging avenues for pharmacotherapy beyond SGLT2 inhibition.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Ei8NA]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended for high-risk CKD and for use at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for individuals at high risk of CKD progression, and for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. The eGFR limit is supported by major trial criteria (CREDENCE: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 300 mg/g; DAPA-CKD: eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 200 mg/g), analyses suggesting safety and effectiveness at eGFR levels of > 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and EMPA-KIDNEY efficacy in participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) primary prevention in diabetes — proven measures and GRADE trial findings: The only proven primary prevention interventions for CKD in people with diabetes are blood glucose (A1C goal of 7%) and blood pressure management. There is no evidence that the use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, or other interventions prevent CKD without hypertension or albuminuria, and the American Diabetes Association does not recommend routine use of these medications solely for prevention. In the GRADE study comparing liraglutide, sitagliptin, glimepiride, and insulin glargine, a total of 5,047 participants were enrolled from July 2013 to August 2017 and were followed for an average of 5 years; almost all participants did not have signs of kidney disease at enrollment, and no differences between the examined medications were observed, suggesting no unique reno-protective effects for prevention. Of note, the SGLT2 inhibitors were not included because they were not routinely available at study initiation.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112TtxQw]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are prioritized based on kidney and cardiovascular benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and type 2 diabetes to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management, while GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardiovascular risk reduction if such risk is predominant. Selection of glucose-lowering medications should also consider an individual's cardiovascular and kidney risks, effects on weight, adverse effects, preferences, and cost, and both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown cardiovascular and kidney protection.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition and diabetic kidney disease [^117QVXnV]. Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is now the principal cause of chronic kidney disease leading to end-stage kidney disease worldwide. As a primary contributor to the excess risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death in diabetes, DKD is a major contributor to the progressively expanding global burden of diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a newer class of antihyperglycemic agents that exert glucose-lowering effects via glycosuric actions. Preclinical studies and clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibitors have consistently demonstrated reduction of albuminuria and preservation of kidney function. In particular, SGLT2 inhibitors lower risk of congestive heart failure, a major cardiovascular complication in DKD. This Perspective summarizes proposed mechanisms of action for SGLT2 inhibitors, integrates these data with results of recent cardiovascular outcomes trials, and discusses clinical applications for patients with DKD. The American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes Consensus Report published online in October 2018 recommends SGLT inhibitors as preferred add-on therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, if kidney function is adequate. Results of the ongoing and just completed clinical trials conducted in patients with established DKD will facilitate further refinement of current guidelines.

### Editorial: the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the management of chronic kidney disease [^116LNTwJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the alleged pathways by which SGLT2 inhibitors slow progression of CKD is correction of hyperfiltration. Since the long-term benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are unlikely mediated by reductions in HbA1c and various types of kidney diseases are characterized by hyperfiltration, it is tempting to speculate on the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD without type 2 diabetes, as reviewed by Dekkers and Gansevoort. Previous studies have indeed suggested that the pharmacodynamic activity persists in non-diabetic conditions. For example, in nearly 400 obese individuals, canagliflozin reduced body weight, blood pressure and uric acid. Moreover, in 10 patients with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, reductions in both numerical and measured proteinuria were noted, although these did not reach statistical significance. Further mechanistic and clinical outcome trials are ongoing in patients with CKD. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD trial assesses the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD with and without diabetes. The rationale and the design of the trial are described in this month's issue of NDT. The Empagliflozin Kidney (EMPA-KIDNEY) trial is another large clinical trial to assess the efficacy of empagliflozin on major kidney outcomes. The results will increase our understanding about the position of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD without diabetes.

Should SGLT2 inhibitors be prescribed to any patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD? It is possible that some patients do not tolerate these drugs or use concomitant medications, such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors or loop diuretics that may impact the efficacy or safety of SGLT2 inhibitors. These questions are discussed by Neuen et al. in this NDT supplement.

After more than a century of research into the physiology of tubular glucose reabsorption, we are now entering a new era of kidney protection with proven effective therapeutic approaches that prevent clinically important outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is now up to the nephrology community to implement these treatments in clinical practice.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: slowing of chronic kidney disease progression in type 2 diabetes [^1172YXkg]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a widely recognised and growing concern among clinicians involved in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Practical approaches that prevent or delay the progression of this serious and costly condition are urgently required, particularly in the current era of COVID-19, for the benefit of people living with T2DM and healthcare services alike.

As the T2DM treatment pathway continues to evolve, an emerging role has been highlighted for SGLT2i therapies in slowing DKD progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). In this article, the Improving Diabetes Steering Committee discusses current data and the proposed mechanisms that may underpin renoprotective effects of these agents, as well as the potential value that SGLT2i therapies offer in delaying the onset and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The SGLT2i Prescribing Tool, previously developed by the Steering Committee, has also been updated to reflect much of the evidence discussed here. The Tool is included as a supplementary item alongside this article and can also be accessed online via the Diabetes Therapy website. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Cardiorenal protection with the newer antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115uKkyx]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem, resulting in significant cardiovascular and kidney adverse outcomes worldwide. Despite the widespread use of standard-of-care therapies for CKD with T2D over the past few decades, rates of progression to end-stage kidney disease remain high with no beneficial impact on its accompanying burden of cardiovascular disease. The advent of the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents, including SGLT2 (sodium glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, has changed the landscape of therapeutic options for patients with CKD with T2D, with demonstration of significant reductions in cardiovascular adverse events and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Several potential mechanisms exist through which these beneficial effects are achieved in both drug classes, which may be independent of their antihyperglycemic effects. This scientific statement summarizes the current literature on the cardiorenal protective effects with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with CKD and T2D. It reviews potential mechanistic pathways that may drive these benefits and summarizes the literature on adverse effects in patients with CKD and T2D at risk for or with established cardiovascular disease. Last, it provides practical guidance on a proposed collaborative care model bridging cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians to facilitate the prompt and appropriate integration of these therapeutic classes in the management of patients with T2D and CKD.

### SGLT2 inhibitors to slow chronic kidney disease progression: a review [^1147TWEn]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

One in seven Americans is at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). For decades, the only treatment proven to slow progression of CKD was the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Based on promising secondary kidney outcomes in the cardiovascular outcome trials with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, kidney outcome trials in patients with CKD were published for canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of PubMed using the MeSH terms "Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors" and "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic" and looking for clinical trials, meta-analyses, or randomized controlled trials in humans between 2015 and 2023.

Findings

Primary and secondary outcomes from CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation), DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease), and EMPA-KIDNEY (Empagliflozin in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease) are described along with complete descriptions of the patient populations studied.

Implications

This review describes the role of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in slowing the progression of CKD, describes guideline changes that have occurred because of these data, and provides information on how these agents may be used clinically.

In conclusion, the DAPA-CKD trial has enrolled a group of participants with a variety of kidney diseases and will allow assessment of SGLT2 inhibition in a broad cohort of patients with proteinuric kidney disease. While small mechanistic studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors exert physiological effects in people with non-DKD, including a characteristic haemodynamic 'dip' in GFR, the DAPA-CKD trial is the first to capture the effects on clinical kidney outcomes. In the context of other trials in this field, the DAPA-CKD trial will provide unique insights into how to treat patients with kidney disease due to diverse aetiologies.

### Gender differences in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease: a real-world database study [^1149UZKH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health burden, with its prevalence increasing worldwide. Renin‐angiotensin system inhibitors have long played a central role in the treatment of CKD by slowing disease progression and reducing cardiovascular risk. In recent years, sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as an important additional treatment option for CKD. Originally developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated robust kidney‐protective effects in large‐scale randomised controlled trials, irrespective of diabetes status, leading to their expanded indications for CKD management.

The global age‐standardised prevalence of CKD is higher in women. However, gender differences also exist in the management of CKD; women are less likely than men to receive a CKD diagnosis, seek medical care, or be treated with renin‐angiotensin system inhibitors. These disparities in CKD management may be partly attributed to gender‐based differences in the distribution of major risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. In addition to these physiological factors, social and structural gender‐related disparities that influence decision‐making by both healthcare providers and patients, as well as environmental factors, are also of concern as potential contributors to differences in CKD management.

Previous studies have reported lower prescription rates of SGLT2 inhibitors in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, raising concerns about potential gender disparities in access to evidence‐based therapies. However, limited data exist regarding whether similar gender differences persist in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors among CKD patients. A previous study suggests that prescription trends in CKD populations may be influenced by factors such as race, healthcare facility characteristics and gender.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the trends in SGLT2 inhibitor prescriptions by gender in a CKD population, and to determine whether women receive these agents at a lower proportion than men. Given the growing emphasis on gender differences in medicine, understanding these patterns is crucial for addressing potential healthcare disparities and ensuring optimal treatment strategies for all CKD patients.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^1144PpiY]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease primary care — SGLT2 inhibitor efficacy and discontinuation: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy is associated with a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure and all-cause mortality by 13–14%. A study reported that 37% of 96,345 Veterans prescribed SGLT2i discontinued use, and discontinuation was associated with increased mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. Subgroup analyses described benefits in non-diabetic, non-albuminuric kidney disease and with lesser proteinuria (UACR < 200mg/g), indicating a need for additional clinical trials. Discontinuation was more common in the placebo arm than treatment, suggesting SGLT2i was well tolerated.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: slowing of chronic kidney disease progression in type 2 diabetes [^113vNHVt]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a topic of increasing concern among clinicians involved in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is a progressive and costly complication associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes and mortality. Ongoing monitoring of the estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate alongside the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is recommended during regular T2DM reviews to enable a prompt DKD diagnosis or to assess disease progression, providing an understanding of adverse risk for each individual. Many people with DKD will progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), typically haemodialysis or kidney transplantation. A range of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions is recommended to help lower CV risk, slow the advancement of DKD and prevent or delay the need for RRT. Emerging evidence concerning sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) agents suggests a role for these medicines in slowing eGFR decline, enabling regression of albuminuria and reducing progression to ESKD. Improvements in renal end points observed in SGLT2i CV outcome trials (CVOTs) highlighted the possible impact of these agents in the management of DKD. Data from the canagliflozin CREDENCE trial (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) have since demonstrated the effectiveness of this medicine in reducing the risk of kidney failure and CV events in a population comprising individuals with T2DM and renal disease. CREDENCE was the first SGLT2i study to examine renal outcomes as the primary end point. Real-world studies have reaffirmed these outcomes in routine clinical practice. This article summarises the evidence regarding the use of SGLT2i medicines in slowing the progression of DKD and examines the possible mechanisms underpinning the renoprotective effects of these agents. The relevant national and international guidance for monitoring and treatment of DKD is also highlighted to help clinicians working to support this vulnerable group.

The commentary notes that the discovery of the cardiorenal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors has been a turning point for the treatment and prognosis of patients with T2D and CKD and that the magnitude of their mitigating effect on cardiorenal end points and consistency across trials is a rarity in clinical research; it also states that the CVOT with ertugliflozin did not meet statistical significance for its primary cardiovascular or kidney outcomes.

Treatments and medications

Several strategies exist that can help prevent DKD development and slow its progression. While healthy lifestyle changes are foundational, achieving optimal glycemic, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels generally require use of medications. A summary of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes is shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4
Clinical strategies to prevent development/progression of chronic kidney disease in people with diabetes. This figure was developed by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and reproduced with permission from KDIGO. Abbreviations: SGLT2, sodium glucose transport protein 2; RAS, renin-angiotensin system; CKD, chronic kidney disease

Current goals/targets for people with T2D are:
Manage glycemic control — goal HbA1C ≤ 7% (53 mmol/mol)
Control blood pressure — the ADA recommends blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg for people with diabetes, with a lower target (e.g. 130/80 mmHg) potentially beneficial for those with macroalbuminuria. KDIGO recommends treating to a target systolic blood pressure of < 120 mmHg, as tolerated, in people with chronic kidney disease with or without diabetes, but not those having had a kidney transplant or on dialysis. Measures to control blood pressure should include use of either: i. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or ii. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)
Manage cholesterol levels — ideally, low density lipoprotein (LDL) of < 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L), total cholesterol of < 150 mg/dL (3.88 mmol/L) i. Statins — used to treat high cholesterol
Lifestyle changes — weight reduction, increased physical activity, and smoking cessation

In addition to the beneficial effects that blood pressure lowering medications have on progression of DKD, other types of medications are also used to manage DKD in people with T2D. Table 2 lists classes, examples, and modes of action of these medications. Optimal management of blood glucose is the first step in preventing the onset of DKD. Both sodium glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have shown beneficial effects on DKD, such as a reduction in albuminuria or lower risk of new-onset albuminuria, largely beyond glycemic control.

### Renal and cardiac implications of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: the state of the science [^115hLpE3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the role of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), including the effects on renal and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes.

Data Sources

A literature search of MEDLINE databases (1964 through May 2018) was conducted utilizing key words sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and diabetes; additional limits for drug names were added.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Available English-language data from reviews, abstracts, presentations, and clinical trials of use of SGLT2 therapy specifically detailing outcomes on CV and renal disease in humans were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

This review will explore the role of the SGLT2 inhibitors on CV and renal outcomes in patients with T2DM. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: A paradigm shift regarding the regulation of medications for the treatment of T2DM has resulted in the need for CV outcomes data as part of the drug approval process. Reduction of major CV events and progression of nephropathy in patients with T2DM represent major outcomes of clinical significance. Few medications have been able to establish a reduction in these end points; data for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors are favorable in this regard.

Conclusion

The SGLT2 inhibitors represents a class of medications that reduce glucose levels via a novel and complementary mechanism. Emerging evidence suggests a plausible explanation for the observed reduction in adverse renal and CV outcomes in recent clinical trials. Questions remain whether these agents reduce renal disease risk greater than achievement of the same glycemic goals as other antidiabetics and whether CV and renal benefits are reproducible in high-risk patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Evaluating the overall renal outcomes of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^112TVhy1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition that affects more than 10% of the general population worldwide, emerging as the third fastest growing cause of death worldwide. It is often an asymptomatic complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D) that requires annual screening to diagnose. Until 2021, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) dapagliflozin was approved for CKD. Over the last 4 years, trials such as DAPA-CKD, CREDENCE, and EMPA-KIDNEY have demonstrated the renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD patients, irrespective of diabetes status, thus international guidelines advocated for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD patients. Despite well-established kidney protective outcomes advocating high levels of evidence for their use in people with CKD, the utilization of SGLT-2 inhibitors has been unexpectedly low in many countries. Additionally, a retrospective cohort study found that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors occurred among fewer than 4% of patients with CKD and albuminuria and patient-level factors may.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^115tnt21]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling > 30 000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^112VjVXT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease — recommendations and practice points include: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 with an SGLT2i (1A). Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m^2, unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated. It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): eGFR ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 200 mg/g (≥ 20 mg/mmol), or heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 with urine ACR < 200 mg/g (< 20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B).

### How do SGLT2 inhibitors protect the kidney? A mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^111jFD2C]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy by 39%, and the composite kidney outcome of doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy or death due to kidney disease by 46% versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease. Studies have also suggested that empagliflozin reduces the risk of adverse kidney outcomes across a wide range of kidney disease stages in patients with T2D and cardiovascular disease, and also in those with heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) irrespective of the presence of T2D. More recently, the CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression in patients with CKD. DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY included a substantial proportion of patients without T2D and reported consistent benefits regardless of presence of diabetes. This finding is supported by a meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor studies. However, the underlying mechanisms of these highly impactful effects remain incompletely understood.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes [^116o4LHa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is associated with high risks of premature chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular diseases, cardiovascular death and impaired quality of life. People with diabetes are more likely to develop kidney impairment, and approximately one in three adults with diabetes have CKD. People with CKD and diabetes experience a substantially higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Sodium-glucose co-transporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown potential effects in preventing kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes. However, new trials are emerging rapidly, and evidence synthesis is essential to summarising cumulative evidence.

Objectives

This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of SGLT2 inhibitors for people with CKD and diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 17 November 2023 using a search strategy designed by an Information Specialist. Studies in the Register are continually identified through regular searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies were eligible if they evaluated SGLT2 inhibitors versus placebo, standard care or other glucose-lowering agents in people with CKD and diabetes. CKD includes all stages (from 1 to 5), including dialysis patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the study risk of bias. Treatment estimates were summarised using random effects meta-analysis and expressed as a risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The primary review outcomes were all-cause death, 3-point and 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, and kidney failure.

Main Results

Fifty-three studies randomising 65,241 people with CKD and diabetes were included. SGLT2 inhibitors with or without other background treatments were compared to placebo, standard care, sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, or insulin. In the majority of domains, the risks of bias in the included studies were low or unclear. No studies evaluated the treatment in children or in people treated with dialysis. No studies compared SGLT2 inhibitors with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or tirzepatide. Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors decreased the risk of all-cause death (20 studies, 44,397 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94; I² = 0%; high certainty) and cardiovascular death (16 studies, 43,792 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; I² = 29%; high certainty). Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors probably make little or no difference to the risk of fatal or nonfatal MI (2 studies, 13,726 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.14; I² = 24%; moderate certainty), and fatal or nonfatal stroke (2 studies, 13,726 participants: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.30; I² = 0%; moderate certainty). Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors probably decrease 3-point MACE (7 studies, 38,320 participants: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98; I² = 46%; moderate certainty), and 4-point MACE (4 studies, 23,539 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96; I² = 77%; moderate certainty), and decrease hospital admission due to heart failure (6 studies, 28,339 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.79; I² = 17%; high certainty). Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors may decrease creatinine clearance (1 study, 132 participants: MD -2.63 mL/min, 95% CI -5.19 to -0.07; low certainty) and probably decrease the doubling of serum creatinine (2 studies, 12,647 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.89; I² = 53%; moderate certainty). SGLT2 inhibitors decrease the risk of kidney failure (6 studies, 11,232 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.79; I² = 0%; high certainty), and kidney composite outcomes (generally reported as kidney failure, kidney death with or without ≥ 40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) (7 studies, 36,380 participants: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.78; I² = 25%; high certainty) compared to placebo. Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors incur less hypoglycaemia (16 studies, 28,322 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; I² = 0%; high certainty), and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance (14 studies, 26,478 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88; I² = 0%; high certainty), and probably decrease the withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events (15 studies, 16,622 participants: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.08; I² = 16%; moderate certainty). The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on eGFR, amputation and fracture were uncertain. No studies evaluated the effects of treatment on fatigue, life participation, or lactic acidosis. The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors compared to standard care alone, sulfonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitors, or insulin were uncertain.

Authors' Conclusions

SGLT2 inhibitors alone or added to standard care decrease all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and kidney failure and probably decrease major cardiovascular events while incurring less hypoglycaemia compared to placebo in people with CKD and diabetes.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^112RswSU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial was designed to specifically address this evidence gap. The trial demonstrated that an SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin, substantially reduced the progression of DKD (doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD or cardiovascular or kidney-related death) in participants with T2DM and severely increased albuminuria who were already receiving RAS blockade. Indeed, CREDENCE demonstrated, for the first time ever, that a single intervention reduced the need for dialysis, transplantation or death due to kidney disease in its own right. A 2019 meta-analysis synthesizing the accumulated trial evidence provided further strong support for the role of SGLT2 inhibition for kidney protection in people with T2DM and that the combination of RAS blockade and SGLT2 inhibition should be routinely offered to patients with T2DM who have, or are at high risk of, progressive kidney disease, with the strongest evidence for canagliflozin.

In the face of these clear and substantial benefits for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, a number of other important questions remain. Who might benefit most from treatment? How should this evidence be applied in routine practice to maximize benefits and ensure potential harms are minimized? Are there other patient groups, aside from those with T2DM, who may benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors? Finally, how should these agents be used in combination with other currently available and future treatments?

Some of these issues, including SGLT2 inhibition in people with type 1 diabetes and in people with non-DKD, have been examined in this special issue of NDT. In this analysis we explore how select patient characteristics and how concomitant drug use might influence the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with T2DM and chronic kidney disease (CKD), discuss current guidelines recommendations and explore future research priorities in this area.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors represent a major step in the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with evidence from several large randomised clinical trials and collaborative meta-analyses indicating that this medication class reduces progression of kidney disease and kidney failure in a broad range of people with CKD irrespective of diabetes (DM) status, level of kidney function, or primary kidney diagnosis. Furthermore, SGLT-2 inhibition has been shown to improve outcomes in people with diabetes with high cardiovascular risk, and in people with heart failure across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction.

In addition to well-established efficacy, SGLT-2 inhibition has been shown to be safe, with few associated risks, which include mycotic infections, lower limb amputations and ketoacidosis. Importantly, serious side effects are rare, particularly among people without diabetes. A recent meta-analysis assessing the balance of risk and benefit in CKD indicates that the absolute benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition in terms of kidney disease progression, cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure, and acute kidney injury substantially outweigh any associated risks in the studied populations (Fig. 1).

Given these findings, there is a need to provide practical and pragmatic guidance for the use of this class of medication to facilitate rapid, effective and safe implementation in clinical practice. In 2021, the UK Kidney Association (UKKA) Clinical Practice Guideline: SGLT-2 Inhibition in Adults with Kidney Disease Working Group published a Clinical Practice Guideline on the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in adults with kidney disease in order to facilitate this, with emphasis on relevant large-scale randomised evidence for the efficacy and safety of SGLT-2 inhibition. This 2023 guideline presents updated Recommendations in light of new evidence from the recent DELIVER and EMPA-KIDNEY trials. This guideline's aims were to: (i) provide guidance on use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in people with CKD, focusing on the potential to modify risk of kidney disease progression; and (ii) support safe implementation of SGLT-2 inhibitors into clinical practice in people with CKD.

CLINICAL QUESTION Are sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors effective in reducing complications for people with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce the mortality risk in people with any stage CKD and type 2 diabetes. 1 Although it is unclear whether SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce major adverse cardiac events, they reduce the risk of kidney failure and kidney composite outcomes. SGLT-2 inhibitors also may decrease doubling of serum creatinine and albuminuria progression. SGLT-2 inhibitors may be effective in reducing the risk of some other complications for patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes; however, more studies are needed to better inform treatment decisions.

KDOQI — recommendation and prioritization for SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD emphasize first-line use in albuminuric CKD and prioritizing proven agents. The KDOQI Work Group comment with a strong recommendation supporting the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as a first-line agent for kidney and heart protection for those with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR ≥ 200 mg/g (≥ 20 mg/mmol). In Practice Point 3.7.1, it should be noted that use of SGLT2 inhibitors with proven kidney and cardiovascular benefits should be prioritized over others that have not demonstrated similar benefits.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the cardiorenal continuum: a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with T2D [^112MkXJ2]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The benefits observed in these clinical trials have been confirmed in real-life studies in which SGLT2i have been associated with significantly lower risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for HF, and major kidney events compared with other glucose-lowering drugs. In addition, this current understanding of the pathophysiological pathways of SGLT2i places this class of drugs in an individualized patient-centered approach and allows clinicians to intervene in different stages of the cardiorenal continuum.

This supplement summarizes all the evidence of this therapeutic change and reviews the role of these drugs from prevention to management of patients who have already developed complications, such as patients with HF and chronic kidney disease.

### Rationale and protocol of the dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (DAPA-CKD) randomized controlled trial [^116PrTTE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

How do DAPA-CKD participants compare with participants enrolled in other SGLT2 inhibitor trials? A minority of patients recruited into cardiovascular outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitors had CKD defined by eGFR or UACR. CREDENCE is the only trial to date that has recruited only patients with both type 2 diabetes and CKD. In DAPA-CKD, ∼90% of patients will have an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and at least 80% of participants a UACR > 300 mg/g (Figure 3). Considering that both a low eGFR and high UACR are strong risk markers for renal as well as cardiovascular events, it is expected that cardiovascular event rates in DAPA-CKD will be at least comparable to the prior SGLT2 cardiovascular outcome trials. In comparing DAPA-CKD with the two other SGLT2 renal outcome trials (CREDENCE and EMPA-KIDNEY), DAPA-CKD will enroll a broader population than CREDENCE; the latter included only patients with type 2 diabetes (Figure 4). The EMPA-KIDNEY trial, assessing the effect of empagliflozin compared with placebo, extends the inclusion criteria further and also enrols patients with type 1 diabetes and patients with UACR < 200 mg/g if their eGFR is between 20 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (Figure 4). Overall, these three trials will help to define the optimum use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of CKD.

### Defining the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in primary care: time to think differently [^115y9FH9]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Disease burden in people with diabetes is mainly driven by long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. This is a consequence of the interconnection between the cardiovascular, renal and metabolic systems, through a continuous chain of events referred to as 'the cardiorenal metabolic continuum'. Increasing evidence suggests that sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have beneficial effects across all stages of the cardiorenal metabolic continuum, reducing morbidity and mortality in a wide range of individuals, from those with diabetes and multiple risk factors to those with established heart failure and chronic kidney disease, regardless of the presence of diabetes. Despite this robust evidence base, the complexity of label indications and misconceptions concerning potential side effects have resulted in a lack of clear understanding in primary care regarding the implementation of SGLT2is in clinical practice. With this in mind, we provide an overview of the clinical and economic benefits of SGLT2is across the cardiorenal metabolic continuum together with practical considerations in order to help address some of these concerns and clearly define the role of SGLT2is in primary care as a holistic outcomes-driven treatment with the potential to reduce disease burden across the cardiorenal metabolic spectrum.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^112Eyqq4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The disconnect between glucose lowering and effects on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is a characteristic feature of SGLT2 inhibition. This is further supported by head-to-head data showing that canagliflozin slows the loss of kidney function compared with glimepiride and that kidney benefits are independent of HbA1c before and during therapy, and by the degree of HbA1c lowering.

Because the risk of ESKD and cardiovascular mortality increases substantially as eGFR declines, the absolute effects of treatment with SGLT2 inhibition are likely to be at least as large, if not greater, in patients with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 compared with those with preserved kidney function. In the CREDENCE trial, the estimated number of primary events prevented per 1000 patients treated over 2.6 years is substantially greater in participants with a starting eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Estimated number of primary events (doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD or cardiovascular or kidney-related death) prevented per 1000 patients treated over 2.6 years in the CREDENCE trial by baseline eGFR. a Absolute risk reductions estimated as the number of events prevented per 1000 patients treated over 2.6 years.

The accumulated trial evidence provides strong evidence that SGLT2 inhibition should be prioritized in people with T2DM and CKD, including those with a starting eGFR of 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Importantly, in the CREDENCE trial, participants whose eGFR fell to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 continued on randomized treatment until dialysis or transplantation. As a result, the FDA now permits the continued use of canagliflozin with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 until dialysis or transplantation in people already initiated on therapy.

### Use of SGLT2 inhibitors vs GLP-1 RAs and anemia in patients with diabetes and CKD… [^112rrtEJ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In this cohort study with 13 799 participants, initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a 19% decrease in incident anemia risk compared with initiation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. Changes in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell counts during the follow-up period supported this observation. Meaning The study findings suggest potential benefits for anemia incidence after SGLT2 inhibitor initiation in patients with T2D and CKD. Importance Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are associated with lower anemia risk, based on findings from post hoc analyses of the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trials; however, the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in a more generalizable type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease population, with active comparisons pertinent to current practice, is unknown. Results The cohort included a total of 13 799 patients with T2D and CKD, initiating SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs. Conclusions and Relevance In this multi-institutional cohort study with target trial emulation, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a decreased risk of composite anemia outcomes, especially anemia event occurrences. SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered as an adjunct therapy to reduce anemia incidence in patients with T2D and CKD. A meta-analysis of large clinical trials has shown that compared with placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a 38% reduced risk of kidney outcomes, 11 probably because SGLT2 inhibitors decrease diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration due to hyperglycemia. 12 In addition to glucose-lowering and beneficial kidney. effects, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to increase hemoglobin levels in patients with T2D and CKD.

13 Recently, 2 post hoc analyses of the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD. inhibitors under routine care compared with the participants in the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trials. 14, 15 Finally, these clinical trials compared the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors with a placebo group, leaving uncertainty about whether anemia effects were independent of glycemic controls and kidney function improvements after SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. Hence, further studies with more generalizable populations and active comparisons pertinent to current practice in patients with T2D and CKD are warranted. In this, Taiwan's largest multi-institutional cohort study emulating the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trials, we investigated anemia incidence associated with initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors, focusing on patients with T2D and CKD stages 1 to 3.

We compared SGLT2 inhibitors with GLP-1 RAs, which do not exhibit anti-anemic effects but are similarly positioned within the T2D treatment algorithm. 20, 21. The CGRD is an important data source that has provided clinical evidence for previous pharmacoepidemiologic studies. 27–29 Notably, the CGRD includes laboratory information, allowing the evaluation of T2D disease severity, enabling more precise results in comparative drug effectiveness research. The median hemoglobin level, hematocrit level, and red blood cell counts in the SGLT2 inhibitor group were similar to those in the GLP-1 RA group at baseline.

### Chronic kidney disease [^113vsjnm]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a progressive disease with no cure and high morbidity and mortality that occurs commonly in the general adult population, especially in people with diabetes and hypertension. Preservation of kidney function can improve outcomes and can be achieved through non-pharmacological strategies (eg, dietary and lifestyle adjustments) and chronic kidney disease-targeted and kidney disease-specific pharmacological interventions. A plant-dominant, low-protein, and low-salt diet might help to mitigate glomerular hyperfiltration and preserve renal function for longer, possibly while also leading to favourable alterations in acid-base homoeostasis and in the gut microbiome. Pharmacotherapies that alter intrarenal haemodynamics (eg, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway modulators and SGLT2 [SLC5A2] inhibitors) can preserve kidney function by reducing intraglomerular pressure independently of blood pressure and glucose control, whereas other novel agents (eg, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) might protect the kidney through anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic mechanisms. Some glomerular and cystic kidney diseases might benefit from disease-specific therapies. Managing chronic kidney disease-associated cardiovascular risk, minimising the risk of infection, and preventing acute kidney injury are crucial interventions for these patients, given the high burden of complications, associated morbidity and mortality, and the role of non-conventional risk factors in chronic kidney disease. When renal replacement therapy becomes inevitable, an incremental transition to dialysis can be considered and has been proposed to possibly preserve residual kidney function longer. There are similarities and distinctions between kidney-preserving care and supportive care. Additional studies of dietary and pharmacological interventions and development of innovative strategies are necessary to ensure optimal kidney-preserving care and to achieve greater longevity and better health-related quality of life for these patients.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease with or without type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113M6nP7]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Objective

To examine cardiovascular and kidney benefits and harms of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors stratified by risk in adults with chronic kidney disease regardless of diabetes status.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central from database inception to 15 June 2024.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials that compared SGLT-2 inhibitors with placebo or standard care with no SGLT-2 inhibitors in adults with chronic kidney disease with a follow-up duration of ≥ 12 weeks were eligible. Secondary analyses based on subpopulations from randomised controlled trials and publications not in English language were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Random effects meta-analyses were conducted, with effect estimates presented as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Absolute treatment effects were estimated over a fiveyear duration for individuals with varied risks of cardiovascular and kidney complications based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) risk stratification system. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

Results

Evidence from 13 randomised controlled trials (29614 patients) informed treatment effect estimates. In relative terms, SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced all cause death (risk ratio 0.85 (95%CI 0.74 to 0.98)), cardiovascular death (0.84 (0.74 to 0.96)), kidney failure (0.68 (0.60 to 0.77)), non-fatal stroke (0.73 (0.57 to 0.94)), non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.75 (0.60 to 0.93)), and admission to hospital for heart failure (0.68 (0.60 to 0.78)). No credible subgroup effects were found from diabetes status, heart failure status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and follow-up duration. Absolute effect estimates across these outcomes over a fiveyear period varied across risk groups based on baseline risks of cardiovascular and kidney events. Effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors in the group at low risk included seven fewer all- cause deaths, four fewer admissions to hospital for heart failure per 1000 individuals, and no effects on kidney failure. Effects in the higher risk group included 48 fewer all cause deaths, 58 fewer kidney failures, and 25 fewer admissions to hospital for heart failure per 1000 individuals. Although SGLT-2 inhibitor use was associated with a relative increase in the risk of harms, including genital infection (2.66 (95%CI 2.07 to 3.42)), ketoacidosis (2.27 (1.30 to 3.95)), and symptomatic hypovolaemia (1.29 (1.15 to 1.44)), absolute differences for all harm outcomes were small.

Conclusions

Among people who have chronic kidney disease either with type 2 diabetes or not, SGLT-2 inhibitors improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with varying degrees of absolute benefit depending on an individual's baseline risks of cardiovascular and kidney-related sequelae. Absolute benefits and harms stratified by risk and associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors should inform individual decision making at the patient level.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

In October 2020, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) published its first clinical practice guideline directed specifically to the care of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This commentary presents the views of the KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) work group for diabetes in CKD, convened by the National Kidney Foundation to provide an independent expert perspective on the new guideline. The KDOQI work group believes that the KDIGO guideline takes a major step forward in clarifying glycemic targets and use of specific antihyperglycemic agents in diabetes and CKD. The purpose of this commentary is to carry forward the conversation regarding optimization of care for patients with diabetes and CKD. Recent developments for prevention of CKD progression and cardiovascular events in people with diabetes and CKD, particularly related to sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have filled a longstanding gap in nephrology's approach to the care of persons with diabetes and CKD. The multifaceted benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors have facilitated interactions between nephrology, cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care, underscoring the need for innovative approaches to multidisciplinary care in these patients. We now have more interventions to slow kidney disease progression and prevent or delay kidney failure in patients with diabetes and kidney disease, but methods to streamline their implementation and overcome barriers in access to care, particularly cost, are essential to ensuring all patients may benefit.

Stratification of risk based on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

The presence or absence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has typically been used to stratify absolute cardiovascular risk and identify which patients should be treated with cardioprotective therapies (i.e. primary versus secondary prevention). While this may be a useful approach for the prevention of atherosclerotic vascular events in patients without CKD, this distinction is probably of limited use in patients with CKD. A 2018 meta-analysis of the cardiovascular outcome trials showed that benefits for HF and kidney disease progression are consistent irrespective of a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Because individuals with T2DM and CKD are at very high risk of both outcomes, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors should be offered regardless, as suggested in the most recent clinical practice guidelines (discussed below). In CREDENCE, consistent protection against cardiovascular and kidney outcomes was observed for primary and secondary prevention cohorts, further emphasizing that stratifying absolute risk based on the history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease alone is short-sighted, particularly in patients with T2DM and severely increased albuminuria, for whom the absolute risk of adverse outcomes is particularly high.

SGLT2 inhibition with and without RAS blockade

The CREDENCE trial provided strong evidence that kidney and cardiovascular protection with canagliflozin is achieved in addition to RAS blockade, as the use of RAS blockade was mandated for entry into the trial. In comparison, there is less data on whether SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy is effective at slowing the progression of kidney disease, although subgroup data from the cardiovascular outcome trials appear promising. A meta-analysis of these trials found that kidney protection was consistent regardless of baseline use of RAS blockade, a finding limited somewhat by the fact all but ∼20% of participants were receiving RAS blockade. Nevertheless, these data provide some justification for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors without background RAS blockade in certain patients, for example, those with normoalbuminuric DKD, for whom there is somewhat less data on kidney protection at lower levels of albuminuria, or those experiencing hyperkalaemia, which occurs more frequently as kidney function declines. Reassuringly, no increased risk of acute kidney injury, volume depletion or hyperkalaemia were observed in the CREDENCE trial, suggesting that the combined use of SGLT2 inhibition and RAS blockade should be well tolerated from a haemodynamic perspective, if used appropriately.

### The impact of metformin on kidney disease progression and mortality in diabetic patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a real-world cohort study [^113qLMDb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are the leading causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and significantly contribute to ongoing morbidity. For the past two decades, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended metformin as the first-line therapy for T2D, owing to its efficacy, affordability, weight neutrality, and benefits in cardiovascular outcomes as well as its potential role in slowing kidney disease progression. However, the latest 2022 consensus on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, joint issued by ADA and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), also advocates for the inclusion of sodium-glucose -cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in all diabetes patients as part of the comprehensive approach to managing glucose levels and reducing cardiovascular and renovascular risk. Specifically, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended for all T2D patients with diabetic kidney disease and an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) above 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2, to mitigate CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events, regardless of baseline HbA1c, or metformin use. These recommendations are particularly crucial for patients with multiple atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors, established ASCVD, or diabetic kidney disease.

Substantial evidence indicates that inadequate glycemic control within the initial years following T2D diagnosis is strongly correlated with a higher risk of future microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as increased mortality. This "glycemic legacy" effect, consistently observed in both randomized controlled trials and real-world observational studies, underscores the critical importance of selecting first-line medications or combination therapies for T2D that not only optimize glycemic control but also provide significant cardiovascular and renal protective benefits.

In recent years, accumulating data has reinforced the benefits of metformin in improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes, even in patients with progressive CKD and eGFR levels below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Nevertheless the 2022 joint ADA and KDIGO guidelines, while recognizing metformin's superior efficacy in glycemia control, highlight a reduced efficacy in cardiovascular and renal protection when compared with SGLT2 inhibitors. Whether metformin offers additional renal protection and survival benefits when combined with SGLT2 inhibitors remains uncertain.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the real-world impact of a combined metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors regimen, compared to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors alone, on renal progression outcomes and all-cause mortality in T2D patients.

SGLT2 inhibition across different levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

The completed trials included participants with varying levels of baseline eGFR and albuminuria. In the three cardiovascular outcome trials, the proportion of participants with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ranged from 7.4 to 25.9%. In contrast, ∼60% of participants in CREDENCE had a baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Most participants in the cardiovascular outcome trials had levels of albuminuria within the normal range at baseline, whereas those in the CREDENCE trial were required to have a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio of at least 300 mg/g at enrolment. While protection against kidney failure with SGLT2 inhibitors other than canagliflozin remains to be demonstrated in the ongoing kidney outcome trials, the accumulated trial evidence has allowed for a robust assessment of the effects of SGLT2 inhibition in patients with T2DM across varying levels of eGFR and albuminuria.

The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is directly proportional to glomerular filtration, and thus glycaemic efficacy decreases substantially as kidney function declines. Because regulatory approvals for these drugs have been primarily based on their ability to reduce glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), SGLT2 inhibitors have largely not been approved for use in people with an eGFR < 45 mL/min1.73 m 2. However, in the CREDENCE trial, the effect of canagliflozin on doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD or death due to kidney disease {hazard ratio [HR] 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–0.81]} was consistent across all levels of kidney function down to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The effect of canagliflozin on cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke [HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.67–0.95)] was also not modified by baseline kidney function. While largely powered by the effects of canagliflozin observed in the CREDENCE trial, a recent meta-analysis of the four major trials showed that SGLT2 inhibition reduces the risk of progression of kidney disease across all levels of kidney function studied to date, including ∼30% proportional risk reduction in people with an eGFR of 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, in whom the glucose-lowering effect is almost completely abrogated.

ACEi or ARB

For the previous decades, ACEi and ARBs have been the mainstay of therapy for slowing the progression of proteinuric kidney disease. Numerous trials aggregated in meta-analysis have shown that both ACEi and ARBs reduce eGFR decline and progression to ESKD in both diabetic and non-diabetic proteinuric kidney disease (A3 or uPCR > 650 mg/g, uACR > 300 mg/g). These medications should generally be titrated to their maximally tolerated doses.

Patients with diabetes and moderate albuminuria (A2 or uACR 30–300 mg/g) benefit from maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB given trial data exhibiting decreased development of increasing albuminuria to A3. For non-diabetic patients with moderate albuminuria, less data exists for benefit of ACEi or ARBs, but patients still likely derive benefit from albuminuria reduction with these agents. ACEi and ARBs do not to have the same eGFR preservation in patients with non-proteinuric kidney disease, and thus are not recommended for this subgroup.

SGLT2i

SGLT2is initially started as glucose lowering agents for T2DM but were subsequently shown to have significant cardiovascular and kidney protection in large high quality RCTs. In a meta-analysis, SGLT2is even have kidney protective effects for diabetic patients without albuminuria. Thus, for patients with diabetes and evidence of CKD (eGFR > 20), SGLT2is are strongly recommended after addition of maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB.

For patients with non-diabetic kidney disease, SGLT2is were assessed in two large kidney outcome RCTs, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY. For non-diabetic patients with A3, SGLT2i exhibited similar kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality benefits as previous trials in patients with diabetes. Evidence for those with moderate-to-no albuminuria is limited to modest GFR decline attenuation, though does not appear to have significant benefit on the primary outcomes. Overall, for patients with non-diabetic kidney disease (eGFR > 20) and albuminuria, SGLT2i are also strongly recommended after addition of maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors for adults with chronic kidney disease: a clinical practice guideline [^116Y6FA9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors on survival and on cardiovascular and kidneyoutcomes for adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

Current Practice

Few therapies slow kidney disease progression and improve long term prognosis for adults living with CKD. SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated cardiovascular and kidney benefits in adults with CKD with and without type 2 diabetes. Existing guidance for SGLT-2 inhibitors does not account for the totality of current best evidence for adults with CKD and does not provide fully stratified treatment effects and recommendations across all risk groups based on risk of CKD progression and complications.

Recommendations

The guideline panel considered evidence regarding benefits and harms of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy for adults with CKD over a five year period, along with contextual factors, and provided the following recommendations:1. For adults at low risk of CKD progression and complications, we suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favour)2. For adults at moderate risk of CKD progression and complications, we suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favour)3. For adults at high risk of CKD progression and complications, we recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favour)4. For adults at very high risk of CKD progression and complications, we recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favour). Recommendations are applicable to all adults with CKD, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified typical risk strata of adults with CKD (from low to very high risk of CKD progression and related complications) using the classification system developed by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations. Effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors were interpreted in absolute terms applicable to different risk strata with varying baseline risks for outcomes of benefit over a five year period. The panel explicitly considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of starting an SGLT-2 inhibitor, incorporating the values and preferences of adults with different risk profiles. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multilayered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that allows reuse and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis (13 trials including 29614 participants) of benefits and harms associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors in adults with CKD with or without type 2 diabetes informed guidance. Among individuals at very high risk of CKD progression and complications, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors (relative to placebo or standard care without SGLT-2 inhibitors) decrease all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure, kidney failure, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. Among individuals at high risk, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors result in similar benefits across outcomes except demonstrating little or no effect on hospitalisation for heart failure and kidney failure. Among individuals at moderate and low risk, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors probably reduce all-cause mortality and non-fatal stroke, with little or no effect for other outcomes of benefit. Risk-stratified estimates were unavailable for outcomes of harm; the panel therefore considered absolute effects summarised across risk strata. SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with little or no effect on acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, bone fractures, lower limb amputations, ketoacidosis, genital infections, or symptomatic hypovolaemia, although a residual possibility of harms at the individual patient level remains.

Understanding The Recommendation

In order to apply recommendations, clinicians must appropriately identify adults with CKD, consider the underlying aetiology, and risk stratify them based on glomerular filtration rate (estimated or measured) and degree of albuminuria. In addition to classifying individuals into risk strata, further estimation of a given patient's risk based on the extent of their kidney disease and other comorbidities may be warranted to inform individual-level decisions and shared decision making. Available risk calculators may help estimate a given patient's risk of CKD progression and complications.

### SGLT2 inhibition for CKD and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes: report of a scientific workshop sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation [^112dxNJ4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes is the most frequent cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to nearly half of all cases of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy. The principal cause of death among patients with diabetes and CKD is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were developed to lower blood glucose levels by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule. In clinical trials designed to demonstrate the CVD safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), consistent reductions in risks for secondary kidney disease end points (albuminuria and a composite of serum creatinine doubling or 40% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, kidney failure, or death), along with reductions in CVD events, were observed. In patients with CKD, the kidney and CVD benefits of canagliflozin were established by the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial in patients with T2DM, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio > 300mg/g, and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to < 90mL/min/1.73m 2. To clarify and support the role of SGLT2 inhibitors for treatment of T2DM and CKD, the National Kidney Foundation convened a scientific workshop with an international panel of more than 80 experts. They discussed the current state of knowledge and unanswered questions to propose therapeutic approaches and delineate future research. SGLT2 inhibitors improve glomerular hemodynamic function and are thought to ameliorate other local and systemic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CKD and CVD. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used when possible by people with T2DM to reduce risks for CKD and CVD in alignment with the clinical trial entry criteria. Important risks of SGLT2 inhibitors include euglycemic ketoacidosis, genital mycotic infections, and volume depletion. Careful consideration should be given to the balance of benefits and harms of SGLT2 inhibitors and risk mitigation strategies. Effective implementation strategies are needed to achieve widespread use of these life-saving medications.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to SGLT-2 inhibitors, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that the initiation or use of SGLT-2 inhibitors does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy.

Conclusion

Looking to the future, clinicians working across primary care, diabetes services and renal services will need to collaborate effectively with commissioners to ensure that the diagnosis and ongoing management of DKD are prioritised and that colleagues are appropriately supported to implement this work. Equitable access to testing and monitoring services, alongside the medications that have been shown to be effective in slowing the progression of DKD, will be critical in protecting this vulnerable group and stemming the ever-increasing costs and HRQoL implications of kidney failure and RRT.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114xfYwD]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes — SGLT2 inhibitors have kidney and cardiovascular benefits, but their glucose-lowering effect decreases at low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and CKD increases hypoglycemia risk requiring careful monitoring with insulin or sulfonylureas. Dedicated kidney outcomes trials in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have beneficial effects on slowing progression of CKD and CV outcomes. However, their ability to lower glucose levels declines when the eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2. A secondary analysis of the GRADE trial found that insulin glargine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride did not prevent CKD when added to metformin in those without underlying CKD. Individuals with CKD are at high risk for hypoglycemia, and if treated with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, treatment needs close monitoring and adjustment as eGFR declines with education on hypoglycemia occurrence.

Renoprotective Medicines

Agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway (ACEi and ARB drugs) have demonstrated renoprotective effects in people with T2DM. These medicines are recommended by NICE for slowing the progression of DKD and are included in the current QOF (DM006, 3 points). The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group has also drafted guidelines for the management of CKD in people with diabetes (due to be published in September 2020). KDIGO recommends titration to the maximally tolerated dose of ACEi and ARB treatments for people with T2DM and increased ACR (ACR > 3 mg/mmol). Many individuals with T2DM may already be taking ACEi or ARB medicines for hypertension. Monitoring for eGFR reduction and hyperkalaemia is required when initiating or increasing the dose of RAAS antagonists. These drugs have been shown to reduce the relative risk of renal events by 20%; however, a residual risk remains for people with T2DM. The Steno-2 trial showed the benefit of intensive multifactorial treatment approaches (e.g. lifestyle changes, glycaemic control, RAAS inhibitors) on CV and renal outcomes in people with T2DM and severely increased ACR. It should be noted that, despite multiple interventions, 25% of those treated intensively went on to develop kidney disease, suggesting that there is scope for improvement in this area of T2DM management.

Published evidence from large-scale randomised trials and real-world studies supports the use of SGLT2i treatments in reducing the overall rate of kidney function decline and adverse renal risk among those with T2DM. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus on the management of hyperglycaemia in T2DM (Fig. 2), the new KDIGO guideline and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/EASD guideline each recommend the use of SGLT2i treatments for people with T2DM and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (G3a/G3b, Fig. 1), where the approved licence indication allows. These recommendations are based on subgroup analyses from SGLT2i cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) as well as more recent data from the CREDENCE trial (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation), the first published study to assess the effects of an SGLT2i agent on renal outcomes in patients with T2DM and CKD.

The study EMPA-KIDNEY was published by EMPA-KIDNEY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the trial question was: what is the role of empagliflozin in patients with CKD? In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the population was: 6609 patients (2192 female, 4417 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200. The key exclusion criteria were polycystic kidney disease; receipt of kidney transplant. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the interventions were: n = 3304 empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg/day) n = 3305 placebo (matching placebo). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes (13.1% vs. 16.9%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in hospitalization for HF or death from cardiovascular causes (4% vs. 4.6%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.07) Significant decrease in the incidence of hospitalization for any cause (24.8 events /100 py vs. 29.2 events /100 py; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95) No significant difference in death from any cause (4.5% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.08). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the conclusion was: in patients with CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes.

### Defining the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in primary care: time to think differently [^116NRvui]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), including dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycaemic therapies that can reduce glucose levels independent of insulin, when estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is sufficient. Their main mechanism of action is the inhibition of SGLT2 function which results in a reduction of glucose absorption from the glomerular filtrate in the proximal renal tubule, and an increase in urinary glucose excretion (Fig. 1). Given their glucose-lowering effects, SGLT2is were firstly licensed as treatments for the management of glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and as such are increasingly employed for this purpose in primary care. Beyond the glucose control benefits, in recent years there has been a wealth of evidence indicating that SGLT2is exert cardiac and renal protective effects across the cardiorenal metabolic continuum.

Fig. 1
SGLT2 inhibitor cardiorenal metabolic effects. The figure summarizes main mechanisms of action and beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors across the cardiorenal metabolic spectrum, including reduction of CV events, renal protection, and improvement of metabolic control in diabetes. CKD chronic kidney disease, CV cardiovascular, CVD cardiovascular disease, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, ESKD end-stage kidney disease, HbA1c glycated haemoglobin, HHF hospitalisation for heart failure, MACE major adverse cardiovascular event, T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus

This has led to new treatment paradigms for SGLT2is including secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease and delaying progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with T2DM, as well as managing heart failure (HF) and CKD, regardless of the presence of diabetes.

The mechanisms behind the CV and renal protection associated with SGLT2is are likely to be multifactorial and are not yet fully elucidated. However, it has been suggested that osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, with subsequent reduction in volume overload and reduced blood pressure, together with a reduction in intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration, may play a role. In addition, metabolic effects (e.g. increases in glucosuria and reductions in HbA1c, glucotoxicity, weight gain and adiposity), improved cardiac remodelling, cardiac contractility and ion-homeostasis, as well as reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress are also likely to contribute to the observed cardiorenal benefits (Fig. 1).

### Concordance with screening and treatment guidelines for CKD in type 2 diabetes… [^112ToAWT]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

ACEI indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; CKD, chronic kidney disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; FDA, US Food and Drug Administration; PCORnet, Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network; SGLT2, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2; T2D, type 2 diabetes; UACR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A separate analysis reviewed prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in adults with CKD and an outpatient clinician visit for T2D between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from July 8, 2022, through June 22,
2023. Exposures Demographics, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results.

Main Outcomes and Measures Screening required measurement of creatinine levels and UACR within 15 months of the index visit. Treatment reflected prescription of ACEIs or ARBs and SGLT2 inhibitors within 12 months before or 6 months following the index visit. In contrast, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and hypertension were associated with a lower risk of nonconcordance. In 4215 patients with CKD and albuminuria, 3288 received an ACEI or ARB; 194, an SGLT2 inhibitor; and 885, neither therapy. Peripheral arterial disease and lower eGFR were associated with lack of CKD treatment, while diuretic or statin prescription and hypertension were associated with treatment. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of patients with T2D, fewer than one-quarter received recommended CKD screening. In patients with CKD and albuminuria, 21. 0% did not receive an SGLT2 inhibitor or an ACEI or an ARB, despite compelling indications.

Patient-level factors may inform implementation strategies to improve CKD screening and treatment in people with T2D. 2 inhibitors. 12–14 However, prescription rates range from 20% to 75% for ACEIs or ARBs and 0. 3% to 12% for SGLT2 inhibitors, 15–20 although UACR data could provide more accurate clinician uptake of these therapies by identifying patients with clear indications. Therefore, a cohort contemporary with US Food and Drug Administration –approved indications for CKD treatment is necessary to assess clinician uptake and identify risk factors for not receiving treatment. We characterized concordance with CKD screening guidelines in a nationally representative cohort, with the goal of identifying patient-level risk factors associated with nonconcordance. We similarly evaluated risk factors for lack of prescriptions for treatments to improve kidney outcomes in people with established CKD, specifically ACEI or ARB and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.

To accomplish these aims, we leveraged electronic health record data from 20 large health systems across the US that have mapped their data to the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network common data model. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. The treatment cohort included patients with T2D, CKD, and indications for ACEI or ARB and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. We restricted the cohort to those with outpatient clinician visits linked to a T2D diagnosis between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020, to coincide with the FDA approval for canagliflozin use to improve CKD outcomes on September 30, 2019. The primary outcome for the treatment cohort was prescription of ACEIs or ARBs and SGLT2 inhibitors. Full treatment required a prescription of both therapies in the 12 months before through 6 months after the index visit.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^1138nfFm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor initiation and practical considerations are noted, including that individuals with HbA1c in the low or normal range (eg, < 7.0%) might not be initiated on an SGLT2 inhibitor based on the KDIGO guideline. Trial context indicates that approximately 18%–25% of participants in large SGLT2 inhibitor trials and 50% in CREDENCE were not on metformin at baseline, and there are no post hoc analyses comparing outcomes according to baseline metformin therapy; therefore, in some cases, it may be reasonable to reduce or discontinue metformin to safely utilize an SGLT2 inhibitor from a glycemic perspective. The KDOQI work group agreed with withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during hospitalization or periods of fasting when risk for diabetic ketoacidosis is higher and to consider decreasing or holding diuretics in euvolemic individuals at initiation to reduce hypovolemia risk, and it underscores the expected initial decline in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. For implementation, KDIGO offers a clinical practice point to prioritize agents with proven cardiorenal benefit and acknowledges that therapy choice will depend on insurance and assistance programs, while highlighting current US uptake gaps where only 21%–50% of eligible people receive ACEI/ARB therapy versus 75%–80% in Europe.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefits in large-scale clinical trials of people who have type 2 diabetes and either established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors. These studies also indicated early signals in benefiting heart failure (HF) patients and those with chronic kidney diseases. This article reviews recent and future clinical studies that focus on evaluation of the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in HF management and renal protection.

### The RENAL LIFECYCLE trial: a RCT to assess the effect of dapagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with severe CKD… [^116A1hRH]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Rationale: Sodium glucose co transporter 2 inhibitors are a relatively new class of agents, originally developed as oral antihyperglycemic drugs. SGLT2 inhibitors are clinically available since 2012 for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. Later, SGLT2 inhibitors appeared to have also specific reno- and cardioprotective effects. Remarkably, the trials that have been performed thus far excluded patients with an eGFR below 25 mL/min/1. 73m2 at inclusion, prevalent dialysis patients, and kidney transplant recipients. This is unfortunate, because especially these patients are at high risk of reaching kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular complications and mortality, whereas there are only few proven effective therapies.

There is emerging evidence from experimental studies and post hoc-analyses of randomized clinical trials that SGLT2 inhibitors may also be effective in preventing cardiovascular and mortality outcomes in these patients with severe CKD, including patients receiving dialysis or living with a kidney transplant. For instance, subgroup analysis of the DAPA-CKD trial comparing 624 patients with an eGFR < 30 to the remainder of the trial population with better kidney function, demonstrated that the efficacy of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in reducing cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes persisted in the population with impaired kidney function. Furthermore, in the DAPA-CKD trial patients continued to use dapagliflozin or placebo when dialysis was initiated. In the subgroup of patients who initiated dialysis, dapagliflozin was associated with a relative risk reduction for mortality of 21%.

Finally, in kidney transplant recipients, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in lowering HbA1c, body weight, blood pressure and stabilize kidney function, and these agents were well tolerated and safe. Taken these findings together there is a sound rationale to study the long-term reno- and cardioprotective efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with severe CKD. There are two cardiac sub-studies: the cardiac MRI substudy and the echocardiography sub-study. The echocardiography sub-study is referred to as the "SGLT-2-inhibitors to Target Heart Failure in Peritoneal Dialysis" study. In STOP HF in PD the effect of dapagliflozin on cardiac function will be assessed in a subset of 100 patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

Objective: To establish the reno- and cardioprotective efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with severe CKD Study design: Multicenter, randomized, controlled, double blinded, pragmatic, interventional trial Study population:

- Patients with advanced CKD, i.e. an eGFR ≤ 25 mL/min*1. 73m2
- Patients on dialysis
- Patients with a kidney transplant and an eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1. 73m2. Intervention: Dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or matching placebo Primary outcome measure: Combined endpoint of all-cause mortality, kidney failure, and hospitalization for heart failure in the overall study population Study duration: 18 month recruitment phase, 30 month follow-up after enrollment of the last patient: Total study duration intended to last 48 months. It should be noted that the trial is event driven and will be terminated when 468 primary composite outcomes have occurred.

### Slowing the progression of diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease: a summary of the current evidence base for sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors [^1117MdRd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is approximately 9%. CKD is predicted to become the fifth largest global cause of death by 2040. Moreover, CKD causes disability, diminished quality of life and poses a high cost to healthcare systems. Delaying the development and progression of CKD is therefore of the utmost importance. Several kidney-specific outcome trials on sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2s) have recently provided a paradigm shift in the treatment of people with CKD, with or without diabetes, as these agents have been shown to reduce the progression of CKD on top of maximally tolerated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade. The relative benefit and safety of SGLT-2is seems to be consistent across ethnicities, ages and frailty categories; however, this needs to be tested in dedicated clinical trials. Guidelines make clear recommendations for the prescription of SGLT-2is and RAAS inhibitors as standard of care for people with CKD. Their combination with other newer antidiabetic agents may provide further benefits by targeting different components of CKD mechanisms. Dedicated randomized controlled trials are needed to test whether combination with other agents could extend the use of SGLT2is and identify people in whom a combination of drugs may be most effective. Increased efforts to implement the guidelines on treatment with SGLT-2is for people with CKD are needed, particularly in those at the highest risk of adverse outcomes and without type 2 diabetes. Moreover, strategies to target the equitable use of SGLT-2is are needed.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^116APRys]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Clinical utility of SGLT2 inhibitors — early eGFR changes, glycemia-related adjustments, and salutary effects are described. SGLT2 inhibitor initiation is associated with a reversible decline in eGFR of 3–5 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the first 4 weeks of therapy, after which GFR typically stabilizes during ongoing SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Because SGLT2 inhibitor therapy reduces blood glucose in persons with preserved eGFR, reduction of insulin or insulin secretagogues may be needed to avoid hypoglycemia in those with eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. These agents reduce risk of hyperkalemia, without causing hypokalemia, and mitigate fluid retention, and therefore SGLT2 inhibitors can facilitate initiation and persistent use of other guideline-directed medical therapies for CKD and heart failure.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: a deeper dive into their renal protective properties beyond glycemic control and proteinuria reduction [^11689eE4]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and associated with increasing burden on patients and healthcare system. Its complex causes and diverse manifestation pose considerable challenge in slowing the disease progression. Over the last few decades, the pharmacotherapeutic strategies have primarily focused on reducing albuminuria, managing complications, and alleviating symptoms. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, known for their glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits in diabetic patients, have shown promise in renal protection, offering hope for slowing CKD progression in a broader patient population.

Summary

The DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY trials have provided compelling evidence that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin reduced the risk of a series of renal events and slowed the chronic decline of eGFR in patients with CKD, irrespective of diabetic status. The results of these trials strongly support the notion that SGLT-2 inhibitors are effective in renal protection across CKD patients with diverse primary diseases and in varying CKD risk categories. EMPA-KIDNEY also demonstrated that empagliflozin can potentially slow CKD progression in patients without albuminuria, a finding collaborated by results from several other studies. The long-term cardiorenal benefits of empagliflozin were further demonstrated in the post-trial follow-up sub-study of EMPA-KIDNEY. The synergistic effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other drugs that have different mechanisms of action is being researched for broader applications.

Key Messages

Emerging evidence underscores the potential of SGLT-2 inhibitors to benefit a wide range of CKD patients, regardless of causes and albuminuria status. Further research in this area will improve our understanding of the roles of this new class of drug in renal protection and potentially shift the paradigm of CKD management.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^1119vw2p]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling > 30000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

2. External Validation by CGRD Database eReferences Data Sharing Statement AKI-D indicates dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury; HCO, health care organization; MACE, major adverse cardiac event; MAKE, major adverse kidney event; and SGLT-2i, sodium-glucose cotransport protein 2 inhibitor. Question Do sodium-glucose cotransport protein 2 inhibitors have beneficial associations with mortality, major kidney events, and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and acute kidney disease. Findings In this cohort study of 230 366 patients, SGLT-2i use among those with type 2 diabetes and AKD was associated with significantly lower risks of mortality, MAKEs, and MACEs compared with nonuse.

Meaning These findings suggest that the use of SGLT-2is in patients with type 2 diabetes and AKD is associated with reduced mortality, MAKEs, and MACEs, highlighting their potential clinical implications. Importance Sodium-glucose cotransport protein 2 inhibitors have demonstrated associations with positive kidney-related and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the association of SGLT-2is with outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes and acute kidney disease remains unclear. External validation using a multicenter cohort data set of 1233 patients with AKD patients who were SGLT-2i users confirmed the observed beneficial outcomes. Notably, the risk reduction associated with SGLT-2is remained significant even among patients without hypertension, those with advanced chronic kidney disease, and those not receiving other hypoglycemic agents.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of patients with type 2 diabetes and AKD, administration of SGLT-2is was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality, MAKEs, and MACEs when compared with nonuse, underscoring the importance of SGLT-2is in care after acute kidney injury. These findings emphasize the potential benefits of SGLT-2is in managing AKD and mitigating the risks of major cardiovascular and kidney diseases. type 2 diabetes experience a decline in kidney function even before the onset of AKI, emphasizing their combined association with CKD development. 7 Recently, acute kidney disease has emerged as a transitional stage between AKI and CKD, lasting 7 to 90 days after an AKI episode. 8–10 With the increasing incidence of AKI among hospitalized patients in various settings, 11 AKD is also becoming increasingly prevalent.

mechanism of action of SGLT-2is is to inhibit the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the kidneys, leading to a reduction in blood pressure, intraglomerular pressure, and albuminuria. 14 Clinical trials15–18 have demonstrated that SGLT-2is are associated with a reduction in the risk of progression of CKD, improve kidney function, and reduce the risk of death in patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted this study to explore the associations of SGLT-2is in a clinical setting of AKD among patients with type 2 diabetes. Using a longitudinal study design with a comprehensive global medical records database, we aimed to provide valuable evidence on the associations of SGLT-2is based on clinical data. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival probabilities, considering 2-sided P <. 05 as statistically significant. Risk analyses assessed the relative risks of adverse outcomes.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD: are they really effective in all patients? [^111hWkPQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors effectively slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce cardiovascular events. However, their efficacy across all CKD subgroups remains uncertain. Major clinical trials primarily included overweight or obese patients with advanced CKD, where sodium retention, volume expansion, and glomerular hyperfiltration are key disease drivers. In contrast, many underrepresented CKD subgroups, such as Alport syndrome or most immune-mediated glomerular disorders often affect lean individuals whose CKD progression is not linked to these mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that the renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors may depend on body mass index (BMI), with greater effects observed in patients with higher BMI, while those with BMI < 25 may show minimal/no benefit. This raises concerns about their applicability in lean, non-diabetic CKD patients, whose disease progression may involve alternative pathways, such as inflammation, autoimmunity, or genetic abnormalities. Animal studies further suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors provide limited renal protection in certain genetic and immune-mediated kidney diseases. Additionally, molecular data indicate that SGLT2 expression is predominantly restricted to the proximal tubule, implying a limited role in CKD driven by non-hyperfiltration mechanisms. While SGLT2 inhibitors have revolutionized CKD treatment in diabetes, obesity, and heart failure, their role in lean, non-diabetic patients remains unclear. Dedicated clinical trials are needed to assess their efficacy in underrepresented CKD subgroups and ensure evidence-based, personalized treatment strategies.

### Implementation of chronic kidney disease guidelines for sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor use in primary care in the UK: a cross-sectional study [^117JpnvG]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The protective cardiovascular and kidney effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in individuals with and without diabetes have been well established in randomised controlled trials. These findings represent a major therapeutic advance in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD), providing a unique opportunity to simultaneously manage cardiovascular risk and kidney disease progression. This has prompted updates to SGLT2 inhibitor drug licences and the publication of clinical guidelines relating to their use in CKD.

The most comprehensive of these is the United Kingdom Kidney Association (UKKA) Clinical Practice Guideline, initially published in October 2021and updated in April 2023. This makes clear recommendations for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in different groups with CKD, including people with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D), with and without albuminuria, and those with established heart failure or ischaemic heart disease. Additionally, guidance specific to the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with co-existing CKD and T2D has been published by various organisations, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and American Diabetes Association (ADA).

The extension of drug licences and publication of updated clinical guidelines relating to the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD are important milestones. However, the successful implementation of these guidelines into routine clinical practice is key to ensuring that the cardio-renal protection offered by these drugs is translated into improvements in cardiovascular and kidney health for people with CKD in real-world clinical practice. There are limited data on the number of people with CKD in routine clinical practice who meet the latest guideline directed indications for treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors. Moreover, the prescribing patterns of SGLT2 inhibitors in response to these updated guidelines in the real-world CKD population remains largely unknown. Understanding treatment opportunity gaps, highlighting potential barriers and disparities are essential in guiding the successful implementation of SGLT2 inhibitor guidelines.

The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which the latest SGLT2 inhibitor guidelines apply to and are then implemented in adults with CKD in real-world clinical practice.

The main objectives were to:
1) estimate the proportion of the CKD population that met guideline directed indications for SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, and examine reasons why individuals were not indicated for treatment,
2) estimate the proportion of the CKD population indicated for treatment who were prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor, and
3) describe the characteristics of the CKD population with an indication for treatment, and explore factors associated with SGLT2 inhibitor prescribing.
