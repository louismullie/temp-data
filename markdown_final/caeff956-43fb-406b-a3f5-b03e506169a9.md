## Question

What is the recommended buprenorphine dosing for fentanyl withdrawal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what buprenorphine dosing is recommended for fentanyl withdrawal, including how to initiate and titrate treatment, how to mitigate precipitated withdrawal, and when higher doses are warranted. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline, guideline-concordant buprenorphine initiation and maintenance targets. Then, I should examine fentanyl-specific pharmacology and clinical data that change precipitated withdrawal risk. Next, I will review evidence for higher buprenorphine doses in the fentanyl era. After that, I need to compare low-dose microdosing versus high-dose rapid induction and novel strategies. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations, monitoring, and evidence gaps while cross-checking against authoritative guidelines and FDA labeling to ensure accuracy [^114U7e9y] [^111zxCHM] [^112ErVxT].

> Let me first confirm the baseline standard-of-care for buprenorphine induction and maintenance, so I don't jump to conclusions. ASAM advises initiating only when there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal, typically starting with 2–4 mg sublingual and titrating in 2–8 mg increments to suppress symptoms, with a usual maintenance goal around 16 mg/day; evidence is deemed insufficient in guidelines to routinely exceed 24 mg/day, and FDA labeling similarly denotes no added advantage above 24 mg/day, although that claim predates widespread fentanyl exposure [^114U7e9y] [^113BFD1e] [^116RfzHN] [^1116cFb9].

> Hold on, I should verify fentanyl-specific issues that alter precipitated withdrawal risk. Fentanyl's high potency and marked lipophilicity create peripheral reservoirs and prolonged receptor occupancy, so even after clinical withdrawal begins, buprenorphine's high-affinity partial agonism may still displace fentanyl and trigger precipitated withdrawal; observational data show markedly higher odds of severe precipitated withdrawal when buprenorphine is taken within 24–48 hours of fentanyl use, consistent with these pharmacokinetic concerns [^112sTsYW] [^1162VFL9] [^114JJGrb] [^115GEXkw].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the severe precipitated withdrawal rate was 22.19% and cited the wrong identifier "a6c3424"; I should double-check the source and correct it to the large survey where severe withdrawal occurred in 22.19% of those taking buprenorphine within 24 hours after fentanyl, with odds ratios of 5.20 for < 24 hours and 3.35 for 24–48 hours, which is [^115GEXkw] [^115GEXkw].

> Next, I need to check whether higher buprenorphine doses are justified in the fentanyl era. Robust evidence supports dose-dependent benefits up to at least 32 mg/day for retention, craving suppression, and blockade of opioid effects, and several analyses argue that FDA label language about "no advantage above 24 mg" is outdated relative to current drug supply; in contrast, stepped-care studies and meta-analyses show improved outcomes with 16–32 mg/day versus lower doses, suggesting that restoring a ceiling of 32 mg/day is reasonable for many fentanyl-exposed patients, acknowledging interindividual bioavailability variability of approximately threefold [^111zxCHM] [^112pqmUF] [^1116cFb9] [^112sTsYW].

> Let me consider alternative initiation strategies to mitigate precipitated withdrawal; first, low-dose or microdosing approaches. Low-dose initiation starts with very small doses of buprenorphine while the patient continues full agonists, gradually increasing over several days to a therapeutic range, which leverages slow receptor replacement to avoid precipitated withdrawal; although evidence is largely case-based and retrospective, hospital cohorts show about 69% completion and national protocol surveys confirm heterogeneous but convergent practice patterns using transdermal, buccal, or 0.5–1 mg sublingual starts, including use in complex settings such as ICU patients [^1153RLms] [^117VARnG] [^11381rhZ] [^1122ac7A].

> I will now examine high-dose, single-day "macrodose" induction, but I need to ensure safety signals are scrutinized. Scoping data across 580 initiations suggest no overdoses or respiratory depression reported, with precipitated withdrawal in seven cases; practical protocols escalate rapidly every 45–60 minutes to 16–24 mg in supervised settings, and case reports in fentanyl users show rapid stabilization and a bridge to extended-release formulations without precipitated withdrawal when carefully monitored [^112ErVxT] [^111biyZZ] [^113fGpLP].

> But wait, what about novel accelerated transitions for those who cannot tolerate waiting; I should review the small but provocative reports. Self-administered intranasal naloxone to precipitate a controlled withdrawal window followed by buprenorphine within about 30 minutes has been reported in fentanyl users, and for severe precipitated withdrawal, adjunctive ketamine with higher-dose buprenorphine has case-level evidence supporting symptom control via NMDA antagonism and potential synergy with buprenorphine signaling; these are promising but remain limited to case reports and require cautious, supervised use [^1162LwJu] [^114JJGrb] [^111tDQwb].

> Now, synthesizing a practical approach, I should double-check risk stratification by time since last fentanyl use. For patients with recent fentanyl exposure within 24–48 hours, a low-dose or microdosing strategy is preferred: begin with approximately 0.5–1 mg sublingual while continuing limited full agonist as needed for comfort, then increase by 1–2 mg per day to reach 4–8 mg by days 2–3, 12–16 mg by days 4–5, and 16–24 mg by days 6–7, discontinuing the full agonist as buprenorphine reaches therapeutic occupancy; I need to ensure daily contact early on and pause or slow the titration if precipitated withdrawal symptoms emerge [^1153RLms] [^117VARnG] [^11381rhZ].

> Alternatively, if low-dose is not feasible and the patient accepts risk with informed consent, I should consider high-dose supervised induction with 4–6 hours of observation, frequent COWS assessments every 45–60 minutes, and rapid titration to 16–24 mg on day one; I should have a plan for managing precipitated withdrawal, including consideration of ketamine in severe cases, and ensure the setting and staffing can observe for adverse effects and provide supportive medications [^111biyZZ] [^112ErVxT] [^111tDQwb].

> For patients who can achieve at least 48 hours of abstinence, I should reconsider whether a modified standard induction suffices. Starting at 4 mg with 4–8 mg increments every 2–4 hours to suppress symptoms is reasonable, but I need to anticipate higher maintenance needs in fentanyl-exposed patients and be prepared to titrate to 24–32 mg/day based on patient-reported dose adequacy, craving suppression, and blockade of illicit opioid effects [^116RfzHN] [^111zxCHM] [^114U7e9y].

> Universally, I need to ensure that dosing prioritizes comfort, blockade, and retention rather than arbitrary ceilings, while acknowledging regulatory and payer constraints. FDA labeling still states no benefit above 24 mg, yet contemporary evidence supports titration up to 32 mg in many cases; frequent assessment with shared decision-making, patient education about precipitated withdrawal, and clear return precautions are essential, and setting selection should reflect patient preference and safety, with office- or home-based starts acceptable but supervised dosing favored for high-risk fentanyl cases; adjuncts like clonidine or lofexidine can help residual symptoms but are usually insufficient for severe precipitated withdrawal [^1116cFb9] [^111zxCHM] [^113dcP1n] [^116qPep6] [^113BFD1e].

> I should double-check the major evidence gaps so we don't overstate certainty. Most fentanyl-specific induction data are observational, with limited randomized trials comparing strategies; interindividual variability in sublingual bioavailability is substantial, complicating a fixed-dose approach; regulatory discord between evidence and labels constrains practice; concerns about diversion often drive dose limits even though nonprescribed buprenorphine is commonly used for self-treatment and is associated with reduced overdose risk; longer-term outcomes with high-dose versus low-dose induction in fentanyl users remain to be defined [^112ErVxT] [^112sTsYW] [^111zxCHM] [^1127Qfw9].

> In sum, I need to emphasize that there is no single "recommended dose" for fentanyl withdrawal; strategy must be individualized with explicit risk mitigation for precipitated withdrawal. Low-dose or microdosing initiation is generally the safest for recent fentanyl exposure and should titrate to an effective maintenance range often between 16 and 32 mg/day, whereas high-dose supervised initiation can rapidly stabilize selected patients when resources and monitoring allow; across strategies, I should aim for the lowest dose that fully suppresses withdrawal and craving and blocks fentanyl effects, accepting that many will require up to 32 mg/day in the current drug supply environment [^1153RLms] [^112ErVxT] [^111zxCHM] [^114U7e9y].

For fentanyl withdrawal, **start buprenorphine at 2–4 mg SL when COWS ≥ 8–12** [^113tFQ9u] [^114XSVxP], titrate by 2–4 mg every 1–2 hours [^114XSVxP] to 8–16 mg on day 1 [^114U7e9y] [^111SSmxa], then maintain at 16–24 mg/day [^113BFD1e] [^1116cFb9], with up to 32 mg/day if needed [^111zxCHM] [^112pqmUF]. To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal [^115GEXkw], **consider microdosing** (e.g. 0.5–1 mg SL every 4–6 hours while continuing fentanyl, then escalate over 3–5 days) [^1153RLms] [^11381rhZ] or high-dose induction (8–16 mg SL initially, with up to 24–32 mg on day 1) [^112ErVxT] [^113fGpLP]. Monitor closely [^115NAB38] [^112EppL2] and adjust dosing to suppress withdrawal and craving [^113BFD1e]; also provide naloxone [^116HPtYE] and counseling [^116HPtYE].

---

## Standard induction protocol

- **Initial dose**: 2–4 mg SL [^114U7e9y] when COWS ≥ 8–12 [^113tFQ9u].
- **Titration**: 2–4 mg every 1–2 hours [^114U7e9y] to 8–16 mg on day 1 [^116RfzHN].
- **Maintenance dose**: 16–24 mg/day [^113BFD1e]; up to 32 mg/day if needed [^111zxCHM].

---

## Alternative induction strategies

### Microdosing (Bernese method)

In the microdosing (Bernese) method, the **initial dose** is 0.5–1 mg SL every 4–6 hours while continuing fentanyl [^1153RLms] [^11381rhZ]. Titration involves **gradually increasing the dose over 3–5 days to 8–16 mg/day**, then discontinuing fentanyl [^1153RLms] [^117VARnG].

---

### High-dose induction

For high-dose induction, the **initial dose** is 8–16 mg SL when COWS ≥ 8–12 [^112ErVxT] [^113fGpLP]. Titration may increase the total dose to **24–32 mg on day 1** if needed [^112ErVxT].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Precipitated withdrawal**: Higher risk with fentanyl [^115GEXkw]; microdosing or high-dose induction may help [^1153RLms] [^112ErVxT].
- **Patient monitoring**: Adjust dose [^113BFD1e] to suppress withdrawal and craving [^112pqmUF].
- **Adjunctive treatments**: Provide naloxone and counseling [^116HPtYE].

## Summary table

| **Induction method** | **Initial dose** | **Titration** | **Maintenance dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Standard induction | 2–4 mg SL | 2–4 mg every 1–2 hours to 8–16 mg on day 1 | 16–24 mg/day (up to 32 mg/day) |
| Microdosing | 0.5–1 mg SL every 4–6 hours | Gradually increase over 3–5 days | 8–16 mg/day |

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend providing naloxone for the reversal of opioid overdose in patients being treated for, or with a history of, opioid use disorder (OUD). It is advised to train patients as well as family members or significant others in the use of naloxone during an overdose.

### Low dose initiation of buprenorphine: A narrative review and practical approach [^1153RLms]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Low dose buprenorphine initiation is an alternative method of starting buprenorphine treatment where the beginning dose is very low and gradually increased to therapeutic levels over several days. This method leverages the slow displacement of the full opioid agonist from mu-opioid receptors, thereby avoiding the need for individuals with opioid use disorder to endure opioid withdrawal symptoms before starting buprenorphine. It also minimizes the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal. This initiation method allows for the continuation of full opioid agonists while beginning buprenorphine, thereby expanding its availability to a wider population.

At the time of writing, literature on low dose initiation is primarily case-based but rapidly growing. As evidence emerges, there is a clear and urgent demand for guidance on using low dose initiation, particularly in the context of an increasingly risky and contaminated opioid drug supply. This is especially important with the prevalence of high potency synthetic opioids, which are driving overdose deaths.

Despite limited evidence, several principles have been identified to guide low dose initiation, including:

- **Choosing the appropriate clinical situation**: Ensuring candidates are suitable for low dose initiation.
- **Initiating at a low buprenorphine dose**: Starting with a small amount.
- **Titrating the buprenorphine dose gradually**: Carefully adjusting the dose over time.
- **Continuing the full opioid agonist even if it is nonmedical**: Allowing ongoing use of opioids during buprenorphine initiation.
- **Communicating clearly with frequent monitoring**: Ensuring clear communication and regular patient monitoring throughout the process.
- **Pausing or delaying buprenorphine dose changes if opioid withdrawal symptoms occur**: Adjusting the plan if withdrawal symptoms arise.
- **Prioritizing care coordination**: Ensuring smooth collaboration and coordination among care providers.

We review a practical approach to low dose initiation in both hospital-based and outpatient settings.

### High-dose buprenorphine initiation: A scoping review [^112ErVxT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The aim of the study is to review and synthesize the literature on high-dose buprenorphine initiation (> 12-mg total dose on the day of initiation).

A scoping review of literature about high-dose buprenorphine initiation was conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central were searched. Randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case studies/reports published in English before February 13, 2023, were included.

Fifteen studies reporting outcomes from 580 high-dose buprenorphine initiations were included. Eight studies were in inpatient settings, three in emergency departments, three in outpatient settings, and one in a first-responder setting. Four studies reported high-dose initiations among individuals exposed to fentanyl. There were no reported events of fatal or nonfatal overdose or respiratory depression, although adverse event reporting was inconsistent in published reports. The most reported side effects with high-dose buprenorphine initiation were nausea or vomiting (n = 17) and precipitated withdrawal (n = 7). The most serious reported adverse event was hypotension requiring oral hydration (n = 2). Most studies reported improvements in subjective or objective withdrawal symptoms. The duration of follow-up ranged from none to eight months.

High-dose buprenorphine initiation has not been associated with reported cases of overdose or respiratory depression. However, the literature about high-dose buprenorphine is limited by inconsistent side effect reporting and limited power to detect rare outcomes.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: A review [^111zxCHM]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

There is robust evidence that buprenorphine's dose-dependent benefits for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) extend at least up to 32 mg/d. Evidence for diversion harm is minimal, yet the consequences of inadequate dosing are predictable and catastrophic. Clinicians and regulators assume that the FDA's buprenorphine package label is evidence-based. Unfortunately, the label language contradicts established evidence and is antiquated regarding harms from fentanyl. However, to avoid off-label prescribing, clinicians must adhere to the specified target dose of 16 mg/d and limit of 24 mg/d — even if that leads to a violation of principles of patient-centered care and inadvertently risks their patients' lives. For patients experiencing dose inadequacy within FDA dosing guidelines, despite effective self-administration technique, transition to methadone or XR-BUP may be an option, but significant barriers frequently impede access to both.

To correct the label language, the FDA should:

- **Remove mention of a target dosage**: This would prevent constraints on personalized treatment plans.
- **Return to the 2004 CSAT dosing recommendation of up to 32 mg/d**: This aligns with current evidence-based practices.
- **Recommend dose titration with consideration of patient-perceived dose adequacy up to the maintenance level that works best for the patient's recovery**: In some cases, this may exceed 32 mg/d.

This review does not address the optimal initial dose or titration strategy, both of which may vary widely among individuals. The federal government recently demonstrated recognition of the urgency of improving treatment of OUD by eliminating the buprenorphine waiver and requiring additional measures.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114U7e9y]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly in the context of withdrawal management, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not initiating opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine until objective signs of opioid withdrawal are present. Once withdrawal signs are objectively confirmed, a dose of buprenorphine sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms should be administered. This typically involves an initial dose of 2–4 mg, which can be titrated up as needed to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113BFD1e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend titrating the buprenorphine dose after initiation to alleviate symptoms. It is advised to use buprenorphine doses sufficient to enable patients to discontinue illicit opioid use. Administering doses of ≥ 16 mg/day is recommended rather than lower doses. There is insufficient evidence to recommend doses > 24 mg/day as they may increase the risk of diversion.

### Buprenorphine maintenance subjects are hyperalgesic and have no antinociceptive response to a very high morphine dose [^114SMH7R]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Acute pain management in opioid-dependent persons is complicated because of tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Very high doses of morphine are ineffective in overcoming opioid-induced hyperalgesia and providing antinociception to methadone-maintained patients in an experimental setting. Whether the same occurs in buprenorphine-maintained subjects is unknown.

- **Design**: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. Subjects were tested on two occasions, at least five days apart, once with intravenous morphine and once with intravenous saline. Testing was conducted at the time of putative trough plasma buprenorphine concentrations.

- **Setting**: Ambulatory.

- **Subjects**: Twelve buprenorphine-maintained subjects received a once-daily sublingual dose ranging from 2 to 22 mg; no dose change for 1.5 to 12 months. Ten healthy controls were also included.

- **Methods**: An intravenous morphine bolus and infusions were administered over two hours to achieve two separate pseudo-steady-state plasma concentrations one hour apart. Pain tolerance was assessed by applying nociceptive stimuli, such as the cold pressor test [seconds] and electrical stimulation [volts]. Ten blood samples were collected for assay of plasma morphine, buprenorphine, and norbuprenorphine concentrations, until three hours after the end of the last infusion. Pain tolerance and respiration rate measurements coincided with blood sampling times.

- **Results**: Cold pressor responses (seconds): At baseline, controls had a duration of 34 ± 6 compared to 17 ± 2 in buprenorphine subjects (P = 0.009); by the end of morphine infusion, controls reached 52 ± 11 (P = 0.04), while buprenorphine subjects remained at 17 ± 2 (P > 0.5). Electrical stimulation response (volts): baseline performance was indicated but cut off.

The study delineates the challenges and ineffectiveness of morphine in managing acute pain among buprenorphine-maintained individuals, showcasing their hyperalgesic conditions.

### Enhancing patient choice: Using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^1162LwJu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal — an experience that deters treatment and causes a return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work. We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than three hours after his last use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal. He remains in care with BUP-NX and would recommend this transition approach to others.

### Buprenorphine [^114uWAFT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Healthcare providers must determine when it is appropriate to cease further management for certain patients. For instance, patients who may be abusing or dependent on multiple drugs or those unresponsive to psychosocial intervention may require more expert care. In such scenarios, providers should consider referring patients to specialists or more intensive behavioral treatment settings. This decision-making process should align with a treatment plan established in agreement with the patient at the onset of treatment.

Patients who persist in misusing, abusing, or diverting buprenorphine products or other opioids need to be directed towards more intensive and structured treatment environments.

The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine and naloxone, or buprenorphine alone, following a maintenance period must be an element of a comprehensive treatment strategy. Patients should be informed about the risk of relapsing into illicit drug use after ceasing opioid agonist/partial agonist medication-assisted treatment. It is advisable to taper the patients to minimize withdrawal signs and symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: A systematic review [^113HXtSo]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The weighted mean stable buprenorphine dose was 14 mg per day. The difference between the initial buprenorphine dose on day 1 and the stable dose ranged from 0.0 to 31.2 mg, with a crude mean of 11.7 mg. The difference between the total dose on the first day and the stable dose ranged from 0.0 to 28.8 mg, with a crude mean of 6 mg.

Individual studies' progression from the first buprenorphine dose to stabilization varied widely. For example, a stable dose of buprenorphine was reached in a single day in some studies. Other studies used various fixed, multiple-day schedules that were designed to reach target doses anywhere between 8 mg and 32 mg over 2 to 7 days.

In three studies, buprenorphine dosing was determined by the patient's response to the previous buprenorphine doses. A single study used transdermal buprenorphine for the transition. The remaining studies were vague in their descriptions of the stabilization process.

The microdosing procedure used in the case series is described in detail in the supplementary digital content. Briefly, the intended process was to administer the patient's full dose of methadone for 7 days concurrently with an increasing dose of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone. The protocol used in the case series was intended to begin with a single 0.5 mg dose once on the first day and then escalate to an 8 mg dose the following morning and a 4 mg dose in the evening on day 7 (which was also the last day of methadone — still at the full dose). On day 8, the patient began…

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: A review [^112sTsYW]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Early pharmacology studies of buprenorphine require careful interpretation for several reasons. (1) Most studies use a single dose or once-daily dosing to measure peak and minimum plasma concentrations and the time course of decay; more frequent dosing may be preferred by some patients because of improved stability of plasma concentration. (2) Protective effects of buprenorphine when heroin was the prevalent illicit opioid must be reevaluated in the context of the current drug supply. Fentanyl's potency is ≥ 20 times that of hydromorphone, so many fentanyl-dependent individuals will require a higher buprenorphine dose and MOR occupancy than found in the 2003 study to block withdrawal, craving, and opioid reward. (3) Individual variability is substantial; the bioavailability of sublingual buprenorphine varies between individuals by a factor of 3, and individuals vary widely in the doses they require for specific protections against withdrawal, craving, and opioid reward blockade. Dose limits disregard this known variability, jeopardizing an individual patient's care.

- **Figure 2**: Buprenorphine plasma concentration versus time at different doses. Plasma concentration of buprenorphine over a 24-hour blood sampling period after once-daily dosing in 5 heroin-dependent volunteers maintained on 0, 2, 16, and 32 mg/d buprenorphine. The thick line at 3 ng/mL is at the level required to suppress drug "liking" of a high-dose hydromorphone challenge, and the red shaded area indicates concentrations where such drug "liking" occurs.

Regarding specific circumstances for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to patients with opioid use disorder, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend stabilizing the opioid use disorder (such as with methadone or buprenorphine) while simultaneously treating the alcohol withdrawal in patients with co-occurring alcohol withdrawal syndrome and opioid use disorder.

### Enhancing patient choice: Using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^1162VFL9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

More than 100,000 overdose deaths were reported in 2021, largely driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF). Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a first-line treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and, like methadone, it reduces morbidity and mortality while increasing retention in care. Unfortunately, initiating BUP-NX has become more complicated as IMF has largely replaced heroin in the US drug supply.

Buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist, has a high affinity and low intrinsic activation at the μ-opioid receptor. Because of these properties, buprenorphine can cause precipitated withdrawal if taken too soon or at an incorrect dose following a full agonist opioid. Unfortunately, this precipitation risk increases with regular fentanyl use, likely because of fentanyl's lipophilicity, which leads to a large volume of distribution and slow dissipation when used chronically. Patients have significant concerns about the severity of withdrawal needed to start buprenorphine, as well as the risk of precipitated withdrawal; the possibility of a negative experience understandably fosters hesitance to begin treatment.

Newer methods for BUP-NX initiation have been reported, generally categorized as very low- (or "microdosing"), low-, standard-, and high-dose (or "macrodose") protocols, each with potential benefits and risks. Less common methods use transdermal, buccal, sublingual, and intravenous buprenorphine formulations that are not readily available for this outpatient purpose. Additional effective, expedited approaches would empower patients by providing more choices regarding when a

### Buprenorphine for the management of opioid withdrawal [^117CVqv3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the endpoint of long-term opioid replacement treatment, such as methadone maintenance. The availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective treatment system.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal in terms of withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal, and adverse effects.

- **Search strategy**: Multiple electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Australian Medical Index, and Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, were systematically searched up to October 2003. Additionally, reference lists of retrieved studies, reviews, and conference abstracts were handsearched.

- **Selection criteria**: Controlled trials comparing buprenorphine with reducing doses of methadone, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications, or placebo, or comparing different buprenorphine-based regimes, were selected to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid-dependent.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed through consultation with all three reviewers. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality. Meta-analysis was undertaken where possible, with sensitivity analyses used to assess the impact of methodological quality.

- **Main results**: Thirteen studies, including 10 RCTs involving 744 participants, met the criteria for inclusion.

### Synergistic effect of ketamine and buprenorphine observed in the treatment of buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal in a patient with fentanyl use [^111tDQwb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Optimal treatment of buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal (BPOW) is unclear. Full agonist treatment of BPOW is limited by buprenorphine's high-affinity blockade at mu-opioid receptors (μORs). Buprenorphine's partial agonism (low intrinsic efficacy) at μORs can limit the effectiveness of even massive doses once BPOW has begun. Adjunct medications, such as clonidine, are rarely effective in severe BPOW.

Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with a potentially ideal pharmacologic profile for treatment of BPOW. Ketamine reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms independently of direct μOR binding, synergistically potentiates the effectiveness of buprenorphine μOR signaling, reverses (resensitizes) fentanyl-induced μOR receptor desensitization, and inhibits descending pathways of hyperalgesia and central sensitization. Ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects potentially address depressive symptoms and subjective distress that often accompanies BPOW. Ketamine is inexpensive, safe, and available in emergency departments. At the time of writing, neither ketamine as treatment for BPOW nor to support uncomplicated buprenorphine induction has been described.

- **Case description**: We report a case of an illicit fentanyl-using OUD patient who experienced severe BPOW during an outpatient low-dose cross taper buprenorphine induction (i.e. "microdose"). The BPOW was successfully treated in the emergency department with a combination of ketamine (0.6 mg/kg intravenous over 1 hour) combined with high-dose buprenorphine (16 mg sublingual single dose). Three days later, he was administ

### Buprenorphine for the management of opioid withdrawal [^115jEQr3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). High credibility.

Managed withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment and may also represent the endpoint of maintenance treatment. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal, considering withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal, and adverse effects.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, including the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials register, Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2005), EMBASE (January 1985 to August 2005), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2005), CINAHL (1982 to July 2005), and reference lists of articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Experimental interventions involved the use of buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants primarily opioid-dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or different buprenorphine-based regimes.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and methodological quality, and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all three reviewers.

- **Main results**: Eighteen studies (14 randomized controlled trials), involving 1,356 participants, were included. Ten studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine, four compared buprenorphine with methadone, one compared buprenorphine with oxazepam, and three compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction.

Regarding the medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly with buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating buprenorphine at a dose of 2–4 mg once objective signs of withdrawal are observed. Consider increasing the dosage in increments of 2–8 mg.

### Low-dose buprenorphine initiation in an intubated and sedated patient: A case report [^1122ac7A]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist effective for the treatment of opioid use disorder. However, precipitated opioid withdrawal remains a barrier to its initiation. As opioid use disorder and related complications continue at alarming rates, it is crucial to evaluate alternative means of initiating this lifesaving medication whenever patients interact with the health care system. In this case report, we discuss a patient who completed low-dose buprenorphine initiation while intubated and sedated in an intensive care setting, which was documented in the patient's recent chart as a desire to initiate buprenorphine. Upon extubation, the patient elected to continue buprenorphine. We discuss potential advantages, ethical considerations, and patient perspectives related to initiating buprenorphine in this manner.

### Zubsolv [^112jtYMf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Maintenance

The dosage of Zubsolv from Day 3 onwards should be progressively adjusted in increments or decrements of 2.9 mg/0.71 mg, or lower, of buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. After treatment induction and stabilization, the maintenance dose of Zubsolv is generally in the range of 2.9 mg/0.71 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 17.2 mg/4.2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day, depending on the individual patient and clinical response. The recommended target dosage of Zubsolv during maintenance is 11.4 mg/2.9 mg as a single daily dose. Dosages higher than 17.2 mg/4.2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage.

When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of their home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. There is no maximum recommended duration of maintenance treatment. Patients may require treatment indefinitely and should continue for as long as they are benefiting and the use of Zubsolv contributes to the intended treatment goals.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to withdrawal management, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management over the abrupt cessation of opioids. Recognize that abrupt cessation of opioids may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome, which can put the patient at risk for relapse, overdose, and overdose death.

### Efficacy of tramadol extended-release for opioid withdrawal: A randomized clinical trial [^111SSmxa]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant public health problem. Supervised withdrawal (i.e. detoxification) from opioids using clonidine or buprenorphine hydrochloride is a widely used treatment.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether tramadol hydrochloride extended-release (ER), an approved analgesic with opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action and low abuse potential, is effective for use in supervised withdrawal settings.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized clinical trial was conducted in a residential research setting with 103 participants with OUD. Participants' treatment was stabilized with morphine, 30 mg, administered subcutaneously 4 times daily. A 7-day taper using clonidine (n = 36), tramadol ER (n = 36), or buprenorphine (n = 31) was then instituted. Patients were crossed-over to a double-blind placebo during a post-taper period. The study was conducted from October 25, 2010, to June 23, 2015.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Retention, withdrawal symptom management, concomitant medication utilization, and naltrexone induction. Results were analyzed over time and using area under the curve for the intention-to-treat and completer groups.

- **Results**: Of the 103 participants, 88 (85.4%) were men and 43 (41.7%) were white; mean (SD) age was 28.9 (10.4) years. Buprenorphine participants (28 [90.3%]) were significantly more likely to be retained at the end of the taper compared with clonidine participants (22 [61.1%]); tramadol ER retention was intermediate and did not differ significantly from that of the other groups (26 [72.2%]; χ2 = 8.5, P = 0.01).

### Prescribing practices in opioid agonist treatment and changes in compliance to clinical dosing guidelines in British Columbia, Canada [^111w9hrh]. Addiction (2024). High credibility.

Titration intervals also declined across medications during the study period (Figure 1b; Supporting information, Tables S3 and S4). One-day buprenorphine–naloxone titration intervals observed an increase of 23.4% from 2014 to 2021 (25.6–49%). Among methadone recipients, titration intervals under 5 days increased from 27.5 to 51.1% throughout the study period. Daily titration of SROM was observed as 29.4% higher from 2017 to 2021 (12–41.4%). After guideline changes in 2017, titration intervals that followed guideline recommendations were 23.4% higher for buprenorphine–naloxone (25.6–49%), 23.5% lower for methadone (72.5–49%), and 29.4% lower for SROM (88–58.6%), for which slower titration was recommended.

Maintenance doses, similar to initiation doses, increased across medications (Figure 1c; Supporting information, Tables S3 and S4). For buprenorphine–naloxone maintenance doses, we observed an increase of 6.5% (1.3–7.8%) for doses greater than 24 mg/6 mg throughout the study period. However, maintenance doses lower than 12 mg/3 mg increased 6.1% (32.7–38.8%) after the guideline was introduced in 2017. Methadone maintenance doses greater than 60 mg were 10.5% higher (67.8–78.2%). Additionally, the prescription of SROM maintenance doses greater than 1200 mg increased from 3.1% to 21.1%. Overall, we observed that maintenance dose prescriptions following guideline recommendations (i.e. dosing exceeded recommendations) decreased by 11.1% for buprenorphine–naloxone (64.5–53.4%) and increased by 4.4% for methadone (73.8–78.2%) and 33.9% for SROM (51.8–85.7%).

### Clinical case conference: Strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^111biyZZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patients are advised they will need to stay at the clinic for at least half a day, as the process takes several hours. The buprenorphine dose is titrated quickly, but there is a need for observation between doses, as well as evaluation of the patient and their symptoms. Doses are administered every 45 to 60 minutes and can increase to a maximum of 24 mg. The dose regimen is 2 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, and 8 mg. Some patients may wish to stop at 16 mg; however, we encourage a dose of 24 mg, which results in a high degree of opioid receptor saturation. Patients may wish to leave the clinic for a break, nonalcoholic drink, or to smoke tobacco. If they are well, they may be allowed to do this, but they should only be away for a short period. Patients are assessed, and opioid withdrawal scales are completed and agreed upon with the patient before each dose is administered. Throughout the process, communication about expectations between the prescriber or worker and the patients is essential for a good outcome.

- **Microdosing transfer (Bernese method)**: A third option for the patient is the use of microdosing. This is a relatively new development by NHS Lanarkshire and is based on experiences reported in the limited published literature and anecdotal reports from other services within the UK. The principle underlying the process is to slowly but gradually introduce buprenorphine to the patients' opioid agonist treatment while they are on a full opioid agonist. The buprenorphine dose is titrated up to a therapeutic level before discontinuing their full opiate agonist.

### Hospital-based buprenorphine micro-dose initiation [^112C3P5Q]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine induction can be challenging for patients with chronic pain or for patients who are unable to cease opioids for a sufficient time to prevent precipitated opioid withdrawal. In the outpatient setting, low-dose buprenorphine induction strategies have been described to avoid these barriers; however, these strategies are not generalizable to the hospital setting, where specific medication regulations may apply. We report a novel strategy for hospital-based low-dose buprenorphine initiation that facilitates the transition from full opioid agonists to buprenorphine.

### Buprenorphine [^1116cFb9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Maintenance**: Buprenorphine and naloxone is preferred for maintenance treatment. Where buprenorphine is used in patients who cannot tolerate naloxone, the dosage should be progressively adjusted in increments or decrements of 2 mg or 4 mg to maintain treatment and suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms. After induction and stabilization, the maintenance dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets is generally 4 mg to 24 mg per day, depending on the patient. The recommended target dosage is 16 mg as a single daily dose, with dosages higher than 24 mg showing no additional clinical advantage. When prescribing for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's stability, home security, and other factors affecting the management of take-home medication. There is no maximum recommended duration for maintenance treatment; it may continue indefinitely as long as it benefits the patient and aligns with treatment goals.

- **Method of administration**: Buprenorphine sublingual tablets must be administered whole. Patients should be advised not to cut, chew, or swallow the tablets and to avoid eating or drinking until the tablet is completely dissolved.

### Prescribing practices in opioid agonist treatment and changes in compliance to clinical dosing guidelines in British Columbia, Canada [^1126A3rV]. Addiction (2024). Low credibility.

As the prevalence of illicit fentanyl use has increased across North America, prescribers are frequently challenged to meet the needs of their clients to sustain retention in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment. Fentanyl and its analogs rapidly overtook the illicit drug supply in British Columbia (BC), prompting a public health emergency declaration in 2016. As of 2022, overdose deaths have more than doubled since the declaration, with toxicology reports confirming that more than 82% of all fatal overdoses contained fentanyl during the past 7 years, a stark increase from 2014 where a quarter of deaths had fentanyl detected.

Revised clinical guidelines for the treatment of OUD in the province were released in 2017, 14 months after the declaration. The guidelines endorse buprenorphine–naloxone as a first-line opioid agonist treatment (OAT) and provide recommendations on initial doses, titration, maintenance dose, and take-home dosage, revised according to updated evidence on the use of both methadone and buprenorphine–naloxone. Additionally, slow-release oral morphine (SROM) was introduced as a second-line treatment; however, evidence on the effective clinical management of people primarily using illicit fentanyl is extremely limited. Evidence cited in BC's OUD guidelines — and guidelines from the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration — almost exclusively predate the introduction of fentanyl and its analogs into the illicit drug supply. However, only the American Society of Addiction Medicine suggests changes in practices tailored to the presence of fentanyl.

Take-home dose durations also increased among all medications during the study period (Figure 1d; Supporting information, Tables S3 and S4). Two-week buprenorphine-naloxone take-home doses had an observed increase of 17.6% between 2014 and 2021 (from 17.7% to 35.3%). Similarly, methadone take-home doses extending more than a week increased by 14.9% in the same period (from 49.5% to 64.4%). SROM take-home doses lasting longer than a week increased by 4.8% (from 34.1% to 38.9%). After the 2017 guideline was introduced, take-home doses that followed guideline recommendations decreased across all medications, with methadone showing the most considerable reduction at 15.2%.

For incident (first-time) individuals on OAT, there were 32,254 episodes (Supporting information, Tables S5 and S6, Figure S1). Prescribing practices that followed clinical guidelines were similar for incident OAT episodes and all episodes regarding initiation doses, titration lengths, maintenance doses, and methadone take-home doses, with marginal differences for take-home doses of buprenorphine-naloxone and SROM.

### Buprenorphine microdose induction for the management of prescription opioid dependence [^111FMwbh]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Prescription opioid dependence remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Patients previously on high-dose opioids may poorly tolerate opioid tapers. Guidelines support the use of buprenorphine therapy in opioid-tapering protocols, even among patients without a diagnosis of opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine microinduction protocols can be used to transition patients to buprenorphine therapy without opioid withdrawal. From November 2019 to April 2020, we transitioned eight patients on high-dose prescribed opioids for pain to sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone using a microdose protocol without any evidence of precipitated withdrawal. Six of these patients remain on buprenorphine-naloxone and report improved analgesia.

Because of its simplicity, the buprenorphine microinduction protocol can be easily adapted for telemedicine and may help prevent unnecessary clinic visits and opioid-related admissions in the setting of social distancing regulations during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic.

### Evidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in persons who use fentanyl [^115GEXkw]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent persons with recent fentanyl use. However, the prevalence of this phenomenon is not clinically established. We sought to evaluate the incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in persons who use fentanyl.

- **Methods**: We collected self-report data on opioid withdrawal symptoms after buprenorphine use, and, as a comparator, after methadone use, in 1679 individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorder across 49 addiction treatment centers in the United States.

- **Results**: The odds of developing severe withdrawal symptoms significantly increased when taking buprenorphine within 24 hours after fentanyl use (OR = 5.202, 95% CI = 1.979–13.675, P = 0.001) and within 24 to 48 hours after fentanyl use (OR = 3.352, 95% CI = 1.237–9.089, P = 0.017). As expected, patients did not report significantly higher rates of withdrawal when taking methadone after fentanyl use. Of those who waited less than 24 hours after fentanyl before using buprenorphine or methadone, 22.19% (n = 152 of 685) and 11.56% (n = 23 of 199), respectively, reported severe opioid withdrawal.

- **Conclusions**: This study supports previous anecdotal reports of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal from fentanyl. The odds of withdrawal symptoms significantly increased when taking buprenorphine after recent (within 48 hours) fentanyl use; however, this relationship was not observed in persons taking methadone, suggesting that this effect is specific to buprenorphine. Further research is urgently needed to describe the pharmacokinetics of non-medi.

### Low-dose buprenorphine initiation in hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder: A retrospective cohort analysis [^117VARnG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) can initiate buprenorphine without requiring a withdrawal period through a low-dose (sometimes referred to as "micro-induction") approach. Although there is growing interest in low-dose buprenorphine initiation, evidence is limited to case reports and small case series.

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with OUD seen by a hospital-based addiction medicine consult service who underwent low-dose buprenorphine initiation starting during hospital admission. We then integrated our practice-based experiences with results from the existing literature to create practice considerations.

Sixty-eight individuals underwent 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations between July 2019 and July 2020. Reasons for low-dose versus standard buprenorphine initiation included co-occurring pain (91.7%), patient anxiety around the possibility of withdrawal (69.4%), history of precipitated withdrawal (9.7%), opioid withdrawal intolerance (6.9%), and other reasons/not specified (18.1%). Of the 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations, 50 (69.4%) were completed in the hospital, 9 (12.5%) transitioned to complete as an outpatient, and 13 (18.1%) were terminated early.

We apply our experiences and findings from literature to recommendations for varied clinical scenarios, including acute illness, co-occurring pain, opioid withdrawal intolerance, transition from high-dose methadone to buprenorphine, history of precipitated withdrawal, and rapid hospital discharge. We also share a standard low-dose initiation protocol.

### Efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine patch for managing withdrawal symptoms in patients with cancer physically dependent on prescription opioids [^114JX6SM]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

The first phase, screening, focused on the identification and enrollment of suitable participants for the trial. Written informed consent and urinary drug screening (UDS) were obtained from all participants.

- **Induction and stabilization**: The process began by ceasing the use of all offending prescription opioids that had led to physical dependence. Rotation to a transdermal buprenorphine patch (TBP) was initiated without an opioid-free interval due to the slower onset time of TBP compared to the sublingual formulation. The patch was attached to undamaged skin on the outer upper arm, upper chest, upper abdomen, or lateral aspect of the chest. Dosages for TBPs were 5, 10, 20, 35, 52.5, and 70 mcg/h. The frequency of patch change depends on the brand; one brand was designed to be replaced every 4 days, while another every 7 days. Simultaneous application of two different brands of TBP was not recommended.

- **Dosage determination**: The TBP dose was calculated to be 75%-100% of the equianalgesic dose of the offending opioid. For participants with a morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) exceeding the maximum allowable TBP dose of 70 mcg/h (MEDD, 170 mg), a combination of TBP and a reduced dose of their offending opioid was permitted. For example, if a patient's MEDD was 200 mg, they would be prescribed TBP at 70 mcg/h plus an additional 30 mg of opioids, with an aim to reduce and discontinue the offending opioids within a few days to weeks. After the initial application of TBP, a 2–4 hour observation period was recommended.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^117SMBnD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Use in patients with impaired hepatic function**: Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for those with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated; hepatic impairment results in a much greater reduction in the clearance of naloxone compared to buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment are exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than those with normal hepatic function. This increased exposure may result in a higher risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with the efficacy of buprenorphine throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction in naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine is less pronounced than in those with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for the initiation of treatment (induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. They may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone, provided that patients are carefully monitored. Consideration should be given to the potential interference of naloxone with buprenorphine's efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Brixadi [^116mbaxV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients not currently receiving buprenorphine treatment

The recommended weekly dose for patients not currently receiving buprenorphine treatment is 24 mg of Brixadi (weekly), titrated up over the first week of treatment as follows:

- **Administration of test dose**: To avoid precipitating an opioid withdrawal syndrome, administer a test dose of transmucosal buprenorphine 4 mg when objective signs of mild to moderate withdrawal appear. If the dose of transmucosal buprenorphine is tolerated without precipitated withdrawal, administer the first dose of Brixadi (weekly), 16 mg.

- **Increasing dose**: Administer an additional dose of 8 mg Brixadi (weekly) within 3 days of the first dose to achieve the recommended 24 mg Brixadi (weekly) dose. If needed during this first week of treatment, an additional 8 mg dose of Brixadi (weekly) may be administered, waiting at least 24 hours after the previous injection, for a total weekly dose of 32 mg Brixadi (weekly).

- **Subsequent doses**: Administer subsequent Brixadi (weekly) injections based on the total weekly dose established during Week One. Dosage adjustments can be made at weekly appointments, with the maximum Brixadi (weekly) dose being 32 mg. A patient who misses a dose of Brixadi (weekly) should receive the next dose as soon as possible. Brixadi (weekly) should be administered in 7-day intervals.

Patients switching from transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products to Brixadi

Patients currently being treated with a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product may be switched directly to either Brixadi (weekly) or Brixadi (monthly).

### "Macrodosing" sublingual buprenorphine and extended-release buprenorphine in a hospital setting: 2 case reports [^113fGpLP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Objectives**: To describe two case reports in which high-dose administration of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone quickly stabilized fentanyl users who presented to the hospital. The study discusses how early administration of extended-release buprenorphine, before the patient is discharged, may improve retention rates for outpatient buprenorphine treatment.

- **Methods**: Two case reports of fentanyl users presented to the emergency department at the general hospital in Timmins, Canada, are described. They were rapidly stabilized on high-dose sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone and then transitioned within 24 to 36 hours to buprenorphine extended-release subcutaneous injection.

- **Results**: In both cases, their withdrawal symptoms quickly resolved without sedation or precipitated withdrawal. Both patients followed up with the outpatient clinic for another injection of extended-release buprenorphine.

- **Conclusions**: High-dose sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone followed by early administration of extended-release buprenorphine quickly and safely relieved withdrawal symptoms in two fentanyl users who presented to the hospital emergency department. This novel approach shows promise in improving treatment retention rates for patients using fentanyl. Further research is required to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this approach.

### Efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine patch for managing withdrawal symptoms in patients with cancer physically dependent on prescription opioids [^112Ckxga]. The Oncologist (2024). High credibility.

In our study, discontinuation of TBP was permitted according to the criteria of the study protocol. However, in the general population or patients without cancer with OUD, retention of buprenorphine is strongly recommended because discontinuation of buprenorphine is frequently associated with an increased risk of resumption of opioid use. Contrastingly, in our study, among the 11 participants who were able to discontinue both TBP and their offending opioids, we observed no cases of resumption of prescribed opioids and only one case of physical dependence on TBP. This difference may be attributed to the relatively mild severity of the withdrawal symptoms and less frequent inclusion of cases with psychological dependence in this study. Moreover, the short-term follow-up period in our study may not have been adequate to fully assess the risk of delayed resumption of prescribed opioids.

Nonetheless, our findings prompted a reevaluation of the necessity for long-term buprenorphine retention in cancer survivors with mild withdrawal symptoms on prescription opioids. Another methodological issue related to our study is the initial dose of TBP because an equianalgesic dose (as applied in our study) may not be the same as the dose needed to control withdrawal symptoms. The initial dose of sublingual buprenorphine for managing withdrawal symptoms is typically fixed at 2–4 mg and titrated based on the patient's withdrawal symptoms. In our study, the initial equianalgesic dose of TBP showed an acceptable safety profile and was effective in managing the initial withdrawal symptoms.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: A review [^1127Qfw9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Diversion is the unauthorized rerouting of prescription medication to someone for whom it was not intended. Clinicians cite risks of diversion and related Drug Enforcement Agency investigations as primary reasons they do not prescribe this lifesaving treatment. Federal regulatory agency concern for buprenorphine diversion dates to the 1990s, when the BUP/NX combined product was developed to "minimize the likelihood of diversion". More recently, the same concern for diversion drove the development of XR-BUP formulations.

An actionable item at the 2014 Buprenorphine Summit, convened by SAMHSA and the National Institutes of Health, demonstrates the assumed linkage between higher doses and diversion: "Provide guidance to the field about the range of possible effective doses, and the lack of evidence for added benefit of more than 24 mg daily, to reduce habitual overprescribing that may be fueling diversion". That specified dose limit references the FDA's inaccurate claim of no clinical advantage greater than 24 mg/d. Federal leadership has predictably led to the codification of inadequate dose limits in insurance coverage, which, in turn, has driven clinical practice and raised unwarranted pharmacy concerns.

Actual harms ascribed to buprenorphine diversion — overdose, injection, and/or the development of OUD — are rare in the United States. Instead, the most common use of nonprescribed buprenorphine is self-treatment of OUD when legal access is unavailable. The risk of overdose death is actually reduced among people who use nonprescribed buprenorphine, and those who have taken nonprescr…

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^116X7Yhe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A "very low" dose (1 mg solution) would be less than a tablet dose of 2 mg. A "low" dose (4 mg solution) approximates a 6 mg tablet dose. A "moderate" dose (8 mg solution) approximates a 12 mg tablet dose. A "high" dose (16 mg solution) approximates a 24 mg tablet dose.

The safety of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film during treatment induction is supported by a clinical trial using 16 patients treated with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film and 18 treated with a buprenorphine-only sublingual film. Few differences in the adverse event profiles were noted between buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film and the buprenorphine-only sublingual film.

The most common adverse event occurring during treatment induction and the 3 days following induction using buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film was restlessness. Other adverse events included anxiety, piloerection, stomach discomfort, irritability, headache, rhinorrhea, cold sweat, arthralgia, and increased lacrimation.

Four subjects left the study early on the first day of sublingual film administration. However, there was no evidence to suggest that any of the four subjects experienced precipitated withdrawal secondary to the administration of buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113tFQ9u]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not initiating buprenorphine in patients currently dependent on opioids until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal. This is to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

### Buprenorphine [^116RfzHN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Before initiating induction, it is essential to consider the type of opioid dependence, whether on long- or short-acting opioid products, the time elapsed since the last opioid use, and the severity of the opioid dependence.

Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products should receive the first dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets only when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear. This should not occur less than 4 hours after the last opioid use. Achieving an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should occur as rapidly as possible. On the initial day of treatment, dosing can be administered in 2 mg to 4 mg increments if preferred. Some studies have noted that gradual induction over several days results in a high rate of dropout of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of buprenorphine sublingual tablets on Day 1 and 16 mg on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients were given either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets or buprenorphine sublingual tablets at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2, based on their assigned treatment. Induction in studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3–4 days, depending on the target dose.

Patients dependent on methadone or other long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction compared to those on short-acting opioids.

### Enhancing patient choice: Using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^114JJGrb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, however, has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal — an experience that deters treatment and causes a return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work.

We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than 3 hours after his last illicitly manufactured fentanyl use by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal. He remains in care with BUP-NX and would recommend this transition approach to others.

### Micro-dosing intravenous buprenorphine to rapidly transition from full opioid agonists [^116gjy7V]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

For patients with opioid use disorder transitioning from methadone or requiring opioid analgesia, initiating buprenorphine for opioid use disorder can be difficult because of the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Low-dose initiation, also known as micro-dosing, is an alternative to standard initiation. Prior studies relied on nonstandard dosing of tablets or films, patches, or buccal formulations, all of which are unavailable in many hospitals. We report a novel approach to micro-dosing using intravenous buprenorphine. Two patients, one on methadone maintenance and another requiring postoperative opioid analgesia, were transitioned to buprenorphine with full-agonist opioids and without precipitated withdrawal.

### Current state of perioperative buprenorphine management-a national provider survey [^114uWxF8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine maintenance for opioid use disorder (OUD) presents potential challenges for acute postoperative pain management. Provider practice and consistency of buprenorphine management strategies within institutions remain unknown. This study aims to identify how providers nationwide manage patients on buprenorphine when they present for elective surgery. A prospective survey of anesthesiologists was conducted nationwide between November 2021 and March 2022. Survey respondents were selected from academic institutions identified through public databases and were also distributed to online social media platforms where members must verify medical licensure and hospital affiliation. Survey results were calculated and interpreted as the percentage rate of response.

Survey invitations were sent to 190 institutions, resulting in 54 responses (28% response rate). An additional 12 completed surveys were obtained from online social media distribution, resulting in 66 responses. Only 36% of respondents reported an established protocol for perioperative management of buprenorphine at their institution. Regarding the consistency of buprenorphine management within institutions, the majority of respondents endorsed buprenorphine continuation without dose reduction in procedures where minimal pain was anticipated. However, there was a significant discrepancy in buprenorphine management for surgeries with moderate to severe pain. Perioperative dosing frequency of buprenorphine was also inconsistent.

The majority of institutions surveyed do not have a standardized protocol for managing buprenorphine perioperatively.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride [^111SFBk4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Buprenorphine HCl should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient's treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Buprenorphine HCl for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Many acute pain conditions (e.g. the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Buprenorphine HCl. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS]. Inspect Buprenorphine HCl for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.

### A plea from people who use drugs to clinicians: New ways to initiate buprenorphine are urgently needed in the fentanyl era [^115TPi48]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). High credibility.

With the worst opioid overdose death crisis in United States history, urgent new approaches to assist people who use drugs onto medication for opioid use disorder are necessary. In this commentary, addiction medicine clinicians and drug user union representatives argue that conventional methods of buprenorphine initiation, which require periods of withdrawal, must be augmented with additional novel approaches.

In the fentanyl era, members of the New England Users Union and Portland Users Union report encountering precipitated withdrawal and being unable to stop using full agonist opioids for the required period. They face difficulty initiating this medication, which could offer them stability and life-saving treatment. People who use drugs should be involved at all levels with ongoing research, and clinical and policy efforts to improve buprenorphine initiation as their lives and suffering are at stake.

### Survey of buprenorphine low-dose regimens used by healthcare institutions [^11381rhZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Buprenorphine microdosing ("low-dosing") allows for initiation of buprenorphine without requiring patients to endure withdrawal. Case studies suggest its favorable utility as an alternative to conventional buprenorphine induction. However, published regimens vary in duration, dosage forms used, and timing of full opioid agonist discontinuation.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional survey study sought to determine how buprenorphine low-dosing is approached by medical institutions across the United States. The primary endpoint was characterization of inpatient buprenorphine low-dosing regimens. Situations and types of patients in which low-dosing is used and obstacles to institutional protocol development were also collected. An online survey was disseminated through professional pharmacy organizations and personal contacts, and responses were collected over four weeks.

- **Results**: Twenty-three unique protocols were collected from 25 institutions. Most protocols used buccal (8 protocols) or transdermal (8 protocols) buprenorphine as first doses before transitioning to sublingual buprenorphine. The most common starting doses were buprenorphine 20 μg/h transdermal, 150 μg buccal, and 0.5 mg sublingual. Patients unable to tolerate conventional buprenorphine induction or those who potentially used fentanyl nonmedically were most likely to be prescribed low-dosing. The most common obstacle to developing an internal low-dosing protocol was the lack of existing consensus guidelines.

Conclusions: Similar to published regimens, internal protocols are variable. Buccal first doses may be used effectively.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: A review [^112kJhKf]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

From a pharmacological standpoint, an adequate maintenance dose of buprenorphine should eliminate negative reinforcement by suppressing opioid withdrawal symptoms and craving that can lead to illicit opioid use; eliminate positive reinforcement by blocking the euphoric and motivational (drug-seeking) effects of illicit opioid use; and eliminate the toxicity of illicit opioid use by blocking its respiratory depression and associated overdose harm.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine recommends four similar goals:

- **Suppress opioid withdrawal**: Suppress withdrawal to eliminate discomfort and prevent relapse.

- **Block the effects of illicit opioids**: Block the euphoric and motivational effects to deter use.

- **Reduce opioid craving and stop or reduce use**: Reduce craving and use for improved recovery chances.

- **Promote patient engagement**: Facilitate engagement in recovery-oriented activities, including psychosocial intervention.

National agencies and treatment guidelines for opioid use disorder emphasize the importance of patient-centered care. However, only one of 31 existing quality metrics concerns patient preferences. When asked, a key goal for patients is to find a "comfortable and effective" dose, which requires "open, trusting and collaborative healthcare provider relationships". One patient's words epitomize the disempowering effect of clinician-driven care: "I went through withdrawals for 2.5 months every morning… because I didn't have my dose high enough… and when I would go to see [my doctor] I would ask can you please up my dose and my doctor would say 'no'".

After arriving at a shared decision regarding dosing, patients and clinicians still often encounter multiple barriers.

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: Expert opinion [^113RkEfS]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical best judgment should be employed to individualize any conversion. However, clinicians may consider the following while noting that some downward titration may be necessary for patients on high opioid doses:

- **For patients taking doses below the following amounts (∼ ≤ 90 MME)**: Fentanyl transdermal: ≤ 25 µg/h; oxycodone: ≤ 60 mg/d; hydrocodone or morphine: ≤ 90 mg/d; hydromorphone: ≤ 16 mg/d; oxymorphone: ≤ 45 mg/d; tapentadol: any dose. Discontinue after the last nighttime dose. Consider initiating an adrenergic α2 agonist (e.g. clonidine, lofexidine) or an immediate-release opioid to reduce the risk of withdrawal. Initiate buprenorphine the following morning per prescribing information as either 10-µg/h transdermal buprenorphine or 150-µg buccal buprenorphine twice daily. Titrate buprenorphine as needed for pain per recommendations in the prescribing information.

- **In patients transitioning to buprenorphine from higher doses of opioids (∼ > 90 MME)**: Fentanyl transdermal: > 25 µg/h; oxycodone: > 60 mg/d; hydrocodone or morphine: > 90 mg/d; hydromorphone: > 16 mg/d; oxymorphone: > 45 mg/d. Discontinue after the last nighttime dose. Consider initiating an adrenergic α2 agonist (e.g. clonidine, lofexidine) or an immediate-release opioid to reduce the risk of withdrawal. Initiate buprenorphine the following morning as either 20-µg/h transdermal buprenorphine once daily or 300-µg buccal buprenorphine twice daily. Follow the recommendations in the prescribing information for upward titration as needed. Note that 20 µg/h is the highest recommended transdermal dose.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder and specifically concerning buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the setting for the initiation of buprenorphine. Both office-based and home-based initiation are viewed as safe and effective when starting buprenorphine treatment. Use clinical judgment to determine the most appropriate setting for a given patient, including consideration of the patient's past experience with buprenorphine and assessment of their ability to manage initiation at home.

### The next stage of buprenorphine care for opioid use disorder [^115NAB38]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine has been used internationally for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) since the 1990s and has been available in the United States for more than a decade. Initial practice recommendations were intentionally conservative, based on expert opinion, and influenced by methadone regulations. Since 2003, the American crisis of OUD has dramatically worsened, with significant related empirical research undertaken. The findings in several important areas conflict with initial clinical practice, which is still prevalent.

- **Location of buprenorphine induction**: Research indicates that induction settings may need revisiting to optimize patient outcomes.
- **Combining buprenorphine with a benzodiazepine**: Evidence suggests reconsidering the safety and efficacy of combining these treatments.
- **Relapse during buprenorphine treatment**: Studies have highlighted factors contributing to relapse that necessitate practice updates.
- **Requirements for counseling**: Recent findings challenge the extent of mandatory counseling requirements.
- **Uses of drug testing**: Evidence for more targeted approaches to drug testing is discussed.
- **Use of other substances during buprenorphine treatment**: The impact of concurrent substance use on treatment outcomes is reviewed.
- **Duration of buprenorphine treatment**: Evidence for determining optimal treatment durations is provided.

For each area, evidence for needed updates and modifications in practice is presented. These modifications will facilitate more successful, evidence-based treatment and care for patients with OUD.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride [^114JUz2A]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Buprenorphine HCl Injection is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic, where alternate treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see WARNINGS: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse], reserve Buprenorphine HCl Injection for patients for whom alternative treatment options, such as non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products, are inadequate.

Buprenorphine HCl Injection should not be used for an extended period unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

### Safety and efficacy of lofexidine for medically managed opioid withdrawal: A randomized controlled clinical trial [^116qPep6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to their use as maintenance treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD), opioid agonists such as buprenorphine and methadone are used for opioid withdrawal syndrome (OWS) management but have limitations. These include the potential for misuse and some restrictions on availability due to prejudicial stigma and special regulatory requirements. The α2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine, an antihypertensive, is used off-label for OWS management but is not U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, has not been adequately studied to inform consistent dosing guidelines — especially for nonspecialists — and may be limited by significant sedation and hypotension at doses effective in alleviating symptoms of OWS.

Lofexidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that has shown evidence in several studies of efficacy in the management of OWS and may have a more favorable side effect profile compared with clonidine. It has been approved and widely used for OWS management in the United Kingdom since the early 1990s. At the recommendation of the FDA, in order to meet the agency's criteria for potential approval of lofexidine, this study was undertaken to further define the efficacy and safety of lofexidine for the management of opioid withdrawal. The essential design of the study was recommended by the FDA to meet registration requirements. Based on the results of this study and a previously reported pivotal trial, the FDA approved lofexidine in May 2018 with an indication for the mitigation of withdrawal symptoms to facilitate the abrupt discontinuation of opioids in adults.

### Buprenorphine for managing opioid withdrawal [^114wpoAW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Managed withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of substitution treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of buprenorphine versus tapered doses of methadone, alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications, placebo, or different buprenorphine regimens for managing opioid withdrawal. The evaluation focuses on the intensity of the withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration and completion of treatment, and adverse effects.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 11, 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to December week 1, 2016), Embase (to 22 December 2016), PsycINFO (1806 to December week 3, 2016), and the Web of Science (to 22 December 2016) and handsearched the reference lists of articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of interventions using buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha 2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine or lofexidine), symptomatic medications, placebo, and different buprenorphine-based regimens.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 27 studies involving 3048 participants. The main comparators were clonidine or lofexidine (14 studies). Six studies compared buprenorphine versus methadone, and seven compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. We assessed 12 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one of seven domains.

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: Expert opinion [^116iMtkh]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

When switching patients from a full µ-opioid receptor agonist to buprenorphine, it is advised to convert directly to buprenorphine without a weaning period. Starting doses should be based on the dose of the previously administered opioid. If withdrawal is a concern, an adrenergic α2 agonist or rescue medication can be used proactively or reactively.

Additional studies are also suggested on the likelihood of precipitated withdrawal during conversion from a full µ-opioid receptor agonist to buprenorphine, on respiratory depression with buprenorphine vs. full µ-opioid receptor agonists (with and without benzodiazepines), and on the abuse potential of buprenorphine. The panel also encourages further research on the effectiveness of reversing buprenorphine effects with naloxone or other opioid antagonists.

Overall, the consensus was that, when used appropriately, buprenorphine is a unique opioid with favorable properties for the management of chronic pain. Additional topics, including the off-label use of sublingual buprenorphine in chronic pain and more detailed treatment recommendations for patients with comorbid OUD and chronic pain, were suggested for discussion at future meetings.

### Managing opioid addiction with buprenorphine [^112qxEAt]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Legislation has enabled physicians to treat opioid-dependent patients with an office-based maintenance program using buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist. Clinical studies indicate that buprenorphine effectively manages opioid addiction and is more effective than placebo. However, it may not be superior to methadone if high doses are needed; it is comparable to lower doses of methadone. Treatment phases include induction, stabilization, and maintenance. Buprenorphine therapy should be initiated at the onset of withdrawal symptoms and adjusted to address withdrawal symptoms and cravings.

- **Advantages**: Buprenorphine offers low abuse potential and high availability for office use.
- **Disadvantages**: The high cost and possible lack of effectiveness in patients who require high methadone doses.

Most family physicians are required to complete eight hours of training before they can prescribe buprenorphine for opioid addiction.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: A review [^112pqmUF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosing evidence from clinical research**: Clinical studies of OUD treatment generally use a combination of the following outcomes: (1) retention in care, (2) substance use measured by drug testing, and (3) OUD consequences such as overdose, drug-related medical conditions, hospitalization and emergency department use, incarceration, housing instability, or unemployment. Hereinafter are descriptions of chronologically ordered studies where doses of buprenorphine up to 32 mg/d and patient perception of dose adequacy were consequential for improved outcomes.

In a 2007 randomized controlled trial in outpatients, dosing was determined by patient-perceived adequacy. A stepped-care strategy was evaluated in which initial buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) doses were increased up to a maximum of 32/8 mg/d. Participants were switched to methadone if an adequate BUP/NX dose could not be achieved. Among participants who remained on BUP/NX (17 of 48 participants), the mean (SD) final dose was 29.6 (4.7) mg/d. Twenty participants switched to methadone with a mean (SD) final dose of 111.0 (11.7) mg/d, and 11 dropped out. There was no difference in retention or toxicology results between those who remained on BUP/NX and those who switched to methadone.

A 2012 meta-analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials (N = 2703) compared outcomes between higher- and lower-dose groups (16–32 vs. < 16 mg/d). The higher-dose group had better retention and fewer positive test results for opioids and cocaine.

In a 2012 observational analysis, gradual dose titration was…

### Discontinuing methadone and buprenorphine: A review and clinical challenges [^114pzZkA]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

This paper offers a review and recommendations for clinicians working with patients interested in discontinuing opioid agonist treatment. As buprenorphine/naloxone has gained widespread acceptance for opioid addiction, many treatment providers and patients have a range of hopes and expectations about its optimal use. A surprising number assume buprenorphine/naloxone is primarily useful as a medication to transition off illicit opioid use, and success is partially defined by discontinuing the medication. Despite accumulating evidence that a majority of patients will need to remain on medication to preserve their gains, clinicians often have to address a patient's fervent desire to taper.

Using the concept of "recovery capital", our review addresses:

- **Appropriate duration of opioid agonist treatment**: Understanding how long treatment should ideally continue for optimal results.
- **Risks associated with discontinuing**: Identifying potential challenges and health risks involved in stopping treatment.
- **Checklist for self-assessment**: Providing a guide for patients to evaluate the wisdom of discontinuing opioid agonist treatment.
- **Shared decision making**: Facilitating a collaborative approach to decide the best course of action for the patient.

### Managing opioid use disorder in primary care: Peer simplified guideline [^1117AxwW]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de Famille Canadien (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning buprenorphine/naloxone, the CFPC 2019 guidelines recommend considering the prescription of take-home doses (for 2–7 days) as an option when need and stability indicate.
