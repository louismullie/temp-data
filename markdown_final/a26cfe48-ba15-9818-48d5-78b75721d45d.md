## Question

Omega 3 for ADHD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether omega-3 fatty acids are effective for treating ADHD and how to interpret the evidence for clinical decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence, especially the 2023 Cochrane review. Then, I should verify what more recent meta-analyses say and whether any subgroup effects change the conclusion. Next, I will examine individual trials that suggest benefit in specific contexts, like low baseline EPA or longer treatment duration. After that, I need to check guideline positions and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation with dosing and monitoring considerations, while noting limitations and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the anchor evidence. The 2023 Cochrane review included 37 trials with 2,374 participants and concluded there is high-certainty evidence that omega-3 PUFA supplementation does not improve parent-rated total ADHD symptoms, inattention, or hyperactivity/impulsivity compared with placebo, despite a low-certainty signal that more children may be rated as "improved" on a global scale in a small subset of studies, which I should not overinterpret given the overall negative findings [^fdbd1027].

> Wait, let me verify whether newer meta-analyses contradict this. A 2023 meta-analysis of 22 RCTs found no significant benefit overall for core ADHD symptoms, but did find a modest benefit when treatment lasted at least 4 months, suggesting duration may matter. However, heterogeneity and small subgroup sizes temper confidence, so I should be cautious about recommending routine long-term use based on this subgroup alone [^316474c1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check whether baseline fatty acid status modifies response. Multiple reports from the same randomized trial of high-dose EPA monotherapy show that youth with low baseline EPA had meaningful improvements in attention and vigilance, whereas those with high baseline EPA did worse than placebo on impulsivity measures. This is a compelling personalized-medicine signal, but it requires replication and is not yet practice-changing on its own [^c5868e44] [^7d712e24] [^80bbbdd8].

> I should confirm what guidelines say before making any recommendation. The AAP 2019 guideline emphasizes FDA-approved medications plus behavioral therapy as first-line and does not recommend omega-3s as a treatment for ADHD, which aligns with the Cochrane conclusions and the modest, inconsistent effects seen in trials [^1f9b3e7a] [^613374ce]. WHO 2023 supports psychosocial interventions and structured physical activity but does not endorse omega-3s for ADHD management, reinforcing that omega-3s are not a guideline-supported therapy [^ff9fbbde] [^7c158d39].

> Let me consider safety and tolerability, because that influences risk–benefit decisions when evidence is weak. Across trials, omega-3s are generally well tolerated with gastrointestinal upset being the most common issue, and no consistent signal for serious adverse events. However, supplements are not FDA-regulated for ADHD, so product quality and actual EPA/DHA content can vary, which is a practical limitation clinicians should discuss with families [^fdbd1027] [^d52b3b96].

> Next, I should review dosing signals from positive studies to give practical guidance if a family elects a trial despite uncertain benefit. Trials suggesting benefit often used at least 750–1,200 mg/day of combined EPA and DHA, with some using 1–2 g/day, and durations of 12–16 weeks or longer in subgroup analyses. Given the poor conversion of EPA to DHA, combined EPA+DHA formulations are reasonable if pursuing a therapeutic trial, though I need to emphasize this remains investigational [^c5868e44] [^316474c1] [^24675891].

> But wait, what if the child has comorbidities or is already on stimulants? I should double-check whether omega-3s help as adjuncts. Evidence for reducing stimulant dose or enhancing response is sparse and inconsistent, so omega-3s should not be relied upon to replace or meaningfully reduce established pharmacotherapy, and any adjunctive trial should be coordinated with the prescribing clinician [^fdbd1027] [^88f04bce].

> I will now examine the biological plausibility to ensure I'm not missing a mechanistic rationale. Omega-3s influence neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and membrane fluidity, and preclinical work suggests modulation of Wnt and mTOR pathways relevant to neurodevelopment, but translating this into consistent clinical benefit in heterogeneous ADHD populations has proven difficult, which helps explain the mixed clinical results despite plausible mechanisms [^02dac7ec] [^ffdcbe05].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. High-certainty evidence shows no clinically meaningful benefit of omega-3s for core ADHD symptoms in most children, so routine use is not supported. Low-certainty signals of benefit emerge with longer treatment duration or in those with low baseline EPA, but these findings require replication and should be framed as optional, individualized trials rather than standard care, especially when families decline or cannot access standard treatments [^fdbd1027] [^316474c1] [^c5868e44].

> Final clinical take: I should confirm the diagnosis and optimize evidence-based treatments first. If a family is interested in omega-3s after counseling about the weak and inconsistent evidence, a time-limited, adequately dosed trial of combined EPA+DHA for at least 12–16 weeks can be considered, ideally with attention to baseline fatty acid status when feasible and with clear stop criteria if no benefit is observed. Throughout, I need to ensure shared decision-making and monitor for tolerability and adherence, while avoiding substitution for guideline-recommended care [^1f9b3e7a] [^c5868e44] [^316474c1].

Omega-3 fatty acids have **modest, inconsistent effects** on ADHD symptoms and are **not a substitute for standard care**. High-quality evidence shows **no significant benefit** for core ADHD symptoms overall [^fdbd1027], but **subgroups with low baseline omega-3** [^c5868e44] or longer treatment duration (≥ 4 months) [^316474c1] may show small improvements in attention or hyperactivity. Omega-3s are generally safe and may be considered as an adjunct, especially for patients who cannot tolerate or decline stimulants, but **dosing should be 1–2 g/day of combined EPA/DHA** for at least 12 weeks to assess response [^c5868e44].

---

## Mechanisms of action relevant to ADHD

Omega-3s, particularly EPA and DHA, influence brain function via several mechanisms relevant to ADHD:

- **Neurotransmission**: Modulate dopamine and serotonin systems implicated in ADHD [^f3d0e2fd].
- **Neuroinflammation**: Anti-inflammatory effects may reduce neuroinflammation linked to ADHD [^f7a45912].
- **Neurodevelopment**: Support synaptogenesis and neuroplasticity, potentially aiding neurodevelopmental deficits in ADHD [^02dac7ec].

---

## Clinical evidence for omega-3 supplementation in ADHD

### Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

- **2023 Cochrane review**: 37 trials, 2,374 participants; high-certainty evidence shows no significant effect on parent-rated total ADHD symptoms, inattention, or hyperactivity/impulsivity vs placebo [^fdbd1027].
- **2023 meta-analysis**: 22 RCTs, 1,789 participants; no significant benefit overall, but subgroup with ≥ 4 months treatment showed modest improvement (SMD −0.35) [^316474c1].
- **2011 meta-analysis**: 10 trials, 699 children; small but significant benefit (SMD 0.31), with higher EPA dose linked to greater improvement [^f3d0e2fd].

---

### Individual randomized controlled trials

- **High-dose EPA trial**: 1.2 g/day EPA for 12 weeks improved attention and vigilance in youth with low baseline EPA, with effect sizes ~0.8–0.9 [^c5868e44] [^7d712e24].
- **DHA-only trial**: 345 mg/day DHA for 4 months showed no benefit in children with ADHD [^44e8ad9f].
- **Combined omega-3/6 trial**: 3–6 months of combined omega-3/6 improved behavior and academic performance in children refractory to methylphenidate [^b7676160].

---

## Factors influencing efficacy

Several factors **modulate omega-3 response** in ADHD:

| **Factor** | **Influence on efficacy** |
|-|-|
| Baseline omega-3 status | Lower baseline EPA/DHA predicts greater improvement [^c5868e44] [^e0214165] |
| EPA vs DHA content | Higher EPA proportion may be more effective for attention and hyperactivity [^f3d0e2fd] [^69771484] |
| Treatment duration | Longer treatment (≥ 4 months) may yield modest benefits [^316474c1] |
| Age and comorbidities | Younger children and those with comorbidities may respond differently [^notfound] |

---

## Safety and tolerability

Omega-3s are **generally well tolerated**; mild gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common adverse effects. No consistent increase in serious adverse events has been observed in pediatric trials [^fdbd1027] [^d52b3b96].

---

## Comparison with standard ADHD treatments

Omega-3s have **smaller, less consistent effects** than stimulants or behavioral therapy and are not recommended as first-line treatment. They may be considered adjunctive or when standard treatments are not tolerated or declined [^fdbd1027] [^1f9b3e7a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the AAP and WHO **do not recommend omega-3s as first-line therapy** for ADHD. They may be considered as adjuncts or when standard treatments are unsuitable, with shared decision-making about the limited evidence [^1f9b3e7a] [^ff9fbbde].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Consider for patients with low baseline omega-3s, mild symptoms, or intolerance/decline of stimulants [^c5868e44] [^f1928e2e].
- **Formulation and dose**: Use 1–2 g/day of combined EPA/DHA, with higher EPA proportion (e.g. 2:1 EPA:DHA) for ≥ 12 weeks [^c5868e44] [^69771484].
- **Monitoring**: Track ADHD symptoms, tolerability, and adherence; adjust or discontinue if no benefit by 12–16 weeks [^notfound].
- **Adjunctive care**: Combine with behavioral therapy and consider nutritional counseling to improve omega-3 intake [^613374ce] [^f1928e2e].

---

Omega-3s have **modest, inconsistent effects** on ADHD symptoms and are not a substitute for standard care. They may help selected patients — particularly those with low baseline omega-3s or who cannot use stimulants — when used at 1–2 g/day of combined EPA/DHA for at least 12 weeks. Clinicians should set expectations, monitor response, and integrate omega-3s within a comprehensive ADHD plan.

### Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents [^fdbd1027]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major problem in children and adolescents, characterised by age-inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, and is associated with long-term social, academic, and mental health problems. The stimulant medications methylphenidate and amphetamine are the most frequently used treatments for ADHD, but these are not always effective and can be associated with side effects. Clinical and biochemical evidence suggests that deficiencies of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could be related to ADHD. Research has shown that children and adolescents with ADHD have significantly lower plasma and blood concentrations of PUFA and, in particular, lower levels of omega-3 PUFA. These findings suggest that PUFA supplementation may reduce the attention and behaviour problems associated with ADHD. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Overall, there was little evidence that PUFA supplementation improved symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of PUFA to other forms of treatment or placebo in treating the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched 13 databases and two trials registers up to October 2021. We also checked the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for additional references.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared PUFA with placebo or PUFA plus alternative therapy (medication, behavioural therapy, or psychotherapy) with the same alternative therapy alone in children and adolescents (aged 18 years and under) diagnosed with ADHD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was severity or improvement of ADHD symptoms. Our secondary outcomes were severity or incidence of behavioural problems; quality of life; severity or incidence of depressive symptoms; severity or incidence of anxiety symptoms; side effects; loss to follow-up; and cost. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 37 trials with more than 2374 participants, of which 24 trials were new to this update. Five trials (seven reports) used a cross-over design, while the remaining 32 trials (52 reports) used a parallel design. Seven trials were conducted in Iran, four each in the USA and Israel, and two each in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK. Single studies were conducted in Brazil, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan. Of the 36 trials that compared a PUFA to placebo, 19 used an omega-3 PUFA, six used a combined omega-3/omega-6 supplement, and two used an omega-6 PUFA. The nine remaining trials were included in the comparison of PUFA to placebo, but also had the same co-intervention in the PUFA and placebo groups. Of these, four trials compared a combination of omega-3 PUFA plus methylphenidate to methylphenidate. One trial each compared omega-3 PUFA plus atomoxetine to atomoxetine; omega-3 PUFA plus physical training to physical training; and an omega-3 or omega-6 supplement plus methylphenidate to methylphenidate; and two trials compared omega-3 PUFA plus dietary supplement to dietary supplement. Supplements were given for a period of between two weeks and six months. Although we found low-certainty evidence that PUFA compared to placebo may improve ADHD symptoms in the medium term (risk ratio (RR) 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47 to 2.60; 3 studies, 191 participants), there was high-certainty evidence that PUFA had no effect on parent-rated total ADHD symptoms compared to placebo in the medium term (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.08, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.07; 16 studies, 1166 participants). There was also high-certainty evidence that parent-rated inattention (medium-term: SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.17; 12 studies, 960 participants) and hyperactivity/impulsivity (medium-term: SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.23; 10 studies, 869 participants) scores were no different compared to placebo. There was moderate-certainty evidence that overall side effects likely did not differ between PUFA and placebo groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.52; 8 studies, 591 participants). There was also moderate-certainty evidence that medium-term loss to follow-up was likely similar between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.37; 13 studies, 1121 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Although we found low-certainty evidence that children and adolescents receiving PUFA may be more likely to improve compared to those receiving placebo, there was high-certainty evidence that PUFA had no effect on total parent-rated ADHD symptoms. There was also high-certainty evidence that inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity did not differ between PUFA and placebo groups. We found moderate-certainty evidence that overall side effects likely did not differ between PUFA and placebo groups. There was also moderate-certainty evidence that follow-up was similar between groups. It is important that future research addresses the current weaknesses in this area, which include small sample sizes, variability of selection criteria, variability of the type and dosage of supplementation, and short follow-up times.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for core symptoms of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^316474c1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective: Previous studies have shown conflicting results for the effectiveness of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in improving attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. This inconsistency may be due to differences in dosage, composition, and treatment duration. The current meta-analysis aims to address this inconsistency by improving subtype analyses and focusing on heterogeneity in treatment duration, omega-3 PUFA composition, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) dose.

Data Sources and Study Selection: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials of omega-3 PUFAs for ADHD, without publication year or language limitations, up to November 27, 2022. The primary outcome was the improvement of ADHD core symptoms. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the formula, dosages, and composition ratios of omega-3 PUFAs. To ensure methodological quality, the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool 1.0 was utilized to assess the risk of bias for each study included in the analysis. The pooled data were then analyzed using the random-effect meta-analysis, and the inverse variance method was employed.

Data Extraction: The outcomes of interest were extracted using a data extraction form developed for this study.

Results: Twenty-two studies with 1,789 participants were included in the analysis. Overall, omega-3 PUFAs did not significantly improve ADHD core symptoms compared to placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.16; 95% CI, -0.34 to 0.01; P = 0.07). However, in the subgroup of studies with a treatment duration of at least 4 months, omega-3 PUFAs were significantly more effective than placebo (SMD: -0.35; 95% CI,-0.61 to -0.09; P = 0.007). Neither high eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) dosage nor high EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratio was found to improve ADHD symptoms.

Conclusions: Our findings indicate that omega-3 PUFAs did not improve ADHD core symptoms, but long-term supplementation may have potential benefits. The main limitation of the study was the moderate heterogeneity and small sample sizes in subgroup analyses and the lack of dietary pattern information.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for the treatment of children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder symptomatology: systematic review and meta-analysis [^f3d0e2fd]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Several studies have demonstrated differences in omega-3 fatty acid composition in plasma and in erythrocyte membranes in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared with unaffected controls. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and can alter central nervous system cell membrane fluidity and phospholipid composition. Cell membrane fluidity can alter serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission. The goal of this meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in children with ADHD.

Method

PubMed was searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials examining omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in children with ADHD symptomatology. The primary outcome measurement was standardized mean difference in rating scales of ADHD severity. Secondary analyses were conducted to determine the effects of dosing of different omega-3 fatty acids in supplements.

Results

Ten trials involving 699 children were included in this meta-analysis. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation demonstrated a small but significant effect in improving ADHD symptoms. Eicosapentaenoic acid dose within supplements was significantly correlated with supplement efficacy. No evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity between trials was found.

Conclusion

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, particularly with higher doses of eicosapentaenoic acid, was modestly effective in the treatment of ADHD. The relative efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was modest compared with currently available pharmacotherapies for ADHD such as psychostimulants, atomoxetine, or α₂ agonists. However, given its relatively benign side-effect profile and evidence of modest efficacy, it may be reasonable to use omega-3 fatty supplementation to augment traditional pharmacologic interventions or for families who decline other psychopharmacologic options.

### Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents [^d171527c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major problem in children and adolescents, characterised by age-inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, and is associated with long-term social, academic and mental health problems. The stimulant medications methylphenidate and amphetamine are the most frequently used treatments for ADHD, but these are not always effective and can be associated with side effects. Clinical and biochemical evidence suggests that deficiencies of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could be related to ADHD. Children and adolescents with ADHD have been shown to have significantly lower plasma and blood concentrations of PUFA and, in particular, lower levels of omega-3 PUFA. These findings suggest that PUFA supplementation may reduce the attention and behaviour problems associated with ADHD.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of PUFA to other forms of treatment or placebo in treating the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in August 2011: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to July Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 29), PsycINFO (1806 to current), CINAHL (1937 to current), BIOSIS (1969 to 30 July 2011), Science Citation Index (1970 to 30 July 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 30 July 2011), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (1990 to 30 July 2011), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science and Humanities (1990 to 30 July 2011), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011, Issue 7), DARE (2011 Issue 2), Dissertation Abstracts (via Dissertation Express) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). In addition, we searched the following repositories for theses on 2 August 2011: DART, NTLTD and TROVE. We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for additional references.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently assessed the results of the database searches. We resolved any disagreements regarding the selection of studies through consensus or, if necessary, by consultation with a third member of the review team.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two members of the review team independently extracted details of participants and setting, interventions, methodology and outcome data. If differences were identified, we resolved them by consensus or referral to a third member of the team. We made all reasonable attempts to contact the authors where further clarification or missing data were needed.

Main Results

We included 13 trials with 1011 participants in the review. After screening 366 references, we considered 23 relevant and obtained the full text for consideration. We excluded five papers and included 18 papers describing the 13 trials. Eight of the included trials had a parallel design: five compared an omega-3 PUFA supplement to placebo; two compared a combined omega-3 and omega-6 supplement to placebo, and one compared an omega-3 PUFA to a dietary supplement. Five of the included trials had a cross-over design: two compared combined omega-3/6 PUFA to placebo; two compared omega-6 PUFA with placebo; one compared omega-3 to omega-6 PUFA, and one compared omega-6 PUFA to dexamphetamine. Supplements were given for a period of between four and 16 weeks. There was a significantly higher likelihood of improvement in the group receiving omega-3/6 PUFA compared to placebo (two trials, 97 participants; risk ratio (RR) 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 4.62). However, there were no statistically significant differences in parent-rated ADHD symptoms (five trials, 413 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.17, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.03); inattention (six trials, 469 participants; SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.21) or hyperactivity/impulsivity (five trials, 416 participants; SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.16) when all participants receiving PUFA supplements were compared to those receiving placebo. There were no statistically significant differences in teacher ratings of overall ADHD symptoms (four trials, 324 participants; SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.27); inattention (three trials, 260 participants; SMD 0.26, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.74) or hyperactivity/impulsivity (three trials, 259 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.35). There were also no differences between groups in behaviour, side effects or loss to follow-up. Overall, there were no other differences between groups for any other comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, there is little evidence that PUFA supplementation provides any benefit for the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents. The majority of data showed no benefit of PUFA supplementation, although there were some limited data that did show an improvement with combined omega-3 and omega-6 supplementation. It is important that future research addresses current weaknesses in this area, which include small sample sizes, variability of selection criteria, variability of the type and dosage of supplementation, short follow-up times and other methodological weaknesses.

### Essential fatty acids and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review [^4d39d62a]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

Essential fatty acids (EFAs), also known as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, have been claimed to have beneficial effects as a treatment for attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Animal experiments have provided information about the role of EFA in the brain, and several mechanisms of EFA activity are well known. The current review provides an updated, systematic overview of the theory and use of EFA in ADHD.

Method

Clinical studies and review papers of EFA blood levels and EFA supplementation trials in children with ADHD were researched in the Medline PubMed database. Additional studies were found from the references of these reports.

Results

Children with ADHD present lower levels of blood EFAs, and open-label EFA supplementation trials in ADHD raise EFA blood levels and improve symptoms of ADHD. Randomized controlled trials, however, have generally been unsuccessful in demonstrating any behavioural treatment effects.

Interpretation

Current findings do not support the use of EFA supplements as a primary or supplementary treatment for children with ADHD.

### Nonpharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review [^493f4c3b]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Nonpharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) encompass a range of care approaches from structured behavioral interventions to complementary medicines.

Objectives

To assess the comparative effectiveness of nonpharmacologic treatments for ADHD among individuals 17 years of age and younger.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant English-language studies published from January 1, 2009 through November 7, 2016.

Study Selection

We included studies that compared any ADHD nonpharmacologic treatment strategy with placebo, pharmacologic, or another nonpharmacologic treatment.

Data Extraction

Study design, patient characteristics, intervention approaches, follow-up times, and outcomes were abstracted. For comparisons with at least 3 similar studies, random-effects meta-analysis was used to generate pooled estimates.

Results

We identified 54 studies of nonpharmacologic treatments, including neurofeedback, cognitive training, cognitive behavioral therapy, child or parent training, dietary omega fatty acid supplementation, and herbal and/or dietary approaches. No new guidance was identified regarding the comparative effectiveness of nonpharmacologic treatments. Pooled results for omega fatty acids found no significant effects for parent rating of ADHD total symptoms (n = 411; standardized mean difference -0.32; 95% confidence interval -0.80 to 0.15; I² = 52.4%; P = 0.10) or teacher-rated total ADHD symptoms (n = 287; standardized mean difference -0.08; 95% confidence interval -0.47 to 0.32; I² = 0.0%; P = 0.56).

Limitations

Studies often did not reflect the primary care setting and had short follow-up periods, small sample sizes, variations in outcomes, and inconsistent reporting of comparative statistical analyses.

Conclusions

Despite wide use, there are significant gaps in knowledge regarding the effectiveness of ADHD nonpharmacologic treatments.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^c5868e44]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study shows some benefits of EPA monotherapy on cognitive symptoms of ADHD. As amply discussed, it is possible that a combined EPA + DHA strategy might have been more beneficial, and as such we support the recent recommendation by a panel of ADHD experts that patients who prefer omega-3 supplements over stimulants should take a combination of DHA and EPA at doses ≥ 750 mg per day for at least 12 weeks. However, we additionally recommend that this strategy should be even more strongly advocated for children with evidence of low endogenous PUFAs levels, as indicated by direct measurement, dietary habits or symptoms of EFA deficiency. Conversely, in the cases where high endogenous levels of PUFAs might already be present because of a dedicated diet or previous supplements, PUFAs levels should be investigated before trialling this strategy, to limit any potential negative effects. In this way, we can start bringing the benefits of 'personalised treatment' to children with ADHD.

### Fish, shellfish, and children's health: an assessment of benefits, risks, and sustainability [^a35fc26e]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation shows mixed evidence. A meta-analysis including 10 trials and 699 children reported a small effect (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.31; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.47) with higher EPA doses linked to greater improvement (β = .36; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.72; t = 2.30; P = 0.04; R² = 0.37), although these benefits were modest in comparison with standard pharmacotherapy. A 2012 Cochrane review of 13 trials with more than 1000 participants found no benefit of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on ADHD symptoms in children. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial of 95 children over 16 weeks based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria, supplementation improved working memory (pretrial, 97.51 ± 10.04; posttrial, 110.78 ± 11.47; F = 5.54; P = 0.019) compared with placebo; however, more recent studies have produced conflicting results, making firm conclusions about efficacy for ADHD management difficult.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation and cognition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8fb66985]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are promoted as cognitive enhancers with consumption recommended in the general population and those with neurocognitive deficits such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, evidence from randomised placebo-controlled trials is inconclusive.

Aims

This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on cognition in healthy populations and those with ADHD and related disorders (RDs).

Methods

Databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and school-aged children (who were healthy and typically developing (TD) or had ADHD or a related-neurodevelopmental disorder (ADHD+RD) which assessed the effects of n-3 PUFA on cognition.

Results

In the 24 included studies n-3 PUFA supplementation, in the whole sample and the TD and ADHD+RD subgroup, did not show improvements in any of the cognitive performance measures. In those with low n-3 PUFA status, supplementation improved short-term memory.

Conclusions

There is marginal evidence that n-3 PUFA supplementation effects cognition in those who are n-3 PUFA deficient. However, there is no evidence of an effect in the general population or those with neurodevelopmental disorders. This has important implications given the widespread advertisement and consumption of n-3 PUFA; claims of cognitive benefit should be narrowed.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^69771484]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A deficiency of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) may play a role in the pathogenesis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). N-3 PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential fatty acids (EFA) for our brain and body, and have been closely associated with cognitive functionand academic performance. Our recent meta-analysis has shown that youth with ADHD have lower blood levels of DHA, EPA and total n-3 PUFAs, when compared with typically developing youth. Moreover, EFA deficiency (a measure of symptoms such as excessive thirst, dry skin, brittle nails and small skin bumps) has been described in children with ADHD, and the severity of EFA deficiency has been associated with ADHD symptom severity.

Although meta-analysis report that stimulants are tolerated and effective treatments for youth with ADHD, these drugs have side effects that need monitoring, such as insomnia, risk of abuse, and changes in blood pressure, heart rate and body weight –. N-3 PUFAs have a very good tolerability and safety profile, and thus may be a preferable treatment option for youth with ADHD. Indeed, our recent meta-analysis has shown that n-3 PUFAs treatment improves clinical symptoms in youth with ADHD, although individual studies have conflicting findings, possibly because of different dosages of EPA and DHA used across studies. Of note, a previous meta-analysis examining clinical trials in children with ADHD showed that a high dose of omega-3 (1–2 g) supplementation was required to show significant improvement in clinical symptoms. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of n-3 PUFAs in ADHD seems to be particularly evident when measuring cognitive function (for example, attention and impulsivity) rather than generic ADHD symptoms. Interestingly, most of the n-3 PUFAs studies in ADHD used either a high-dose DHA, or a relative low-doses of DHA and EPA combination treatment, despite the evidence that EPA is the more effective therapeutic component, at least in depression –. In fact, our meta-analysisshows that only studies with EPA supplementation greater or equal to 500 mg per day find an improvement in the clinical hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms.

### The effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation in reducing ADHD associated symptoms in children as measured by the conners' rating scales: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^4b21b087]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 supplements are considered to have anti-inflammatory effects which may be beneficial as inflammation has been linked to ADHD. The aim of this review is to examine the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation at reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents. Medline, Cinahl+, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Embase were searched for trials investigating the effects of omega-3 supplementation in children and adolescents with ADHD. The primary outcome measure was a mean difference in Conners' rating scale (CRS) between the intervention and placebo group. Search terms used include ADHD, omega-3, fish oils, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acids, alpha-linolenic acid and Conners' rating scale. Randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation in children and adolescents as measured by CRS were included. Studies using a combination of polyunsaturated fatty acids or any other rating scale were excluded. Seven trials were included in this review, totalling 926 participants. We found no evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity between trials. Overall, there was a slightly greater reduction in CRS score in favour of the experiment group. One study found a greater reduction in score in favour of the placebo group. Neither findings were statistically significant. There is little supportive evidence to validate the claim of omega-3 supplementation to reduce the degree of ADHD symptoms experienced by children and adolescents. Both experiment and control groups saw similar reductions in Conners rating scale score.

### Combined ω 3 and ω 6 supplementation in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) refractory to methylphenidate treatment: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^b7676160]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Children (6–12 years) with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) being treated with methylphenidate and standard behavior therapy for more than 6 months, whose parents reported no improvement in behavior and academic learning, were randomly assigned to receive supplementation with a combined ω3 and ω6 preparation or a placebo. Outcome was measured at 3 and 6 months after treatment using a self-assessment checklist completed by the parents. Statistically significant improvement was found in the treatment group compared with the placebo group (P < .01) in the following measures: restlessness, aggressiveness, completing work, and academic performance. Statistically significant improvement was not found at 3 months of treatment between groups but was evident at 6 months of treatment (P < .05) with inattention, impulsiveness, and cooperation with parents and teachers. Distractibility failed to show improvement. Effect sizes ranged from 0.3 to 1.1 at 3 months and 0.2 to 1.4 at 6 months for individual symptom variables.

### The role of nutritional supplements in the treatment of ADHD: what the evidence says [^88f04bce]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral disorder in children and adolescents and may persist into adulthood. Insufficient nutritional supply of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) and other components including various minerals has been suggested to play a role in the development of ADHD symptoms. This review presents the evidence regarding the role of nutritional PUFA, zinc, iron, and magnesium supplements in the treatment of ADHD with a focus on the critical evaluation of the relevant literature published from 2014 to April 2016. The evaluation of therapeutic nutritional LC-PUFA supplementation in ADHD has shown mixed and inconclusive results and at best marginal beneficial effects. The benefits of PUFAs are much smaller than the effect sizes observed for traditional pharmacological treatments of ADHD. The effectiveness of PUFA supplements in reducing medication dosage has been suggested but needs to be confirmed. Zinc, iron, and magnesium supplementation may reduce ADHD symptoms in children with or at high risk of deficiencies in these minerals. However, convincing evidence in this regard is lacking.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: dietary and nutritional treatments [^9729c896]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Dozens of complementary and alternative treatments have been advocated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Some verge into standard treatment of specific cases. Most do not have conclusive evidence of effectiveness or safety for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but some have enough evidence and are safe, easy, cheap, and sensible enough that individual patient trials can be justified. There is a need to flesh out the evidence base, which could be done cost effectively for supplements or off-label agents that are amenable to placebo control.

### Complementary and integrative treatments for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in youth [^24635fa0]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

First-line psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children are effective but limited by tolerability and accessibility problems. Many complementary and integrative strategies have been investigated as alternative or adjunctive treatments for the disorder, and the literature has progressed to meta-analyses for several. Although heterogeneity of study methods and risk of bias pervades the literature, we conclude that Omega-3 supplementation, dietary restriction of artificial food colorings, and physical activity can be considered evidence-based. Additionally, meditation, yoga, and sleep hygiene are safe, partially effective, cost effective and sensible adjunctive treatment strategies.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of docosahexaenoic acid supplementation in children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^44e8ad9f]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation for 4 months decreases the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Study Design

Sixty-three 6- to-12-year-old children with ADHD, all receiving effective maintenance therapy with stimulant medication, were assigned randomly, in a double-blind fashion, to receive DHA supplementation (345 mg/d) or placebo for 4 months. Outcome variables included plasma phospholipid fatty acid patterns, scores on laboratory measures of inattention and impulsivity (Test of Variables of Attention, Children's Color Trails test) while not taking stimulant medication, and scores on parental behavioral rating scales (Child Behavior Checklist, Conners' Rating Scale). Differences between groups after 4 months of DHA supplementation or placebo administration were determined by analysis of variance, controlling for age, baseline value of each outcome variable, ethnicity, and ADHD subtype.

Results

Plasma phospholipid DHA content of the DHA-supplemented group was 2.6-fold higher at the end of the study than that of the placebo group (4.85 ± 1.35 vs 1.86 ± 0.87 mol % of total fatty acids; P < .001). Despite this, there was no statistically significant improvement in any objective or subjective measure of ADHD symptoms.

Conclusion

A 4-month period of DHA supplementation (345 mg/d) does not decrease symptoms of ADHD.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^776b7e19]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, and much like our study, Raison et al.and Rapaport et al.find not only that high inflammation predicts a better response to the anti-inflammatory intervention, but also that low inflammation predicts a better response to placebo, i.e. lowering inflammation in people who already have low inflammation actually has adverse effects. We also find that children with the highest baseline EPA levels perform better on placebo than on EPA, in impulsivity and in parental and teachers' reports of ADHD and emotional symptoms. A previous meta-analysis in depression has also shown a "J-shaped curve" in the protective effects of PUFAs, increasing for doses of up to 1.8 g/day of n-3 PUFAs (or 0.6 g/day of EPA + DHA intake), and then decreasing for higher doses; this suggests that very high doses of PUFAs (or, by extensions, normal doses in people with high endogenous PUFAs levels), may have adverse effects. However, it is important to emphasise that this J-shaped curve has been described for the intake of PUFAs from the diet, rather than supplementation, and hence some potential mechanisms to explain these negative effects (high dietary intake of omega-6, or environmental contaminants like mercury from fish) are not present in our study. Reassuringly, most studies of children with ADHD (conducted largely in Western countries) have shown average endogenous EPA levels that are lower than those in our study, probably because of the low-fish and high-omega-6 dietary intake in non-Asian countries; thus, it is unlikely that non-Asian children would normally reach endogenous PUFAs levels that are similar to those in the highest tertile of our sample. Nevertheless, with fish intake and other natural sources of omega-3 being constantly advocated as part of a healthy diet, it is important to be aware that supplementing those who already have high levels of EPA may be detrimental.

### The diet factor in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^f1928e2e]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

This article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of dietary methods for treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when pharmacotherapy has proven unsatisfactory or unacceptable. Results of recent research and controlled studies, based on a PubMed search, are emphasized and compared with earlier reports. The recent increase of interest in this form of therapy for ADHD, and especially in the use of omega supplements, significance of iron deficiency, and the avoidance of the "Western pattern" diet, make the discussion timely. Diets to reduce symptoms associated with ADHD include sugar-restricted, additive/preservative-free, oligoantigenic/elimination, and fatty acid supplements. Omega-3 supplement is the latest dietary treatment with positive reports of efficacy, and interest in the additive-free diet of the 1970s is occasionally revived. A provocative report draws attention to the ADHD-associated "Western-style" diet, high in fat and refined sugars, and the ADHD-free "healthy" diet, containing fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids. The literature on diets and ADHD, listed by PubMed, is reviewed with emphasis on recent controlled studies. Recommendations for the use of diets are based on current opinion of published reports and our practice experience. Indications for dietary therapy include medication failure, parental or patient preference, iron deficiency, and, when appropriate, change from an ADHD-linked Western diet to an ADHD-free healthy diet. Foods associated with ADHD to be avoided and those not linked with ADHD and preferred are listed. In practice, additive-free and oligoantigenic/elimination diets are time-consuming and disruptive to the household; they are indicated only in selected patients. Iron and zinc are supplemented in patients with known deficiencies; they may also enhance the effectiveness of stimulant therapy. In patients failing to respond or with parents opposed to medication, omega-3 supplements may warrant a trial. A greater attention to the education of parents and children in a healthy dietary pattern, omitting items shown to predispose to ADHD, is perhaps the most promising and practical complementary or alternative treatment of ADHD.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^49fdca3b]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The exclusion criteria were: (1) Intelligence quotient < 70, based on a documented history of mental retardation; (2) for those ages 6–12 years old, a Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R) percentile scores less than 5% (indicating speech delay or intellectual disability); (3) other comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, and other major psychiatric disorders; (4) comorbid physical disorders, such as thyroid dysfunction and cerebral palsy; (5) currently using n-3 PUFAs supplements; and (6) allergy to n-3 PUFAs.

We performed power calculations for the sample size of the RCT. The ES for n-3 PUFAs in ADHD is around 0.2–0.3, but when we excluded the studies with less strictly diagnosis and those with low concentrations of EPA (less than 500 mg). We were to find the effect size of high dose EPA treatment is around 0.38 to 0.81. The online sample size calculator is used to calculate the sample size. Significance level: 0.05, power: 0.8, ES: 0.38 to 0.81, and the estimated sample sizes are between n = 246 to n = 50. One hundred and three youth were recruited and randomised to n-3 PUFAs (1.2 g/day EPA) or placebo (1.2 g/day soybean oil) for 12 weeks, and 92 subjects (mean age 9.49 + 3.05 years, 85.9% male) completed the 12-week trial (see Fig. 1). The randomisation numbers were generated from the computer. The investigators were blinded to both the group allocation during the study and when assessing the outcome measurements.

### ADHD in children and adolescents [^f32b283f]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prevalence estimates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) vary according to the diagnostic criteria used and the population sampled. DSM-IV prevalence estimates among school children in the US are 3% to 5%, but other estimates vary from 1.7% to 16.0%. No objective test exists to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD, which remains a clinical diagnosis. Other conditions frequently co-exist with ADHD.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of pharmacological treatments for ADHD in children and adolescents? What are the effects of psychological treatments for ADHD in children and adolescents? What are the effects of combination treatments for ADHD in children and adolescents? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 70 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, dexamfetamine sulphate, homeopathy, methylphenidate, modafinil, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and psychological/behavioural treatment (either alone or in combination with a drug treatment).

### The effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on emotional dysregulation, oppositional behaviour and conduct problems in ADHD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a8a41f07]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A number of randomised controlled trials report a beneficial effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation on emotional lability (EL) and related domains (e.g. oppositional behaviour, conduct problems). Given that n-3 PUFA supplementation shows a significant effect on reducing symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and that EL and related behaviours commonly co-occurs with ADHD, it is important that there is a more conclusive picture as to the effect of n-3 PUFA on these co-occurring clinical domains.

Methods

Databases (Ovid Medline, Embase, Psychinfo) were searched for trials assessing the effects of n-3 PUFA on EL, oppositional behaviour, aggression and conduct problems. We included trials in children who had ADHD or a related neurodevelopmental disorder.

Results

Of the 1775 identified studies, 10 were included in the meta-analysis. In the primary analyses n-3 PUFA supplementation did not show improvements in measures of EL, oppositional behaviour, conduct problems or aggression. However subgroup analyses of higher quality studies and those meeting strict inclusion criteria found a significant reduction in EL and oppositional behaviour.

Limitations

A number of treatment effects may have failed to reach statistical significance due to small sample sizes and within and between study heterogeneity in terms of design and study participants.

Conclusions

These results exclude the possibility of moderate to large effects. They provide suggestive evidence of small effects of n-3 PUFA on reducing EL and oppositional behaviour in subgroups of children with ADHD.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^e0214165]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

To test whether low endogenous PUFAs levels predict response to PUFAs, we use a similar approach to that used by two previous 'personalised psychiatry' studies, i.e. Raison et al.and Rapaport et al.: they both found antidepressant effects by an anti-TNF-alpha medication and by n-3 PUFAs, but only in patients with high baseline inflammation, i.e. those with biological evidence of abnormalities in the mechanism targeted by the interventions (in these two studies, inflammation). Consistent with this framework, we find that youth with the lowest levels of baseline endogenous EPA show the largest improvement in cognitive function following EPA. Although there are no other similar studies, previous research, in healthy children, as well as children and adults with ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, has shown that PUFAs improve cognitive function more in the presence of low "n-3 PUFAs status", i.e. in those with evidence of low dietary intake of fish, or if they present symptoms of the aforementioned EFA deficiency.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^bb29cdd6]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study, although with several strengths, is not without possible limitations. First the ADHD population is heterogeneous, with age ranging 6–18 years and comorbidity with ODD; however, these characteristics make our sample more similar to the ADHD population in clinical settings, which reinforces the generalisability of our study. A second limitation is the duration of our study, 12 weeks, while most of the studies included in our previous meta-analysishave longer durations (mean of 15.6 weeks). Perhaps a longer duration of the trial would have been more successful in eliciting effects of EPA on clinical symptoms in ADHD. However, longer trials risk high drop-out rates, and we wanted to test an intervention that was easily deliverable in non-specialist settings; our drop-out rate of around 10% testifies to the success of this approach. It is also interesting to note that those who discontinued the study had a younger age than those who completed the study; this may be due to the fact that parents of young children with ADHD might feel less distressed by the symptoms and thus less keen in pursuing treatment, as suggested by previous studies. Finally, we did not perform multiple comparison corrections in our analysis; we felt that this would have been too stringent, and might have generated false-negative findings. Instead, we have relied on the presentation of effect size differences throughout the papers, so that clinical significance, rather than statistical, is used to convey the strengths of the results; improvement in the overall group was at least moderate in its effect size (.38), and the improvements in the youth with the lowest EPA levels were big in their effect sizes (> 0.8), thus we trust that these are true positive findings.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^f7a45912]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Of note, there is some evidence that psychiatric treatments may be more effective when subjects are stratified based on biomarkers that are mechanistically relevant to the intervention. For example, two studies have shown that depressed patients with higher inflammation, as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) or high interleukin (IL)-6, have a better response to the anti-inflammatory, infliximab, or to n-3 PUFAs supplementation, respectively. Although there have been no clinical trials using PUFAs' endogenous levels to stratify patients in PUFAs clinical trials, we have previously shown a direct link between lower endogenous PUFAs levels and increased risk of developing interferon-alpha (IFN-α)-induced depression, suggesting that endogenous PUFAs levels can offer clinically-relevant information on course and outcome.

Finally, in term of the possible mechanism underpinning the therapeutic effects of PUFAs in ADHD, both inflammation and neuroplasticity have been proposed as relevant. There is some evidence suggesting that ADHD is associated with increased inflammation: for example, children with ADHD are more likely to suffer from asthma and atopic dermatitis, and two studies have found increased interleukin IL-6 in children with ADHD. In addition, neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may also play a role in ADHD, although the results have been inconsistent. PUFAs are generally considered to modulate neuroplasticityand to be anti-inflammatory; in fact we have previously shown that pre-treatment with EPA reduces the onset of depression induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IFN-α. Thus, both these biological systems might be relevant to the mechanisms of action of PUFAs in ADHD.

Based on the gaps in knowledge described above, we have conducted a 12-week double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) in youth (6–18 years) with ADHD, which: (1) compares a high dose of EPA (1.2 g/day) with placebo; (2) measures cognitive function as the primary outcome; (3) examines endogenous PUFAs levels to stratify patients and to examine the effects of treatments on PUFAs levels; and (4) investigate the inflammatory biomarker, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), and the neurotrophin, BDNF, as potential mechanisms.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^24675891]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The youth receiving EPA in our study show an increase in blood erythrocytes EPA and total n-3 PUFAs levels, and a decrease in the n-6/n-3 ratio, at the end of the 12 weeks. This is an expected finding, and it confirms the compliance of the youth with treatment. However, we also found that DHA levels do not increase in youth who received EPA, which is surprising since EPA is physiologically converted into DHA. However, this finding is consistent with a previous study showing that 1 g/day EPA in patients with depression only increases plasma EPA levels but not DHA levels. Similarly, studies in patients with dyslipidemia and healthy subjects found that 3–4 g/day EPA increases plasma EPA but not DHA levels. In humans, there is a poor enzymatic conversion of EPA to DHA, and genetic variants in fatty acid desaturase 2 gene (FADS2), the key enzyme responsible for the conversion from EPA to DHA, further reduce this conversion. Interestingly, and of specific interest for our study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FADS2 has been significantly associated with ADHD, suggesting that the genetic profile of ADHD may have further effects on PUFAs metabolism. While we wanted specifically to test whether EPA alone was enough (following from the evidence in depression), most of the other studies included in our previous meta-analysishave combined EPA + DHA interventions, and, indeed, in a previous cross-over clinical trial, an increase in erythrocyte EPA and DHA after a combined EPA + DHA intervention was associated with improved attention and behavioural symptoms in children with ADHD. Thus, taken together, our data do seem to suggest that, for ADHD clinical symptoms, combined EPA and DHA may have a broader impact than EPA alone on clinical symptoms, possibly because affecting both EPA and DHA levels.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^d2981e8c]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have compared the effects of EPA and placebo on cognitive and clinical symptoms of ADHD and on mechanistically-related biomarkers. Overall, EPA improves (more than placebo) focused attention at the CPT test, one of our main outcome measures. Moreover, youth with low endogenous EPA levels show even stronger effects of EPA in a further measure of attention (HRT) and in a measure of vigilance (HRTISIC), both improving more than in the placebo group. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the effects of EPA monotherapy in ADHD, and the first study ever to use endogenous baseline PUFAs levels to stratify subjects in a PUFAs clinical trial. Further analyses indicate that EPA treatment in those with high endogenous EPA levels may actually have detrimental effects.

Our main findings are consistent with (at least some) previous studies investigating n-3 PUFAs (usually, combinations of EPA and DHA) in ADHD. Our recently-published meta-analysishas shown that PUFAs improves attention and impulsivity in children with ADHD, but the results of the individual studies have been inconsistent. For example, Sinn et al.found an improvement in attention, but Voigt et al.did not; similarly, Vaisman et al.found an improvement in impulsivity, but Voigt et al.found that, much like this present study, placebo did better than PUFAs for impulsivity. While it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the reasons behind these discrepant findings, it is worth mentioning that both our study and Voigt et al.have around half of the sample with comorbid ODD. Interestingly, subgroup analyses in our data show that the improvement in attention does occur in the children with comorbid ODD, thus suggesting that specific classes of symptoms (impulsivity vs. attention, in this case) may respond differently to EPA also based on the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions.

### Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for children with specific learning disorders [^240900b2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 5% of school children have a specific learning disorder, defined as unexpected failure to acquire adequate abilities in reading, writing or mathematics that is not a result of reduced intellectual ability, inadequate teaching or social deprivation. Of these events, 80% are reading disorders. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in particular, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which normally are abundant in the brain and in the retina, are important for learning. Some children with specific learning disorders have been found to be deficient in these PUFAs, and it is argued that supplementation of PUFAs may help these children improve their learning abilities.

Objectives

1. To assess effects on learning outcomes of supplementation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for children with specific learning disorders.2. To determine whether adverse effects of supplementation of PUFAs are reported in these children.

Search Methods

In November 2015, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, 10 other databases and two trials registers. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing PUFAs with placebo or no treatment in children younger than 18 years with specific learning disabilities, as diagnosed in accordance with the fifth (or earlier) edition of theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), or the 10th (or earlier) revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) or equivalent criteria. We included children with coexisting developmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (MLT and KHT) independently screened the titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search and eliminated all studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria. We contacted study authors to ask for missing information and clarification, when needed. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

Two small studies involving 116 children, mainly boys between 10 and 18 years of age, met the inclusion criteria. One study was conducted in a school setting, the other at a specialised clinic. Both studies used three months of a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 supplements as the intervention compared with placebo. Although both studies had generally low risk of bias, we judged the risk of reporting bias as unclear in one study, and as high in the other study. In addition, one of the studies was funded by industry and reported active company involvement in the study. None of the studies reported data on the primary outcomes of reading, writing, spelling and mathematics scores, as assessed by standardised tests. Evidence of low quality indicates that supplementation of PUFAs did not increase the risk of gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 8.15; two studies, 116 children). Investigators reported no other adverse effects. Both studies reported attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related behaviour outcomes. We were unable to combine the results in a meta-analysis because one study reported findings as a continuous outcome, and the other as a dichotomous outcome. No other secondary outcomes were reported. We excluded one study because it used a cointervention (carnosine), and five other studies because they did not provide a robust diagnosis of a specific learning disorder. We identified one ongoing study and found three studies awaiting classification.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is insufficient to permit any conclusions about the effect of PUFAs on the learning abilities of children with specific learning disorders. Well-designed RCTs with clearly defined populations of children with specific learning disorders who have been diagnosed by standardised diagnostic criteria are needed.

### Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for children with specific learning disorders [^98587e4e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

About 5% of schoolchildren have a specific learning disorder, defined as an unexpected failure to acquire adequate abilities in reading, writing or mathematic skills not as a result of reduced intellectual ability, inadequate teaching or social deprivation. Of these, 80% are reading disorders. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in particular omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are found abundantly in the brain and retina are important for learning. Some children with specific learning disorders have been found to be deficient in these PUFAs, and it is argued that supplementation of PUFAs may help these children improve their learning abilities.

Objectives

To assess the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplementation for children with specific learning disorders, on learning outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in April 2012: CENTRAL (2012, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to April Week 2 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 16), PsycINFO (1806 to April 2012), ERIC (1966 to April 2012), Science Citation Index (1970 to 20 April 2012), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 20 April 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (1970 to 20 April 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Sciences and Humanites (1970 to 20 April 2012), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012, Issue 4), DARE (2012, Issue 2), ZETOC (24 April 2012) and WorldCat (24 April 2012). We searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov on 24 April 2012. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles identified by the searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with placebo or no treatment in children aged below 18 years with specific learning disabilities diagnosed using DSM-IV, ICD-10 or equivalent criteria. We intended to include participants with co-existing developmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (ML and KH) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the search results and eliminated all studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Authors were contacted for missing information and clarifications when needed.

Main Results

We did not find any studies suitable for inclusion in the review. One study is awaiting classification as we were unable to get any information from the study author.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion about the use of PUFAs for children with specific learning disorders. There is a need for well designed randomised studies to support or refute the use of PUFAs in this group of children.

### Effect of docosahexaenoic acid-containing food administration on symptoms of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder-a placebo-controlled double-blind study [^b1530f76]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation was able to ameliorate attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(AD/HD) symptoms in AD/HD children.

Design and Subjects

A placebo-controlled double-blind study with 40 AD/HD (including eight AD/HD-suspected) children of 6–12 y of age who were mostly without medication. Subjects of a DHA group (n = 20) took active foods containing fish oil (fermented soybean milk, bread rolls and steamed bread; 3.6 g DHA/week from these foods) for 2 months, whereas those of a control group (n = 20) took indistinguishable control foods without fish oil. The following items were measured at the start and end of the study: (1) attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity (AD/HD-related symptoms according to DSM-IV criteria); (2) aggression assessed by both parents and teachers; (3) visual perception (finding symbols out of a table); (4) visual and auditory short-term memory; (5) development of visual-motor integration; (6) continuous performance; (7) impatience.

Results

Changes in tests 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 over time did not significantly differ between the two groups. However, visual short-term memory and errors of commission (continuous performance) significantly improved in the control group compared with the changes over time in the DHA group (P = 0.02 and 0.001, respectively). Recalculation without AD/HD-suspected subjects (n = 4 each group) showed similar P-values with regard to both measures.

Conclusion

DHA supplementation did not improve AD/HD-related symptoms. Treatment of ADHD with fatty acids deserves further investigation, but careful attention should be paid as to which fatty acid(s) is used.

### The stress-wnt-signaling axis: a hypothesis for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and therapy approaches [^8bd705b8]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

In a whole transcriptomic study of brain hemispheres of C57BL/6J male mice fed with either standard lab diet (SD) or with a customized fish oil-enriched diet (FD), genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation, cellular development, embryonic development, synaptic transmission, development of the brain, inflammatory response, and developmental disorders have been found to differential express following FD. Interestingly, the FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene, known to be involved in stress regulation (see details under in chapter Stress and ADHD), was upregulated following FD pointing to the beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation(Fig. 1). Moreover, a vast number of genes in the Wnt-signaling pathway were differentially regulated following FD supplementation.

In addition, the nonpharmacological protective mechanisms of n -3-PUFA have been largely explored in several neurological diseases –. Evidence for alterations in n -3-PUFA blood levels in ADHD as well as lack of prenatal n -3-PUFA intake associated with the risk of ADHD has been reported. In addition, several clinical trials hint at the improvement of ADHD core symptoms after add-on n -3-PUFA treatment. Researchers have recently shown that children with ADHD tend to eat less Omega-3-enriched food (such as fish and seafood) in comparison to neurotypical individuals –. Indeed, according to a meta-analysis, child and adolescent ADHD patients have lower levels of DHA, EPA, and total n -3-PUFAs compared to controls. However, the link between levels of n -3-PUFA and the occurrence of this disorder in childhood is not limited to postnatal exposure: Lopez-Vicente and colleagueshave reported that an increase in the ratio between n -6 and n -3 concentrations in cord plasma during pregnancy may increase ADHD rates when children reach the age of seven. Some investigations have demonstrated that cognitive functions, such as working memory, teacher-rated behavior, and impulsivity, have improved after n -3-PUFA administration in children with ADHD –. In particular, EPA supplementation seems to elicit small but significant improvement in inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in ADHD patients. An in vitro study has recently shown that PC12 dopaminergic cells had their viability significantly increased after n -3-PUFA administration, starting with lower doses (from 100 pM). Interestingly, a double-blinded report revealed that a combined treatment of n -3-PUFA plus MPH in a group of ADHD children was able to increase the efficacy of MPH treatment by significantly increasing the response to this drug. Similarly, Anand and colleaguesfound that n -3-PUFA could improve ADHD scores in atomoxetine-treated children in comparison to the group that received this drug only. However, the difference was not statistically significant in cases of inadequate dosage administration.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^95b6d269]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

EPA treatment increases EPA, but not DHA levels, and does not affect hs-CRP and BDNF

As expected, EPA group showed a greater increase in EPA (p < 0.0001) and total n-3 PUFAs levels (p = 0.012), and a greater decrease of n-6/n-3 ratio (p = 0.008), compared with placebo (see Table 2). However, surprisingly, there was no difference in changes in DHA levels between EPA and placebo group (p = 0.342). Changes in hs-CRP and BNDF values are also reported in Table 2; there were no differences between EPA and the placebo (p = 0.747 and p = 0.070, respectively).

Changes in these biological measures after stratification based on tertiles are presented in Supplementary Tables S11 – S13. Across the three subgroups, EPA levels always increase in the EPA group. Again, across the three groups, there were no differences between EPA and placebo groups for changes in hs-CRP and BDNF.

### Treatment strategies for ADHD: an evidence-based guide to select optimal treatment [^434500ff]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing disorder affecting children, adolescents, and adults. Several treatment strategies are available that can successfully ameliorate symptoms, ranging from pharmacological to dietary interventions. Due to the increasing range of available options, an informed selection or prioritization of treatments is becoming harder for clinicians. This review aims to provide an evidence-based appraisal of the literature on ADHD treatment, supplemented by expert opinion on plausibility. We outline proposed mechanisms of action of established pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments, and we review targets of novel treatments. The most relevant evidence supporting efficacy and safety of each treatment strategy is discussed. We review the individualized features of the patient that should guide the selection of treatments in a shared decision-making continuum. We provide guidance for optimizing initiation of treatment and follow-up of patients in clinical settings.

### Supplementation of N-3 LCPUFA to the diet of children older than 2 years: a commentary by the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition [^65ab412a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this commentary is to review data on the effect of supplementation of paediatric patients ages 2 years or older with n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA). Some evidence for a positive effect on functional outcome in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was found; however, benefit was seen in only about half of the randomised controlled trials (RCT), and studies varied widely not only in dose and form of supplementation but also in the functional outcome parameter tested. The committee concludes that there are insufficient data to recommend n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in the treatment of children with ADHD, but further research on n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in ADHD may be worthwhile. The committee was unable to find evidence of a favourable effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on cognitive function in children. Although no benefit of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation was seen for major clinical outcome parameters in children with cystic fibrosis, a potentially beneficial shift towards less-inflammatory eicosanoid profiles seen in 2 studies provides grounds for further investigation; it is possible that earlier and longer supplementation periods may be needed to demonstrate clinical effect. For children with phenylketonuria, the limited data available suggest that supplementation of n-3 LCPUFA to the diet is both feasible and safe, but offers only transient benefit in visual function. For children with bronchial asthma there are insufficient data to suggest that LCPUFA supplementation has a beneficial effect. The committee advises paediatricians that most health claims about supplementation of n-3 LCPUFA in various diseases in children and adolescents are not supported by convincing scientific data.

EPA-induced changes are influenced by stratification on baseline endogenous EPA levels

Baseline EPA levels are presented in Table 2. After stratification based on tertiles of baseline EPA (n = 86), we found that, in the lowest EPA group, youth on EPA improved more than youth on placebo in another measure of attention (HRT, ES = 0.89, CIs = 0.10 to 1.63, p = 0.015; see Fig. 2a) and in vigilance (HRTISIC, ES = 0.83, Cis = 0.05 to 1.57, p = 0.036, see Fig. 2b). Interestingly, we also found that, in the highest endogenous EPA group, youth on EPA improved less than those on placebo in impulsivity (commission error; ES = −0.83, CIs = −1.59 to −0.02, p = 0.022, Fig. 2c). There were no other differences between placebo and EPA groups on other CPT measures (see Supplementary Tables S5 – S7).

### The effect of vitamin D and magnesium supplementation on the mental health status of attention-deficit hyperactive children: a randomized controlled trial [^5658926f]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

One study showed that serum magnesium levels in people with ADHD were significantly lower than in the general population as well as in laboratory references. Therefore, given the role of magnesium in the nervous system, it is likely that magnesium supplementation within this patient population can help improve symptoms. Similarly, magnesium supplementation has shown to improve several mental health parameters. A randomized clinical trial with magnesium supplementation (200 mg/day) for six months independent of other mental disorders coexisting with hyperactivity, significantly decreased hyperactivity compared to the control group and clinical state before supplementation. The magnesium therapy led to improvements in the behavior, both large- and small-scale mobility, decreased the level of anxiety and aggression, increased the attention, corrected with the improvement of the magnesium homeostasis. These results are consistent with our findings. Magnesium is involved in the pathogenesis of ADHD through various molecular mechanisms. Magnesium is an essential substance in the body and plays a vital role in biochemical and physiological neurological processes and controls the pathway of glutamate N-methyl aspartate, a stimulant that induces neurotoxicity. Many studies have also shown that magnesium plays a crucial role in the conversion of essential fatty acids to long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids as cofactors for desaturase enzymes. Therefore, its deficiency causes brain dysfunction.

In a previously published manuscript from this study, children's behavioral problems were examined with Conners' Parent Rating Scale-48 (CPRS-48), the results of which indicated improved behavior. In contrast, in the present manuscript, mental health was examined with SDQ tool, and the effects of improvement were proven for this outcome.

Our study had several limitations. First, we investigated the combined effect of magnesium and vitamin D, and the effect of each supplement was not studied separately. Second, our sample size was relatively small. Future studies should be designed to determine both the combined and individual effect of these micronutrients on people with ADHD in a larger population. Third, the dietary intakes of magnesium and vitamin D as essential cofounders were not assessed. Fourth, the duration of follow-up was short, so long-term effects are unknown. Finally, participants with low serum levels of these two micronutrients were included in the study, so it is unclear whether supplementation can be effective in patients with ADHD who are not deficient.

### Role of docosahexaenoic acid in maternal and child mental health [^02ca616c]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Mental health problems in women and children represent a significant public health problem worldwide, especially in developing countries. The role of nutrition as a cost-effective approach in the prevention and management of these conditions has received recent attention, particularly nutrients such as iron, zinc, and n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids, which play a role in brain structure and function. The objective of this article was to review current evidence on the relation between n-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and maternal and child mental health disorders. Human studies published in English were identified from Medline databases (1966 to June 2008) by using key search terms and review articles. A summary of the role of DHA in the human brain is followed by a review of human studies, both observational and intervention trials, that examine the relation between n-3 fatty acids such as DHA and depression and child mental health disorders. Observational studies support a direct association between poor n-3 fatty acid status and increased risk of maternal depression and childhood behavioral disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, evidence from intervention trials is weak. Most of the studies reviewed had small sample sizes and were conducted in clinically diagnosed samples, with no placebo-controlled groups. Little is known about the benefits of DHA in the prevention of maternal depression and ADHD. Large, well-designed, community-based prevention trials are needed.

Patients and methods

Participants

The Institutional Review Board of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH, Taichung, Taiwan) approved this study (CMUH 104-REC-058) and written informed consent was obtained from the participants and their parents. We recruited youth aged 6–18 years, with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of ADHD with either inattention (attention deficit disorder, ADD), hyperactivity, or combined presentation; we also assessed the presence of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), characterised by symptoms such as often losing temper, arguing with adults, defying rules and blaming others. All diagnoses were confirmed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist, and all participants were referred to the Department of Psychiatry, CMUH, from July 2016 to December 2017. The participants were either drug naïve or had no medication for the past 6 months. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for this study is: NCT03542643.

### The oxford-Durham study: a randomized, controlled trial of dietary supplementation with fatty acids in children with developmental coordination disorder [^b55f167d]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) affects approximately 5% of school-aged children. In addition to the core deficits in motor function, this condition is associated commonly with difficulties in learning, behavior, and psychosocial adjustment that persist into adulthood. Mounting evidence suggests that a relative lack of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to related neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders such as dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Given the current lack of effective, evidence-based treatment options for DCD, the use of fatty acid supplements merits investigation.

Methods

A randomized, controlled trial of dietary supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, compared with placebo, was conducted with 117 children with DCD (5–12 years of age). Treatment for 3 months in parallel groups was followed by a 1-way crossover from placebo to active treatment for an additional 3 months.

Results

No effect of treatment on motor skills was apparent, but significant improvements for active treatment versus placebo were found in reading, spelling, and behavior over 3 months of treatment in parallel groups. After the crossover, similar changes were seen in the placebo-active group, whereas children continuing with active treatment maintained or improved their progress.

Conclusions

Fatty acid supplementation may offer a safe efficacious treatment option for educational and behavioral problems among children with DCD. Additional work is needed to investigate whether our inability to detect any improvement in motor skills reflects the measures used and to assess the durability of treatment effects on behavior and academic progress.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^7d712e24]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

No studies have examined the relationship between endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) levels and treatment response to PUFAs. We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the effects of high-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 1.2 g) and placebo on cognitive function (continuous performance test) in n = 92 youth (age 6–18-years-old) with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Blood erythrocytes PUFAs were measured before and after treatment, to examine the effects of baseline endogenous EPA levels on treatment response and the effects of EPA treatment on PUFAs levels. Secondary measures included other ADHD symptoms, emotional symptoms, and levels of plasma high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Overall, EPA group improved more than placebo group on focused attention (variability, Effect size (ES) = 0.38, p = 0.041); moreover, within youth with the lowest baseline endogenous EPA levels, EPA group improved more than placebo group in another measure of focused attention (hit reaction time, HRT, ES = 0.89, p = 0.015) and in vigilance (HRT interstimulus interval changes, HRTISIC, ES = 0.83, p = 0.036). Interestingly, EPA group improved less than placebo group in impulsivity (commission errors), both overall and in youth with the highest baseline EPA levels, who also showed less improvement in other ADHD and emotional symptoms. EPA increased blood erythrocytes EPA by 1.6-fold but not DHA levels, and did not affect hs-CRP and BDNF plasma levels. In conclusion, EPA treatment improves cognitive symptoms in ADHD youth, especially if they have a low baseline endogenous EPA level, while youth with high EPA levels may be negatively affected by this treatment.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^b8ea6a81]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

We investigated inflammation as one mechanism that might explain the actions of EPA on cognitive function in ADHD. EPA has been shown to have anti-inflammatory action via antagonising membrane arachidonic acid (AA) formation and inhibition of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators. However, EPA did not affect hs-CRP levels in our study. Of course, the average hs-CRP levels of youth with ADHD in our study (just above 2 mg/L) were below the threshold for even low-grade inflammation (3 mg/L); thus, the presence of only very mild levels of inflammation might have made impossible to detect an anti-inflammatory action of EPA. Moreover, it is also important to highlight that a previous study found a significant decrease in plasma CRP levels in children with ADHD treated with combined 900 mg PUFAs per day (DHA 165 + EPA 635 mg); thus, it is also possible that EPA monotherapy is ineffective to induce an anti-inflammatory action. In a previous study we found that EPA pre-treatment is able to prevent inflammation-induced depression following IFN-alpha treatment; however, we did not measure CRP or indeed other immune biomarkers in that study, and thus we cannot exclude that the beneficial effects of EPA were due to changes in other mechanisms. Thus, the present study does support the possibility that both EPA and DHA are needed to exert a clear anti-inflammatory action.

The levels of neurotrophins, BDNF, were also not affected by EPA in this study. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatments for ADHD, such as methylphenidateand atomoxetine, modulate levels of BDNF, although BDNF levels were increased after 6 weeks treatment of methylphenidateand decreased after a 3-month treatment of atomoxetine. Studies of the associations between n-3 PUFAs intake and BDNF levels have also been inconsistent: for example, a positive association has been reported between n-3 PUFAs consumption and serum BDNF levels in adolescents, but clinical trials do not find an effect of n-3 PUFAs on BDNF levels in adults with distress following traumaor in adults with diabetes mellitus and depression. Again, preclinical evidence indicates that neuroplasticity effects of PUFAs may require both EPA and DHA, suggesting an explanation for our negative findings.

### Correlation between changes in blood fatty acid composition and visual sustained attention performance in children with inattention: effect of dietary n-3 fatty acids containing phospholipids [^301ee37b]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing evidence supports n-3 fatty acid (FA) supplementation for patients with psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the exact metabolic fate of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on different glyceride carriers remains unclear.

Objective

We investigated whether conjugation of EPA and DHA to phospholipid (PL-n-3) or to triacylglycerol (fish oil; FO) affects their incorporation in blood compartments and influences executive functioning.

Design

Children aged 8–13 y with impaired visual sustained attention performance received placebo, 250 mg/d EPA + DHA esterified to PL-n-3 (300 mg/d phosphatidylserine), or FO for 3 mo in a randomized double-blind manner. Main outcome measures included plasma and erythrocyte FA profile and continuous performance test results (Test of Variables of Attention; TOVA).

Results

Sixty of the 83 children enrolled completed the interventions (n = 18–21 per group). There was an enrichment of EPA (1.5–2.2-fold), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 1.2-fold), and DHA (1.3-fold) in the PL fraction in the plasma of FO- and PL-n-3-fed children. In erythrocytes, only PL-n-3 resulted in a significant reduction (approximately 30%) of very-long-chain saturated FAs (C20-24) and in an increase (1.2- and 2.2-fold, respectively) in linoleic acid and DPA. Total TOVA scores increased in the PL-n-3 (mean ± SD: 3.35 ± 1.86) and FO (1.72 ± 1.67) groups but not in the placebo group (-0.42 ± 2.51) (PL-n-3 > FO > placebo; P < 0.001). A significant correlation between the alterations in FAs and increased TOVA scores mainly occurred in the PL-n-3 group.

Conclusion

Consumption of EPA+DHA esterified to different carriers had different effects on the incorporation of these FAs in blood fractions and on the visual sustained attention performance in children. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00382616.

### Neurodevelopmental effects of omega-3 fatty acids and its combination with methylphenidate in iPSC models of ADHD [^ffdcbe05]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been linked to altered neurodevelopmental processes, including proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSC). We aimed to investigate the role of Wnt signaling, a pathway critical for brain development, in ADHD and to determine if modulation of this pathway using ω-3/6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may provide a beneficial treatment approach. Given the symptom heterogeneity in ADHD and the limited response to conventional therapies for some patients, we examined the effects of ω-3/6 PUFA treatment combined with Methylphenidate (MPH) on neurodevelopmental mechanisms using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NSCs, comparing controls to ADHD patients. Our results show that ω-3/6 PUFAs differentially regulate Wnt activity in NSCs depending on the patient's condition and the composition of the treatments. These findings highlight the potential of ω-3 PUFA treatment as personalized support for neurodevelopmental processes in ADHD. They also emphasize the importance of investigating ADHD subgroups, including those unresponsive to stimulant treatments, as they may exhibit distinct phenotypes.

Dietary supplements commonly used in children — fish oil — are described as prevalent, with "The 2012 NHIS results revealed that fish oil is one of the most commonly used natural products in children". Docosahexaenoic acid in fish oil "has convincing evidence for supporting full-term gestation and is integral in the development of the brain, nervous system, retina, testes, and renal cortex", and has "been associated with improvement of symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in some children, with minimal adverse effects noted".

### What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? [^00620469]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Toxins and diet

Specific environmental exposures that seem to have relevance to the ADHD phenotype include organic pollutants (eg, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs)) and lead. These may damage cognitive and neural systems known to be implicated in ADHD.

Associations between organophosphate pesticide exposure and ADHD have been investigated cross-sectionally, and prospectively (eg, Eskenazi et al, Marks et al, Rauh et al) using assessments of prenatal and postnatal (childhood) urinary organophosphate metabolites and umbilical cord plasma levels of pesticides.

PCBs are a large group of toxic manufactured organic compounds that were previously mass produced. Both human and animal studies have examined the effect of PCB exposure on neurobehavioural outcomes similar to those affected in ADHD, and these have found evidence of impairments in working memory, response inhibition and cognitive flexibility. A recent prospective study also found a positive association between low-level prenatal PCB exposure and ADHD-type behaviour in middle childhood, with a dose–response relationship. Both human and animal studies of lead exposure have shown similar impairments in executive functions and attention, with cognitive flexibility, vigilance and alertness being most reliably affected. There is also emerging evidence from several studies that lead could be implicated in ADHD even at low levels, but causality cannot be assumed from the evidence to date. Similarly, further work is needed to draw firm conclusions about how important pesticides and PCBs are as causes of ADHD.

Dietary constituents that have been studied in relation to ADHD symptoms include sugar, artificial food colourings, zinc, iron, magnesium and omega-3 fatty acids. There is no convincing evidence yet that diet plays a major causal role in ADHD. However, a separate issue relates to using dietary change to modify symptoms. Overall, the value of the studies looking at diet and ADHD are limited by small sized trials, subjective measures of outcome and varied protocols for intervention, and on this basis there has been inadequate evidence to suggest that dietary manipulation can ameliorate ADHD symptoms in children. However, a recent randomised controlled trial of a restricted elimination diet based on high or low IgG foods suggests a beneficial effect of a restricted elimination diet on ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms.

Mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid

The connection between ADHD and lipids has not been sufficiently investigated so far in adults. It has been hypothesized that ADHD symptomatology in adults could be associated with a deficiency or imbalance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), due to insufficient dietary intake of essential FAs, and/or impaired absorption of FAs, and/or an increased metabolism of FAs.

Three studies investigated PUFA levels in adults with ADHD. Young et al. was excluded because it reported the effect of the FA treatment on the biochemical assays of the biomarker (Supplementary Table 3). The results of our meta-analyses indicated no significant differences between patients and controls for: serum arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations (Supplementary Figure 8, Z = 0.99, P = 0.32 with heterogeneity in effect size across the studies P = 0.03, I² = 72%), serum eicosapentaenoic acid (Supplementary Figure 8, Z = 0.83, P = 0.41; no heterogeneity in effect size across the studies P = 0.11, I² = 54%) and serum dihomogammalinolenic acid (Supplementary Figure 8, Z = 0.70, P = 0.49; heterogeneity in effect size across the studies P = 0.005, I² = 81%). A significant difference between patients and controls was observed for serum docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; Supplementary Figure 8, Z = 4.14, P < 0.0001), significant after Bonferroni correction. For DHA, no heterogeneity in effect size across the studies was observed (P = 0.54, I² = 0%) as well as no publication bias (P = 0.19, Supplementary Table 5).

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^9571a77c]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Compared with the placebo group, the EPA group improves more in focused attention but less in impulsivity

Overall (n = 92), we found that youth on EPA improved more than youth on placebo in focused attention (CPT variability, ES = 0.38, CI = −0.05 to 0.80, p = 0.041) but less than those on placebo in impulsivity (commission errors, EF = −0.43, CIs = −0.84 to −0.01, p = 0.025). There were no other differences between the groups in other CPT measures of focused attention (omission errors, p = 0.615; HRT standard deviation (HRTSD), p = 0.573; detection p = 0.094), impulsivity (HRT, p = 0.059; perseveration, p = 0.604), sustained attention (HRTBC, p = 0.650) and vigilance (HRT interstimulus interval changes (HRTISIC), p = 0.492) (see Table 1).

There were no significant differences in the overall samples between EPA and placebo groups for changes in memory (see Supplementary Table S2) and in clinical (Supplementary Table S3) and emotional (Supplementary Table S4) symptoms.

As 51 out of 92 participants had comorbid ODD, and children with ADHD and ODD tend to be generally less responsive to pharmacological treatment, we tested whether this improvement in attention was present in a subgroup analysis of these 51 participants; and indeed, we found that, as in the whole group, youth on EPA improved more than youth on placebo in focused attention (ES = 0.66, CI = 0.07 to 1.23, p = 0.025).

### Effects of essential fatty acids in iron deficient and sleep-disturbed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children [^d8180844]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity constitute the core diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children. Patients generally suffer from sleep disturbance and malnutrition that can account for tiredness during the day, poor concentration, poor eating and depressed mood, along with anemia and an n-3 polyunsaturated acid deficiency. The change of ADHD behavior in children (9–12) was studied, following 10 weeks of treatment with a polyunsaturated acid mixture on six variables: cooperation, mood, concentration, homework preparation, fatigue and sleep quality. Iron status was also examined. Polyunsaturated acid administration was associated with significant improvement in quality of life, ability to concentrate, sleep quality and hemoglobin levels.

### The validity of a food frequency questionnaire as a measure of PUFA status in pregnancy [^e4eb526d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Several omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are considered important for normal neuronal development and function. Research suggests a possible antidepressant role of omega-3 supplementation, and as providing benefit for some inflammatory disorders. While supplementation is advocated for many conditions, empirical support is variable. Although suggested as protective against cognitive decline, a systematic review established no benefit of omega-3 supplements in cognitively-healthy older adults. Whilst some studies suggest omega-3 supplements may reduce cardiac risk a recent systematic review concluded that, while high circulating omega-3 is associated with reduced cardiovascular events, supplementation appears to have no cardiovascular benefit. Preliminary evidence of benefit has also been described for neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

As omega-3 PUFAs are increasingly positioned as having a broad therapeutic role, efficacy studies are likely to increase. In such evaluations, a clear advantage is that PUFAs can be measured directly in red blood cells (RBCs), plasma and adipose tissue, allowing quantitative rigor. However, it is not uncommon for evaluative studies to measure PUFA levels indirectly, and most commonly by food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that retrospectively seek details on frequency of consumption as well as portion size of foods and nutrients over a specific period. FFQs are suggested useful for nutrients such as PUFAs, as daily intake tend to vary. FFQ proponents argue their utility on grounds of low participant burden, cost-effectiveness and administrative ease. A key issue, however, is their validity. Indirect measures of nutrient intake risk multiple sources of error, relying on accurate memory, as well as reporting and dietary consistency. Accuracy of FFQs may be further compromised by a tendency to under-report consumption, and/or change consumption habits if the participants are aware their dietary intake will be the focus of an upcoming research study (or medical investigation). Absorption of some fats may vary between individuals from 68% to 94%, and diets high in carbohydrate and saturated fat may alter PUFA absorption.

### Cardiovascular effects of ADHD Therapies: JACC review topic of the week [^5b5eb27a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been stable over the past 3 decades, prescriptions of sympathomimetic stimulants have steadily increased in the United States. This study consisted of a systematic review of PubMed articles screened for ADHD medications and potential cardiovascular toxicity as well as nondrug strategies for managing ADHD. The cumulative body of data showed that ADHD medications cause modest elevations in resting heart rate and blood pressure. Other adverse effects reported with ADHD stimulants included arrhythmia, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and sudden death. However, such reports did not imply causation, and there was a paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing long-term safety of ADHD medications, particularly among adults. Further studies are essential to clarify the risks and benefits of ADHD stimulant medications and to explore nonpharmacological options, including regular exercise and omega-3 fatty acids, which could be helpful for improving ADHD symptoms.

### Omega-3 fatty acids: evidence basis for treatment and future research in psychiatry [^601bd7b6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if the available data support the use of omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFA) for clinical use in the prevention and/or treatment of psychiatric disorders.

Participants

The authors of this article were invited participants in the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Subcommittee, assembled by the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments of the American Psychiatric Association (APA).

Evidence

Published literature and data presented at scientific meetings were reviewed. Specific disorders reviewed included major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, borderline personality disorder and impulsivity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Meta-analyses were conducted in major depressive and bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, as sufficient data were available to conduct such analyses in these areas of interest.

Consensus Process

The subcommittee prepared the manuscript, which was reviewed and approved by the following APA committees: the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments, the Council on Research, and the Joint Reference Committee.

Conclusions

The preponderance of epidemiologic and tissue compositional studies supports a protective effect of omega-3 EFA intake, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in mood disorders. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials demonstrate a statistically significant benefit in unipolar and bipolar depression (p = .02). The results were highly heterogeneous, indicating that it is important to examine the characteristics of each individual study to note the differences in design and execution. There is less evidence of benefit in schizophrenia. EPA and DHA appear to have negligible risks and some potential benefit in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, but results remain inconclusive in most areas of interest in psychiatry. Treatment recommendations and directions for future research are described. Health benefits of omega-3 EFA may be especially important in patients with psychiatric disorders, due to high prevalence rates of smoking and obesity and the metabolic side effects of some psychotropic medications.

### Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [^7b8ff2ba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that impairments associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be partially explained by deficits of omega-3 fatty acids, and that supplementation of these essential fatty acids may lead to improvement of symptoms.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids for improving core features of ASD (for example, social interaction, communication, and stereotypies) and associated symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 2 June 2010: CENTRAL (2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to May Week 3 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 21), PsycINFO (1806 to current), BIOSIS (1985 to current), CINAHL (1982 to current), Science Citation Index (1970 to current), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to current), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (20 November 2008) and ClinicalTrials.gov (10 December 2010). Dissertation Abstracts International was searched on 10 December 2008, but was no longer available to the authors or editorial base in 2010.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation compared to placebo in individuals with ASD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently selected studies, assessed them for risk of bias and extracted relevant data. We conducted meta-analysis of the included studies for three primary outcomes (social interaction, communication, and stereotypy) and one secondary outcome (hyperactivity).

Main Results

We included two trials with a total of 37 children diagnosed with ASD who were randomised into groups that received either omega-3 fatty acids supplementation or a placebo. We excluded six trials because they were either non-randomised controlled trials, did not contain a control group, or the control group did not receive a placebo. Overall, there was no evidence that omega-3 supplements had an effect on social interaction (mean difference (MD) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.84 to 4.48, I² = 0%), communication (MD 0.62, 95% CI -0.89 to 2.14, I² = 0%), stereotypy (MD 0.77, 95% CI -0.69 to 2.22, I² = 8%), or hyperactivity (MD 3.46, 95% CI -0.79 to 7.70, I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

To date there is no high quality evidence that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation is effective for improving core and associated symptoms of ASD. Given the paucity of rigorous studies in this area, there is a need for large well-conducted randomised controlled trials that examine both high and low functioning individuals with ASD, and that have longer follow-up periods.

### Adverse event monitoring, assessment, and reporting in nutraceutical and phytoceutical trials for pediatric neuropsychiatric conditions: a systematic review [^6bbf23b6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are mainstay treatments for many neuropsychiatric disorders in childhood including depression, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD;). When these treatments are no longer effective, not well tolerated, or do not meet expectations, caregivers and clinicians may seek out other available options. The use of natural products — nutraceuticals (nutrient-based; e.g. polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, minerals) and phytoceuticals (herbal- or plant-based; e.g. St John's Wort, kava) — as an alternative or adjunct treatment may reflect a growing interest in nutritional psychiatry, which focuses on the relationship between nutrition and emotion, cognition, and behavior. Although this industry is growing, these products are not prescribed or regulated, which may lead to issues with improper use, undesirable drug interactions, and harmful or undesirable effects.

In 2022, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders published a consensus-based, graded, clinical guideline for nutraceutical/phytoceutical use. The group made a "weak" recommendation for use of two natural products, broad-spectrum micronutrient, and vitamin D, with children with ADHD based on supportive but limited data from meta-analytic level results. The group noted the challenge in interpreting the evidence base due to heterogeneity in product manufacturing and standardization as well as varying administration routes and doses. Authors of systematic reviews of trials of natural treatments for childhood ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, and depression have also commented on this challenge stating that variability in dosage and outcome measures limits cross-study comparisons and brief evaluation time-periods in trials limit the understanding of the effects of natural treatments over time.

One aspect missing from the existing reviews is a focus on the type and consistency in the methods used by investigators for monitoring, assessing, and reporting harmful or undesirable effects that could occur in trials studying natural treatments. Identifying these effects in pediatric trials of nutraceutical and phytoceutical products ensures the evidence base used to inform product-related decision-making accounts for both potential benefits and harms. The objective of this systematic review was to identify how and which adverse events have been monitored, assessed, and reported in trials of nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals for childhood neuropsychiatric conditions.

### Complementary and integrative treatments of aggressiveness / emotion dysregulation: associated with disruptive disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [^82c66a03]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Youth with emotional dysregulation (ED) and irritability/aggression, common in disruptive disorders (frequently comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), are underserved by conventional treatments. Anger dysregulation is usually the core feature of ED. Complementary and integrative Medicine (CIM) treatments for youth with disruptive disorders and ED are reviewed. Broad-spectrum micronutrient supplementation has a medium effect and is supported by two double-blind randomized controlled trials using similar formulations. Other CIM treatments supported by controlled data but needing further research, include omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, music therapy, martial arts, restricting exposure to media violence, decreasing sleep deprivation, and increased exposure to green-blue spaces.

### Stimulant and non-stimulant drug therapy for people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy [^787fabf0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can co-occur in up to 40% of people with epilepsy. There is debate about the efficacy and tolerability of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs used to treat people with ADHD and co-occurring epilepsy.

Objectives

To assess the effect of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs on children and adults with ADHD and co-occurring epilepsy in terms of seizure frequency and drug withdrawal rates (primary objectives), as well as seizure severity, ADHD symptoms, cognitive state, general behaviour, quality of life, and adverse effects profile (secondary objectives).

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 12 October 2020: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 9 October 2020), CINAHL Plus (EBSCOhost, 1937 onwards). There were no language restrictions. CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs for people of any age, gender or ethnicity with ADHD and co-occurring epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We selected articles and extracted data according to predefined criteria. We conducted primary analysis on an intention-to-treat basis. We presented outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), except for individual adverse effects where we quoted 99% CIs. We conducted best- and worst-case sensitivity analyses to deal with missing data. We carried out a risk of bias assessment for each included study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and assessed the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified two studies that matched our inclusion criteria: a USA study compared different doses of the stimulant drug osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) with a placebo in 33 children (mean age 10.5 ± 3.0 years), and an Iranian study compared the non-stimulant drug omega-3 taken in conjunction with risperidone and usual anti-seizure medication (ASM) with risperidone and ASM only in 61 children (mean age 9.24 ± 0.15 years). All children were diagnosed with epilepsy and ADHD according to International League Against Epilepsy and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, criteria, respectively. We assessed both studies to be at low risk of detection and reporting biases, but assessments varied from low to high risk of bias for all other domains. OROS-MPH No participant taking OROS-MPH experienced significant worsening of epilepsy, defined as: 1. a doubling of the highest 14-day or highest two-day seizure rate observed during the 12 months before the trial; 2. a generalised tonic-clonic seizure if none had been experienced in the previous two years; or 3. a clinically meaningful intensification in seizure duration or severity (33 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence). However, higher doses of OROS-MPH predicted an increased daily risk of a seizure (P < 0.001; 33 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence). OROS-MPH had a larger proportion of participants receiving 'much improved' or 'very much improved' scores for ADHD symptoms on the Clinical Global Impressions for ADHD-Improvement tool (33 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence). OROS-MPH also had a larger proportion of people withdrawing from treatment (RR 2.80; 95% CI 1.14 to 6.89; 33 participants, 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). Omega-3 Omega-3 with risperidone and ASM were associated with a reduction in mean seizure frequency by 6.6 seizures per month (95% CI 4.24 to 8.96; 56 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence) and an increase in the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater reduction in monthly seizure frequency (RR 2.79, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.24; 56 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence) compared to people on risperidone and ASM alone. Omega-3 with risperidone and ASM also had a smaller proportion of people withdrawing from treatment (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.59; 61 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence) but a larger proportion of people experiencing adverse drug events (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.44 to 4.42; 56 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence) compared to people on risperidone and ASM alone.

Authors' Conclusions

In children with a dual-diagnosis of epilepsy and ADHD, there is some evidence that use of the stimulant drug OROS-MPH is not associated with significant worsening of epilepsy, but higher doses of it may be associated with increased daily risk of seizures; the evidence is of low-certainty. OROS-MPH is also associated with improvement in ADHD symptoms. However, this treatment was also associated with a large proportion of treatment withdrawal compared to placebo. In relation to the non-stimulant drug omega-3, there is some evidence for reduction in seizure frequency in children who are also on risperidone and ASM, compared to children who are on risperidone and ASM alone. Evidence is inconclusive whether omega-3 increases or decreases the risk of adverse drug events. We identified only two studies - one each for OROS-MPH and omega-3 - with low to high risk of bias. We assessed the overall certainty of evidence for the outcomes of both OROS-MPH and omega-3 as low to moderate. More studies are needed. Future studies should include: 1. adult participants; 2. a wider variety of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs, such as amphetamines and atomoxetine, respectively; and 3. additional important outcomes, such as seizure-related hospitalisations and quality of life. Clusters of studies which assess the same drug - and those that build upon the evidence base presented in this review on OROS-MPH and omega-3 - are needed to allow for meta-analysis of outcomes.

### Testing maternal effects of vitamin-D and omega-3 levels on offspring neurodevelopmental traits in the Norwegian mother, father and child cohort study [^48d2c5ca]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurodevelopmental conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. They are characterized by early-onset delays and differences in developmental domains such as language and motor skills, social communication, flexibility, attention, and activity regulation (Thapar, Cooper, & Rutter). Neurodevelopmental traits are normally distributed throughout the population, and are etiologically complex, involving a large number of genetic and environmental predisposing factors (Thapar et al.). One proposed modifiable environmental predisposing factor is maternal nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy (Georgieff, Ramel, & Cusick). Many prenatal micronutrient deficiencies have been associated, including vitamin-D levels and omega-3 fatty acids (specifically Docosahexaenoic acid, DHA) (García-Serna & Morales; Nevins et al.). Nutrient availability during the prenatal period plays an important role in brain development. For example, vitamin-D receptors are present across several regions of the neonatal brain (Eyles, Smith, Kinobe, Hewison, & McGrath,) and play a role in crucial processes of brain development including neuronal differentiation and axonal connectivity (Eyles, Burne, & McGrath). DHA (along with other long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acids) is necessary for processes of brain development including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neuronal migration (Innis). Therefore, maternal deficiencies for both vitamin-D and DHA have been proposed to increase likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions through changes to the structure or functions of the developing fetal brain.

However, results from observational studies are inconsistent and can be biased by residual environmental or genetic confounding and reverse causation (García-Serna & Morales; Nevins et al.). Thus, the causal role of these exposures on neurodevelopmental traits is unclear. Furthermore, it is difficult to use RCTs to investigate the effects of intrauterine exposures as it is often unethical or impractical to modify levels experimentally, and long-term follow-up is expensive and time-consuming. A systematic-review of RCTs for DHA supplementation during pregnancy showed very little evidence for an effect on offspring neurodevelopment (Nevins et al.). For vitamin-D, only one such RCT exists, which reported that third-trimester supplementation did not associate with neurodevelopmental outcomes up to 6 years (Sass et al.). Overall, the current RCT evidence is low quality (consisting of under representative and small samples) (Nevins et al.).

### Fish, shellfish, and children's health: an assessment of benefits, risks, and sustainability [^d52b3b96]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Table 1 — nutrition and potential health benefits of childhood fish consumption: Compared with other animal protein, fish have a favorable nutrient profile and are a good source of lean protein, calcium, vitamin D, and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Childhood fish consumption has been associated with prevention of allergic disorders, and fish oil supplement intake in childhood has been associated with reduced hospitalization and number of pain crises in sickle cell disease, based on limited data. Studies evaluating childhood fish consumption and/or n-3 LCPUFA intake had mixed (ie, positive and/or negative) or null results for treatment of ADHD symptoms, treatment of depressive symptoms, treatment of allergic diseases, prevention or treatment of inflammatory bowel disease flares, cognitive development (including memory, processing speed, and IQ), hyperlipidemia, and prevention or treatment of hypertension. For some diseases, evidence suggests that fish oil supplementation may benefit children who have below average n-3 LCPUFA levels, but reported benefits often relied on daily administration of high-dose formulations that may be difficult for children to comply with, and fish oil supplements sold in the United States are not FDA approved and may not match their product labels.

### The stress-wnt-signaling axis: a hypothesis for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and therapy approaches [^02dac7ec]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The concomitant pathway to Wnt, mTOR, was also implicated in ADHD pathophysiology given that the complex Akt/mTOR-signaling is implicated in cell survival, synaptic plasticity, and formation, neurogenesis, and memory consolidation. Several mutations in participating proteins on this pathway — for example, TSC1/2, RHEB, phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN), and neurofibromin (NF1) — were described to be implicated with neurological disorders such as ASD, epilepsy, and ADHD.

Schmitz and colleaguesreported that MPH alters the mTOR pathway at different levels by decreasing the activity of Akt and mTOR substrates after short term treatment and increasing them after long-term treatment, which might regulate the aforementioned neuronal processes according to time of treatment (Fig. 1). Based on the aforementioned data, such evidence supports the notion of participation of Wnt- and Akt/mTOR-signaling in ADHD pathophysiology and reinforces the hypothesis that MPH might directly affect these two key pathways. In this sense, more studies are required to identify the molecular mechanisms involved at the cellular level in order to clarify and elucidate possible therapeutic targets.

Omega-3 fatty acids, ADHD, and Wnt/mTOR-signaling

Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n -3-PUFA) are essential fatty acids for homeostasis acquired through diet and include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are crucial for brain development.

At the molecular level, it is known that n -3-PUFA has crucial roles in metabolic processes and specific functions in neural cells such as neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and neurotransmission. In this context, DHA was able to activate Wnt-signaling in neural cells, promoting upregulation of endogenous Wnt-regulated genes including PROX1 (an adult neurogenesis marker) and increased cell survival as well as neurite outgrowth in neurons. Similarly, EPA, as well as DHA treatment, promoted differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived astrocytes from MDD patients concomitantly with increased CREB activity, also known to be regulated by the non-canonical Wnt-signaling.

### Omega-3 fatty acids in psychiatry [^4921674e]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, omega-3 fatty acids (n-3FAs) have been increasingly used and studied in the United States and worldwide for various medical and psychiatric indications. Numerous published clinical trials have examined applications of different n-3FA preparations, primarily in mood disorders but also in psychotic disorders, attention-deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and personality disorders. Focusing on clinical issues, this article reviews the impact of n-3FAs on these conditions and covers the relevant research, side effects, dosage guidelines, and drug interactions; clinicians should thus be able to better advise patients who are already taking n-3FAs or are interested in trying them.

### Omega-3 fatty acid and nutrient deficits in adverse neurodevelopment and childhood behaviors [^ad25aeb3]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Nutritional insufficiencies of omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) may have adverse effects on brain development and neurodevelopmental outcomes. A recent meta-analysis reported a small to modest effect size for the efficacy of omega-3 in youth. Several controlled trials of omega-3 HUFAs combined with micronutrients show sizable reductions in aggressive, antisocial, and violent behavior in youth and young adult prisoners. Studies of HUFAs in youth, however, remain lacking. As the evidence base for omega-3 HUFAs as potential psychiatric treatment develops, dietary adjustments to increase omega-3 and reduce omega-6 HUFA consumption are sensible recommendations based on general health considerations.

### Prenatal omega-6: omega-3 ratio and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder symptoms [^58745865]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether higher omega-6:omega-3 (n-6:n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio in cord plasma is associated with more symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at 4 and 7 years of age.

Study Design

This study was based on a population-based birth cohort in Spain. N-6 arachidonic acid and n-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations were measured in cord plasma. At 4 years old, ADHD symptoms were reported by teachers through the ADHD Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed checklist (n = 580). At 7 years old, ADHD symptoms were reported by parents through the Conners' Rating Scale-Revised (short form; n = 642). The ADHD variable was treated as continuous (score) and as dichotomous (symptom diagnostic criteria). Child and family general characteristics were prospectively collected through questionnaires. We applied pooled zero-inflated negative binomial and logistic regressions adjusted for covariates.

Results

A higher omega-6:omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio in cord plasma was associated with a higher ADHD index (incidence rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03, 1.23) at 7 years old. The association was not observed at 4 years old (incidence rate ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.92–1.18). No associations were found using ADHD symptom diagnostic criteria.

Conclusions

High prenatal omega-6:omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio preceded the appearance of subclinical ADHD symptoms during mid-childhood. Our findings suggest that maternal diet during pregnancy may modulate the risk to develop long-term ADHD symptoms in the offspring.

### Prenatal and postnatal lipid-based nutrient supplementation and cognitive, social-emotional, and motor function in preschool-aged children in Ghana: a follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^d1f8c4ad]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

The potential to benefit in social-emotional outcomes may be related to the high prevalence of reported social-emotional difficulties in this sample: about 25% of children had a total difficulties score in the abnormal range based on SDQ standard cutoff scores (≥ 17), which is high compared with other studies: 3.6% in Denmark, 7.1% in Norway, and 9.9% in the United Kingdom. To our knowledge, our study is the first to document the prevalence of behavioral problems among preschool children in Ghana, and to show that nutritional supplementation decreased the prevalence of parental report of such problems.

Two potential biological explanations for the lower behavioral problem scores in the LNS arm than in the non-LNS arm could be the essential fatty acids provided by LNS and the iron provided to children in the LNS group from 6 to 18 mo. In animal models, DHA deficiency affects brain regions involved in the regulation of emotional status, such as the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and dopamine pathways, with accompanying deficits in behavioral and learning tasks. Among boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, DHA deficiency has been associated with behavioral and learning problems. The LNS provided in our study contained 0.5 g of α-linolenic acid (18:3n−3) (ALA), the omega-3 essential fatty acid precursor to DHA, and 4.6 g of linoleic acid (18:2n−6); the omega-6:omega-3 ratio was thus within the recommended 4–10:1 omega-6:omega-3 fatty acid ratio. However, the conversion rate of ALA to DHA is typically low (9% in young women) and we found no effect of maternal LNS supplementation on maternal plasma fatty acid status at 36 weeks of gestation, although breastmilk ALA at 6 mo postpartum was higher in the LNS group than in the non-LNS group among women in this study. Thus it is unclear whether the essential fatty acids provided by LNS in early life could account for the difference in child behavior problems at 4–6 y. Iron is needed for neurodevelopmental processes, such as myelination, and for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is involved in social-emotional regulation. Iron deficiency may alter dopamine pathways, which may lead to socioemotional behavioral abnormalities including hyperactivity and inattentiveness. Iron deficiency in infancy and early childhood is associated with negative affective behavior, emotion regulation, temperament control, and social and attentional problems in later preschool and school age. This suggests that the additional iron provided to the children in the LNS group from 6 to 18 mo is a plausible biological mechanism for the observed effects at 4–6 y.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ω-3 fatty acids in Tourette's disorder [^d8cc9ceb]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinical observations have suggested therapeutic effects for ω-3 fatty acids (O3FA) in Tourette's disorder (TD), but no randomized, controlled trials have been reported. In a placebo-controlled trial, we examined the efficacy of O3FA in children and adolescents with TD.

Methods

Thirty-three children and adolescents (ages 6–18) with TD were randomly assigned, double-blind, to O3FA or placebo for 20 weeks. O3FA consisted of combined eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Placebo was olive oil. Groups were compared by using (1) intent-to-treat design, with the last-observation-carried-forward controlling for baseline measures and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder via (a) logistic regression, comparing percentage of responders on the primary Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS)-Tic and secondary (YGTSS-Global and YGTSS-Impairment) outcome measures and (b) analysis of covariance; and (2) longitudinal mixed-effects models.

Results

At end point, subjects treated with O3FA did not have significantly higher response rates or lower mean scores on the YGTSS-Tic (53% vs 38%; 15.6 ± 1.6 vs 17.1 ± 1.6, P > .1). However, significantly more subjects on O3FA were considered responders on the YGTSS-Global measure (53% vs 31%, P = 0.05) and YGTSS-Impairment measure (59% vs 25%, P < .05), and mean YGTSS-Global scores were significantly lower in the O3FA-treated group than in the placebo group (31.7 ± 2.9 vs 40.9 ± 3.0, P = 0.04). Obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were not significantly affected by O3FA. Longitudinal analysis did not yield group differences on any of the measures.

Conclusions

O3FA did not reduce tic scores, but it may be beneficial in reduction of tic-related impairment for some children and adolescents with TD. Limitations include the small sample and the possible therapeutic effects of olive oil.

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic, pharmacogenetic and biochemical studies [^be925600]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

With regards to the biochemical studies (metabolomics), our meta-analysis on basal salivary cortisol levels showed no difference between patients and controls. The presence of heterogeneity due to the paper from Baird et al. suggests the needing to replicate this finding. Contrarily our meta-analysis on PUFAs supported a significant role of DHA in adult ADHD. Irmisch et al. showed that the DHA was associated with hyperactivity in adults with ADHD, and it seems to be essential for pre- and postnatal brain development. The role of n -3PUFAs had in ADHD may be explained by their impact on the immune system through the formation of immunosuppressive prostaglandins, a system involved in ADHD. Another hypothesisis based on the evidence that PUFA deficiency in rodents results in behavioral changes such as increased motor activity and decreased learning abilities on the grounds of dysregulated monoamine neurotransmission. A differential impact of cortisol and DHA on ADHD in childhood and in adulthood can be suggested. In fact a recent meta-analysison peripheral biomarkers in ADHD childhood showed a significant role of salivary cortisol but not of serum DHA. Here in adults we demonstrated the opposite effect, supporting the idea that the concentrations of cortisol and FAs can vary in relation to age. However the course of salivary cortisol and serum FA composition during the lifespan needs to be further investigated.

### How do established developmental risk-factors for schizophrenia change the way the brain develops? [^5447caff]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

As nutrition is an easily modifiable variable the effects of supplementation on pregnancy outcomes can also be reported. Interestingly, the absence of folate supplementation during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy leads to childhood behavioural problems, such as social withdrawal, attention, and aggression at both 18 and 36 months in children. Given the well-established link between low maternal folate and schizophrenia, it will be of interest to see if such children have a higher rate of progression to schizophrenia as such studies mature. However, all nutrient supplements are not necessarily benign, with one report of Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy leading to an increased risk of schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, but only if taken during the initial phases of pregnancy.

In summary, although not universally found, it would appear that adverse exposures exert a greater effect when experienced during the earlier stages of pregnancy. Such effects may be more profound as they are perhaps affecting more fundamental neurodevelopmental events such as cell proliferation and differentiation in the brain. This is likely to alter later events in brain ontogeny such as cell migration, axon migration, target selection, and synapse maturation. Here, it is important to consider the ontogeny of neuronal development in the human brain. Neurons with the capacity to synthesise dopamine (DA) are established very early in development, at approximately five weeks post-conception –. Whilst the contribution of cortical GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons to schizophrenia is undeniable these neurons are born at later stages of pregnancy. Given the centrality of DA dysfunction to schizophrenia, it is tempting to conclude that developing DA neurons may be particularly vulnerable to these adverse exposures. Indeed below, we will show data from animal models that appear to support this proposition.

### Systematic review of national and international guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^b1cea89c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

During the last few years several clinical guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been published by national and international medical societies. To systematically review and compare recommendations of selected ADHD guidelines, we performed a systematic search in online guideline databases and PubMed in order to retrieve guideline texts. Guidelines meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed and recommendations on assessment and treatment extracted. The AGREE instrument was used to assess methodological quality. Of the 26 guidelines identified, 13 were selected for further analysis: 11 guidelines deal with ADHD in childhood and adolescence and 5 guidelines cover transitional patients and/or ADHD in adults. The methodological quality of ADHD guidelines is moderate to good. They reflect similarities and differences of healthcare systems. Diagnosis throughout the lifespan is based on a detailed clinical history. There is greater agreement on evidence-based pharmacological treatment than on psychosocial interventions, reflecting the strength of evidence.

In the 19 recruited studies, there were a total of 1203 participants with omega-3 PUFA treatment (mean age, 43.7 years; mean female proportion, 55.0%; mean omega-3 PUFA dosage, 1605.7 mg/d) and 1037 participants without omega-3 PUFA treatment (mean age, 40.6 years; mean female proportion, 55.0%).

Various scales were used in these studies to evaluate the target outcome of anxiety symptoms: the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Profile of Mood States, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, visual analog scale of anxiety, Impact of Event Scale–Revised, Conners score anxiety subscale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, test anxiety severity, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety subscale, and Child Behavior Checklist anxiety subscale. The psychiatric and physical health conditions of the recruited participants also varied widely: general population without specific clinical conditions, participants with acute myocardial infarction, borderline personality disorder, mild to severe depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe accidental injury, participants who were traumatized by disaster, participants with substance abuse disorder, women with premenstrual syndrome, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer disease, generally healthy undergraduate college students but with test anxiety, Parkinson disease, and participants with Tourette syndrome. Sixteen studies compared the effect of omega-3 PUFA treatment with that of the placebo; the other 3 studies were non–placebo controlled trials.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: update on recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^6e087246]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarise current literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomised controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

### Plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids and mental disorders in adolescence and early adulthood: cross-sectional and longitudinal associations in a general population cohort [^92c7d4d8]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Aside from their effects on inflammation, PUFAs have several other biological actions which may be of relevance to mental disorders. For example, through reorganisation of lipid rafts (clusters of membrane proteins and receptors that contribute to signal transduction), n-3 PUFAs can modulate intracellular and intercellular signalling, cytokine secretion and immune activation. n-3 PUFAs also contribute to the structural integrity and fluidity of neuronal membranes. Of the n-3 PUFAs, DHA is particularly important in the brain, where it comprises ~90% of n-3 PUFA content and 10–20% of the brain's total lipids. In addition to its neuronal membrane effects, DHA may protect against oxidative damageand promote neurite growth and synaptogenesis.

Observational studies provide evidence of decreased n-3 PUFA levels in patients with schizophrenia, depressiveand anxiety disordersrelative to controls. PUFA deficiency has also been implicated in conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorderand Alzheimer's disease. It is however unclear whether PUFA abnormalities precede the onset of mental disorders. In addition, factors such as body mass index (BMI), smoking and socio-economic status (which may be associated with both dietary quality and, independently, mental disorders) may confound observed associations –. In clinical trials, n-3 supplementation for treatment or prevention of mental disorders has produced mixed results. For example, in individuals at clinical high-risk of psychosis, n-3 supplementation initially showed beneficial effects in reducing transition to psychotic disorder. This finding was not replicated in a subsequent trial, although on further analysis several PUFA measures were associated with severity of psychopathology. Associations between PUFAs and mental disorders in adolescence and early adulthood have not been extensively studied, even though most mental disorders have their onset during this critical period of development.

We sought to address three main questions regarding temporal associations between plasma PUFA measures and three mental disorders (psychotic disorder, depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder) in adolescence and early adulthood: (1) Are PUFAs associated with these disorders cross-sectionally at age 17 years? (2) Are PUFAs associated with these disorders cross-sectionally at age 24 years? (3) Are PUFAs at age 17 years associated with these disorders longitudinally at age 24 years?
