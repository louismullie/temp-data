## Question

Fingernail infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and treating fingernail infections, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and distinguishing onychomycosis from paronychia. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and confirmatory testing. Next, I will classify severity and define treatment goals. After that, I will select therapy based on severity and patient factors, including special populations. Finally, I will address monitoring, prevention of recurrence, and when to escalate care, making sure each step is supported by guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and the differential. Fingernail infection most commonly reflects onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the nail unit, but I need to keep paronychia in mind as a periungual bacterial infection that can mimic or coexist with fungal disease, so I should not jump to conclusions without correlating the exam with testing and history of trauma or moisture exposure [^111fLAGQ] [^117Fh9Au].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before discussing treatment. I should confirm suspected onychomycosis with laboratory testing because clinical diagnosis alone is unreliable; KOH microscopy, fungal culture, histology, or PCR improve accuracy and guide therapy selection, and I need to ensure I obtain nail clippings from the distal edge and subungual debris to maximize yield [^112YLKrj] [^11321efe] [^112zghM4]. Hold on, I should also consider that repeated testing or PCR can convert initially negative results to positive in a meaningful fraction of cases, so if suspicion remains high, repeating diagnostics is reasonable before excluding onychomycosis [^115PJUj5].

> I will now examine severity classification because it drives therapy. Mild disease typically involves less than 20% of the nail plate without matrix involvement, moderate disease spans 20–60%, and severe disease exceeds 60% or includes matrix/lunula involvement; I should double-check that matrix disease signals higher risk and often pushes me toward systemic therapy rather than topical monotherapy [^113z5Tm2].

> Next, I should review treatment goals and endpoints so I counsel accurately. Complete cure requires both a normal-appearing nail and negative mycology, whereas mycological cure alone (negative KOH and culture) is necessary but insufficient for complete cure; I need to ensure patients understand that visible clearing lags mycologic eradication by months due to slow nail growth, especially in fingernails [^114WKApv].

> For mild fingernail onychomycosis, let me consider topical therapy first and verify expected outcomes. Efinaconazole 10% once daily for 48 weeks achieves higher complete cure than vehicle and is my preferred topical based on high-quality randomized data; tavaborole 5% daily is a reasonable alternative with moderate-quality evidence, and ciclopirox 8% lacquer can be used when cost or access constraints apply, though complete cure is lower and application-site reactions are common [^1127Qx9o] [^112WWQ3y] [^111Eb71K]. I should confirm that topical therapy is less effective than oral agents overall, so expectations must be calibrated and adherence emphasized [^112YLKrj].

> For moderate disease, I need to check whether combination therapy improves outcomes. Pairing oral terbinafine with a topical agent such as efinaconazole can increase complete cure rates and shorten the time to clearance compared with either alone, so I should discuss this option when more than one nail is involved or disease burden is rising toward 50% [^1147QjSw] [^113MfTo1] [^112KQ8F3].

> For severe disease or when rapid clearance is desired, I should confirm oral therapy as first-line. Terbinafine 250 mg daily for 6 weeks for fingernails yields high mycologic and clinical cure rates in trials and is guideline-endorsed; I need to ensure baseline liver assessment and symptom surveillance during therapy, and I should remind myself that clinical clearing continues for months after mycologic cure as the nail grows out [^114GBEnn] [^115r4cXZ] [^114oMws9]. If terbinafine is contraindicated or not tolerated, itraconazole pulse therapy is an evidence-based alternative, though efficacy is somewhat lower than terbinafine in head-to-head comparisons [^113UMTeu] [^115kNiXD].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has specific comorbidities. In pediatrics, topical efinaconazole or tavaborole is preferred for mild disease given favorable safety and pediatric data; systemic therapy is reserved for more extensive disease, with weight-based terbinafine or itraconazole pulse dosing and careful monitoring, noting that pediatric labeling for systemic onychomycosis treatment is limited in some regions [^113Ym9ed] [^112B36bU] [^117WMPBu] [^117PE5sZ]. In patients with liver disease or significant drug–drug interactions, I should avoid terbinafine or itraconazole and consider topical monotherapy or, in select cases, fluconazole as an alternative agent per guidelines, with baseline and periodic labs when indicated [^117BnDuN] [^114oMws9].

> I should double-check supportive measures that enhance cure. Monthly nail debridement reduces fungal burden and improves topical drug penetration, and mechanical removal of dermatophytomas is reasonable; however, debridement alone should not be used as a stand-alone treatment for onychomycosis, and I need to ensure patients maintain short, clean nails and practice strict hygiene to limit reinoculation [^116yweLU] [^111hpNKT] [^113xyju6].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. I will reassess clinically and mycologically at 12 weeks for fingernails if using oral therapy, recognizing that visible clearing may take 3–6 months; for topical therapy, I should continue for the full 48 weeks and then evaluate for complete cure, extending treatment if response is suboptimal because longer courses can improve outcomes in severe or slow-growing nails [^114GBEnn] [^111euFbn]. Hold on, I should verify that persistence on microscopy at late visits does not always equal viable infection; morphologic hyphal damage on KOH may represent nonviable organisms after effective therapy, so culture status and clinical context should guide whether to extend or stop treatment [^111vC2mj].

> I need to ensure a prevention plan because recurrence is common. Concurrent treatment of tinea pedis or other reservoirs, shoe and sock hygiene, and post-cure topical prophylaxis can reduce recurrence; weekly application of a topical antifungal for several months after cure has supportive evidence for lowering recurrence, particularly after terbinafine, and I should tailor this to risk factors such as family history and multiple nail involvement [^114tHTyi] [^111gW8XQ] [^115iwWKy].

> Let me reconsider device-based therapies briefly. Lasers and plasma devices show modest and inconsistent efficacy in small studies and should not replace guideline-based pharmacotherapy; I should present them as investigational or adjunctive options when conventional therapy fails or is contraindicated, emphasizing the need for larger, high-quality trials [^1127Qx9o] [^113CScMT].

> Finally, I should confirm when to escalate or pivot therapy. If there is no mycologic improvement by 12 weeks of oral therapy or by 24–36 weeks of optimized topical therapy, I should re-evaluate adherence, repeat diagnostics to confirm the pathogen and rule out non-dermatophyte molds or resistance, consider combination therapy, or switch to an alternative systemic agent per guidelines and culture results [^114oMws9].

---

Fingernail infections are most often due to **dermatophytes** (Trichophyton spp.) [^114UQ4Rq], with Candida and non-dermatophyte molds as less common causes [^notfound]. Diagnosis should be confirmed by **KOH prep, culture, or PCR** [^112YLKrj] to guide therapy and avoid overtreatment [^112YLKrj]. For onychomycosis, **terbinafine 250 mg daily for 6 weeks** is first-line for fingernails [^114GBEnn] [^114oMws9]; itraconazole pulse therapy is an alternative [^112CywgH] [^113M34Fw]. Topical efinaconazole or tavaborole is reserved for mild disease or when oral therapy is contraindicated [^112YLKrj]. Paronychia is managed with warm soaks, topical antibiotics, and drainage if abscess is present [^114UiTq2]; chronic cases may need topical steroids or antifungals [^117Fh9Au]. Recurrence is common, so hygiene, moisture control, and treating coexisting tinea pedis are essential [^114tHTyi] [^113xyju6].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Fingernail infections arise from diverse pathogens; **dermatophytes** — especially Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes — are the most common cause of onychomycosis [^114UQ4Rq], whereas **Candida albicans** is more frequent in chronic paronychia and immunocompromised hosts [^notfound]. Non-dermatophyte molds (e.g. Aspergillus, Fusarium) occur less often but are harder to treat [^114UQ4Rq]. Risk factors include **trauma, moisture, immunosuppression, diabetes, and poor hygiene** [^112K2PJN] [^113xyju6].

## Clinical presentation

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Onychomycosis | - Discoloration (white, yellow, brown) <br/> - Thickening <br/> - Brittleness <br/> - Subungual debris <br/> - Onycholysis <br/> - Usually painless [^112YLKrj] |
| Paronychia | - Erythema <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Tenderness of the proximal/lateral nail folds <br/> - Acute: purulent discharge <br/> - Chronic: nail dystrophy, ridging, discoloration [^114UiTq2] |

---

## Diagnostic methods

Accurate diagnosis guides therapy and prevents overtreatment; **laboratory confirmation is recommended** [^112YLKrj].

- **KOH preparation**: Rapid, inexpensive, moderate sensitivity [^notfound].
- **Fungal culture**: Gold standard, slower, identifies species [^notfound].
- **PCR**: High sensitivity/specificity, rapid, detects mixed infections [^114UQ4Rq].
- **Histopathology**: Useful when KOH/culture are inconclusive [^112YLKrj].

---

## Treatment options

### Onychomycosis

#### Systemic therapy

- **Terbinafine**: 250 mg daily for 6 weeks (fingernails); high mycologic and clinical cure rates [^114GBEnn] [^115kNiXD].
- **Itraconazole**: Pulse therapy 200 mg twice daily for 1 week, repeat after 3 weeks; effective alternative [^112CywgH] [^113M34Fw].
- **Fluconazole**: 150–450 mg weekly for 3 months; alternative when others contraindicated [^117BnDuN].

---

#### Topical therapy

- **Efinaconazole 10%**: Once daily for 48 weeks; effective for mild disease [^1127Qx9o] [^112WWQ3y].
- **Tavaborole 5%**: Once daily for 48 weeks; alternative topical [^1127Qx9o] [^111Eb71K].
- **Ciclopirox 8%**: Less effective, often used adjunctively [^112YLKrj] [^111hpNKT].

---

### Paronychia

#### Acute paronychia

For acute paronychia, **warm soaks and topical antibiotics** (mupirocin, fusidic acid) are first-line [^notfound]; **incision and drainage** are indicated if an abscess is present [^117Fh9Au].

---

#### Chronic paronychia

For chronic paronychia, **topical corticosteroids** reduce inflammation [^notfound]; **topical antifungals** are added if Candida is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **hygiene and moisture control**:

- **Keep nails short and clean** [^113xyju6].
- **Avoid trauma and moisture** [^112K2PJN].
- **Use protective gloves** for wet work [^114UiTq2].
- **Treat tinea pedis** to prevent autoinoculation [^114tHTyi].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally good** with adherence, though recurrence is common (20–50%). Relapse relates to incomplete treatment, reinfection, or immunosuppression [^115iwWKy] [^114tHTyi].

---

Fingernail infections are commonly due to dermatophytes or Candida; **confirm with KOH, culture, or PCR** [^112YLKrj] and treat according to severity and patient factors. Terbinafine is **first-line** for onychomycosis, with topical options for mild disease or when oral therapy is contraindicated; paronychia requires local care and drainage when indicated. Prevention through hygiene and moisture control is essential to reduce recurrence [^112YLKrj].

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^1127Qx9o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

Main Results

We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty-five studies specifically examined dermatophyte-caused onychomycosis. Forty-three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high-risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate-quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low-quality evidence). Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high-quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate-quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low-quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low-quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low-quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly-reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Assessing complete cure, high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate-quality evidence supports P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low-quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low-quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. We are uncertain if 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P-3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low-quality evidence). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device-based treatments, which were under-represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. Future studies of topical and device-based therapies should be blinded, with patient-centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^113UMTeu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one centre and were conducted in outpatient dermatology settings. The participants mainly had subungual fungal infection of the toenails. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years. We assessed one study as being at low risk of bias in all domains and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The most common high-risk domain was 'blinding of personnel and participants'. We found high-quality evidence that terbinafine is more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96 to 9.08, 8 studies, 1006 participants) and mycological cure (RR 4.53, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.33, 8 studies, 1006 participants). Adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated participants included gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and headache, but there was probably no significant difference in their risk between the groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47, 4 studies, 399 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was high-quality evidence that azoles were more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (RR 22.18, 95% CI 12.63 to 38.95, 9 studies, 3440 participants) and mycological cure (RR 5.86, 95% CI 3.23 to 10.62, 9 studies, 3440 participants). There were slightly more adverse events in the azole group (the most common being headache, flu-like symptoms, and nausea), but the difference was probably not significant (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 9 studies, 3441 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine and azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared, individually, to placebo (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38, 1 study, 35 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07, 1 study, 26 participants, respectively; both low-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that terbinafine was probably more effective than azoles for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, 15 studies, 2168 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88, 17 studies, 2544 participants). There was probably no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; 9 studies, 1762 participants, moderate-quality evidence) between the two groups, and there may be no difference in recurrence rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.79, 5 studies, 282 participants, low-quality evidence). Common adverse events in both groups included headache, viral infection, and nausea. Moderate-quality evidence shows that azoles and griseofulvin probably had similar efficacy for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.96, 5 studies, 222 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.51, 5 studies, 222 participants). However, the risk of adverse events was probably higher in the griseofulvin group (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.73, 2 studies, 143 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbance and allergic reaction (in griseofulvin-treated participants) along with nausea and vomiting (in azole-treated participants). Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about this comparison's impact on recurrence rate (RR 4.00, 0.26 to 61.76, 1 study, 7 participants). There is low-quality evidence that terbinafine may be more effective than griseofulvin in terms of clinical cure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72, 4 studies, 270 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, 5 studies, 465 participants), and griseofulvin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, although this was based on low-quality evidence (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.82, 2 studies, 100 participants). Common adverse events included headache and stomach problems (in griseofulvin-treated participants) as well as taste loss and nausea (in terbinafine-treated participants). No studies addressed recurrence rate for this comparison. No study addressed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-quality evidence that compared to placebo, terbinafine and azoles are effective treatments for the mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis, with moderate-quality evidence of excess harm. However, terbinafine probably leads to better cure rates than azoles with the same risk of adverse events (moderate-quality evidence). Azole and griseofulvin were shown to probably have a similar effect on cure, but more adverse events appeared to occur with the latter (moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine may improve cure and be associated with fewer adverse effects when compared to griseofulvin (low-quality evidence). Only four comparisons assessed recurrence rate: low-quality evidence found that terbinafine or azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared to placebo, but there may be no difference between them. Only a limited number of studies reported adverse events, and the severity of the events was not taken into account. Overall, the quality of the evidence varied widely from high to very low depending on the outcome and comparison. The main reasons to downgrade evidence were limitations in study design, such as unclear allocation concealment and randomisation as well as lack of blinding.

### Onychomycosis: does cure equate to treatment success? [^114WKApv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is no general agreement as to what constitutes cure or treatment success in onychomycosis. Regulatory guidelines differ in the United States and Europe, and outcomes reported in clinical trials do not consistently report secondary endpoints. <br/>

Methods

We reviewed definitions of onychomycosis cure to develop a less stringent and more practical approach to assess improvement and treatment success. <br/>

Results

Complete cure (totally clear nail and mycologic cure) remains an important regulatory standard. Mycologic cure (negative fungal culture and negative potassium hydroxide) is the only consistently reported outcome in clinical trials, however the potential for discrepancies between microscopy and culture can be problematic. We propose a more practical approach to assessing improvement in infected nails that relies on both physician and patient input in a similar fashion to other skin diseases. <br/>

Conclusions

Treatment success should be based on both physician and patient assessment of improvement in the affected toenails and negative fungal culture. <br/> <br/> J Drugs Dermatol. 2016;15(5):626–632.

### How should fungal nail infection be treated? [^112NwjGH]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Many people consulting dermatologists for nail problems have a fungal nail infection (onychomycosis). This may be asymptomatic and not merit prolonged treatment, particularly since relapse after such intervention is common. On the other hand, fungal nail infection is sometimes a treatable risk factor for more serious bacterial infections including cellulitis. Here we discuss the management of adults with fungal nail infection.

### Acral manifestations of fungal infections [^113rNupU]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Fungal infections, which are named according to the body site involved, can affect any skin area, the fingernails, or the toenails. Numerous fungal agents are responsible for both superficial and deep fungal diseases. Dermatophytes and Candida spp are the most common causative organisms on the surface of the hands, feet, and nails of patients with superficial fungal diseases; however, although deep fungal infections of the skin are less common compared with superficial fungal diseases, their incidence is increasing worldwide due to cross-border travel. Most superficial fungal diseases are diagnosed clinically, but sometimes direct microscopic examination with potassium hydroxide and fungal culture may be necessary for diagnosis, especially in patients suspected of having tinea incognito. In cases of superficial fungal infections except for onychomycosis and tinea incognito, topical treatments are usually sufficient and effective, but systemic treatments may be required in recalcitrant cases. Deep fungal diseases may resemble each other clinically; therefore, the organism must be identified with laboratory methods and should be treated for a long period. We review the most important clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of fungal diseases. This paper covers fungal problems encountered both in hospitals and in general practice.

### Fungal toenail infections [^111fLAGQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fungal infections are reported to cause 23% of foot diseases and 50% of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3% to 12% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amorolfine, butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, itraconazole, terbinafine, tioconazole, and topical ketoconazole.

### Fungal toenail infections [^116kvvbB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fungal infections are reported to cause 23% of foot diseases and 50% of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3% to 5% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amorolfine, butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, mechanical debridement, terbinafine, and tioconazole.

### Onychomycosis: rapid evidence review [^112YLKrj]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the fingernail or toenail bed leading to brittle, discolored, and thickened nails. Onychomycosis is not just a cosmetic problem. Untreated onychomycosis can cause pain, discomfort, and physical impairment, negatively impacting quality of life. Onychomycosis should be suspected in patients with discolored nails, nail plate thickening, nail separation, and foul-smelling nails. Accurate diagnosis is important before initiating treatment because therapy is lengthy and can cause adverse effects. A potassium hydroxide preparation with confirmatory fungal culture, periodic acid-Schiff stain, or polymerase chain reaction is the preferred diagnostic approach if confirmative testing is cost prohibitive or not available. Treatment decisions should be based on severity, comorbidities, and patient preference. Oral terbinafine is preferred over topical therapy because of better effectiveness and shorter treatment duration. Patients taking terbinafine in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, or tamoxifen should be monitored for drug-drug interactions. Topical therapy, including ciclopirox 8%, efinaconazole 10%, and tavaborole 5%, is less effective than oral agents but can be used to treat mild to moderate onychomycosis, with fewer adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Nail trimming and debridement used concurrently with pharmacologic therapy improve treatment response. Although photodynamic and plasma therapies are newer treatment options that have been explored for the treatment of onychomycosis, larger randomized trials are needed. Preventive measures such as avoiding walking barefoot in public places and disinfecting shoes and socks are thought to reduce the 25% relapse rate.

### Assessing treatment outcomes in toenail onychomycosis clinical trials [^115XnbG5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Several oral and topical medications are available for the treatment of onychomycosis, a widespread fungal infection of the nail. Since efficacy criteria vary greatly among clinical trials for onychomycosis treatment, it is difficult for physicians to compare outcomes and determine the appropriate therapy for a given patient. The present analysis evaluates the efficacy criteria used in intention-to-treat clinical trials of itraconazole, terbinafine, and 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, drugs approved by the US FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis. Efficacy parameters often appear to use subjective assessment tools and may not include the actual size measurement of the affected target nail as an efficacy variable. Parameters, which assess both mycologic and clinical cure, are frequently omitted from clinical trials. Not surprisingly, clinical trials with stringent efficacy criteria, which assess both mycologic and clinical response/cure without use of subjective methods, appear to have the lowest rates for both therapeutic response and complete cure. Thus, an evaluation of treatment options for onychomycosis cannot solely compare success/failure rates in clinical trials, but requires a critical appraisal of the efficacy criteria utilized in those trials.

### Monotherapy for toenail onychomycosis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1158mkjV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and nondermatophyte moulds that accounts for approximately 50% of all nail-related disease.

Objectives

This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of monotherapy and combination treatments for toenail onychomycosis using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

Quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane-compliant rules and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared using a random-effects NMA to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) of direct and indirect comparisons among oral and topical treatments (PROSPERO 2015: CRD42018086912). There were not enough eligible combination and device-based therapy trials to include in the NMA.

Results

Of 77 randomized controlled trials, 26 were included in the ORs (8136 patients). There were no significant inconsistencies between the direct and indirect evidence. Relative effects show that the odds of mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg are significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure. The ORs of adverse events occurring with oral or topical treatments were not significantly different from each other. For mycological cure, evidence was of moderate or high quality while evidence ranged from very low to high quality for adverse events.

Conclusions

Our review suggests that oral and topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis are safe and effective in producing mycological cure. What's already known about this topic? Topical treatments traditionally have lower success rates than oral treatments. Oral treatments have the advantage of shorter treatment durations, but also present challenges in cases of drug-drug interactions or immunosuppression. A network meta-analysis (NMA) gathers data from indirect evidence to gain confidence about all treatment comparisons and allows for estimation of comparative effects that have not been investigated in head-to-head randomized clinical trials (RCTs). What does this study add? This NMA of efficacy and safety includes all RCTs of oral, topical, combination and device-based treatments for toenail onychomycosis, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for NMA. The odds of achieving mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg were significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure.

### Oral medications to treat toenail fungal infection [^115kNiXD]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Which oral antifungal medication is associated with the highest clinical (ie, normal appearance of the toenail) and mycological (negative culture, microscopy, or both) cure rates vs placebo or other antifungals when used to treat fungal infections?

Bottom Line

Both terbinafine and azole-based medications were associated with higher clinical and mycological cure rates compared with placebo (high-quality evidence). Azoles were associated with lower cure rates than terbinafine when compared directly.

### Itraconazole [^116mpCm9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis of the fingernail:

Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 73 total; 37 given itraconazole capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without itraconazole, which was followed by a second 1-week course of 200 mg of itraconazole capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed.

### Toenail onychomycosis: current and future treatment options [^117TENkv]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting as much as 8% of the general population. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, complicated by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of current oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine because of its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole could be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies may be a useful adjunct to these systemic therapies, but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

### Terbinafine [^115r4cXZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial. In the first toenail trial, for subjects evaluated at least 6 months after achieving clinical cure and at least 1 year after completing therapy with terbinafine tablets, the clinical relapse rate was approximately 15%.

### A practical guide to curing onychomycosis: how to maximize cure at the patient, organism, treatment, and environmental level [^115iwWKy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that can impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates. Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors that could influence the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Furthermore, organism, treatment, and environmental factors that may hinder cure include point mutations, biofilms, affinity for non-target enzymes, and exposure to fungal reservoirs. To address patient-related factors, physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely. To combat organism-focused factors, it is recommended that disruption of biofilms is considered, and drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action are prescribed when traditional agents are not effective. Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may also be of benefit. Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.

### Itraconazole (Sporanox) [^111jb3jC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

SPORANOX®(itraconazole) Capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients:

Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary
Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and
Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy.

Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, antiinfective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

SPORANOX®Capsules are also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients:

Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and
Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium).

Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis.

(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience for more information.)

Blastomycosis

Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N = 73 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status. The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 6 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of blastomycosis compared with the natural history of untreated cases.

Histoplasmosis

Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies (N = 34 combined) in patients with normal or abnormal immune status (not including HIV-infected patients). The median dose was 200 mg/day. A response for most signs and symptoms was observed within the first 2 weeks, and all signs and symptoms cleared between 3 and 12 months. Results of these two studies demonstrated substantial evidence of the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of histoplasmosis, compared with the natural history of untreated cases.

### Therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the US [^115MkSxK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis affects around 14% of individuals in North America and Europe and is undertreated. Treatment is challenging as toenail growth can take 12&ndash;18 months, the nail plate may prevent drug penetration, and disease recurrence is common. National guidelines/consensus documents on onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment were last published more than 5 years ago and updated medical guidance is needed.

Methods

This document aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment of toenail onychomycosis following a roundtable discussion with a panel of dermatologists, podiatrists, and a microbiologist specializing in nail disease.

Results

There was a general consensus on several topics regarding onychomycosis diagnosis, confirmatory laboratory testing, and medications. Onychomycosis should be assessed clinically and confirmed with microscopy, histology, and/or culture. Terbinafine is the primary choice for oral treatment and efinaconazole 10% for topical treatment. Efinaconazole can also be considered for off-label use for maintenance to prevent recurrences. For optimal outcomes, patients should be counseled regarding treatment expectations as well as follow-up care and maintenance post-treatment.

Conclusions

This article provides important updates to previous guidelines/consensus documents to assist dermatologists and podiatrists in the diagnosis and treatment of toenail onychomycosis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(10):1076–1084. doi:10.36849/JDD.6291.

### Onychomycosis to fungal superinfection: prevention strategies and considerations [^114tHTyi]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is the most common fungal skin infection, and it is frequently seen in the setting of other concomitant fungal infections, the most common being tinea pedis. Infected nails become a reservoir of fungal organisms that may infect the skin, and vice versa. Early, effective treatment of the nails is necessary for preventing not only permanent structural damage but also the spread and superinfection of the surrounding skin and soft tissue. Moreover, treatment of the skin is important for preventing re-infection of the nails.

### Acute and chronic paronychia of the hand [^117Fh9Au]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic infections and inflammation adjacent to the fingernail, or paronychia, are common. Paronychia typically develops following a breakdown in the barrier between the nail plate and the adjacent nail fold and is often caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens; however, noninfectious etiologies, such as chemical irritants, excessive moisture, systemic conditions, and medications, can cause nail changes. Abscesses associated with acute infections may spontaneously decompress or may require drainage and local wound care along with a short course of appropriate antibiotics. Chronic infections have a multifactorial etiology and can lead to nail changes, including thickening, ridging, and discoloration. Large, prospective studies are needed to identify the best treatment regimen for acute and chronic paronychia.

### Onychomycosis in athletes [^112K2PJN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disorder that is difficult to cure. Prevalence is lower in children (0.7%), but athletes are 2.5-fold more likely to develop the disease, with infections of the toenails seven times more prevalent than those of the fingernails. This is a concern for athletes as it can interfere with their performance. The risk of developing onychomycosis is increased by the warm environment of many sports activities; the use of occlusive footwear; the warm, moist environment associated with socks and sweating; shared, close quarters among athletes; and trauma to the foot and toenail. Once infected, onychomycosis treatment requires a long duration of treatment with strict compliance, a potential problem for younger patients. Treatment carries the risk of significant side effects, and recurrence rates remain high. Avoiding infection can be a potent first line of defense and may circumvent the need for treatment. Preventive recommendations such as keeping toenails short and proper washing of laundry, to name a few, can be effective and are discussed here. Technological improvements such as synthetic, moisture-wicking socks and well-ventilated, mesh shoes have also been shown to reduce moisture and injury. Education about preventing fungal spread and improving hygiene in the locker room, gym, and pool are of critical importance. This overview of onychomycosis focuses primarily on the preventive measures and innovative changes in athletic gear. It also provides a compact step-by-step guide to prevention intended to be useful for both the general public and the professional. It can be reproduced to use as a handout for athletes, trainers, and coaches.

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in 3 US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial. In the first toenail trial, for subjects evaluated at least 6 months after achieving clinical cure and at least 1 year after completing therapy with terbinafine tablets, the clinical relapse rate was approximately 15%.

### Topical therapy for toenail onychomycosis: an evidence-based review [^115uG4C3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Managing toenail onychomycosis with topical treatments is challenging. It is difficult for topical medication to penetrate the nail plate, and this is reflected in lower cure rates with topical treatment than with oral treatment. However, oral medications may not be suitable for some patients, because of drug interactions; therefore, topical treatments are critical in managing the disease in certain patient populations.

Objective

This paper reviews the quality and content of the scientific literature on topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

PubMed, Ovid (Medline and Embase), Scopus, Cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched for original clinical reports of topical monotherapy for microscopy and/or culture-confirmed toenail onychomycosis in adults. Studies were evaluated using an onychomycosis study quality scale, which was based on the CONSORT guidelines.

Results

Twenty-five publications (28 studies) were identified and met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies scored high ratings on the quality scale. These were randomized controlled trials or randomized comparative trials. Low-quality studies were nonrandomized, open studies that prevented statistical analysis. Most studies reported clinical and mycological cure. The most variation was observed with reporting outcomes of clinical improvement. Amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole produced clinical and mycological cure in patients with mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis (< 50–65% nail involvement), with efinaconazole showing the highest rates. Treatments were generally applied daily for 24–48 weeks, with longer treatment and follow-up showing better outcomes.

Conclusion

Topical treatment with amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, or efinaconazole is appropriate for cases of mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis due to dermatophyte or mixed dermatophyte/Candida infection.

### The future of onychomycosis therapy may involve a combination of approaches [^1146vjAy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most commonly caused by the anthropophilic dermatophyte fungi. It is generally accepted that this disease is increasing in prevalence despite the introduction of new and efficacious antifungal drugs. Several studies have documented health-related quality-of-life issues associated with onychomycosis and it is clear that patient treatment is both necessary and desirable. The aetiology and pathogenesis of onychomycosis is coming under increasing scrutiny and work in this field has grown substantially in recent years. This is reflected by the increased assurance with which clinicians can now prescribe treatment and be confident of improvement in a majority of their patients. However, a significant proportion of patients, perhaps as many as 25–40% of those encountered in clinical practice, are classified as treatment failures. Clinical indicators for poor prognosis include the development of residual foci of subungual fungal growth, onycholysis and severe disease. These observations have led to a resurgence of interest in combination treatments for use in patients at risk of failure/relapse. Several types of combination can be considered, including the use of oral or topical drugs and the concomitant use of surgical techniques, all of which have a place in the treatment of onychomycosis.

Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial. In the first toenail trial, for subjects evaluated at least 6 months after achieving clinical cure and at least 1 year after completing therapy with terbinafine tablets, the clinical relapse rate was approximately 15%.

### Clinical insights about onychomycosis and its treatment: a consensus [^113z5Tm2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, experience and knowledge have been gained using effective topical treatment for onychomycosis, a difficult-to-treat infection.

Methods

This project aims to help understand and improve patient-focused quality of care for fungal nail infections. A panel of dermatologists who treat onychomycosis convened on several occasions to review and discuss recent learnings in the treatment of onychomycosis. The panel developed and conducted a survey on diagnosis, treatment and prevention, discussed the results, and provided recommendations.

Results

The survey was sent out digitally to the Canadian Dermatology community. Ninety-two dermatologists completed the questionnaires, which were included in the analysis. The survey respondents and panel members agreed that the diagnosis of toe onychomycosis should be confirmed with a positive microscopic examination for fungus or a positive mycological culture when oral therapy and/or topical treatment is prescribed, except when it is not clinically feasible, in which case topical therapy could be started based on clinical presentation. The panel and survey respondents also agreed that treatment is to be based on percentage of nail involvement: less than 20% = topical efinaconazole; 20%-60% = topical efinaconazole ± oral terbinafine (for greater than 3 nails); greater than 60% = oral terbinafine ± topical therapy.

Conclusions

The current treatment paradigm for onychomycosis may have shifted from mainly oral antifungals to topical treatment, improving patient-focused quality of care. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(3):253–262.

### A review of lasers and light for the treatment of onychomycosis [^113CScMT]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Onychomycosis is a common fungal infection that affects many individuals. Systemic therapies are effective, but are limited by their side effects and potential for hepatotoxicity. Topical therapies have less serious side effects, yet provide only limited efficacy due to their inability to penetrate the nail plate. These limitations have led to the investigation of laser and light-based modalities as alternative treatment options for onychomycosis. This article will provide an overview and critical assessment of the field of laser and other energy-based treatments for onychomycosis.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

A literature search was conducted on laser and light-based treatments for onychomycosis.

Results

Early data are promising, however, many of these studies are small or poorly designed.

Conclusion

Further evaluation and larger studies are needed to determine the optimal light source, pulse duration, and treatment schedule for long-term success.

### Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot [^111khEPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infections of the feet normally occur in the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). The skin between the toes is a frequent site of infection which can cause pain and itchiness. Fungal infections of the nail (onychomycosis) can affect the entire nail plate.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical treatments in successfully treating (rate of treatment failure) fungal infections of the skin of the feet and toenails and in preventing recurrence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE and EMBASE (from inception to January 2005). We screened the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB - Health and Healthstar, CINAHL DARE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit (March 2005). Bibliographies were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using participants who had mycologically diagnosed fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently summarised the included trials and appraised their quality of reporting using a structured data extraction tool.

Main Results

Of the 144 identified papers, 67 trials met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials yielded the following pooled risk ratios (RR) of treatment failure for skin infections: allylamines RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.44); azoles RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.45); ciclopiroxolamine RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.66); tolnaftate RR 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.44); butenafine RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.45); undecanoates RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.12–0.70). Meta-analysis of 11 trials comparing allylamines and azoles showed a risk ratio of treatment failure RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94) in favour of allylamines. Evidence for the management of topical treatments for infections of the toenails is sparser. There is some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year). The 6 trials of nail infections provided evidence that topical ciclopiroxolamine has poor cure rates and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective but more research is required.

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo-controlled trials of allylamines and azoles for athlete's foot consistently produce much higher percentages of cure than placebo. Allylamines cure slightly more infections than azoles and are now available OTC. Further research into the effectiveness of antifungal agents for nail infections is required.

The fingertip is the interface between humans and the world, including the various thorns, dirty needles, and other hazards to be found there. It is unsurprising that this is the site where hand infections most frequently occur. Although commonly encountered by hand surgeons and other physicians, fingertip infections have several mimics, and diagnosis and management is not always straightforward. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to success. As with all infections, they are more common and are more aggressive in immunosuppressed patients. This article reviews fingertip anatomy, common and uncommon fingertip infections and their mimics, and recommendations for management.

### Pilot study to evaluate a plasma device for the treatment of onychomycosis [^116P8zSy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, and is the most common of the nail disorders. Current therapies for onychomycosis have less than ideal efficacy and have the potential for adverse effects. As previous studies have shown that nonthermal plasma inhibits the in vitro growth of Trichophyton rubrum, we conducted a pilot study on 19 participants with toenail onychomycosis. The primary endpoint was safety of the device, and secondary outcome measures were clinical efficacy and mycological cure. Patient satisfaction was measured using questionnaires at the completion of the study. All but one patient met the primary endpoint of safety and there were no long-term sequelae. The overall clinical cure was 53.8% and the mycological cure was 15.4%. The majority of patients were satisfied with the treatment. Our conclusions are that nonthermal plasma is a safe treatment and may have a beneficial effect on toenail onychomycosis.

### Improved efficacy in onychomycosis therapy [^113MfTo1]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The success rate of onychomycosis treatment is limited by several factors, including the access of the therapeutic agent to the fungal mass, the presence of conidia, and the susceptibility of the different infectious agents to the antifungals. Different strategies used to improve efficacy of the currently available antifungal treatments, their rationale, and the published evidence of their beneficial effects are reviewed. An improved efficacy was demonstrated for some of these strategies, such as combined oral and topical antifungal therapies, whereas most of them lack clear and direct evidence of an increase in therapeutic success.

### Cumulative meta-analysis of systemic antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis [^1179TFEz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common nail disease that is often chronic, difficult to eradicate, and has a tendency to recur. The most common oral therapies for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis include terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole.

Objectives

A cumulative meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for antimycotic agents was performed to determine whether the pooled estimate of the cure rates has remained consistent over the years. Furthermore, for each agent we compared the overall meta-analytical average of both mycological and clinical response rates of RCTs vs. open studies.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966 to November 2002) for relevant studies evaluating the efficacy of the oral antifungal agents terbinafine, itraconazole (pulse or continuous), fluconazole and griseofulvin for treating dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Studies included in this meta-analysis required a standard accepted dosage regimen, treatment duration and follow-up period. To determine the cumulative meta-analytical average, studies were sequentially pooled by adding one study at a time according to the date of publication (i.e. earliest to the most recent).

Results

There were 36 studies included in the analyses. For RCTs the change in efficacy of mycological cure rates from the first trial to the overall cumulative meta-average for each drug comparator is as follows (with 95% confidence interval): terbinafine, 78 ± 6% (n = 2 studies, 79 patients) to 76 ± 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) (P = 0.68); itraconazole pulse, 75 ± 10% (n = 1 study, 20 patients) to 63 ± 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) (P = 0.25); itraconazole continuous, 63 ± 5% (n = 1 study, 84 patients) to 59 ± 5% (n = 7 studies, 1131 patients) (P = 0.47); fluconazole, 53 ± 6% (n = 1 study, 72 patients) to 48 ± 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) (P = 0.50); and griseofulvin, 55 ± 8% (n = 2 studies, 109 patients) to 60 ± 6% (n = 3 studies, 167 patients) (P = 0.41). The cumulative meta-analytical average of mycological cure rates when comparing RCTs vs. open studies was: terbinafine, 76 ± 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) vs. 83 ± 12% (n = 2 studies, 391 patients) (P = 0.0028); itraconazole pulse, 63 ± 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) vs. 84 ± 9% (n = 3 studies, 194 patients) (P = 0.0001); and fluconazole, 48 ± 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) vs. 79 ± 3% (n = 3 studies, 208 patients) (P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

The cumulative meta-analysis of cure rates for RCTs suggests that over time, as new RCTs have been conducted, the efficacy rates have remained consistent. The efficacy rates of open studies are substantially higher compared with RCTs and may therefore overestimate cure rates.

### Effectiveness of nail bed repair in children with or without replacing the fingernail: NINJA multicentre randomized clinical trial [^114pZr2K]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgery for nail bed injuries in children is common. One of the key surgical decisions is whether to replace the nail plate following nail bed repair. The aim of this RCT was to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of nail bed repair with fingernail replacement/substitution compared with repair without fingernail replacement.

Methods

A two-arm 1: 1 parallel-group open multicentre superiority RCT was performed across 20 secondary-care hospitals in the UK. The co-primary outcomes were surgical-site infection at around 7 days after surgery and cosmetic appearance summary score at a minimum of 4 months.

Results

Some 451 children presenting with a suspected nail bed injury were recruited between July 2018 and July 2019; 224 were allocated to the nail-discarded arm, and 227 to the nail-replaced arm. There was no difference in the number of surgical-site infections at around 7 days between the two interventions or in cosmetic appearance. The mean total healthcare cost over the 4 months after surgery was €84 (95 per cent c.i. 34 to 140) lower for the nail-discarded arm than the nail-replaced arm (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

After nail bed repair, discarding the fingernail was associated with similar rates of infection and cosmesis ratings as replacement of the finger nail, but was cost saving. Registration number: ISRCTN44551796 (http://www.controlled-trials.com).

### Systematic review of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children [^112B36bU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fungal infection of the nails accounts for 15%–40% of all nail disease and is one of the most common nail diseases in adults. The prevalence of onychomycosis increases with age and is reported to be infrequent in children. It has nevertheless been suggested that the incidence of onychomycosis in children may have increased over the last three decades. However, most studies are retrospective and based on information from medical records or laboratory data.

Pediatric onychomycosis is important to diagnose and treat for several reasons. Early detection and treatment of onychomycosis is crucial to prevent disease progression. In addition, early treatment of onychomycosis can result in higher cure rates. Mild onychomycosis can be treated topically with good clearance in children. Few antifungal therapies are licensed to onychomycosis treatment in children. Topical therapy is used as monotherapy for milder cases and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from the age of ≥ 12 years (ciclopirox), and ≥ 6 years (efinaconazole, tavaborole). Treatment with topical therapy is reported to be more effective in children than in adults, with low risk of side effects and low systemic exposure. Systemic treatment is added when the disease is more severe but has a larger risk of drug interaction and adverse events. No systemic antifungal therapy is licensed for treatment of onychomycosis in children.

The aim of this systematic review is to explore the worldwide prevalence of onychomycosis in children.

### Onychomycosis. treatment, quality of life, and economic issues [^113Hpz9N]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a public health concern because of its high worldwide incidence and prevalence, and its potential for spread of fungal elements to others, as well as complications such as cellulitis, bacterial infection, pain, and extensive dermatophytic infections. The incidence of onychomycosis has been increasing, particularly in individuals over 60 years of age, patients with HIV infection, and patients with diabetes mellitus. Onychomycosis may impact upon physical, functional, psychosocial, and emotional aspects of life. Difficulty walking, wearing shoes, and embarrassment are common complaints. Quantification of such quality-of-life changes are significant to clinical practice in that many factors can affect overall patient health. In light of the potential clinical implications on physical and mental health, onychomycosis should be considered a medical condition that deserves rigorous clinical management. Onychomycosis can be treated effectively and with comparative safety with the new generation of oral antifungal agents (itraconazole, fluconazole and terbinafine). Significantly improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles permit markedly reduced duration of administration, individual drug exposure, and ultimately enhanced patient compliance and satisfaction with therapy. In addition, a number of pharmacoeconomic studies have documented the cost effectiveness of these newer agents compared with both traditional pharmacologic treatment and topical therapies. The currency figures quoted are 1997 values. With regard to continuous oral antifungal regimens, terbinafine therapy has been found to be most cost effective in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis, with a drug acquisition cost of $US522.50. However, improved safety, tolerability, efficacy and cost effectiveness have been documented with itraconazole intermittent, pulse regimens. With itraconazole pulse therapy, the drug acquisition cost decreases to $US488.90. Additionally, the total cost of medical management is less for itraconazole therapy compared with that of terbinafine ($US261.00 vs $US306.00). Because sensitivity analyses for itraconazole and terbinafine have been found to be somewhat comparable in terms of mycological cure, clinical response, and relapse rates, other variables such as safety and efficacy profiles, and patient attitudes and expectations toward therapy need to be considered when formulating an onychomycosis pharmacologic treatment plan. The drug aquisition cost of fluconazole given as a 300 mg dose once weekly for 6 months is $US562.76 and given as a 150 mg dose once weekly (for 6 months) $US281.38.

### Griseofulvin — microsize) — griseofulviin — microsize [^112dJBC3]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium — depending on rate of growth — fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis since in some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Adults: A daily dose of 500 mg will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis.

For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a daily dose of 1 gram is recommended.

Children: Approximately 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children. On this basis the following dosage schedule for children is suggested:

Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of tinea pedis, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as dermatophytes. Griseofulvin will not eradicate these associated bacterial or yeast infections.

ADULTS: 0.5 g daily (125 mg q.i.d., 250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg/day). Patients with less severe or 300 extensive infections may require less, whereas those with widespread lesions may require a starting dose of 0.75 g to 1 g/day. This may be reduced gradually to 0.5 g or less after a response has been noted. In all cases, the dosage should be individualized.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (older than 2 years): A dosage of 10 mg/kg daily is usually adequate (pediatric patients from 30 to 50 lb, 125 mg to 250 mg daily; pediatric patients over 50 lb, 250 mg to 500 mg daily, in divided doses). Dosage should be individualized, as with adults. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

Safety is not established at higher doses than recommended.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^111AwtXi]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Trials Data

The results of use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), in treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the US. In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20–65% involvement of the target great toenail plate. Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint "complete cure" (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint "almost clear" (≤ 10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study. These results are presented below.

The summary of reported patient outcomes for the ITT population at 12 weeks following the end of treatment are presented below. Note that post-treatment efficacy assessments were scheduled only for patients who achieved a complete cure.

### Clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of a new topical treatment for onychomycosis [^112rKjrb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of an investigational topical product for the treatment of onychomycosis (nail fungus).

Method

A prospective, multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled clinical investigation was done with adult subjects that met the inclusion criteria, primarily culture-confirmed dermatophyte infection of at least one great toe. Subjects self-treated in a weekly regimen of topical application for six months, with clinical assessment at one, three, and six months. Primary efficacy endpoint was clearance of fungal nail infection after six months of weekly treatment. Primary safety endpoint was freedom from product-related adverse events for the duration of the treatment term.

Results

Fifty males and 13 females, ages 24 to 65, infected with Trichophyton (n = 62) or Epidermophyton (n = 1) were enrolled; 53 completed six months of assessment. Sixty percent showed improvement in clinical parameters (nail color, nail plate involvement, onycholysis, thickness, and hyperkeratosis) at six months. Cumulative rates of dermatophyte-negative culture results (test of cure) were 28, 36, and 62 percent of subjects after one, three, and six months of treatment, respectively. Three minor adverse events were device-related, with no unanticipated or serious adverse events.

Limitations

This study was single-arm and self-controlled; 53 of 63 enrolled subjects completed the study.

Conclusion

This study describes a new topical medical device with safety and efficacy profiles that compare favorably to results reported for topically applied onychomycosis drug treatments.

### A rationale for systemic treatment in onychomycosis with negative results on fungal examination [^115PJUj5]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infection of the nail affects millions of people worldwide, and has an estimated prevalence of about 10% of the general population. Laboratory confirmation of fungal infection is currently accepted as a requirement before initiation of antifungal treatment in clinical practice.

Aim

To examine the rationale for systemic treatment in cases of clinical onychomycosis with negative results on fungal examination (potassium hydroxide test and fungal culture).

Methods

In total, 147 patients with suspected clinical toenail onychomycosis but with negative results on fungal examination underwent up to three consecutive fungal examinations of the affected nails. Patients who were negative after these examinations underwent a fourth set of investigations, including PCR.

Results

Of the 147 cases initially thought to be negative, 138 (94%) were rated as positive after up to four consecutive sets of laboratory mycological investigations including PCR. Trichophyton rubrum was by far the commonest dermatophyte cultured from all samples.

Conclusions

In the majority of cases of initially negative examinations, consecutive laboratory fungal tests will eventually produce positive results. These findings suggest that systemic antifungal treatment should be started in patients with suspected fungal infections, even if they have negative laboratory fungal examinations.

### Comparison of the efficacy of long-pulsed Nd: YAG laser intervention for treatment of onychomycosis of toenails or fingernails [^117N5qMS]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of laser intervention in the treatment of onychomycosis. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of long-pulsed Nd:YAG 1064 nm laser for treatment of toenails onychomycosis with fingernails onychomycosis.

Methods

One hundred and twelve affected fingernails or toenails in 37 patients with onychomycosis were randomized into Group 1 (22 patients with 50 affected fingernails) and Group 2 (15 patients with 62 affected toenails). These patients were further classified into three subgroups (Grade II, III, and IV) according to Scoring Clinical Index of Onychomycosis. All the affected nails were treated with long-pulse Nd:YAG 1064 nm laser intervention, once weekly, for continuous weeks, and were followed up for 24 weeks.

Results

The response rates at weeks 8, 16, and 24 were 0, 0 and 52%, respectively, for Group 1, and 10, 32 and 71% for Group 2. The inter-group difference in efficacy was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Even in the same subgroup, the response rate of Group 2 was higher than that of Group 1.

Conclusions

The efficacy of long-pulsed Nd:YAG 1064 nm laser intervention against affected toenails is superior to that against fingernails. It is also effective for treatment of onychomycosis with different severity.

### Antifungal therapy for onychomycosis in children [^111W1gFR]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic infection of the nail unit, and its prevalence increases with age. Treatment options for children are similar to those for adults and include both oral and topical therapies. Oral agents, such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole have been reported to have good efficacy and a low rate of side effects in children. Topical therapies, such as amorolfine and ciclopirox, can also be used as monotherapy or combined with oral agents to treat onychomycosis. Due to their thinner, faster-growing nails, children are more likely to respond to topical monotherapy than adults. There is currently insufficient data comparing emerging medical devices, such as laser therapy, with standard therapeutic options to recommend their use in children.

### Griseofulvin (griseofulvin MICROSIZE) [^116GFidM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of tinea pedis, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as dermatophytes. Griseofulvin tablets, USP will not eradicate these associated bacterial or yeast infections.

ADULTS: 0.5 g daily (125 mg q.i.d., 250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg/day). Patients with less severe or 300 extensive infections may require less, whereas those with widespread lesions may require a starting dose of 0.75 g to 1 g/day. This may be reduced gradually to 0.5 g or less after a response has been noted. In all cases, the dosage should be individualized.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (older than 2 years): A dosage of 10 mg/kg daily is usually adequate (pediatric patients from 30 to 50 lb, 125 mg to 250 mg daily; pediatric patients over 50 lb, 250 mg to 500 mg daily, in divided doses).

### A one health roadmap towards understanding and mitigating emerging fungal antimicrobial resistance: fAMR [^1121B2ru]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

However, knowledge of the resistance status of crop pathogens is often incomplete or slow to emerge. Monitoring and surveillance programmes are largely funded by the agrochemical industry with more limited research in the public domain. Minor pathogens of smaller crops receive little attention. National surveys on the health status of crops are also incomplete, and for example those conducted in the UK by the Defra (the UK Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs) and by Scottish Government are confined to major combinable crops and only record the diseases found, not their resistance status.

PATH-SAFE is developing approaches to measure antimicrobials in biosolids and surface waters. ESPAUR (the English Surveillance Program for Antimicrobial Usage and Resistance) produces top level data for antifungals, although the UKHSA "Fingertips" resource for antibiotic use and resistance does not currently extend to antifungals. Even less is known about antifungal usage across the built environment and in companion animals, and the recent detection of C. auris in both feral and companion-dogs in the United States speaks to the risk of spillover into other vertebrates that may act as vectors, reservoirs or amplifiers of fAMR. Currently, international focus is patchy, but there are signs of increasing transnational integration with international funding (JPIAMR) and WHO (GLASS) to better understand reservoirs and vectors of fAMR.

For clinical antifungal stewardship, an evidence base is lacking compared to antibacterials. Optimal stewardship strategies are complex due to the heterogeneity of patient cohorts, fungal pathogens, and personalised diagnostic strategies and treatments. Key principles for antifungal stewardship include optimisation of prescribing through better diagnostics, appropriate antifungal susceptibility testing to ensure correct treatment regimens are given, antifungal therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate de-escalation of therapies. Stewardship is delivered through highly specialised multidisciplinary teams and was reinforced in the UK by the National Health Service (NHS) national Antifungal Stewardship Implementation Pack in 2019. However, it is more problematic to assess the scale of over-the-counter sales of fungicides, such as topical antifungals aimed at controlling skin/nail or genital fungal infections.

Establishing the most cost-effective chemical and non-chemical interventions to mitigate the emergence of antifungal resistance requires agricultural and health economic modelling. Establishing feasibility of implementation in different contexts requires social research and pragmatic piloting with affordable monitoring and evaluation; this is especially relevant for resource poor settings where the evidence-base for stewardship is low to non-existent.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^111euFbn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the new findings of our study is the evaluation of the complete cure rate in patients with long‐term treatment for more than 48 weeks. Severe cases have been reported to require a longer treatment duration, but the evaluation of EFCZ use for more than 48 weeks had been unclear. 15, 16 Considering that the treatment success rate increased until week 72 after starting EFCZ application, the clinical significance of continuing the application beyond 1 year was indicated. The complete cure rates at weeks 48 and 52 in the Japanese group in the multinational phase III study were 20.1% and 28.8%, respectively, which were almost the same as our results of 19.6% and 26.5% at weeks 48 and 60, respectively. Moreover, the rate in our study increased to 31.1% at week 72, indicating the benefit of continuing EFCZ application for more than 1 year. In fact, 121 subjects (55.3%), more than half of the enrolled subjects, continued EFCZ application to week 72, of whom 10 achieved complete cure. Generally, the factors associated with complete cure included not only fungal infection in the nail but also the growth rate of the nail. Considering that the duration until toenails are completely replaced with new growth is mostly 1 year or even longer for elderly or thickened nails, it is not an easy goal to achieve. Nevertheless, we observed many patients who attained cure after using EFCZ for over 1 year, which suggests that more patients would achieve complete cure with longer therapy. Improvement of the mycological cure rate was observed earlier than that of the treatment success rate, reaching 50.7% at week 36 and even 55.3% at week 72. In the patient population with an affected area of more than 50%, mycological cure was obtained in 47.5% of the subjects at week 72, which is expected for high antifungal activity, even in severe cases. Mycological cure in severe cases was newly achieved even at week 72, suggesting the possible efficacy by further long‐term treatment. However, outcomes from our study are limited and thus future reports are expected.

### Longitudinal melanonychias [^112H7x77]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Melanonychia is black or brown pigmentation that appears in the fingernails and toenails. The pigment can come from exogenous sources, such as bacteria or fungal infection, tar, or blood. Endogenous causes include aberrant melanin production in the nail bed, resulting in a longitudinal presentation. Melanonychia can indicate the presence of cancerous growths, as well as infection. Diagnostic measures, including dermatoscopy, biopsy, and histopathology, can determine the cause and direct the course of treatment. Malignant lesions should be excised, and underlying infections should be addressed with antibiotics or antifungals. Benign lesions and hyperpigmentation may benefit from a wait-and-see approach.

### Long-term efficacy of antifungals in toenail onychomycosis: a critical review [^115GiqJA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Modern antifungal drugs achieve high mycological and clinical cure rates in onychomycosis of the toes, but little is known about the long-term evolution of the treated patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to analyse the therapeutic results recorded more than 1 year after initiation of therapy.

Methods

We used two endpoints for the analysis: EP1 (the number of patients with negative mycology after follow-up, divided by the number of patients included at day 0, including all patients lost to follow-up), and EP2 (the number of patients with negative mycology after follow-up divided by the number of patients with negative mycology at week 48). Clinical cure rate (EPclin) was the number of patients clinically cured or with minimal residual lesions divided by the number of patients included at day 0.

Results

From a Medline search we identified 17 studies providing results beyond 48 weeks. Ketoconazole 200 mg d(-1) up to 1 year resulted in EP1 of 11% at 18 months, and EP2 of 43%. Griseofulvin 1 g d(-1) for 1 year allowed an EP1 of 43% at 18 months, and EP2 of 71%. The mean EP1 after fluconazole once weekly up to 1 year was 49% at 18 months, and EP2 was 91%. With itraconazole 200 mg d(-1) or 400 mg d(-1) for 1 week each month for 3–4 months, EP1 was 37% at 18 months, and 53% at 2 years; EP2 was 76% at 4 years. Terbinafine 250 mg d(-1) for 12–16 weeks achieved an EP1 of 62% at 18 months, 72% at 2 years, and 60% at 4 years; EP2 was 80% at 18 months, 81% at 2 years, and 71% at 4 years. In the only study planned to compare the long-term efficacy of terbinafine and itraconazole, EP1 at 18 months was significantly higher with continuous terbinafine than with intermittent itraconazole (66% vs. 37%, P < 0.001). The clinical cure rates were 21% at 60 weeks and 37% at 72 weeks with fluconazole. EPclin was 27% at 18 months and 35% at 2 years with itraconazole. EPclin was 48% at 18 months, 69% at 2 years and 50% at 4 years with terbinafine.

Conclusions

Considering the stringency of the criteria we used, this critical review suggests that the long-term efficacy achieved with terbinafine is superior to that obtained with griseofulvin, ketoconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole.

### The diagnosis of onychomycosis [^112zghM4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The prevalence of onychomycosis is increasing and the primary pathogens may be dermatophytes, nondermatophyte molds, or Candida spp. It may not be satisfactory to treat onychomycosis on the basis of clinical diagnosis alone. Laboratory diagnosis is an important component of the proper management of this fungal infection. Laboratory diagnostic methods for detecting onychomycosis include light microscopy and culture, or histopathology. Management of onychomycosis includes palliation achieved through mechanical debridement of the nail and topical or oral antifungal therapy.

### Onychomycosis therapy: past, present, future [^116NHpM1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods to treat onychomycosis are varied, using therapies that can be categorized as topical, oral or device-related. Since their development, oral therapies have represented the gold standard for treatment over other methods. However, efficacy with oral therapies remains limited, and safety may be an issue, leaving many patients requiring alternative treatments. With research advances, topical therapies as alternatives for onychomycosis are being investigated with greater interest as new technologies are overcoming previous limitations of topical treatments, such as lack of nail penetration. New device-related topical therapy methods are particularly noteworthy, as they may allow for shorter, more convenient treatments for patients, reducing issues with topical compliance, and, in cases of non-drug light-based therapies, they will avoid potential for drug reactions. Research in these fields is preliminary, and the impact these methods may have on the future of onychomycosis remains to be seen.

### Terbinafine in fungal infections of the nails: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114mrBdS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, there has been a general resistance to treating onychomycosis on the basis that such treatments were protracted and of uncertain outcome. However, modern treatments act more promptly and reliably.

Objectives

To carry out a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of terbinafine in comparison with placebo, itraconazole and griseofulvin.

Methods

The analysis used data from published trials, supplemented where necessary by reference to the original trial reports.

Results

Three trials were included in which terbinafine was compared with placebo. From four trials comparing terbinafine with itraconazole, a statistically significant advantage in favour of terbinafine was observed for negative culture and microscopy at the end of the trials. Furthermore, both patients and physicians reported terbinafine to be better tolerated than itraconazole. From two trials comparing terbinafine with griseofulvin, a significantly higher rate of negative microscopy and culture was observed with terbinafine.

Conclusions

A significant advantage in favour of treatment with terbinafine was observed.

### Onychomycosis in the US pediatric population-an Emphasis on fusarium onychomycosis [^114UQ4Rq]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Onychomycosis refers to a superficial fungal infection of the nail unit and represents the majority of onychopathies worldwide. With an estimated global prevalence of 4% across all ages, the management of this chronic condition is associated with unique challenges such as misdiagnosis due to lack of confirmatory testing, emergence of antifungal resistance, and the high risk of recurrence. Advances in diagnosis have become possible with the advent of molecular platforms such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which significantly improve sensitivity and turnaround time compared to fungal culture. The combination of PCR with histopathologic examination is an effective diagnosis method as it offers rapid pathogen identification with a clear demonstration of nail keratin invasion.

Onychomycosis is predominantly caused by dermatophytes (Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex). An infection by nondermatophyte molds (NDMs), including Aspergillus, Fusarium, Scopulariopsis, Neoscytalidium, and Acremonium, can become difficult to treat and is thought to be a contributing factor to the less‐than‐optimal cure rates and high risks of disease recurrence. In children, treatment preferences for both dermatophyte and NDM onychomycosis are generally topical agents over oral agents owing to potential safety concerns. According to a recent epidemiological survey by Landreau et al. Fusarium has emerged as the dominant NDM pathogen found in infected toenail and fingernail samples as opposed to skin and scalp samples; however, it is unclear if children, in particular, are similarly affected by this pathogen shift.

Despite the scarcity of reports, onychomycosis caused by the genus Fusarium presents a concern in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. To update our current understanding of the pathogen spectrum in the pediatric onychomycosis population, we conducted an analysis of specimens submitted to a molecular diagnostic laboratory — utilizing combined PCR and histopathologic diagnosis — over a 9‐year period across the United States.

We reviewed data from seven international onychomycosis trials that enrolled subjects with positive KOH and dermatophyte-positive culture at screening followed by 48 weeks of treatment. Further, we examined 94 KOH-positive/culture-negative week 52 follow-up samples for morphological hyphal damage.

Results

From 3054 samples collected at week 52 follow-up visits, 2360 were culture-negative. However, a significant percentage (78.7%) of these subungual samples (n = 1857) remained KOH-positive. From the subset of follow-up samples examined for morphological changes, we identified hyphal breakage or distortion in 56 direct smears (60%), which may indicate nonviability.

Conclusions

Reassessment of the definition of onychomycosis cure is critical. For clinical trials of topical agents, length of treatment should be re-examined. Further, in our experience, a high rate of subungual debris samples remained direct smear-positive while converting to negative culture. Evidence of morphological hyphal damage suggests that late-visit microscopic results may be false-positives. Therefore, the absence of clinical signs following an adequate washout period, coupled with a negative culture, with or without negative microscopy, should be considered the definition of onychomycosis cure.

### Treating onychomycoses of the toenail: clinical efficacy of the sub-millisecond 1, 064 nm Nd: YAG laser using a 5 mm spot diameter [^11289ajv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a relatively common fungal infection. Current treatments have limited applicability and low cure rates. Recently introduced laser therapy has shown to be a safe and effective treatment for onychomycosis. In this study, we evaluate a submillisecond Nd:YAG 1,064 nm laser for treating onychomycoses of the tonail.

Methods

Thirteen subjects (9 female, 4 male) with 37 affected toenails received 1 to 3 treatments 4 and/or 8 weeks apart with a sub-millisecond 1,064 nm Nd:YAG laser. Diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed with microscopy. Average follow-up time was 16 weeks post-final treatment. Photos were taken and degree of turbidity was determined using a turbidity scale (ranging from "0 = clear nail" to "10 = completely turbid nail") at each visit. Improvement in turbidity was determined by comparison of turbidity scores at baseline and 16-week follow-up on average. Efficacy was assessed by an overall improvement scale (0 to 4), which combined improvement in turbidity scores and microscopic examination. Overall improvement was classified as "4 = complete clearance" if the turbidity score indicated "0 = clear nail" accompanied by a negative microscopic result. No microscopic examination was performed unless the turbidity score showed "0 = clear nail".

Results

Treatments were well tolerated by all subjects and there were no adverse events. Of the 37 toenails treated, 30 (81%) had "moderate" to "complete" clearance average of 16 weeks post-final treatment. Nineteen toenails (51%) were completely clear and all tested negative for fungal infection on direct microscopic analysis. Seven (19%) toenails had significant clearance and four (11%) had moderate clearance.

Conclusions

The preliminary results of this study show this treatment modality is safe and effective for the treatment of onychomycosis in the short term. Additional studies are needed to more fully assess the clinical and mycological benefits as well as optimize the treatment protocol and parameters.

### Advances in topical and systemic antifungals [^114Ka8p4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Topical antifungal agents are generally used for the treatment of superficial fungal infections unless the infection is widespread, involves an extensive area, or is resistant to initial therapy. Systemic antifungals are often reserved for the treatment of onychomycosis, tinea capitis, superficial and systemic candidiasis, and prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. With the development of resistant fungi strains and the increased incidence of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, some previously effective traditional antifungal agents are subject to limitations including multidrug interactions, severe adverse effects, and their fungistatic mechanism of actions. Several new antifungal agents have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits and have broadened clinicians' choices in the treatment of superficial and systemic invasive fungal infections.

### Effectiveness of nail bed repair in children with or without replacing the fingernail: NINJA multicentre randomized clinical trial [^116fkzRY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Co-primary outcome measures

Surgical-site infection at 7–10 days

The clinical research nurse or surgeon assessed the fingertip for evidence of surgical-site infection (SSI). Diagnosis of SSI was based on the presence of pain, swelling, tenderness, erythema, or purulent discharge. Definitive SSI had the addition of an organism isolated by culture or Gram stain. Return to theatre for drainage of the nail bed wound and prescription of antibiotics were included as additional diagnostic markers of the participant having received treatment for a probable infection. Originally, the incidence of infection, defined in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria (CDC 1993) within 4 months, was selected. However, during the study set-up this was changed to the SSI at 7–10 days owing to concerns about attrition. This change was incorporated into version 1.0 of the protocol (5 December 2017).

Cosmetic appearance of the nail

The cosmetic appearance of the fingernail was assessed using the Oxford Fingernail Appearance Score (OFNAS)at final follow-up, a minimum of 4 months up to 12 months after randomization. This score ranges from 0 (worst) to 5 (best nail appearance) with a single point awarded for each of the following features: subjective assessment of quality for nail shape, nail adherence, eponychium, nail surface, and nail plate split. The reference for assessment was the same finger on the uninjured contralateral hand. Any defects or reduction in quality of the nail compared with the contralateral side resulted in a score of 0 for that feature. Given the scale of changes and substantive differences in Zook score, on which the approach was originally based, the score was formalized as OFNAS in version 2.0 of the protocol (15 August 2018). It was originally intended to use OFNAS to score photographs of patients' fingernails. Trainee surgeons who were blinded to the randomization group scored the returned photographs, and the median score across observers was used in the analysis. However, the proportion of returned photographs was considered too low (48.8 per cent). To improve the return rate, the team telephoned parents who had not responded and asked them to complete the score by answering the questions that make up the OFNAS. This change in follow-up strategy was formally incorporated into protocol version 3.0 (4 June 2019). It improved completeness of the outcome from 48.8 to 65.4 per cent.

### Topical antifungal treatment prevents recurrence of toenail onychomycosis following cure [^111gW8XQ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Recurrence rates are high for onychomycosis, with prophylactic topical antifungal use proposed to counter recurrence. Although this is a reasonable action for many clinicians, few studies have been conducted on the efficacy of topical prophylaxis. A retrospective chart review (2010–2015) was conducted in patients receiving oral terbinafine or itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis. Following complete cure, a topical antifungal (amorolfine, bifonazole, ciclopirox olamine, or terbinafine spray) was used weekly as prophylaxis. Recurrence was recorded along with patient characteristics including demographics and concomitant medical conditions. Data from 320 patients were collected. Recurrence was significantly lower in patients receiving topical antifungal prophylaxis than in no prophylactic treatment following oral terbinafine (p < .001), but not itraconazole (p = .185). Regardless of oral treatment, the use of topical antifungals as prophylaxis (p < .001) decreased, and the number of affected toenails (p = .048) and family history of fungal infections (p < .001) increased the likelihood that recurrence would occur. This study supports the use of topical antifungal medications as prophylactic treatment to help prevent recurrence of toenail onychomycosis and suggests that those with a family history of fungal infections should be closely monitored.

### Validity of self-reported nail counts in patients with onychomycosis: a retrospective pilot analysis [^111bjDG2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis (fungal infection of the toenails or fingernails) is common, affecting up to 8% of the general population. Telephone and mailed surveys conducted to study this disease are usually completed via patient self-report. The validity of the counts of diseased nails reported by the patients participating in these surveys has not been established.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the interrater agreement between patient and health care professional (HCP) counts of affected nails in patients with onychomycosis.

Methods

Patient and HCP counts of infected toenails and fingernails corresponding to a total of 567 patients originating from 3 different clinical trials were retrospectively analyzed. All these patients were initially classified as mycologically positive for toenail onychomycosis, and all 3 trials used identical self-administered questions regarding counts of infected toenails and fingernails. The level of agreement between patient versus HCP counts of infected toenails and fingernails (based on collapsed and uncollapsed counts) was measured using the quadratically weighted kappa statistic.

Results

Thirty-eight percent (213/554, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 35% to 43%) of the 554 patients with self-reported and HCP counts of infected toenails had exact agreement; for these 554 patients, quadratically weighted kappa = 0.47 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.54). The highest agreement rates-79, 62, and 50%-correspond to the patients with HCP counts of affected toenails equaling 1, 2, and 10, respectively; that is, HCP counts at the extremes. The agreement rates ranged from 3% to 31% for the remaining patients with HCP counts between 3 and 9. Patients tended to undercount affected toenails, irrespective of the number of affected toenails counted by HCPs. No statistically significant association was found between agreement rates and whether or not the patients had been previously treated for toenail onychomycosis (P = .91). A marginally nonsignificant association of increasing agreement rates with increasing disease duration was observed (P = .06). Among the patients who reported one or more affected fingernails (n = 122), percent agreement was similar to that of toenails (41%, 95% CI: 33.0 to 50.0%).

Limitations

This pilot study is limited by its retrospective design, its homogeneous group of patients (predominantly white, male veterans), and the fact that information on intraobserver and interobserver reliability was not obtained from all of the 3 clinical trials, the sources for this analysis.

Conclusions

Patients tend to undercount affected nails as compared to HCPs. Reliance on self-reported counts in epidemiological surveys may lead to an inaccurate, underestimate of disease severity.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution for onychomycosis treatment in pediatric patients [^113Ym9ed]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric onychomycosis management is challenging as there are limited treatment options. The objective of this study was to evaluate efinaconazole 10% topical solution in children with onychomycosis.

Methods

This phase 4, multicenter, open-label study (NCT02812771) evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in pediatric participants (6–16 years). Efinaconazole was administered once daily for 48 weeks, with a 4-week posttreatment follow up. Participants had culture-positive, mild-to-severe distal lateral subungual onychomycosis affecting at least 20% of at least 1 great toenail. The PK subset included participants 12–16 years with moderate-to-severe onychomycosis affecting at least 50% of each great toenail and onychomycosis in at least 4 additional toenails.

Results

Of 62 enrolled participants, 60 were included in the safety population and 17 in the PK population. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution was well tolerated. The concentration-time profiles for efinaconazole and its major metabolite were relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations during the 24-hour dosing interval. Systemic exposure to efinaconazole was low. By week 52, 65.0% of participants achieved mycologic cure, with a 36.7% mycologic cure rate observed as early as week 12. A total of 40.0% of participants achieved complete cure, 50.0% achieved clinical efficacy, and 88.3% achieved fungal cure by week 52.

Conclusion

Efinaconazole was safe and efficacious in pediatric participants with mild-to-severe onychomycosis, with improved mycologic cure and complete cure rates compared with adults from two 52-week studies. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(9):867–872. doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.5401.

### A 1, 320-nm Nd: YAG laser for improving the appearance of onychomycosis [^113nkBLK]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a therapeutic challenge because of the toxicities of systemic medications. This has led to the investigation of light-based technologies for safe and effective alternative treatment modalities.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of 4 treatments with a 1,320-nm neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in improving the appearance of onychomycosis.

Materials and Methods

This study was a 24-week, single-center randomized placebo-controlled study. Ten subjects were enrolled with culture-proven, bilateral great toenail onychomycosis. The subjects received 4 treatments with the 1,320-nm Nd:YAG laser to the treatment toenail on Days 1, 7, 14, and 60. The control toenail received a sham treatment of cryogen cooling only. Mycologic cultures were obtained at 3-month follow-up visits.

Results

Fifty percent of mycologic cultures were negative at the 3-month follow-up after 4 laser treatments. Toenails had improvement in subungual debris, hypertrophy, and yellowing. Patient satisfaction was upheld as assessed by the Nail Quality of Life Questionnaire.

Conclusion

The 1,320-nm Nd:YAG laser may be a safe and effective therapy for improving the appearance of onychomycosis. Additional therapy may be necessary to enhance long-term results. Further investigation needs to explore the optimal treatment settings and the most effective treatment schedule.

### Tavaborole topical solution, 5% (tavaborole) [^111Eb71K]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy and safety of tavaborole topical solution was evaluated in two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials. Tavaborole topical solution or vehicle was applied once daily for 48 weeks in subjects with 20% to 60% clinical involvement of the target toenail, without dermatophytomas or lunula (matrix) involvement.

A total of 1194 subjects (795 tavaborole topical solution, 399 Vehicle) 18 to 88 years of age, 82% male, 84% white, participated in these two trials. Efficacy assessments were made at 52 weeks following a 48-week treatment period.

The Complete Cure efficacy endpoint included negative mycology (negative KOH wet mount and negative fungal culture) and Completely Clear Nail (no clinical evidence of onychomycosis as evidenced by a normal toenail plate, no onycholysis, and no subungual hyperkeratosis). Efficacy results from the two trials are summarized in Table 2.

Complete cure defined as 0% clinical involvement of the target toenail plus negative KOH and negative culture.

† Complete or almost complete cure defined as ≤ 10% affected target toenail area involved and negative KOH and culture.

‡ Mycologic cure defined as negative KOH and negative culture.

### Healthy habits: nail hygiene… [^113xyju6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Dirt and germs can live under your fingernails and cause some infections.
- Keep nails short and clean to prevent nail infections. Overview Dirt and germs can live under fingernails and contribute to the spread of some infections, such as pinworms. More dirt and bacteria can gather under long nails than short nails. Fingernail and toenail infections often appear as swelling of the skin around the nails, pain around the nails, or thickening of the nail. In some cases, these infections may be serious and need to be treated by a physician. Everyday tips To help prevent the spread of germs and nail infections:

- Keep nails short and trim them often.
- Scrub the underside of nails with soap and water every time you wash your hands.
- Clean nail grooming tools before use.
- In commercial settings such as nail salons where nail tools are shared among people, sterilize nail grooming tools before use.
- Do not bite or chew nails.
- Do not cut cuticles, as they act as barriers to prevent infection.
- Never rip or bite a hangnail. Instead, clip it with a clean, sanitized nail trimmer.

### Acute and chronic paronychia… [^114UiTq2]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

3–5 Such trauma enables bacterial inoculation of the nail and subsequent infection. The most common causative pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus, although Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, and Proteus vulgaris can also cause paronychia. 3, 6, 7 In patients with exposure to oral flora, other anaerobic gram-negative bacteria may also be involved. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS In patients with acute paronychia, only one nail is typically involved. 10 The condition is characterized by rapid onset of erythema, edema, and discomfort or tenderness of the proximal and lateral nail folds, 11 usually two to five days after the trauma. Patients with paronychia may initially present with only superficial infection and accumulation of purulent material under the nail fold, as indicated by drainage of pus when the nail fold is compressed 12, 13.

14 The test is performed by having the patient oppose the thumb and affected finger, thereby applying light pressure to the distal volar aspect of the affected digit. The increase in pressure within the nail fold causes blanching of the overlying skin and clear demarcation of the abscess. In patients with severe infection or abscess, a specimen should be obtained to identify the responsible pathogen and to rule out methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection.
13. DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis of chronic paronychia is based on physical examination of the nail folds and a history of continuous immersion of hands in water. Pus may form below the nail fold. 8 One or several fingernails are usually affected, typically the thumb and second or third fingers of the dominant hand.

13 The nail plate becomes thickened and discolored, with pronounced transverse ridges such as Beau's lines, and nail loss 8, 10, 13. Chronic paronychia generally has been present for at least six weeks at the time of diagnosis. 10, 12 The condition usually has a prolonged course with recurrent, self-limited episodes of acute exacerbation.
13. Successful treatment outcomes also depend on preventive measures taken by the patient. If the patient is not treated, sporadic, self-limiting, painful episodes of acute inflammation should be expected as the result of continuous penetration of various pathogens.

### Ringworm and fungal nail infections basics… [^115AT1vy]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Ringworm is a common fungal infection of hair, skin, or nails.
- Athlete's foot, jock itch, and most fungal nail infections are forms of ringworm.
- On the skin, it usually causes an itchy, red, ring-shaped rash.
- Nail infections may cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily. What it is Ringworm is a common fungal infection of the hair, skin, or nails. It gets its name because it causes a ring-shaped, itchy, red rash. Skin infections Skin infections are more common on certain parts of the body like on the foot or groin. Ringworm on feet is often referred to as athlete's foot. Ringworm on the groin is often called jock itch. Nail infections Ringworm is also a common type of fungal nail infection. It can cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily.

Although infections are much more common in toenails, fingernails can get infected. Causes Ringworm is caused by fungi. The scientific names for the most common fungi that cause ringworm are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. Ringworm is very common and can be spread by:

- Skin-to-skin contact with people or animals with the infection
- Shared objects
- Shared surfaces. Risk factors include:

- Use of public showers or locker rooms without protective footwear
- Participating in contact sports like wrestling
- Wearing tight shoes and socks
- Excessive sweating
- Close contact with animals Anyone can get ringworm, but people who have weakened immune systems may be especially at risk for infection. They may also have problems fighting off a ringworm infection. Learn more about how to prevent ringworm.

Treatment The treatment for ringworm depends on its location on the body and how serious the infection is. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription antifungal medications. However, other forms of ringworm need treatment with prescription antifungal medication.
