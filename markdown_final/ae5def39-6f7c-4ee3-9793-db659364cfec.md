## Question

trazodone side effect on sinus rhythm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about trazodone's effects on sinus rhythm and how to interpret and manage the arrhythmic risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "sinus rhythm" means in this context and why it matters. Then, I should verify trazodone's electrophysiologic mechanism and whether it plausibly alters sinus node function or repolarization. Next, I will review the clinical evidence for bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes, including dose-response and patient-level risk factors. After that, I need to check drug–drug interactions and electrolyte contributors that amplify risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned approach to screening, monitoring, and management, including what to do if an arrhythmia occurs on therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: "sinus rhythm" refers to normal sinoatrial pacing with regular P waves and a PR interval around 120–200 ms. Disturbances include sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, sinus pauses/arrest, and atrial fibrillation/flutter, all of which can be influenced by medications that affect autonomic tone or repolarization, so I need to ensure I'm interpreting any ECG changes in that framework [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine trazodone's mechanism. Wait, let me verify the core electrophysiology: trazodone prolongs the QT/QTc interval via IKr blockade, which is the key substrate for torsade de pointes. It also has serotonergic effects and alpha-adrenergic antagonism that can contribute to orthostatic hypotension and reflex tachycardia, and it is metabolized by CYP3A4, which becomes important for interactions that raise exposure and QT risk [^114ArdGz] [^1124EWrg].

> Next, I should review bradyarrhythmic effects. Multiple FDA labels note occasional sinus bradycardia in long-term studies, and bradycardia is listed among common adverse reactions; clinically, this can manifest as asymptomatic sinus slowing or, in predisposed patients, as symptomatic bradycardia or even sinus node dysfunction exacerbation, so I need to check for preexisting SND or conduction disease before prescribing [^114T4XgR] [^1173PFwJ] [^112BxDgs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tachyarrhythmias. I should confirm the spectrum. Labels and postmarketing data describe palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular ectopy, and ventricular tachycardia, with case reports of rapid atrial fibrillation temporally linked to trazodone initiation; in overdose cohorts, tachycardia is common, reinforcing a dose-related risk signal even if causality is complex in polypharmacy settings [^114T4XgR] [^114DV4DE] [^116oXqWA].

> I will now examine malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Trazodone has been repeatedly associated with torsade de pointes, including reports at therapeutic doses of 100 mg/day or less; large toxicology cohorts identify trazodone as a drug associated with severe QT prolongation after overdose, and AHA/ACC guidance lists trazodone among agents implicated in TdP, emphasizing risk stratification and ECG vigilance in exposed patients [^114mCoev] [^113FNQJk] [^116GGTke].

> Let me consider dose-response and special populations. While TdP has been reported at doses ≤ 100 mg, overdose series show a clear dose–severity relationship with higher rates of QTc prolongation and cardiac interventions at higher ingestions; women may have greater QTc responses to IKr blockers at similar exposures, and patients with structural heart disease or prior MI appear particularly vulnerable to proarrhythmia, so I should double-check baseline risk before initiating therapy [^116oXqWA] [^117FYxR8] [^114mCoev].

> Next, I should review modifiable risk amplifiers. Concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors like ritonavir, clarithromycin, or itraconazole can markedly increase trazodone levels and arrhythmia risk. Co-administration with other QT-prolonging agents (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, certain antipsychotics, fluoroquinolones) compounds torsade risk. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are critical, and trazodone is contraindicated in patients with known QT prolongation or those at high risk for TdP, so I need to ensure electrolytes are corrected and interacting drugs are avoided [^1124EWrg] [^114ArdGz] [^111einms].

> But wait, what if the patient already has bradycardia or SND — should trazodone be used at all? I should confirm guideline-aligned principles: in patients with symptomatic SND or conduction disease, first address reversible causes and consider withdrawal of offending agents; trazodone is not absolutely contraindicated for bradyarrhythmias per se, but caution is warranted and any new bradycardia on therapy should prompt reassessment of indication, dose, and alternatives [^112urumh] [^113SVZ8g].

> I need to ensure a practical screening and monitoring plan. Before starting trazodone, I should obtain a baseline ECG in patients with cardiac disease, age ≥ 65, or on QT-prolonging regimens; check electrolytes (K+, Mg2+); review concomitant medications for CYP3A4 inhibition and QT liability; and avoid use in congenital long QT or recent MI recovery. During therapy, new palpitations, syncope, or QTc > 500 ms should trigger immediate ECG review and drug interruption, with formal torsade risk assessment per AHA/ACC guidance [^114ArdGz] [^114bNMEF].

> Let me think about management if an arrhythmia emerges. For suspected torsade, I should stop trazodone and other QT-prolonging agents, correct potassium and magnesium, and administer intravenous magnesium. Temporary pacing or isoproterenol may be needed for bradycardia-dependent TdP, and continuous telemetry is indicated. For persistent symptomatic bradycardia attributable to trazodone, dose reduction or discontinuation is first-line, reserving pacing for refractory SND after removing reversible causes, consistent with bradycardia guidelines [^116GGTke] [^112urumh].

> Hold on, I should verify the overall risk–benefit message for off-label insomnia use, since that's common. Evidence for trazodone as a hypnotic in nondepressed adults is limited, and professional guidance emphasizes adverse effects including orthostatic hypotension, sedation, and cardiac arrhythmias; given QT risk and interaction potential, many patients may fare better with alternatives that lack meaningful QT liability, so I should discuss these trade-offs explicitly [^111qtxoJ] [^113bZseR].

> In summary, trazodone can affect sinus rhythm in two principal ways: by slowing sinus node automaticity (sinus bradycardia or SND exacerbation) and by prolonging repolarization with risk of torsade de pointes and other tachyarrhythmias. Risk is amplified by CYP3A4 inhibitors, co-administered QT-prolonging drugs, electrolyte derangements, female sex, and structural heart disease, so baseline screening, interaction review, electrolyte optimization, and symptom-triggered ECG monitoring are essential to safe use [^114ArdGz] [^114mCoev] [^114bNMEF].

Trazodone can cause **sinus bradycardia** [^114T4XgR] and **QT prolongation** [^114ArdGz], which may lead to torsades de pointes and other arrhythmias [^114mCoev]. These effects are more likely in patients with preexisting cardiac disease, electrolyte abnormalities, or when combined with other QT-prolonging or CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs [^114mCoev]. Routine ECG monitoring is not required for all patients, but it is advised to assess baseline risk, avoid high-risk combinations, and monitor for symptoms such as palpitations, syncope, or dizziness [^notfound].

## Mechanisms of trazodone-induced sinus rhythm disturbances

Trazodone affects sinus rhythm through **two primary mechanisms**:

- **Sinus bradycardia**: Trazodone can decrease sinus node automaticity, causing sinus bradycardia [^114T4XgR], particularly in patients with preexisting cardiac conduction abnormalities or those taking other negative chronotropic medications [^112urumh].

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: Trazodone prolongs the QT interval [^114ArdGz], increasing the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP), a potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia [^114mCoev]. This risk is heightened in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), or when coadministered with other QT-prolonging medications [^114mCoev].

---

## Clinical evidence of sinus rhythm disturbances associated with trazodone

Several clinical studies and case reports have documented **sinus rhythm disturbances** associated with trazodone:

- **Sinus bradycardia**: Occasional sinus bradycardia has been reported in long-term studies of trazodone [^114T4XgR] [^1173PFwJ].

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: Clinical studies and postmarketing reports have identified trazodone as arrhythmogenic, particularly in patients with preexisting cardiac disease [^114mCoev]. Arrhythmias reported include isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsades de pointes [^1177BMH1]. Notably, torsades de pointes has been reported even at doses of 100 mg per day or less [^114mCoev].

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Case reports have documented the onset of rapid atrial fibrillation following the initiation of trazodone therapy [^114DV4DE].

---

## Risk factors for trazodone-induced sinus rhythm disturbances

Several patient-specific and medication-related factors **increase the risk** of sinus rhythm disturbances with trazodone:

| **Risk factor category** | **Specific risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Patient-specific factors | - Preexisting cardiac disease (e.g. arrhythmias, heart failure, myocardial infarction) [^114mCoev] <br/> - Congenital long QT syndrome [^1177BMH1] <br/> - Electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) [^114bNMEF] <br/> - Advanced age <br/> - Female sex [^114bNMEF] |
| Medication-related factors | - Concomitant use of QT-prolonging medications (e.g. antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, certain antibiotics) [^114ArdGz] <br/> - CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, ketoconazole) [^1124EWrg] <br/> - High trazodone doses or overdose [^113FNQJk] |

---

## Clinical management and monitoring strategies

Given the potential for significant cardiac effects, clinicians should **adopt the following strategies**:

- **Baseline assessment**: Evaluate patients' cardiac history, perform a baseline ECG if indicated, and assess electrolyte levels before initiating trazodone therapy [^notfound].

- **Avoidance of high-risk combinations**: Avoid coadministration of trazodone with other QT-prolonging medications or CYP3A4 inhibitors when possible [^114ArdGz].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor patients for symptoms of arrhythmias (palpitations, syncope, dizziness) and perform periodic ECGs in patients with ongoing risk factors [^114mCoev].

- **Management of arrhythmias**: If significant bradycardia or QT prolongation occurs, discontinue trazodone and manage arrhythmias according to standard clinical protocols [^112urumh].

---

## Comparison with other antidepressants

Compared with other antidepressants, trazodone has a **moderate-to-high risk** of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, due to its QT-prolonging properties [^1173PFwJ]. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) generally have a lower risk of cardiac arrhythmias, although some (e.g. citalopram) have been associated with dose-dependent QT prolongation [^112JTibZ]. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) carry a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to their quinidine-like effects and potential to cause conduction disturbances [^1113Za7h].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following **recommendations** regarding trazodone use:

- **Avoidance in high-risk patients**: Trazodone should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation, symptomatic bradycardia, or recent myocardial infarction [^111einms].

- **Careful monitoring**: Patients with preexisting cardiac disease or those receiving other QT-prolonging medications should be closely monitored for cardiac arrhythmias [^114mCoev].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be informed about the potential cardiac side effects of trazodone and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms of arrhythmias [^114mCoev].

---

Trazodone can cause **sinus bradycardia** and **QT prolongation**, with a risk of torsades de pointes and other arrhythmias, especially in patients with preexisting cardiac disease, electrolyte abnormalities, or when combined with other QT-prolonging medications [^114mCoev]. Clinicians should assess baseline risk, avoid high-risk combinations, and monitor for symptoms of arrhythmias [^114bNMEF].

What Was Added to the United States Label?

The following 2 paragraphs were added:

Warnings and precautions (5.4) Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities: In vitro testing showed that Lamictal exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Based on this activity, Lamictal (lamotrigine) could slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) and induce proarrhythmia, including sudden death, in people with structural heart disease or myocardial ischemia. Therefore, avoid the use of Lamictal in people who have cardiac conduction disorders (eg, second- or third-degree heart block), ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac disease or abnormality (eg, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, structural heart disease, Brugada syndrome, or other sodium channelopathies). Concomitant use of other sodium channel blockers may increase the risk of proarrhythmia.

Clinical Pharmacology (12.2). Effect of Lamictal: In vitro studies show that lamotrigine exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. It inhibits human cardiac sodium channels with rapid onset and offset kinetics and strong voltage dependence, consistent with other Class IB antiarrhythmic agents. Lamictal did not slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) in healthy individuals in a thorough QT study; however, it could slow ventricular conduction and increase the risk of arrhythmia in people with structural heart disease or myocardial ischemia. Elevated heart rates could also increase the risk of ventricular conduction slowing with Lamictal.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Death from overdose has occurred in patients ingesting trazodone and other CNS depressant drugs concurrently (alcohol; alcohol and chloral hydrate and diazepam; amobarbital; chlordiazepoxide; or meprobamate).

The most severe reactions reported to have occurred with overdose of trazodone alone have been priapism, respiratory arrest, seizures, and ECG changes, including QT prolongation and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The reactions reported most frequently have been drowsiness and vomiting. Overdosage may cause an increase in incidence or severity of any of the reported adverse reactions.

There is no specific antidote for trazodone hydrochloride overdose.

In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. For current information on the management of poisoning or overdose, contact a poison control center (1–800–222–1222 or www.poison.org).

Atrial fibrillation — digoxin provides limited rate control with delayed onset, is not first-line for rapid management, and has important adverse effects and interactions. Although intravenous digoxin may slow the ventricular response to AF at rest, there is a delay of at least 60 min before onset and the peak effect does not develop for up to 6 h; digoxin is no more effective than placebo in converting AF to sinus rhythm, in a review of 139 episodes of paroxysmal AF there was no difference between those taking digoxin and those not, and digoxin is no longer considered first-line therapy for rapid management of AF except in patients with HF or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or in very sedentary patients. According to a systematic review, digoxin alone slows resting heart rate by an average of 4 to 21 beats per minute but does not slow heart rate during exercise in AF; the most frequent adverse effects are ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) block, and sinus pauses, and serum digoxin concentration may rise with verapamil or antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or amiodarone.

### Single-substance trazodone exposures reported to US poison centers from 2000 to 2019 [^116oXqWA]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Individual case reports describe trazodone overdose resulting in QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. The clinical effects and outcomes associated with trazodone exposures on a large-scale basis are less well known.

Objective

The primary objective was to characterize the severity of single substance trazodone exposures and identify any relationships that may exist between dose of trazodone and severity of exposure. The secondary objective was to describe these exposures from a demographic and clinical symptom standpoint.

Methods

A retrospective review of single-substance trazodone exposures reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2019 was performed. The primary objective was to characterize the severity of trazodone exposures and relationships between ingested dose and level of care required or medical outcome.

Results

A total of 118,773 cases were included in the analysis of demographics and level of care required. A majority (59.5%) of cases did not require medical admission. Of the 81,698 cases with known medical outcomes, the most common clinical effects included mild-moderate CNS depression (49.7%), QTc prolongation (12.2% of cases in 2019), vomiting (9.0%), hypotension (7.0%), and tachycardia (7.0%). The median ingested dose associated with treatment, and release from the emergency department was 600mg compared to 1500mg in those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Regarding medical outcome, median ingested dose ranged from 600mg in those experiencing no effect to 1500mg in those experiencing major effects. Cardiac-related clinical effects and the need for cardiac-specific interventions were overall infrequent. A dose-response relationship was identified for level of care and medical outcome.

Conclusions

Many trazodone exposures can be characterized as low severity due to the infrequent need for healthcare facility admission and large proportion of cases that experienced no effects or only minor effects.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Agents with proven efficacy to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF) — evidence summary and amiodarone: Thirty-six controlled trials evaluating 7 antiarrhythmic drugs for maintenance were identified, including 14 trials in paroxysmal AF and 22 trials in persistent AF. Available evidence suggests that amiodarone is more effective than either class I drugs, sotalol, or placebo for long-term maintenance in patients refractory to other drugs, but it is associated with a relatively high incidence of potentially severe extracardiac toxic effects, making it a second-line or last-resort agent in many cases. The use of low-dose amiodarone (200 mg daily or less) may be effective and associated with fewer side effects. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and/or previous myocardial infarction (MI), amiodarone is associated with a low risk of proarrhythmia, making it an appropriate initial choice to prevent recurrent AF in these situations, and it provides the added benefit of effective rate control, frequently eliminating the need for other drugs to control the ventricular rate. In the CTAF trial context, a majority of the 403 patients had first-time paroxysmal (46%) or persistent (54%) AF of less than 6-month duration.

### Respiration driven excessive sinus tachycardia treated with clonidine [^113NaEfs]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Variation in heart rate with the respiratory cycle is a well described, but not yet a fully understood phenomenon known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Through a predominantly vagally mediated response, the normal response to inspiration is an increase in heart rate. Suggested mechanisms for this response include the activation of pulmonary stretch receptors, increased firing of atrial and arterial baroreceptors and modulation by central respiratory drive.

Treatments acting on the efferent end points of this pathway alone, such as ivabradine and β blockers, failed to show any improvement. However, we were able to achieve an excellent response by combining these therapies with the centrally acting clonidine.

Patient's perspective

Email from the patient (31 October 2016): This condition is far from what I would wish on anyone. However, I have managed to cope with it, as much as can be expected. I still am on clonidine and have been titrated down to 50 µg three times a day. This is one of the tablets that I felt helps me as it stops the forceful contractions of my heart. I find that exercise is still a very big no-no for me. However, I am managing to do everyday things like go to university. Since I last came down to London, this condition has flourished and affected my sleep. It seems like I am using medication to compensate for a switch from parasympathetic to sympathetic state and the reverse (especially at night). Clonidine is one of the tablets that has the least effect on my blood pressure but stops the 'adrenal storms' I usually get. To be honest, I find that the medication I am on only suppresses symptoms and I normally have to prepare for a couple of days of breakthrough symptoms that last longer than if I was not on medication. However, I would prefer to have it this way as it allows me to gain a bit of control over my life. I thank your team for everything they did as you were 100% right in your diagnosis.

Learning points

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia remains a not yet fully understood mechanism where the respiratory cycle leads to variations in the heart rate in sinus rhythm.
While an exaggerated respiratory sinus arrhythmia is commonly seen during tilt testing, such a marked symptomatic sinus tachycardia following a single deep breath proved difficult to manage.
When traditional peripherally acting treatments for palpitations such as β blockers and ivabradine have failed, we have shown an excellent response with the addition of the centrally acting agent clonidine.

### The use of trazodone as a hypnotic: a critical review [^111qtxoJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The last few years have seen a remarkable rise in the off-label use of trazodone for inducing sleep in nondepressed patients, to a degree that it is prescribed for this purpose as commonly as the leading hypnotic. In view of this widespread popularity, it seems prudent to review what is known of the safety and efficacy of trazodone when used in this context.

Data Sources and Selection

A MEDLINE search of the literature published in English between 1975 and 2003 that included the keywords sleep, trazodone, Desyrel, depression, sleeping pill, and sedative-hypnotics was conducted.

Data Synthesis

From this review, it is concluded that there are very few data to suggest that trazodone improves sleep in patients without mood disorder, though it does increase total sleep in patients with major depressive disorder. There are virtually no dose-response data for trazodone vis-à-vis sleep and, similarly, no available data on tolerance to its possible hypnotic effects. Areas of concern with its use include reports of significant dropout rates and induction of arrhythmias, primarily in patients with histories of cardiac disease, as well as the development of priapism.

Conclusion

In summary, there are few data to support the use of trazodone in nondepressed subjects. When the risk-benefit ratio of trazodone is assessed, its side effect profile, which is much more significant than that of conventional hypnotics, should be considered.

### Trazodone in the elderly: risk of extrapyramidal acute events [^1116wQ3v]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Trazodone is a second-generation atypical antidepressant exercising selective inhibitory action on the transport of serotonin. It also has an antagonist effect, similar to nefazodone, on the 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptors, probably due to the therapeutic effects of such substances. It is very effective in the treatment of depression, in anxiety and insomnia. Its known side effects mainly occur with prolonged use of daily doses of 150–200 mg. The ability to enhance drowsiness may be associated with some risk in elderly patients. This clinical case illustrates an acute extrapyramidal event induced by a low dose of trazodone.

10. Overdosage

Death from overdose has occurred in patients ingesting trazodone and other CNS depressant drugs concurrently (alcohol; alcohol and chloral hydrate and diazepam; amobarbital; chlordiazepoxide; or meprobamate).

The most severe reactions reported to have occurred with overdose of trazodone alone have been priapism, respiratory arrest, seizures, and ECG changes, including QT prolongation. The reactions reported most frequently have been drowsiness and vomiting. Overdosage may cause an increase in incidence or severity of any of the reported adverse reactions.

There is no specific antidote for trazodone hydrochloride overdose. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. For current information on the management of poisoning or overdose, contact a poison control center (1–800–222–1222 or www.poison.org).

### New antiarrhythmic drugs for establishing sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: what are our therapies likely to be by 2010 and beyond? [^114g5nAL]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation (AF) is plagued by, among other things, limitations in the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of currently available agents for the conversion of AF to sinus rhythm and for the maintenance of sinus rhythm. This review describes some of the most promising approaches to new therapies that may overcome some of the limitations of our current therapies. The agents we have chosen to review are representative of these new approaches and have completed their phase III trials and have submitted an application for approval for release by regulatory agencies or have almost completed their phase III trials and appear likely to submit for approval in the not to distant future.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^1177BMH1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Monitor all patients taking trazodone for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with trazodone and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of trazodone with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing events, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release form of trazodone. Trazodone should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering trazodone to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including trazodone) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Results

Participant characteristics

The incident cohort had a mean age of 55 (SD 13) years, 133 (55%) were male, 175 (72%) were African American, the median total depression score was 4 (IQR: 1, 8), 138 (57%) had diabetes, and 97 (40%) had congestive heart failure.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options to maintain sinus rhythm: guideline-based and new approaches [^114SqaYv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia in patients with heart failure and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Restoration and preservation of sinus rhythm, therefore, has a premium. Of the numerous treatment options available, many must be avoided because of their potential for adverse effects or because of limited proof of efficacy in defined populations. Published guidelines provide help by synthesizing clinical trial data into a recommended approach. This article summarizes current information regarding the best methods applicable to patients with left ventricular dysfunction for rate control, sinus rhythm restoration and maintenance, and stroke prevention. New and evolving therapies and how they might fit into the evolving treatment paradigm are also briefly reviewed.

### Drug-specific risk of severe QT prolongation following acute drug overdose [^113FNQJk]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Severe QT prolongation (SQTP) has been identified as a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in acute drug overdose, but drug-specific causes of SQTP in the setting of acute drug overdose remain unclear. We aimed to perform the most definitive study to date describing drug-specific risk of SQTP following acute drug overdose. Methods: This was a prospective multicenter cohort study at > 50 hospital sites across the US using the ToxIC Registry between 2015 and 2018. Inclusion criteria were adults (≥ 18 years) receiving medical toxicology consultation for acute drug overdose. The primary outcome was SQTP, which was defined using the computer automated Bazett QT correction (QTc) on the ECG with the previously validated cut point of 500 milliseconds. Mean difference in QTc was also calculated for specific drugs. Drugs associated with SQTP were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to control for known confounders of QT risk (age, sex, race, cardiac disease). Results: From 25,303 patients screened, 6473 met inclusion criteria with SQTP occurring in 825 (13%). Drugs associated with increased adjusted odds of SQTP included Class III antidysrhythmics (sotalol), sodium channel blockers (amitriptyline, diphenhydramine, doxepin, imipramine, nortriptyline), antidepressants (bupropion, citalopram, escitalopram, trazodone), antipsychotics (haloperidol, quetiapine), and the antiemetic serotonin antagonist ondansetron. Conclusions: This large US cohort describes drug-specific risk of SQTP following acute drug overdose. Healthcare providers caring for acute drug overdoses from any of these implicated drugs should pay close attention to cardiac monitoring for occurrence of SQTP.

### Rapid atrial fibrillation associated with trazodone hydrochloride… [^114DV4DE]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Trazodone hydrochloride is a triazolopyridine derivative that was released in 1981 as a nontricyclic antidepressant with antiserotonin activity. 1 Recent reports have suggested that trazodone may have more cardiotoxicity than was first believed. 2, 3 Herein, we describe a patient who manifested atrial fibrillation after trazodone therapy was instituted. Report of a Case. — 78-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for the repair of a uterine prolapse. Five years Previously, she had had a subendocardial myocardial infarction and subsequently manifested a pattern of chronic stable angina pectoris. Her antianginal medications were isorbide dinitrate and propranolol hydrochloride. On admission, the ECG showed a sinus rhythm with a PR interval of 0. 21 s and left ventricular hypertrophy.

Because of frequent crying episodes, confusion, and a sleep disorder, the patient was seen by a psychiatrist preoperatively and was placed on a regimen of 200 mg/day of trazodone hydrochloride in two.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — transient/reversible causes of sinus node dysfunction (SND) states that patients presenting with symptomatic SND secondary to a reversible cause should first be managed by directing the therapy at eliminating or mitigating the offending condition (COR I, LOE C-EO). When sinus bradycardia is the consequence of nonessential medications, permanent cardiac pacing should not be considered a first-line treatment, and withdrawal of the offending drug or dosage reduction can improve the heart rate and symptoms; medications are frequent culprits, including negative chronotropic drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. Additional reversible contributors noted include hypothyroidism with cardiovascular abnormalities that respond to thyroxine, metabolic abnormalities such as severe systemic acidosis or hypokalemia in acute settings, and other treatable conditions such as elevated intracranial pressure, acute MI, severe hypothermia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Spinal cord injury–associated sinus bradycardia is common in the acute recovery phase and cardiac arrest during the first 2 to 4 weeks after injury was observed in 16% of patients with severe cervical spinal injury. Episodes can be persistent and refractory to atropine, with common triggers including tracheal suctioning and turning the patient. Adenosine receptor blockade by theophylline or aminophylline has been shown to be effective in case series; 3 case series of 2 to 6 patients reported beneficial effects on heart rate and avoidance of PPM implantation, and treatment usually can be withdrawn after 4 to 6 weeks with rare side effects or adverse events. Temporary pacing is another potential approach for hemodynamically significant sinus bradycardia in this setting.

Trazodone — insomnia and nightmare symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) veterans — was assessed in a retrospective cohort of 74 male patients in an 8‑week inpatient program where all had previously received trazodone; sixty patients maintained an effective dose and reported decreased nightmare frequency from an average of 3.3 ± 1.7 to 1.3 ± 1.4 nights/week, with a mean reported effective dose of 212 mg/day. Among continuers, 60% experienced some side effect (particularly daytime sedation or dizziness), and 14 discontinued due to intolerable effects including priapism (5 subjects), daytime sedation (5 subjects), more vivid nightmares (1 subject), dry mouth/sinuses (1 subject), muscle pain (1 subject), and severe agitation (1 subject).

### Identification of drug interaction adverse events in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review [^114J17TG]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The current study was planned to analyze DDI-associated clinical outcomes that occurred in clinical practice during the pandemic and to investigate whether and how drug interaction checkers might be useful to assess them. Our main finding is that the use of these tools could have identified several DDI-associated ADRs, including severe and life-threatening events. However, the interactions between the drugs used to treat COVID-19 and between the COVID-19 drugs and those already used by the patients should be evaluated.

At the beginning of the pandemic, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were largely used because of their ability (assessed in vitro) to modify cellular pH, thus interfering with SARS-CoV-2 replication and its fusion with the host cells. Then, as shown in the current study, hydroxychloroquine was recognized to interfere with the antiviral agents lopinavir-ritonavir, darunavir-cobicistat, and acetazolamide, causing QT-interval prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. In the study by Borba et al, several patients treated with chloroquine died after drug administration. Most patients (89.6%) with increased QT-interval prolongation were taking oseltamivir as well as acetazolamide and ceftriaxone. Crescioli et alreported 5 deaths among 23 patients. These patients had developed QT-interval prolongation after the coadministration of hydroxychloroquine with at least 1 of the following drugs: darunavir-cobicistat, acetazolamide, amiodarone, lopinavir-ritonavir, haloperidol, citalopram, and trazodone. Martínez-López-de-Castro et alreported that 3 of 44 deceased patients also had alteration of the QT interval associated with DDIs.

### Sex differences in cardiac arrhythmia: a consensus document of the European Heart Rhythm Association, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^117FYxR8]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced QTc responses by sex — In studies of drug-induced repolarization changes, women tend to have larger QTc responses to drugs blocking the delayed potassium rectifier current such as e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, haloperidol and droperidol than men, differences that appear to be explained by lower body weight and thus increased plasma concentrations when the same drug amount is administered at the same doses in women and men. After adjusting for plasma concentration differences, QTc responses to drugs blocking the delayed potassium rectifier current are similar in women and men, and observations are noted as suggesting that sex hormones play an important role in determining the QTc interval duration.

### Attaining sinus rhythm mediates improved outcome with early rhythm control therapy of atrial fibrillation: the EAST-AFNET 4 trial [^112xLuYX]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Strong mediating and moderating effect of sinus rhythm at 12 months on the first primary outcome of the EAST-AFNET 4 trial. The presence of sinus rhythm at 12 months explains about 81% of the effect of early rhythm control on the first primary outcome, a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure, or acute coronary syndrome. This can be appreciated in the first horizontal line in the graph (natural effect). There is hardly any effect of early rhythm control in patients who are not in sinus rhythm at the 12-month visit, visible in lack of a controlled direct effect in patients not in sinus rhythm at 12 months. Atrial fibrillation recurrence at any time up to the 12-month visit, in contrast, only explains 31% of the effect of early rhythm control, due to the small differences between the effects of the two subgroups (controlled effect in patients without AF recurrence and patients with AF recurrence). The analysis is adjusted for baseline characteristics that may confound the treatment effects on the mediator or the mediator effect on the outcome. Total effect indicates the adjusted treatment effect on the outcome; natural direct effect indicates the adjusted treatment effect due to the observed distribution of the mediator; controlled direct effect indicates the adjusted treatment effect for subgroups of patients with and without sinus rhythm or with and without atrial fibrillation recurrence at 12 months.

Figure 3
Time to recurrent atrial fibrillation and number of patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients randomized to early rhythm control by rhythm status at 12 months. (A) The survival curves show the time to recurrent atrial fibrillation from randomization to 12 months in patients randomized to early rhythm control who were in sinus rhythm at 12 months and for patients who were not in sinus rhythm at 12 months. Patients who reached a primary outcome event or died in the first 12 months were not included. Recurrent atrial fibrillation was documented by triggered visits due to atrial fibrillation in the telemetric echocardiography or by an unscheduled visit due to clinically documented atrial fibrillation. (B) The tabulated data show the proportion of patients without recurrent atrial fibrillation and with recurrent atrial fibrillation who were in sinus rhythm at the 12-month visit: 58.3% (105/180) of patients not in sinus rhythm at 12 months had a scheduled or unscheduled visit due to recurrent atrial fibrillation, while only 28.5% (288/1009) of those in sinus rhythm at 12 months had such a visit.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112JTibZ]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants — tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): TCAs have numerous documented cardiovascular side effects, including sinus tachycardia and postural hypotension; they also prolong the duration of the QRS interval and QTc interval, and second- and third-degree heart block can develop. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a very low rate of adverse cardiovascular effects, and in prospective studies of patients with HF, post-MI, or unstable angina, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine had minimal to no effect on electrocardiographic and echocardiographic indices of cardiac function. However, in 2011 the FDA issued a safety announcement that citalopram should not exceed 40 mg/d because of the risk of dose-dependent QTc prolongation that could lead to TdP, and the FDA recommended avoiding use in patients with decompensated HF.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^114ArdGz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Trazodone prolongs the QT/QTc interval. The use of trazodone should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including trazodone, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of vanoxerine for the conversion of subjects with recent onset atrial fibrillation or flutter to normal sinus rhythm: RESTORE SR [^111ZPBJm]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vanoxerine is an oral, 1,4-dialkylpiperazine derivative antiarrhythmic drug being evaluated for pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vanoxerine for the restoration of sinus rhythm in subjects with recent onset AF or atrial flutter (AFL).

Methods

RESTORE SR (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of vanoxerine for the conversion of subjects with recent onset atrial fibrillation or flutter to normal sinus rhythm) was a prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized subjects to a single oral dose of vanoxerine 400 mg or placebo (2:1 allocation).

Results

A total of 41 subjects were randomized in the study (placebo [n = 15] and vanoxerine [n = 26]). The study was terminated prematurely because of safety concerns. Overall, 61% (23 of 38) of the treated cohort had a history of AF/AFL and 66% (27 of 41) had structural heart disease (SHD). The primary efficacy end point-conversion to sinus rhythm through 24 hours-occurred in 20% (3 of 15) in the placebo arm vs 69% (18 of 26) in the vanoxerine arm (P = 0.0024). The mean length of stay was 4.2 ± 2.9 days in the placebo arm vs 4.7 ± 3.2 days in the vanoxerine arm (P = 0.6561). The primary safety end point (all-cause death, ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia requiring intervention, or torsades de pointes) occurred in no patient in the placebo arm vs 11.5% (3 of 26) in the vanoxerine arm. All 3 patients had torsades de pointes and underlying SHD.

Conclusion

Vanoxerine is an oral, mixed ion channel blocker with IKr, INa, and L-type calcium channel activity. While oral therapy with 400 mg of vanoxerine appears effective for the termination of recent onset AF/AFL, its use was associated with a significant risk of ventricular proarrhythmia in patients with SHD.

### A review of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of trazodone in insomnia [^111PwWuE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine antidepressant, is currently the second most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of insomnia due to its sedating qualities. Given trazodone's widespread use, a careful review of the literature was conducted to assess its efficacy and side effects when given for treatment of insomnia.

Data Sources

In April 2003, a MEDLINE search was conducted using the search terms trazodone and insomnia and trazodone and sleep and restricted to 1980–2003, human subjects, and English language. As trazodone has been implicated in cardiac disorders, a further search was conducted using the term cardiac and trazodone.

Study Selection

All clinical trials that measured any endpoint for insomnia efficacy were included in the assessment. A total of 18 studies were identified from the literature search. In addition, commonly used texts were consulted for information regarding adverse effects related to trazodone.

Data Extraction

Because so few studies were identified by the literature search, all were evaluated and described.

Data Synthesis

Evidence for the efficacy of trazodone in treating insomnia is very limited; most studies are small, conducted in populations of depressed patients, raise issues of design, and often lack objective efficacy measures. Side effects associated with trazodone are not inconsequential, with a high incidence of discontinuation due to side effects, such as sedation, dizziness, and psychomotor impairment, which raise particular concern regarding its use in the elderly. There is also some evidence of tolerance related to use of trazodone.

Conclusion

Given the relative absence of efficacy data in patients with insomnia and the adverse events associated with trazodone's use in general, it is uncertain whether the risk/benefit ratio warrants trazodone's use in nondepressed patients with insomnia.

### Effect of viloxazine and trazodone in obstructive sleep apnoea: a randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study [^114PYvAJ]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Combination of the noradrenergic atomoxetine with either the antimuscarinic aroxybutynin or trazodone has been shown to improve obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) severity. However, atomoxetine may contribute to apnoea-cycling and reduced drug tolerability due to wake-promoting, especially in a subgroup (poor cytochrome 2D6 metabolisers leading to higher blood concentration of medication). We investigated the effect of a potentially more manageable noradrenergic, viloxazine, with and without trazodone, on OSA severity.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 24 patients with OSA (18–75 years) were analysed and randomised to 500 mg viloxazine, 500/75 mg viloxazine-trazodone (vilo-trazo) or placebo; taken before bed for 2 weeks with 1-week washout between treatments. In-laboratory polysomnography was performed at the end of each cross-over period. Mixed-model analyses compared the effect of vilo-trazo versus placebo on AHI 4 (apnoea-hypopnoea index with 4% desaturations; primary outcome) and hypoxic burden (secondary outcome). Additional outcomes examined the effects of vilo-trazo versus viloxazine on total sleep time (TST) and wake-after-sleep-onset (WASO). Safety endpoints (patient-reported outcomes, heart rate and adverse events) were also assessed.

Results

Vilo-trazo reduced AHI 4 (mean difference (95% CI): 10.5 (6.6, 13.6) events/hour, p < 0.001) and hypoxic burden (16.7 (9.6, 21.8) %min/hr, p < 0.001) versus placebo. Compared with viloxazine, TST tended to be longer on vilo-trazo (22.3 (-1.4, 46.0) min, p < 0.065), while WASO was unchanged. TST and WASO remained significantly reduced on vilo-trazo versus placebo. Both interventions worsened patient-reported outcomes, although to a lesser extent on vilo-trazo, and increased heart rate versus placebo. Commonly reported adverse events were insomnia, constipation, headache and xerostomia.

Conclusions

Viloxazine-trazodone reduced OSA severity. Potential deleterious effects of viloxazine on sleep quality appeared partly attenuated by trazodone.

### Trazodone hydrochoride (trazodone hydrochloride) [^1154zb6i]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Animal Oral LD50: The oral LD50 of the drug is 610 mg/kg in mice, 486 mg/kg in rats, and 560 mg/kg in rabbits.

Signs and Symptoms: Death from overdose has occurred in patients ingesting trazodone HCl and other drugs concurrently (namely, alcohol; alcohol + chloral hydrate + diazepam; amobarbital; chlordiazepoxide; or meprobamate).

The most severe reactions reported to have occurred with overdose of trazodone HCl alone have been priapism, respiratory arrest, seizures, and EKG changes. The reactions reported most frequently have been drowsiness and vomiting. Overdosage may cause an increase in incidence or severity of any of the reported adverse reactions (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Treatment

There is no specific antidote for trazodone HCl. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive in the case of hypotension or excessive sedation. Any patient suspected of having taken an overdose should have the stomach emptied by gastric lavage. Forced diuresis may be useful in facilitating elimination of the drug.

### Evaluating the dose-dependent mechanism of action of trazodone by estimation of occupancies for different brain neurotransmitter targets [^116pwmwn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Trazodone is a drug that was introduced in the clinic almost 40 years ago. It is licensed to treat depression, but it is also commonly used off-label to treat insomnia. A recent study shows that it could be promising in preventing neurodegeneration in mice, and clinical trials to assess its possible beneficial effects on dementia and Alzheimer's disease are expected to start soon in humans. In this study, we describe the dose-dependent pharmacology of trazodone by carrying out pharmacokinetic simulations aiming to predict the brain concentrations of trazodone for different drug-dosing regimens and calculating occupancy for 28 different targets for which published trazodone-binding data are available. Our study indicates that low doses of trazodone (typically 50 mg daily) should suffice to block specific receptors responsible for the hypnotic effect, and to provide the protective effect against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that could be beneficial in dementia. Higher doses are required for an antidepressant effect. The occupancy of specific receptors at therapeutic doses also explains peculiar side effects reported by patients treated with trazodone (e.g. dry-mouth, hypotension and priapism).

### Does trazodone have a role in palliating symptoms? [^1173G8t9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trazodone is a unique antidepressant, which blocks the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C), and weakly inhibits presynaptic 5-HT transporters.

Discussion

Trazodone is well-absorbed by the mouth and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in those depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain may be relieved by mechanisms similar to venlafaxine. Delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. Drug interactions are a risk due to cytochrome metabolism.

Conclusion

Trazodone has a unique pharmacology, which may be an advantage in palliating symptoms; however, little evidence is available through cohort or randomized trials to give guidance to its use.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder

A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that trazodone HCl is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

TRAZODONE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF PRIAPISM. IN MANY OF THE CASES REPORTED, SURGICAL INTERVENTION WAS REQUIRED AND, IN SOME OF THESE CASES, PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OF ERECTILE FUNCTION OR IMPOTENCE RESULTED. MALE PATIENTS WITH PROLONGED OR INAPPROPRIATE ERECTIONS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE THE DRUG AND CONSULT THEIR PHYSICIAN.

The detumescence of priapism and drug-induced penile erections has been accomplished by both pharmacologic, e.g., the intracavernosal injection of alpha-adrenergic stimulants such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as surgical procedures.b-g Any pharmacologic or surgical procedure utilized in the treatment of priapism should be performed under the supervision of a urologist or a physician familiar with the procedure and should not be initiated without urologic consultation if the priapism has persisted for more than 24 hours.

Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction.

Caution should be used when administering trazodone HCl to patients with cardiac disease, and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including trazodone HCl) have been associated with the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias. Recent clinical studies in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease indicate that trazodone HCl may be arrhythmogenic in some patients in that population. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, and in two patients short episodes (3–4 beats) of ventricular tachycardia.

Background

Clozapine is an efficacious treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia; however its use can be limited by side effect intolerability. Sinus tachycardia is a common adverse event associated with clozapine treatment. Various pharmacological treatments are used to control heart rate increase due to clozapine use and can include a decreased rate of clozapine titration, a switch to a different antipsychotic, or treatment with negative chronotropic drugs.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effects and efficacy of pharmacological interventions for clozapine-induced sinus tachycardia. To systematically review the adverse events associated with pharmacological interventions for clozapine-induced sinus tachycardia.

Search Methods

On 23 March 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions, at any dose and by any route of administration, for clozapine-induced tachycardia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently screened and assessed studies for inclusion using pre-specified inclusion criteria.

Main Results

The electronic searches located three references. However, we did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

With no studies meeting the inclusion criteria, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. There are currently insufficient data to confidently inform clinical practice. We cannot, therefore, conclude whether specific interventions, such as beta-blockers, are less effective or more effective than standard courses of alternative treatments for tachycardia. This lack of evidence for the treatment of clozapine-induced tachycardia has implications for research and practice. Well-planned, conducted and reported randomised trials are indicated. One trial is currently underway. Current practice outside of well-designed randomised trials should be clearly justified.

Table 2 Common Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 2% of Trazodone-treated Patients and Greater than the Rate of Placebo-Treated Patients as Observed in Controlled Clinical Studies

Other adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of < 2% with the use of trazodone hydrochloride in the controlled clinical studies: akathisia, allergic reaction, anemia, chest pain, delayed urine flow, early menses, flatulence, hallucinations/delusions, hematuria, hypersalivation, hypomania, impaired memory, impaired speech, impotence, increased appetite, increased libido, increased urinary frequency, missed periods, muscle twitches, numbness, paresthesia, retrograde ejaculation, shortness of breath, and tachycardia/palpitations. Occasional sinus bradycardia has occurred in long-term studies.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trazodone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

Blood and lymphatic system disorders: hemolytic anemia, leukocytosis

Cardiac disorders: cardiospasm, congestive heart failure, conduction block, orthostatic hypotension and syncope, palpitations, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, ventricular ectopic activity, including ventricular tachycardia and QT prolongation. Prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia have been reported at doses of 100 mg per day or less [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Sotalol — role in atrial fibrillation — Sotalol is not effective for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm, but it may be used to prevent AF. Placebo-controlled studies found it safe and effective at doses ranging from 80 to 160 mg twice daily. In the CTAF study, sotalol and propafenone were less effective than amiodarone. In an uncontrolled stepped-care study beginning with propafenone and then sotalol after failure, paroxysmal AF occurred in nearly 50% of patients and only 27% with persistent AF converted to sinus rhythm at 6 mo. In recurrent AF after cardioversion, propafenone was as effective as sotalol in maintaining sinus rhythm 1 y after cardioversion. Sotalol should be avoided in patients with asthma, HF, renal insufficiency, or QT interval prolongation.

Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Maintenance of sinus rhythm post‑cardioversion — In general, antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) are moderately effective in maintenance of sinus rhythm after conversion of AF. Amiodarone is more effective in rhythm control than other AADs, but extracardiac adverse effects may limit its long‑term use. Dronedarone is less effective than amiodarone, but reduces cardiovascular hospitalizations and death in paroxysmal or persistent AF or AFL; however, it has been associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with recently decompensated heart failure. Use patterns show that beta‑blockers, flecainide, propafenone, and amiodarone were most frequently used first‑line for rhythm control, and overall amiodarone was the most commonly used AAD for rhythm control in the EORP Pilot AF general Registry.

These Warnings Stem From In Vitro Data. Are These Data Available?

We are aware of a previous study by Harmer et althat raised concerns at the FDA. While that study has limitations that bring its clinical relevance into question, it is our understanding that it led to a request by the FDA for a subsequent in vitro study from Lamictal's manufacturer, Glaxo Smith-Kline (GSK). As per GSK, that work was completed in 2019 and showed that lamotrigine can weakly inhibit cardiac sodium channels, showing Class IB antiarrhythmic activity. That in vitro information led to the recent US package insert update and warning. The task force has requested the in vitro data from GSK, but to date this has not been provided.

### COR-ART: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study to evaluate single oral doses of vanoxerine for conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter to normal sinus rhythm [^112nhcyG]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) in patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL) is limited principally to direct current cardioversion. The multi-ion channel blocker vanoxerine may prove an effective alternative.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess vanoxerine, a 1,4-dialkylpiperazine derivative, for acute conversion of recent-onset, symptomatic AF and AFL.

Methods

One hundred four subjects with symptomatic AF/AFL for < 7 days were randomized sequentially to single oral doses of vanoxerine 200, 300, and 400 mg or placebo. Holter monitors were examined for conversion to SR and proarrhythmia through ≥ 24 hours.

Results

Conversion to SR was dose related: 18.2%, 44.0%, and 52.0% within 4 hours, and 59.1%, 64.0%, and 84.0% within 24 hours, for the 200-, 300-, and 400-mg groups, respectively. This was significantly higher than placebo for the 300- and 400-mg groups within 4 hours (12.5% for placebo; p = 0.0138 and P = 0.0028, respectively) and for all doses within 24 hours (31.3% for placebo; p = 0.0421, P = 0.0138, P = 0.0001 for 200-, 300-, and 400-mg vanoxerine groups, respectively). Although vanoxerine caused significant dose-dependent QTcF (QT correction by Fridericia) prolongation, monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia did not occur. Adverse events were mild and self-limited, with only the highest dose having a greater frequency than placebo.

Conclusion

Oral vanoxerine converted AF/AFL to SR at a high rate, was well tolerated, and caused no ventricular proarrhythmia.

Conservative and medical treatment — general considerations — reducing the number of medications that cause hypotension can be helpful, provided that it does not worsen conditions such as hypertension and heart failure; several narrative and systematic reviews have evaluated the benefits of lifestyle and medical therapies, and while results have generally been positive in uncontrolled trials and short-term controlled trials, those of long-term, placebo-controlled prospective trials have been less encouraging; furthermore, only the most motivated patients will commit to medical therapy to prevent a handful of yearly syncopal episodes.

### Ivabradine and outcomes in chronic heart failure (SHIFT): a randomised placebo-controlled study [^113KmDpa]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

The study SHIFT was published by Swedberg K and colleagues in 2010 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the SHIFT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of ivabradine on heart-rate reduction in patients with chronic HF? In the SHIFT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SHIFT study, the population was: 6505 patients (1535 female, 4970 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with symptomatic HF and a left-ventricular ejection fraction < 35% who were in sinus rhythm with HR ≥ 70 beats/min and had been admitted to hospital for HF within the previous year. The key exclusion criteria were recent (< 2 months) myocardial infarction, ventricular or atrioventricular pacing operative for ≥ 40% of the day, AF or flutter, and symptomatic hypotension. In the SHIFT study, the interventions were: n = 3241 ivabradine (titrated to a maximum of 7.5 mg BID) n = 3264 placebo (matching placebo BID). In the SHIFT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening HF (24% vs. 29%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.9). In the SHIFT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospital admission for worsening HF (21% vs. 16%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.83) Significant decrease in death due to HF (5% vs. 3%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.94). In the SHIFT study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in serious adverse events (3388 vs. 3847, p = 0.025), symptomatic bradycardia (5% vs. 1%, p < 0.0001), and visual side-effects (3% vs. 1%, p < 0.0001). In the SHIFT study, the conclusion was: in patients with symptomatic HF and a left-ventricular ejection fraction < 35% who were in sinus rhythm with HR ≥ 70 beats/min and had been admitted to hospital for HF within the previous year, ivabradine was superior to placebo with respect to cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening HF.

Sedative-hypnotics and related agents — adverse effects in older adults and dementia: General adversities attributed to sedative-hypnotics include increased risks for falls, headaches, nausea, medication-medication interactions, and drug dependence, with elderly patients at specific high risk. Benzodiazepines are associated with increased confusion, impaired motor performance, anterograde amnesia, daytime sleepiness, and physiologic dependence. Over-the-counter antihistamines have very high rates of side effects, including cognitive impairment, daytime somnolence, and anticholinergic responses. Trazodone is widely used off-label as a hypnotic despite virtually no evidence-based data supporting efficacy with older adults and carries significant risks including priapism, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Off-label neuroleptic use for dementia-related disturbances has a black box warning for increased mortality risks approximately twofold higher than with placebo-treated patients, mostly due to cardiovascular or infectious causes.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — transient/reversible causes and initial management — states that patients presenting with symptomatic SND secondary to a reversible cause should first be managed by directing the therapy at eliminating or mitigating the offending condition (COR I, LOE C-EO). When sinus bradycardia is the consequence of nonessential medications, permanent cardiac pacing should not be considered a first-line treatment, and withdrawal of offending drug or dosage reduction can improve the heart rate and symptoms. Negative chronotropic drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin can decrease the sinus rate, and sodium-channel and potassium-channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs can exacerbate bradycardia in preexisting SND; hypothyroidism can cause clinically significant bradycardia and such cardiovascular abnormalities respond well to replacement therapy with thyroxine (T4), and metabolic abnormalities such as severe systemic acidosis or hypokalemia can uncommonly cause sinus bradycardia in acute settings.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing events, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release form of trazodone. Trazodone should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering trazodone to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including trazodone) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Trazodone prolongs the QT/QTc interval. The use of trazodone should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

7. Drug Interactions

MAOIs

MAOIs should not be used within 14 days of trazodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants

Trazodone may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.

Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors

In vitro drug metabolism studies suggest that there is a potential for drug interactions when trazodone is given with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors. The effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of trazodone (50 mg) has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax of trazodone increased by 34%, the AUC increased 2.4 fold, the half-life increased by 2.2 fold, and the clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were coadministered. It is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole may lead to substantial increases in trazodone plasma concentrations with the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, the risk of cardiac arrhythmia may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

### Dronedarone [^115GtEMk]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is the most effective antiarrhythmic drug for maintaining sinus rhythm for patients with atrial fibrillation. Extra-cardiac side effects have been a limiting factor, especially during chronic use, and may offset its benefits. Dronedarone is a noniodinated benzofuran derivative of amiodarone that has been developed for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Similar to amiodarone, dronedarone is a potent blocker of multiple ion currents, including the rapidly activating delayed-rectifier potassium current, the slowly activating delayed-rectifier potassium current, the inward rectifier potassium current, the acetylcholine activated potassium current, peak sodium current, and L-type calcium current, and exhibits antiadrenergic effects. It has been studied for maintenance of sinus rhythm and control of ventricular response during episodes of atrial fibrillation. Dronedarone reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation, but may be unsafe in those with severe heart failure. This article will review evidence of safety and effectiveness of dronedarone in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Sleep alterations as a function of 88 health indicators [^114zHHf2]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings showed accelerated EEG rhythms, increased REM sleep latency, reduced REM sleep duration/percentage, and increased N2 sleep in participants reporting ongoing treatment with SSRIs. SSRI antidepressants are known for their inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft, thus potentiating the effect of the transmitter on pre- and postsynaptic receptors. Our findings on the acceleration of sleep EEG frequencies in patients treated with SSRIs confirm the excitatory profile of these drugs and cohere with former studies performed on a low number of healthy volunteers. We found that these effects were specific to SSRI treatment, with different patterns emerging for other antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are known for their sedative side effects due to antagonizing muscarinic and histamine receptors, resulting in a different sleep–wake-promoting effect. Trazodone exhibits antagonistic effects on 5-HT2A (serotonergic) receptors, resulting in a wake-inhibiting and slow-wave sleep-promoting effect and a sedative, sleep-inducing profile of this mediation. TCAs and trazodone were not significantly associated with sleep EEG changes, but the former were associated with increased N2 and decreased SWS sleep, while the latter was associated with increased sleep efficiency, SWS, and decreased N1 sleep, in line with clinical experience. A direct comparison of patients undergoing different antidepressive treatment regimens supported that the acceleration of EEG rhythms is specific to SSRIs. However, the fact that the severity of depressive symptoms correlated with sleep alterations in a similar manner as SSRIs even in antidepressant-naïve participants suggests that the separation of the effects of SSRI treatment from that of the underlying illness is a complex issue in an ecologically valid observational study such as ours.

### An unreported side effect of risperidone in children: sinus arrest with long pauses causing syncope [^114rUoj8]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Risperidone has been reported as a well-tolerated antipsychotic in children. The most common side effects of risperidone are anxiety, headaches, insomnia, and agitation, which frequently appear with high doses. Although it is known that risperidone affects the cardiac conduction system, symptomatic bradycardia has not been reported previously in children. We report a child who developed syncope because of sinus arrest with long pauses (> 3 seconds) with therapeutic doses of risperidone. This case suggests that close monitoring is mandatory even during therapeutic treatment with risperidone.

### Anaesthetic and sedative agents used for electrical cardioversion [^1177ivFB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Electrical cardioversion is an effective procedure for restoring normal sinus rhythm in the hearts of patients with irregular heart rhythms. It is important that the patient is not fully conscious during the procedure, as it can be painful and distressing. The drug used to make patients unaware of the procedure should rapidly achieve the desired level of sedation, should wear off quickly and should not cause cardiovascular or respiratory side effects.

Objectives

We aimed to compare the safety, effectiveness and adverse events associated with various anaesthetic or sedative agents used in direct current cardioversion for cardiac arrhythmia in both elective and emergency settings. We sought answers to the following specific questions.• Which drugs deliver the best outcomes for patients undergoing electrical cardioversion?• Does using a particular agent confer advantages or disadvantages?• Is additional analgesic necessary to prevent pain?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) on 27 March 2014. Our search terms were relevant to the review question and were not limited by outcomes. We also carried out searches of clinical trials registers and forward and backward citation tracking.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized and cluster-randomized studies with adult participants undergoing electrical cardioversion procedures in the elective or emergency setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, consulting with a third review author for disagreements. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, including assessment of risk of bias for all studies.

Main Results

We included 23 studies with 1250 participants that compared one drug with one or more other drugs. Of these comparisons, 19 studies compared propofol with another drug. Seven of these compared propofol with etomidate (four of which combined the drugs with remifentanil or fentanyl), five midazolam, six thiopentone and two sevoflurane. Three studies compared etomidate with thiopentone, and three etomidate with midazolam. Two studies compared thiopentone with midazolam, one thiopentone with diazepam and one midazolam with diazepam. Drug doses and the time over which the drugs were given varied between studies. Although all studies were described as randomized, limited information was provided about the methods used for selection and group allocation. A high level of performance bias was observed across studies, as study authors had not attempted to blind the anaesthetist to group allocation. Similarly, study authors had rarely provided sufficient information on whether outcome assessors had been blinded. Included studies presented outcome data for hypotension, apnoea, participant recall, success of cardioversion, minor adverse events of nausea and vomiting, pain at injection site and myoclonus, additional analgesia and participant satisfaction. We did not pool the data from different studies in view of the multiple drug comparisons, differences in definitions and reporting of outcomes, variability of endpoints and high or unclear risk of bias across studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Few studies reported statistically significant results for our relevant outcomes, and most study authors concluded that both, or all, agents compared in individual studies were adequate for cardioversion procedures. It is our opinion that at present, there is no evidence to suggest that current anaesthetic practice for cardioversion should change.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^1154dspQ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

One possible advantage of using antipsychotic medications over other options is that medication such as risperidone or aripiprazole could have a more favourable effect on some of the behavioural symptoms associated with tic disorders and on the common comorbidities such as ASD and OCD. Risperidone, particularly, has proven efficacy in ameliorating aggressive behaviour and therefore in the case of challenging behaviour either linked to autism spectrum disorder or ADHD, risperidone and aripiprazole are likely to have more significant effects on aggression than noradrenergic counterparts. It is worth noting though that noradrenergic options such as clonidine or guanfacine are likely to have much more of an effect on ADHD core symptoms, and noradrenergic drugs are recommended as the first-line option for tic disorders with co-morbid ADHD in the recent European Guidelines.

Risperidone also has a greater affinity for 5-HT receptors and is more likely to augment serotonergic agents in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCSs). Therefore, when a combined Tic and OCS presentation is present and obsessive and/or compulsive symptoms are equally problematic, antipsychotics have often been used alongside SSRI's. This effect has also been shown to be present with aripiprazole, and the partial agonist profile of this medication may point to it being more effective on mood and OCS difficulties. One of the potential side effects of noradrenergic agents is depression.

Typically, antipsychotic medications are also more sedating than noradrenergic alternatives. This might, for example, be beneficial to consider in young people who already using sedating medications such as promethazine.

Of note, noradrenergic agents are contraindicated in individuals who experience severe bradyarrhythmia secondary to second- or third-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome. Antipsychotic medications are not contraindicated in this type of patients, although cardiology opinion would be essential before prescribing antipsychotic medication in this client group. Aripiprazole has the least cardiac side effect profile of the antipsychotic medications especially related to QT prolongation.

### Selection of drugs in pursuit of a rhythm control strategy [^111KZeoc]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A rhythm control strategy based on a combination of antiarrhythmic drugs and electrical cardioversion(s) has emerged as a viable alternative for treatment of atrial fibrillation, particularly when the arrhythmia is associated with symptoms, which may be poorly tolerated, or with congestive heart failure. Several classes of antiarrhythmic drugs are available to restore sinus rhythm by chemical cardioversion and to help maintain it once it has been achieved. In our discussion, we will detail aspects of their efficacy and safety, and attempt to outline a pragmatic clinical approach to their use. Some newer drugs are currently under investigation and hold promise for improved efficacy and/or more favorable side effect profile and will be mentioned in this article.

### Electroconvulsive therapy and cardiovascular complications in patients taking trazodone for insomnia [^116znRY6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Trazodone has been used widely to treat insomnia in depressed patients. When used in combination with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), trazodone has been suspected to cause cardiovascular side effects.

Method

A retrospective study was done of 100 patients who received ECT with concurrent trazodone. One patient was excluded because permission to review the patient's records had not been given. The remaining 99 patients were matched with control ECT patients.

Results

No statistically significant between-group differences were identified in cardiovascular side effects, although a trend toward more orthostatic hypotension was observed in patients taking trazodone.

Conclusion

Administering low-dose trazodone for insomnia in conjunction with ECT does not appear to increase cardiovascular complications. The true incidence of adverse cardiac events was not higher than 3.66% at a 95% confidence level.

### Attaining sinus rhythm mediates improved outcome with early rhythm control therapy of atrial fibrillation: the EAST-AFNET 4 trial [^1146yQC4]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Descriptive statistics of the potential mediators at 12 months by random group; restricted to patients without first primary endpoint and withdrawal of consent before first in-person follow-up visit at 12 months

To determine the effect of these mediators on outcomes, we conducted a landmark analysis evaluating all first primary outcome events after the 12-month visit. Early rhythm control reduced the first primary outcome from 12 months on up to the study end (median follow-up time 4.1 years, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61–0.92; Figure 2). Sinus rhythm at 12 months explained 81% of the treatment effect of ERC therapy compared with usual care during the remainder of follow up. In patients not in sinus rhythm at 12 months, ERC did not reduce further cardiovascular outcomes. Atrial fibrillation recurrence in the first 12 months of follow up only explained 31% of the treatment effect, systolic blood pressure at the 12-month visits only 10% (Table 2). For cardiovascular death and stroke, two key components of the primary outcome, similar effects were observed with larger CI due to smaller event numbers (Table 2). The key mediator 'sinus rhythm at 12 months' was partially correlated with recurrent AF in the first year (Spearman's ρ = 0.59) and in a weaker way with paroxysmal AF (Spearman's ρ = –0.32). As expected, recurrent AF was more common in patients who were not in sinus rhythm at the 12-month visit (Figure 3). None of the other mediators were correlated with sinus rhythm at 12 months (Spearman's ρ = –0.22 to 0.13).

### Cabins, castles, and constant hearts: rhythm control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113aq1gB]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness and safety of antiarrhythmic drug therapy

On average, antiarrhythmic drugs double the proportion of patients who maintain sinus rhythm. Amiodarone is more effective than other antiarrhythmic drugs in maintaining sinus rhythm, and catheter ablation is more effective than antiarrhythmic drugs. The long-term complication rates of antiarrhythmic drug therapy are comparable to complications in patients treated with AF ablation. Although amiodarone has been associated with adverse outcomes in non-randomized analyses of patients at very high risk, the safety of antiarrhythmic drug therapy found in recent randomized trials in patients with AF attenuates historical safety concerns, particularly in patients with heart failure. Unlike earlier trials of antiarrhythmic drugs compared to placebo or rate control therapy (Table 1), antiarrhythmic drug therapy with dronedarone was associated with reduced cardiovascular hospitalizations and cardiovascular deaths compared to placebo. The same substance, dronedarone, used as a rate-controlling agent, was associated with higher rates of heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular death in patients with permanent AF in the PALLAS trial. Patients included in PALLAS were not considered suitable for rhythm control therapy, did not receive interventions to restore sinus rhythm (e.g. cardioversion, AF ablation) and had severe heart failure. Hence, they were deprived of any potential to benefit of sinus rhythm. Patients treated with dronedarone in ATHENA, in contrast, received that therapy to restore sinus rhythm. Taken together, these data may suggest that the beneficial effects found in ATHENA could be associated with its rhythm controlling effect, but more data are needed.

Antiarrhythmic drugs are also effective after AF ablation. Two recent randomized studies (AMIO-CATand POWDER-AF) showed that adding antiarrhythmic drug therapy to AF ablation improves sinus rhythm maintenance for the duration of therapy. This synergistic effect of antiarrhythmic drugs with AF ablation reflects the common (approximately 50% of patients) use of antiarrhythmic drugs 1 year after AF ablation. A substudy within AMIO-CAT measuring brain natriuretic peptide suggested that biomarkers may improve identification of patients at risk for recurrent AF, pointing potentially towards personalized or stratified selection of patients for specific rhythm control therapies.

### Attaining sinus rhythm mediates improved outcome with early rhythm control therapy of atrial fibrillation: the EAST-AFNET 4 trial [^112afZND]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Sinus rhythm at 12 months explains most of the effect of early rhythm control

Our main modelling analysis demonstrates that the presence of sinus rhythm at 12 months, the first follow-up interval with rhythm assessment in all patients, explains 81% of the outcome reduction achieved with ERC. This is an important mechanistic confirmation of the initial hypothesis of EAST-AFNET 4: restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm is the predominant effect of the ERC strategy in EAST-AFNET 4. Earlier trials comparing rate control only to rhythm control limited to antiarrhythmic drug therapy and cardioversion did not show reduced outcomes in patients randomized to rhythm control therapy. However, a modelling analysis of the AFFIRM data set also suggested that successful maintenance of sinus rhythm was associated with improved survival. The practice of stopping oral anticoagulation after apparently successful restoration of sinus rhythm may have led to worse outcomes in patients randomized to rhythm control therapy in AFFIRM. This factor was irrelevant in the present trial, as over 90% of all patients were on continued oral anticoagulation, irrespective of their rhythm status. A similar association of presence of sinus rhythm with better outcomes compared with patients who remained in AF was observed in the AF substudy of the DIAMOND trial. These prior analyses are in line with our analysis and underline the outstanding role of sinus rhythm for prognosis in AF patients. As a snapshot, the 12-month ECG follow up, even though it only provides a very crude estimate of AF burden and recurrent AF, identified patients in whom ERC therapy was not successful. These patients did not show reduced primary outcome events in our landmark analysis (Figure 3). Atrial fibrillation recurrence during the first year of follow up explained a smaller portion of the therapy effect. Broadly speaking, patients with recurrent AF are either patients in whom another attempt at rhythm control is successful (leading to sinus rhythm at 12 months), or patients in whom rhythm control remains futile (resulting in AF at 12 months). The former group is likely to see the beneficial effects of ERC, the latter probably not. This consideration can explain the weaker effect of recurrent AF on cardiovascular outcomes compared with attaining sinus rhythm at 12 months.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^113yYnec]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on previous studies that indicate a relationship between decreased SWS, cognitive deficits, and amyloid- β pathology as revealed through molecular PET even in cognitively non-impaired individuals, we included a CN group in addition to the two patient groups. Longitudinal trazodone use was associated with delayed cognitive decline across diagnostic groups in our study, supporting its possible utility as a treatment from cognitively non-impaired to mildly-impaired patients. None of our patients had moderate or severe dementia to allow for inferences of trazodone use on more advanced disease.

Trazodone group comparative delay in cognitive decline persisted when accounting for concomitant use of medications that modulate brain rhythms, such as stimulants and sedatives, which may signify trazodone's contribution to sleep-wake and ultradian rhythm consolidation toward delayed cognitive decline. However, when specifically accounting for ChEi use, trazodone users did not significantly benefit in delayed cognitive decline compared to non-users. This particular finding does not fully detract from our hypothesis that trazodone use may delay cognitive decline, considering that there may be 1) decreased statistical power when accounting for ChEi, 2) common mechanistic effects on sleep-wake rhythm consolidation between trazodone and ChEi, or 3) ceiling effects on cognitive outcomes for ChEi users. Specifically, ChEi users benefit from improved attention and alertness through enhancement of cholinergic transmission and may thus perform at ceiling throughout the follow-up period. Indeed, the observed rate of decline in MMSE for all non-users when accounting for ChEi use was slower than anticipated, at 0.60 points per year (Table 2), compared to the one-point decline per year observed in longitudinal trials on ChEi use in mild AD. Furthermore, for 25–40% of patients with mild to moderate AD who suffer from excessive daytime somnolence, daytime administration of ChEi can help consolidate sleep-wake rhythms by directly promoting daytime wakefulness. In turn, direct wakefulness consolidation indirectly enhances subsequent SWS, and may thus facilitate the hypothesized mechanism for trazodone's benefits. Even if ChEi have shared effects with trazodone toward delaying cognitive decline, trazodone has certain additional useful clinical qualities. In addition to directly improving sleep consolidation, the current results indicate a potential cognitive benefit for patients with MCI that is not verified in ChEi trials, where benefits are more definitively shown for mild to moderate AD. Whether trazodone's beneficial effects are indeed mediated through neuroprotection, however, remains to be clarified. Additionally, trazodone does not have the prevalent side effects of ChEi, such as insomnia, diarrhea, or bradycardia, making it even more favorable for patients who also do not tolerate ChEi.

### QT prolongation and delayed atrioventricular conduction caused by acute ingestion of trazodone [^116qguzT]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Trazodone possesses minimal anticholinergic properties and, therefore, is generally regarded as having less cardiotoxic potential than other antidepressants. This report describes a young woman who developed significant QT prolongation and delayed atrioventricular nodal conduction after acute trazodone overdose. The case adds to the existing literature because it has a number of strengths, namely that confounding drugs and alcohol were lacking, trazodone exposure was confirmed by drug assay, and early presentation to hospital gave a valuable opportunity to study the time-course of the cardiac effects. This case reminds us to consider the possibility of cardiotoxic effects after trazodone overdose, even in young patients with no established cardiovascular disease.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing reports, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release trazodone hydrochloride tablets. RALDESY should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. RALDESY is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering RALDESY to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including RALDESY) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Trazodone hydrochloride prolongs the QT/QTcinterval. The use of RALDESY Should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.
