## Question

What is the immature gran absolute value indicate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the immature granulocyte (IG) absolute value indicates. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly is being measured and how it is reported. Then, I should verify the normal reference ranges across populations. Next, I will interpret what an elevated IG absolute value means pathophysiologically. After that, I should review the clinical contexts where IG is most informative, including infection, sepsis, ischemia, and hematologic disease. Finally, I will consider limitations, confounders, and how to integrate IG with other labs and clinical data before concluding with practical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and measurement. Immature granulocytes are myeloid precursors — promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes — that are not normally present in peripheral blood in significant numbers; modern hematology analyzers can quantify them as an absolute count (cells per microliter) and as a percentage of total leukocytes, which is how the "absolute IG" value appears on reports [^a011463a] [^aa47e194].

> I need to check reference ranges because interpretation hinges on context. In healthy adults, the 95th percentile for absolute IG is around 60 µL−1, and many laboratories use an upper limit of normal near 0.03–0.07 × 10^9/L (30–70/µL). In children ≤ 10 years, the 95th percentile is about 30 µL−1, so pediatric thresholds are lower. In term newborns at 24 hours, the normal range is much higher, roughly 80–1700/µL, reflecting developmental hematopoiesis. I should double-check that these ranges align with instrument-specific validation and population data, which they do across outpatient, pediatric, and neonatal cohorts [^c56956ca] [^d3f6507f] [^df4a7657].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. An elevated absolute IG signals increased myelopoiesis and premature release from the marrow, i.e., a left shift. Mechanistically, inflammatory cytokines (G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6) drive emergency granulopoiesis and mobilize less mature forms into circulation, which is why IG rises before total leukocytosis in many acute states. I should confirm that this temporal relationship is supported, and yes, multiple studies describe IG appearing earlier than WBC or neutrophil rises in infection and inflammation [^d3fbfa7f] [^8010f9d9] [^4e3a39d4].

> Next, I should review where IG adds the most clinical value. In sepsis and severe infection, IG correlates with disease severity and can outperform WBC or ANC in some contexts; for example, in ICU cohorts, band forms were more prevalent in definite sepsis than in noninfectious SIRS, and higher myelocyte/metamyelocyte levels tracked with worse outcomes. In treatment monitoring, rising IG on day 3 of antibiotics has been associated with inadequate therapy and higher mortality, suggesting IG can help flag nonresponse. But wait, I should verify that these findings are not universal; indeed, sensitivity varies and IG should augment, not replace, clinical judgment and cultures [^2666e520] [^9a991724] [^c57ab310].

> I will now examine noninfectious inflammatory and ischemic conditions. Elevated IG has been reported in acute pancreatitis, correlating with severity, and in complicated appendicitis and diverticulitis, where IG count has shown strong discrimination for complications. Intriguingly, IG rises early in intestinal ischemia/strangulation — within hours in some series — offering a potential early signal before imaging changes, though I need to emphasize that these are retrospective and should be validated prospectively [^c413185c] [^69dc59e8] [^cc7d4d41].

> But wait, what if the IG elevation reflects hematologic disease rather than a reactive process. In myeloproliferative neoplasms and leukemoid reactions, increased IG reflects abnormal myelopoiesis; distinguishing reactive from clonal requires smear review, blast enumeration, and, when indicated, bone marrow and molecular testing. I should confirm that guidelines endorse integrating IG with morphology and ancillary studies, which they do for suspected myeloid neoplasms [^2580cc30] [^9d476827].

> I need to ensure I address limitations and confounders. Automated IG counts are generally reproducible but can be biased upward versus manual differentials, and instrument flags may prompt unnecessary slide reviews. Pregnancy, corticosteroids, and G-CSF can elevate IG, and in neonates, IG and the I/T ratio have limited sensitivity for sepsis, so normal or mildly elevated values do not exclude infection. Conversely, extreme IG elevations are uncommon and, when present, should heighten concern for severe infection or marrow stress [^afdd109c] [^c56956ca] [^d3152601].

> Let me consider how to integrate IG with other data. IG performs best when interpreted alongside clinical assessment, cultures, and complementary biomarkers such as CRP and procalcitonin. In some studies, combining IG with ANC or using derived indices like the I/T ratio improves diagnostic performance, and serial IG trends can be more informative than a single value. I should double-check that this integrated approach is consistent with sepsis and neonatal literature, which it is [^e095a6cf] [^1dec6b01] [^9a991724].

> In practical terms, I should confirm what to do when the absolute IG is high. First, verify the result with a manual differential if the clinical context is discordant. Second, correlate with symptoms, fever, hemodynamics, and localizing signs. Third, assess for infection sources and obtain cultures as indicated. Fourth, consider noninfectious causes such as ischemia, pancreatitis, or drug effects. Fifth, if unexplained or persistent, evaluate for hematologic disorders with smear, bone marrow, and molecular testing. And sixth, if monitoring sepsis treatment, a rising IG on day 3 warrants reassessment of antibiotics and source control [^2580cc30] [^9a991724].

> To synthesize, the absolute immature granulocyte value quantifies circulating myeloid precursors and, when elevated, indicates a left shift reflecting increased marrow output in response to inflammatory, infectious, ischemic, or clonal stimuli. It is an early, inexpensive, and context-sensitive marker that can refine suspicion for infection or complications, but it lacks standalone diagnostic specificity and should be interpreted with clinical judgment and other laboratory findings [^d3fbfa7f] [^2666e520] [^c56956ca].

---

The absolute immature granulocyte (IG) count reflects the number of **immature neutrophils** (myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes) in circulation, typically representing a **left shift** due to marrow stress from infection, inflammation, or marrow disorders [^4e3a39d4]. Normal adult levels are **≤ 0.03 × 10⁹/L**; elevations suggest bacterial infection, sepsis, or inflammatory states, and higher counts correlate with severity and mortality risk [^9a991724] [^c413185c]. IG counts are **not specific** and can rise with corticosteroids, G-CSF, or hematologic malignancies, so results should be interpreted in clinical context and alongside other labs [^c56956ca] [^2580cc30].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Immature granulocytes are **precursors of neutrophils** — myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and promyelocytes — normally confined to the bone marrow; their presence in blood indicates a left shift [^4e3a39d4]. The absolute IG count quantifies these cells per liter and signals **marrow stress** from infection, inflammation, or marrow disorders [^d3fbfa7f].

---

## Normal reference ranges

Reference ranges vary by age and method; typical adult reference intervals include:

| **Population** | **Absolute ig count** | **Reference** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults (> 10 years) | ≤ 0.03 × 10⁹/L (≤ 30/µL) | Manufacturer reference [^eabd848c] |
| Children (≤ 10 years) | ≤ 0.03 × 10⁹/L (≤ 30/µL) | Manufacturer reference [^eabd848c] |
| Neonates (24 hours) | 0.08–1.7 × 10⁹/L (80–1700/µL) | Prospective study [^d3f6507f] |

---

Elevations above these limits indicate a **left shift** and warrant clinical evaluation [^c56956ca].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with elevated absolute immature granulocyte count

Several **conditions** are linked to elevated IG counts:

- **Infection and sepsis**: Common causes of IG elevation, reflecting marrow stress and left shift; IG counts correlate with severity and mortality in sepsis [^9a991724] [^c413185c].
- **Inflammatory conditions**: Rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other chronic inflammatory states can elevate IG counts [^notfound].
- **Hematologic malignancies**: Leukemias (e.g. CML, AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes often show elevated IG counts due to abnormal myelopoiesis [^2580cc30].
- **Drug-induced myeloid stimulation**: Corticosteroids and G-CSF can increase IG counts by stimulating marrow release [^c56956ca].
- **Ischemic conditions**: Early intestinal ischemia and strangulated obstruction can cause rapid IG elevation, sometimes before leukocytosis [^66064a06].

---

## Diagnostic and prognostic utility

IG counts have **diagnostic and prognostic value**:

- **Early infection detection**: IG counts can rise before total WBC, aiding early recognition of infection or sepsis [^d3fbfa7f] [^8010f9d9].
- **Severity assessment**: Higher IG counts correlate with disease severity and mortality in sepsis, pancreatitis, and ischemic conditions [^9a991724] [^c413185c] [^cc7d4d41].
- **Treatment monitoring**: Serial IG counts can help assess response to therapy in sepsis and other inflammatory conditions [^9a991724] [^c57ab310].

---

## Limitations and considerations

IG counts have **limitations**:

- **Lack of specificity**: Elevations are not specific to infection and can occur in inflammation, ischemia, and marrow disorders [^c56956ca] [^2580cc30].
- **Variability**: Automated IG counts may differ from manual differentials; results should be interpreted cautiously [^afdd109c] [^a011463a].
- **Clinical context**: Always interpret IG counts alongside clinical findings, other labs (WBC, CRP, PCT), and smear review when indicated [^2580cc30] [^e095a6cf].

---

## Clinical approach to elevated absolute immature granulocyte count

When IG counts are elevated, a **structured approach** is advised:

- **Confirm result**: Repeat CBC with differential or manual smear to verify IG presence and morphology [^2580cc30].
- **Assess clinical context**: Evaluate for infection, inflammation, ischemia, or marrow disorders [^c56956ca].
- **Order additional tests**: CRP, PCT, cultures, or bone marrow studies as indicated [^4c5e59ce].
- **Monitor trends**: Serial IG counts can inform response to therapy and disease course [^9a991724].

---

The absolute immature granulocyte count quantifies circulating myeloid precursors and signals a **left shift** from marrow stress; it is a useful, early marker of infection, inflammation, or marrow disorders, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and alongside other tests.

### Age-dependent reference ranges for automated assessment of immature granulocytes and clinical significance in an outpatient setting [^c56956ca]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

New generations of hematology analyzers have made the routine automated quantification of immature granulocytes (IGs) in peripheral blood samples accessible as a powerful clinical parameter.

Objective

The use of IGs has previously been studied mostly in hospitalized patients with sepsis. We investigated the use of IGs in the outpatient setting. Establishment of precise normal outpatient IG reference ranges is a prerequisite for clinically meaningful interpretation of the parameter.

Design

We analyzed a large outpatient population comprising more than 2400 samples to determine age-stratified normal reference ranges for IGs.

Results

Using nonparametric statistical approaches, we show that 1-tailed 95th percentile estimates for relative and absolute IG concentrations up to the age of 10 years are 0.30% and 30.0 µL(-1), respectively. For individuals above the age of 10 years, the respective 95th percentile estimates are approximately twice as large at 0.74% and 60.0 µL(-1). No differences were seen between male and female reference ranges. Taking nonparametric 90% confidence intervals for each estimate into account, we recommend the following IG upper reference range limits for routine outpatient use: 0.30%/40.0 µL(-1) (≤ 10 years) and 0.90%/70.0 µL(-1) (> 10 years). Up to the age of 10 years, the most common pathologies associated with elevated IG counts in outpatients were infections, in particular, otitis media, upper and lower respiratory infections, and gastroenteritis. By contrast, above the age of 10 years, the most common causes were hematologic malignancies, drug therapy (glucocorticoids, chemotherapy), severe infections, and pregnancy (young females).

Conclusions

The use of appropriate reference ranges makes IGs a powerful hematologic parameter for outpatient care that is associated with differential diagnoses that are distinctly characteristic of that setting.

### Role of immature granulocytes in monitoring sepsis treatment [^602b511c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is an organ dysfunction characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection(s). Although its associated mortality rate is high, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can improve outcomes. Diagnosis is made according to the Sepsis-3 criteria. Although biomarkers, such as procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin (IL)-6, are helpful for diagnosis, they are relatively expensive tests and not always available. When necessary, fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, source control, oxygenation, and early empirical antibiotic therapy are the main approaches to sepsis management. Excessive or incorrect use of empirical antibiotics, however, should be considered in terms of treatment optimization and the development of antibiotic resistance.

Immature granulocytes (IGs) are a subset of neutrophils (metamyelocytes, myelocytes, and promyelocytes), and are produced in the bone marrow prompted by stimuli such as inflammation or infection. IGs are less mature cells than band cells and are usually present at lower levels. The ability to automatically determine percentage of IGs using modern analyzers enables faster and more precise measurement of left shift. Although many studies have been performed to determine the optimal cut-off value, there is no clear consensus.

As such, this study aimed to determine the role of IG% in predicting the response to microbiological treatment(s) for sepsis.

### The diagnostic and prognostic significance of monitoring blood levels of immature neutrophils in patients with systemic inflammation [^b882bb47]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

It is of interest that one of the criteria for SIRS involves the appearance in the circulation of immature neutrophils, whose mature forms are essential for the elimination of foreign bacteria but whose untoward activities could lead to organ failure. The appearance of band cells in the blood of patients with bacterial infections is commonly referred to as 'a shift to the left'. Because SIRS is often initiated by infections, 90% of which are bacterial in origin, there is the question whether, in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, elevated levels of circulating band cells are associated predominantly with N-I SIRS or with sepsis. We therefore investigated the relative merits of the WBC criteria of Bone et al. and of Levy et al. in identifying patients with SIRS and whether monitoring levels of all forms of immature neutrophils could help in differentiating patients with N-I SIRS from those with sepsis. It was recently shown in patients with septic shock that increased mortality was related to WBC counts and that in patients with sepsis an increase in the number of immature neutrophils reflected disease severity and predicted patient deterioration. On this basis, we also examined whether levels of immature neutrophils had a bearing on patient outcome.

Key messages

Increased prevalence of band cells in the circulation is mainly a feature of sepsis rather than N-I SIRS.
High blood levels of myelocytes and metamyelocytes may be indicative of poor patient outcome.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^2580cc30]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

Introduction

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) identifies patients who are at high risk of developing organ failure. It is initiated by infections (sepsis) and by non-infectious (N-I) stimuli that include trauma, stress, cardiopulmonary bypass and pancreatitis. In 1992, a consensus conference led by Bone and colleagues defined patients with SIRS as satisfying two of the four following conditions: temperature > 38°C or < 36°C, heart rate > 90 beats/min, respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min and a white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 × 10 9 /L or < 4 × 10 9 L or > 10% immature (band) forms of neutrophils in the circulation. In a later conference, chaired by Levy et al. these four criteria were included in the diagnostic criteria for sepsis as it was proposed that, although the SIRS concept was valid, it was considered to have limited diagnostic application. Moreover, in this modified format, the identification of > 10% immature neutrophils was now restricted to just a normal WBC count without reference to band cells. No explanation was provided for the exclusion of patients with abnormal WBC counts, and the omission of band cells may have been made in the belief that other immature neutrophils are contributing to this diagnostic criterion. To appreciate the latter consideration, it is necessary to recall the various forms of immature neutrophils that appear during granulopoiesis in the bone marrow. A 7-day mitotic stage (myeloblast → promyelocyte → myelocyte) is followed by a 7-day maturation stage (myelocyte → metamyelocyte → band cell → mature segmented neutrophil), whereupon mature neutrophils are held in storage pools before their entry into the circulation. Factors controlling the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow are outlined in several informative reviews. To date, most reports of circulating immature neutrophils in SIRS refer to band cells, the direct precursors of mature neutrophils, with limited reference to other myeloid progenitors, such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes.

Discussion

Identifying abnormal numbers of WBCs or increased levels of circulating immature neutrophils is one of the four established criteria for diagnosing N-I SIRS or SIRS with infection (sepsis). Initially, Bone and colleagues proposed that elevated levels of immature neutrophils (band cells) be defined as > 10% of WBCs, which was later modified by Levy et al. to > 10% immature neutrophils but with a normal WBC count. In the present investigation, we noted that increased levels of circulating band cells were more prevalent in patients with sepsis than in patients with N-I SIRS, an observation that was apparent when we applied the criterion of Bone et al. but not when we used that of Levy et al. Thus, with respect to WBCs and sepsis, we propose that the Bone et al. criterion provides more diagnostic information than that of Levy et al. Although the occasional appearance of myelocytes and metamyelocytes had no bearing on the differentiation of the various patient groups, an increased prevalence of these cells in the circulation was associated with poor patient outcome.

An important aspect of the present study is that an experienced haematologist, who was blinded to the clinical details of the patients, identified immature neutrophils in peripheral blood smears by their characteristic morphology. Using only one haematologist eliminates interobserver variations that may arise in cytological interpretations and in the staining methods that are important for the recognition of neutrophil progenitors and their discrimination from one another. Differences in procedures used to identify immature neutrophils could explain why some investigators propose that the increased levels they observed in the circulation are an indication or prediction of bacterial infections, whereas others suggest that these levels have limited diagnostic application.

Our present study differs from earlier investigations in two respects. First, blood samples were obtained from unselected patients within 48 hours of entry into the ICU, and all forms of immature neutrophils were included in the assessment of neutrophil progenitors. Second, the patients were retrospectively categorized by two independent consultants into those with and those without SIRS, and they were further differentiated into those with definite sepsis, possible sepsis or N-I SIRS. The important distinction between definite and possible sepsis reflects the fact that ≥ 30% of patients in the ICU with infections do not have positive microbiological test results and that experienced clinicians may disagree on whether the patient is truly infected or merely colonised. It is therefore of interest that the prevalence of band cells, which was very high in patients with definite sepsis, was also increased in the possible sepsis group compared with patients with N-I SIRS.

### The diagnostic and prognostic significance of monitoring blood levels of immature neutrophils in patients with systemic inflammation [^458495fc]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Distribution of immature neutrophils in the blood of patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome

The prevalence of immature neutrophils in the circulation of 136 patients admitted to the ICU is presented in two formats: the first complies with the proposal of Bone et al. in which immature neutrophils (band cells) comprise > 10% of the granulocyte population, and the second is in accord with the recommendation of Levy et al. which also states that immature neutrophils constitute > 10% of blood granulocytes, but in patients with normal WBC counts.

Table 3 shows that, with the Bone et al. criterion, the incidence of immature neutrophils was increased in patients with SIRS (mean = 66%) compared with critically ill patients with no evidence of SIRS (mean = 29%; P < 0.01) and with healthy control subjects (0%). The increase in immature cells was due to the increased levels of band cells. The patients with SIRS were further categorized into those with definite sepsis, possible sepsis and N-I SIRS (see Material and Methods). The prevalence of band cells was higher in patients with definite sepsis (mean = 82%) than in the group with possible sepsis (mean = 63%; P < 0.05) and in the N-I SIRS group (mean = 39%; P < 0.001). The incidence of band cells in patients with N-I SIRS did not differ from that of patients with no SIRS. These findings suggest that the entry of band cells into the circulation may be a particular feature of sepsis. Myelocytes and metamyelocytes were present in a small number of patients with SIRS, but including these cells in the analysis did not modify the results.

### Immature granulocyte measurement using the sysmex XE-2100. relationship to infection and sepsis [^0b6fc9d6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

We determined the usefulness of immature granulocyte measurement as a predictor of infection or positive blood culture and compared the results with total WBC count and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Blood samples from 102 infected and 69 noninfected patients were analyzed using the Sysmex XE-2100 automated blood cell counter (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The percentage of immature granulocytes was significantly higher in infected than in noninfected patients and in patients with positive than patients with negative blood cultures. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the percentage of immature granulocytes was a better predictor of infection than the WBC count and comparable to the ANC. Automated immature granulocyte measurements reflect a biologically and clinically relevant phenomenon but are not sensitive enough to be used as screening assays for prediction of infection or bacteremia. However, although infrequently encountered, a percentage of immature granulocytes of more than 3 was a very specific predictor of sepsis and might help expedite microbiologic laboratory evaluation of a subset of patients.

### The diagnostic and prognostic significance of monitoring blood levels of immature neutrophils in patients with systemic inflammation [^5259686a]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Because immature neutrophils, by definition, are not fully functional, their increased prevalence in the circulation of patients with sepsis might be expected to impede bacterial elimination. This may not be the case, however. The function of myeloid progenitors within the bone marrow improves during differentiation, such that the activities of band cells may be similar to those of mature neutrophils. Indeed, in patients with sepsis who have both granulocytosis and increased levels of immature neutrophils, the overall phagocytic function of neutrophils is comparable to that of healthy control subjects.

An interesting and unexpected finding of our study was the relationship between the percentage of myelocytes and metamyelocytes and the time to patient death. Such an association was not seen with band cells, which is in agreement with an earlier observation that levels of band cells do not predict patient mortality; however, it is not in accord with a report that band cells, identified by the phenotypes CD10 dim and CD16 dim, predict sepsis deterioration. An increase in the percentage of immature neutrophils, other than band cells, has been reported to discriminate complicated from uncomplicated sepsis, although researchers in another study claimed that these cells predict infection. In both of these investigations, researchers employed an automated procedure to identify immature neutrophils. In the present study, we found that the prevalence of myelocytes and metamyelocytes identified by their distinct morphologies did not differentiate patients with sepsis from those with N-I SIRS. In health, myelocytes and metamyelocytes appear rarely in the circulation, but they are present in neonates with sepsis. It is possible that, in SIRS, raised levels of myelocytes and metamyelocytes not only may serve as surrogate markers of poor outcome but also may directly participate in the initiation of organ failure. Immature neutrophils possess membranes that are more rigid than that of segmented neutrophils, and this difference in cellular rheology could account for the accumulation of immature neutrophils in the pulmonary microvasculature upon release from the bone marrow. Prolonged interactions with vascular endothelium could initiate occlusions, hypoxia and hypoperfusion, and, in children with Gram-negative bacteraemia, elevated numbers of circulating immature neutrophils could be inducing microvascular obstruction. In patients with septic shock, it was recently shown that those patients whose neutrophil numbers were below the upper limit of normal values died earlier than those with higher numbers of neutrophils. We found no association between the number of neutrophils and the time to patient death. However, it is conceivable that the early onset of death in the septic shock study was influenced by the increased prevalence of myelocytes and metamyelocytes, but their distribution in the circulation was not investigated.

### Utility of immature granulocyte percentage in pediatric appendicitis [^a4636bcb]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal surgery in children. Adjuncts are used to help clinicians predict acute or perforated appendicitis, which may affect treatment decisions. Automated hematologic analyzers can perform more accurate automated differentials including immature granulocyte percentages (IG%). Elevated IG% has demonstrated improved accuracy for predicting sepsis in the neonatal population than traditional immature-to-total neutrophil count ratios. We intended to assess the additional discriminatory ability of IG% to traditionally assessed parameters in the differentiation between acute and perforated appendicitis.

Materials and Methods

We identified all patients with appendicitis from July 2012-June 2013 by International Classification of Diseases-9 code. Charts were reviewed for relevant demographic, clinical, and outcome data, which were compared between acute and perforated appendicitis groups using Fisher exact and t-tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. We used an adjusted logistic regression model using clinical laboratory values to predict the odds of perforated appendicitis.

Results

A total of 251 patients were included in the analysis. Those with perforated appendicitis had a higher white blood cell count (P = 0.0063), C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.0001), and IG% (P = 0.0299). In the adjusted model, only elevated CRP (odds ratio 3.46, 95% confidence interval 1.40–8.54) and presence of left shift (odds ratio 2.66, 95% confidence interval 1.09–6.46) were significant predictors of perforated appendicitis. The c-statistic of the final model was 0.70, suggesting fair discriminatory ability in predicting perforated appendicitis.

Conclusions

IG% did not provide any additional benefit to elevated CRP and presence of left shift in the differentiation between acute and perforated appendicitis.

The number of patients with malignancy was higher in group 2 (P = 0.01), as was the number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation support (P = 0.003). However, no significant differences were found between the groups in terms of other comorbidities and sex. The 28-day intensive care unit (P = 0.049) and hospital (P = 0.008) mortality rates were higher in group 2 (Table 3).

### Manual differential cell counts help predict bacterial infection. A multivariate analysis [^e095a6cf]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We developed logistic regression models that combine information from the automated CBC and manual 100-cell differential counts to predict bacterial infection. The logistic models were fitted from a case group of 116 patients with proven bacterial infection and a control group of 930 presumably uninfected outpatients. A 4-variable, 15-parameter model, which includes automated absolute neutrophil, manual band, and manual immature granulocyte counts, performed best with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area of 89%. A more practical 2-variable model including automated absolute neutrophil and manual band counts performed almost as well with an ROC curve area of 86%. The automated neutrophil count-only model is less informative with an ROC curve area of 78%. The combined information from automated and manual differential cell counts more accurately predicts bacterial infection than automated counting alone. Despite these modest improvements, the high cost of manual differential cell counts dictates careful patient selection. The supplemental information gained from manual differential counts is most useful for patients with low to normal neutrophil counts (8,000/microL [8.0 x 10(9)/L] or less). Further studies are indicated to determine the characteristic patient populations deriving maximal benefit from this information.

### The white blood cell count in fevers of unknown origin… [^3bd0adfd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A study of 200 fevers of unknown origin in nonhospitalized children showed that the value of the white blood cell and differential counts as predictors of cause is limited. In various viral infections, high neutrophil counts, even with numerous immature forms, were seen. An absolute neutrophil count below 5, 000, however, was strong evidence against a bacterial cause.

According to Andersson, in general population, appendicitis is likely when two or more inflammatory variables are increased and unlikely when all are normal. Furthermore, Yu et al. found that procalcitonin has great diagnostic value in identifying complicated appendicitis (AUC value 0.94).

However, according to some studies, laboratory tests have no sufficient diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients. On the contrary, other studies showed as leukocyte response is not affected by age, and a significantly greater proportion of older patients had a raised white cell count compared with younger patients.

In a series of 83 consecutive elderly patients operated on for a clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis, although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, unelevated values excluded it with a 100% negative predictive value.

According to some studies, a high CRP value in elderly patients with acute appendicitis, could be a suspect index for the existence of a perforation (AUC 0.811 with the cut-off of 101.9 mg/l). Shin et al. showed, as the delta neutrophil index, that measures of the fraction of immature granulocytes in the circulation is the only independent marker that can significantly predict the presence of perforation in multiple regressions in elderly patients.

Statement 3. We recommend against basing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients only on elevated leukocytes count and CRP value. It should prompt adequate diagnostic course (Strong recommendation, low quality evidence).
4 What is the optimum pathway for imaging in elderly patients with suspected acute appendicitis? CT or US or both?

### Performance of an automated immature granulocyte count as a predictor of neonatal sepsis [^758a8d9b]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Neonatologists use immature granulocytes (IG) in manual differential counts as an indicator of sepsis. This study was designed to compare the predictive ability of automated vs manual IG counts for neonatal sepsis. Infants undergoing sepsis evaluation were identified prospectively for study if a CBC count was obtained in temporal proximity to the blood culture. Automated IG counts were obtained from the research software of the Sysmex XE-2100 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). Manual average IG counts were obtained from two 100-cell manual differential counts independently performed by a technologist and a hematopathology resident. A comparative analysis of manual and automated IG counts showed considerable overlap of ranges. The highest positive blood culture rate occurred in the nonneutropenic preterm subset of infant older than 7 days (21/55 [38%]). For these infants, elevated IG counts by manual and automated methods were associated significantly with positive blood culture results (odds ratio, manual, 3.74; odds ratio, automated, 3.63), albeit with low sensitivity.

### The diagnostic and prognostic significance of monitoring blood levels of immature neutrophils in patients with systemic inflammation [^2666e520]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In this cohort study, we investigated whether monitoring blood levels of immature neutrophils (myelocytes, metamyelocytes and band cells) differentiated patients with sepsis from those with the non-infectious (N-I) systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). We also ascertained if the appearance of circulating immature neutrophils was related to adverse outcome.

Methods

Blood samples were routinely taken from 136 critically ill patients within 48 hours of ICU entry and from 20 healthy control subjects. Clinical and laboratory staff were blinded to each other's results, and patients were retrospectively characterised into those with SIRS (n = 122) and those without SIRS (n = 14). The patients with SIRS were further subdivided into categories of definite sepsis (n = 51), possible sepsis (n = 32) and N-I SIRS (n = 39). Two established criteria were used for monitoring immature white blood cells (WBCs): one where band cells > 10% WBCs and the other where > 10% of all forms of immature neutrophils were included but with a normal WBC count. Immature neutrophils in blood smears were identified according to nuclear morphology and cytoplasmic staining.

Results

With the first criterion, band cells were present in most patients with SIRS (mean = 66%) when compared with no SIRS (mean = 29%; P < 0.01) and with healthy subjects (0%). The prevalence of band cells was higher in definite sepsis (mean = 82%) than in patients with possible sepsis (mean = 63%; P < 0.05) or with N-I SIRS (mean = 39%; P < 0.001), and they had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 71% for the detection of definite sepsis. With the second criterion (that is, patients with normal WBC counts), we noted that immature neutrophils did not differentiate any of the patient groups from one another. Patients who died within 1 week of blood sample provision had higher levels of myelocytes and metamyelocytes (median = 9%; P < 0.05) than patients who died at 2 to 4 weeks (median = 0.5%).

Conclusions

Raised blood levels of band cells have diagnostic significance for sepsis, provided that measurements are not confined to patients with normal WBC counts, whereas an increased prevalence of myelocytes and metamyelocytes may have prognostic application.

### Role of immature granulocytes in monitoring sepsis treatment [^9a991724]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is an organ dysfunction that impairs response to infection. Inflammatory biomarkers have been used to diagnose and monitor sepsis. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of immature granulocytes (IGs) in monitoring sepsis treatment.

Methods

This two-center, prospective, observational study included patients diagnosed with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 criteria, who were followed-up in the adult intensive care units of the Bolu Izzet Baysal State Hospital and Bolu Izzet Baysal Training and Research Hospital (Bolu Merkez/Bolu, Türkiye). Laboratory investigation results, demographic information, treatment responses, and mortality were recorded. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to treatment: appropriate (group 1); and inappropriate (group 2). Differences in the number of IGs and IG% were compared. Differences with P < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant for all analyses.

Results

The study included 87 patients from 2 centers. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (54%) and 28-day mortality (37.9%). Empirical antibiotic therapy (43.7%) was appropriate for 38 patients (group 1) and 49 patients when the treatment was incorrect or inadequate (group 2). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of laboratory investigation results on the day of treatment initiation. IG count and IG% on day 3 of treatment were significantly higher in group 2. Mortality was higher in patients with a high IG count (IG %) and in group 2.

Conclusion

IG% was a simple, inexpensive, and useful test for monitoring sepsis treatment and, in addition, IG count was also effective in predicting mortality.

### How to approach neutropenia [^de67e2d9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is defined as the reduction in the absolute number of neutrophils in the blood circulation. Acute neutropenia is a relatively frequent finding, whereas disorders of production of neutrophils are quite rare. Acute neutropenia is often well tolerated and normalizes rapidly. Neutropenia arising as a result of underlying hematologic disorders is far more significant. Such a patient may be at risk for infectious complications and will likely require a thorough investigation. Acute neutropenia evolves over a few days and occurs when neutrophil use is rapid and production is impaired. Chronic neutropenia may last for 3 months or longer and is a result of reduced production, increased destruction, or excessive splenic sequestration of neutrophils. Neutropenia may be classified by whether it arises secondarily to causes extrinsic to BM myeloid cells, which is common; as an acquired disorder of myeloid progenitor cells, which is less frequent; or as an intrinsic defect arising from impaired proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells in the BM, which is rare. Severe neutropenia with absolute neutrophil counts below 500/μL increases susceptibility to bacterial or fungal infections. Multiple disorders of severe congenital neutropenia have been found by the discovery of genetic defects affecting differentiation, adhesion, and apoptosis of neutrophil precursors. Elucidation of the multiple genetic defects have provided insight into the biology of the cell involving membrane structures, secretory vesicles, mitochondrial metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, and cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as the risk for myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia.

### Role of immature granulocytes in monitoring sepsis treatment [^a1bebd5f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In reviewing the literature, IG% and IG counts have been investigated in terms of diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. However, it attracted our attention that the power of this hemogram parameter, which is inexpensive, easy to measure and useful, in monitoring the response to treatment has not been investigated. Our results encouraged us to investigate their roles in treatment monitoring. We believe that IG% and IG count, which are inexpensive and useful parameters, may be effective at follow-up, although further studies are required.

In group 2, the 28-day and hospital mortality rates were significantly higher. Again, when we compared patients who were discharged with those who were deceased, mortality was higher in the group in which antibiotics were changed; more specifically, in which treatment was inadequate. In this context, we agree that antibiotic treatment and follow-up are especially important for sepsis. The IG% and the number of IGs were higher on the day of treatment initiation and on day 3. Similar to most studies, we believe that IG% and IG counts are effective predictors of mortality.

Our study had several limitations. First, although this was a two-center study, the sample size was relatively small. The treatment of sepsis is a multidisciplinary approach, and we may not have standardized fluid therapy, doses of inotropes and vasoactive agents, corticosteroid support, mechanical ventilation modes and pressures, or nutritional status.

In conclusion, patients treated for sepsis either recover or die. In situations in which antibiotic therapy, fluid therapy, and vasoactive agent support are involved, we believe that IG% and IG count are inexpensive, and useful hemogram parameters for monitoring the bacteriological treatment of sepsis. IG% may be a potential follow-up marker; however, it should be assessed alongside other clinical parameters in the decision-making process. We believe that additional studies should be performed to fill this knowledge gap in the literature.

### Granulocyte abundance and maturation state at diagnosis predicts treatment-free remission in CML [^01673ef1]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to overproduction of granulocytes, we found evidence that patients maintaining TFR showed a predominance of mature over immature granulocytes. Non-relapsing patients were characterized with neutrophils that demonstrated more variation in nuclear segmentation and shift towards nuclear hypersegmentation, indicating more mature neutrophils. In contrast, relapsed patients harbored more promyelocytes with elliptic nuclei and metamyelocytes with rounder nuclei. Cytomorphological examination of promyelocytes did not demonstrate clear signs of maturation based on the cell size or cytoplasm. However, increased ellipticity may indicate a shift toward myelocytes with more banded nuclei.

We also found that morphological changes were associated with cell proportions. Higher promyelocyte nuclei ellipticity was associated with elevated promyelocytes and could reflect a shift in proliferation or maturation. Neutrophil and metamyelocyte morphology were associated with metamyelocyte proportion. This could be explained with the left shift phenomenon where maturing metamyelocytes and band neutrophils become enriched in clinical conditions associated with reactive neutrophilia. Analogical to this, round-shaped nuclei in metamyelocytes could reflect similar phenomenon of metamyelocytes from myelocytes.

### Delta neutrophil index as an early predictor of acute appendicitis and acute complicated appendicitis in adults [^01487d1f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring urgent surgical intervention in an emergency department (ED). Increasing time periods between symptom onset and surgical treatment is a risk factor for a ruptured appendix. Successful treatment depends on early diagnosis and prompt intervention.

Several blood tests are used to aid diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Approximately 80% of patients are known to have leukocytosis in acute appendicitis. However, an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count has a low predictive value because the WBC is also elevated in up to 70% of patients with other causes of right lower abdominal quadrant pain. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are common in acute appendicitis, but studies disagree on its sensitivity and specificity. A more recently suggested laboratory evaluation is the determination of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios. However, their sensitivity and specificity is not more sensitive or specific than that of the WBC or CRP.

Immature granulocytes are an indicator of increased myeloid cell production and are known to increase in infectious or inflammation conditions. The delta neutrophil index (DNI) measures the fraction of immature granulocytes in the circulation and has recently been introduced as a new inflammatory marker. The DNI is assessed by an automated blood cell analyzer, and tests required for the DNI can be performed simultaneously with the routine complete blood count (CBC) testing. Recent studies have examined its ability to predict infectious conditions. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of the DNI as an early predictor of acute appendicitis and acute complicated appendicitis in adults.

### The diagnostic and prognostic significance of monitoring blood levels of immature neutrophils in patients with systemic inflammation [^b13e606a]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Material and methods

Patients and controls

Blood samples, obtained from 136 consecutive patients within 48 hours of entry into the adult ICU, were examined by light microscopy for the distribution of immature neutrophils. Samples were acquired every weekday for 8 weeks. Later, the patients were retrospectively and independently categorised by two ICU consultants (MSH and DFT), who were unaware of the immature neutrophil data, into those with SIRS (n = 122) and those without SIRS (n = 14). Patients were defined as having SIRS if they satisfied at least two of the recognised criteria, but without reference to the number or distribution of WBCs. We undertook this omission because, in the Levy definition, > 10% immature neutrophils were recorded in patients with a normal WBC count, and, if we had used a neutrophilia or a neutropenia as one of the features of SIRS, then a potentially important subgroup of patients (that is, those with normal WBC counts) would have been removed from the study. The patients with SIRS were further differentiated into three groups: (1) 51 patients with definite sepsis (either microbiological documentation of an infective organism or where both consultants had a very strong clinical suspicion of infection in the absence of positive microbiology), (2) 32 patients with possible sepsis (no relevant confirmatory microbiology, but where one of the consultants had a strong clinical suspicion) and (3) 39 patients with N-I SIRS (neither clear microbiological evidence nor any clinical suspicion of infection).

### The early biomarker of immature granulocyte count in predicting right-side colonic complicated acute diverticulitis: a retrospective cohort study [^bf381c2d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated IG count was determined to be superior diagnostic biomarker for complicated diverticulitis in early stage. When cut-off value was 0.10, it showed an optimal sensitivity of 80.60% and specificity of 100.00%. The significance of IG count comes to the fore, while more clinical studies are needed to further verified in future.

### Role of immature granulocytes in monitoring sepsis treatment [^e8128264]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Biomarkers are useful to diagnose, monitor treatment response, and predict prognosis of sepsis or suspected sepsis. Biomarkers must be highly specific, sensitive, reproducible and cost effective. Many biomarkers have been investigated for their role in differentiating conditions such as infection, trauma, surgery, malignancy, and ischemia. The IG count and IG% have recently been investigated for their roles in reflecting infection status.

Yazla et al. found that IG count and IG% were significant biomarkers for predicting the diagnosis of complicated acute appendicitis in patients undergoing surgery for acute appendicitis. In a similar study, Durak et al. reported that IG count was an effective biomarker for predicting mesenteric ischemia and intestinal necrosis in patients undergoing laparotomy. Porizka et al. reported that IG% could be used to differentiate between infective and non-infective systemic inflammatory response syndromes (i.e.".SIRS") in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Jeon et al. evaluated the IG% to be moderately effective in predicting sepsis in patients with burns and recommended it as an auxiliary test due to its cost and ease of routine use. They reported that IGs were effective markers for differentiating bacterial pneumonia in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (i.e. "SARS-CoV-2") infection.

### Elevated levels of neutrophils with a pro-inflammatory profile in Turner syndrome across karyotypes [^627feb5c]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the last decade the significant role of neutrophils contributing to chronic inflammation in metabolic diseases has been highlighted, actively supporting inflammation by the release of serine proteases and formation of NETs. Our investigation into neutrophils, lymphocytes and NLR in TS unveils heightened neutrophil levels and an elevated NLR, indicating a chronic low-inflammatory state in individuals with TS. We verified increased granulocyte and neutrophil levels in 3 cohorts using 3 different methodologies. In the "genomic cohort" granulocytes and neutrophil levels were estimated from DNAm data from whole blood. Here, we showed that neutrophils, not basophils or eosinophil, were responsible for the increased levels of granulocytes. In the "flow cytometry cohort" granulocyte levels were quantified using flow cytometry and granulocyte levels in TS individuals were positively correlated to increased abdominal fat mass. In the "outpatient cohort" absolute neutrophil counts were quantified as part of standard follow-up visits. The slight, non-significant increase in neutrophils with age, alongside no observed difference between KS and TS in age-related increase, indicates that while age may impact neutrophil levels, the effect is not different between these two conditions. However, the observation that adults with TS have higher neutrophil levels than those with KS, with a fixed age difference, and that TS individuals have higher neutrophil levels than KS after adjusting for age, particularly in childhood, suggests a distinct neutrophil profile only present in TS individuals. Thus, neutrophils and low-grade inflammation may not play the same role in KS. This profile may be an intrinsic aspect of TS pathology, not merely a consequence of aging or secondary health conditions. The neutrophil trends in TS individuals diagnosed with autoimmune diseases are particularly interesting. The increase in neutrophil counts leading up to an autoimmune disease diagnosis and the subsequent decline post-diagnosis, possibly because of treatment initiation, suggests a potential predictive value of neutrophil monitoring. Considering these findings, the elevated neutrophil counts in TS raise questions about the mechanisms driving this increase. Is this a direct result of genetic abnormalities in TS, or does it reflect a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and immune factors? Here, we show a strong correlation between neutrophil counts and TBL1X expression, particularly its inverse relation with the number of sex chromosomes. This highlights a potential genetic basis for the elevated neutrophil levels and low-grade inflammation in TS, where TBL1X may play a key role in neutrophil counts, and thus, modulating immune responses. The link between TBL1X and NF-kappa B signaling, especially its role in enhancing p65 transcriptional activity in response to inflammatory stimuli like TNF-alpha, could provide a molecular context for TBL1X involvement in inflammatory processes, including recruitment and activation of neutrophils. Moreover, studies have shown that neutrophils, and especially NE, have a significant role in the development of vascular inflammation, aortic aneurysm, and thoracic aortic dissection. In one study, TBL1X was identified as a downstream target of NE, implicating it in vascular pathologies, while inhibiting TBL1X impacted NE-driven signaling pathways, decreasing inflammatory cell migration and risk of aortic dissection.

### Interrogating the sepsis host immune response using cytomics [^4e3a39d4]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Historical focus on immature granulocytes in sepsis

Long before the molecular era of medicine, hematopathologists had described the association between numeric and morphologic changes in peripheral blood leukocytes and severe infections across the age spectrum. Elevated peripheral white blood cells and a shift to more immature neutrophils or "bands" were codified as part of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, although with acknowledgement that SIRS could occur due to both infectious and non-infectious causes and that sepsis can occur in the absence of SIRS. As early as the 1970s, investigators had demonstrated that hospitalized patients with infection, both pediatric and adult, were more likely to have immature neutrophils, toxic granulation within neutrophils, and vacuolization of neutrophil cytoplasm on blood smear review. Furthermore, when tested ex vivo, neutrophils from subjects with such morphological changes were more likely to have delayed bacterial killing and higher proportion of neutrophils with visible intracellular bacteria, linking altered leukocyte morphology to impaired pathogen response. Along with the discovery of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that were highly expressed in the circulation of septic patients, a paradigm emerged that posited that sepsis represented unrivaled and uncontrolled inflammation.

With the rapid advances of flow cytometric techniques, applications to the granulocyte fraction highlighted the shift to more immature neutrophil forms and significant heterogeneity among circulating leukocytes in sepsis. Neutrophils from hospitalized patients with sepsis were more likely to have reduced CD10 and CD16 expression compared to either uninfected outpatients or to patients with community-acquired infection but without SIRS, and the manual band count was correlated with CD10 dim CD16 dim neutrophils. The antigen CD10 is not restricted to granulocytes — indeed, it is also known as acute lymphoblastic lymphoma antigen — but neutrophils express this antigen only in the latest stages of differentiation. In addition, low or absent CD10 expression was shown to discriminate immature neutrophils in a study of donors treated with exogenous granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), the growth factor most known for stimulating neutrophil production from the bone marrow. In contrast to mature CD10 + neutrophils, CD10 − neutrophils exhibited immunostimulatory effects on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, enhancing T cell proliferation, survival, and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) production. Neutrophils with CD10 dim CD16 dim expression persisted at 3 and 8 days after the onset of septic shock and non-survivors had a higher proportion of these cells compared to septic shock survivors. In addition, neutrophils from patients with septic shock manifested altered function, with lower intracellular myeloperoxidase and lactoferrin expression, reduced chemotaxis, and impaired phagocytosis, suggesting that immune dysregulation in sepsis involves both immune stimulation and defective immune functions.

### Role of immature granulocytes in monitoring sepsis treatment [^c57ab310]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study conducted in a non-septic intensive care unit, blood tests were performed for 7 days, and the IG count and IG% were found to have high sensitivity and specificity in the early recognition of sepsis. In a similar study, IG% was defined as a useful and effective marker of the development of infections and septic shock. Ayres et al. found that a low IG% demonstrated high specificity in excluding sepsis and reported that it was a useful additional marker. In a study comparing blood culture-positive groups, IG% was found to be effective for the early detection of bacteremia. Although the IG count and IG% have supported the diagnosis of sepsis in previous studies, there has been heterogeneity in some results.

The half-life of IGs is 3 h, and the capacity of this marker to better reflect the state of inflammation compared with other markers with long half-lives is remarkable. In our study, blood samples collected on the day of the empirical treatment were analyzed. There was no significant difference in PCT and CRP levels between the groups in which empirical treatment was appropriate and a response to treatment was obtained (i.e.g.roup 1) and the group in which empirical treatment was inadequate (i.e.g.roup 2). Again, there was no significant difference in IG% on the day of treatment initiation in either group. In blood samples obtained on day 3 of empirical treatment, IG% was significantly higher in the group in which antibiotics were added due to inadequate empirical treatment or antibiotic therapy was changed according to the culture results. When we compared IG% on day 3 with IG% on the day of treatment initiation, this ratio was significantly higher in the inadequate treatment group (group 2) than in the adequate treatment group (group 1). When we analyzed the number of IGs, the mean number of IGs decreased on day 3 in the adequate treatment group, whereas the mean number of IGs increased in the inadequate treatment group.

### Immature granulocyte: an early predictor of strangulated adhesive small bowel obstruction [^4d038718]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Equally important, IG count is also less cost of money and time and more easy to obtain than CT and other blood markers. IG count is one common parameter of complete blood count with a lower detection cost of less than $ 2.8, which has a higher cost advantage than 128 CT scan with a cost of $ 98.58 in China. It greatly reduces the financial burden of patients and medical insurance expenditure. Furthermore, the majority of clinical studies also have focused on building clinical prediction models of intestinal strangulation, which has poor clinical applicability. Owing to its multiple evaluation parameters, which require a lot of time to detect, collect, and analyze variables. Undoubtedly, it takes more time to obtain than IG count.

As we seen, IG count had a high predictive value and specificity for ultra-early stage(< 6 h) of intestinal ischemia and strangulation, providing a faster bedside assessment tool than CT. Previously in 2024, our group explored the clinical predictive value of IG count for right-sided complicated acute diverticulitis (cAD), while this study about strangulated adhesive SBO, may break new ground by demonstrating predictive value of IG count for surgical acute ischemic disease, thereby paving the way for its broader clinical application. In the study of infectious diseases, such as sepsis, acute appendicitis, and pancreatitis, an elevated IG count reflected the compensatory response of the bone marrow to bacterial infection and correlated positively with pathogen load. In contrast, in our study of intestinal ischemia and strangulation in adhesive SBO, elevated IG count was the result of tissue hypoxia directly activating the bone marrow granulocyte pool significantly earlier than the secondary infection stage. This findings broke through the limitations of traditional views of IG count as an infection marker. Moreover, the early identification of strangulation in adhesive SBO hold significant clinical value, especially within 6 h from onset time to hospital, more importantly, by enabling timely surgical intervention to rescue ischemic bowel and save lives, which differently from by only mitigating the risk of antibiotic misuse in cAD. Surprisingly, this study showed that sensitivity of IG count for predicting bowel strangulation at an early stage (< 6 h) was as high as 89.50%, even higher than in cAD with a sensitivity of 80.60%. Of course, the prerequisite of IG count for predicting severity of the primary disease must be based on the disease's type, and then can build a rigorous clinical hierarchical evaluation system of severity in future.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^03a32378]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

It should be noted that some studies demonstrated no significant correlation between persistent lymphopenia and the incidence of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients. Conversely, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio and the IL-10-to-lymphocyte count ratio offer a more reliable reflection of the severity of sepsis. Additionally, investigations into subpopulations of lymphocytes have furnished valuable insights, wherein specific subsets of T and B lymphocytes displayed variations associated with the gravity of sepsis. For instance, CD3 + T lymphocyte counts manifested a decreasing trend in patients with early clinical deterioration (0.5 × 10^9/L ± 0.5 versus 0.7 × 10^9/L ± 0.5, p = 0.06). Although changes in B cells were not as pronounced as those in T cells, there was a significant reduction in CD19 + CD23 + B cells at admission in septic shock patients, followed by a marked augmentation in survivors, implying these cells potentially harbor significant prognostic value.

Impact on mortality

Numerous studies have affirmed a significant correlation between the degree of lymphopenia within 28 days and the incidence of hospital-acquired infections and mortality. There is a link between the failure to normalize lymphocyte levels post-trauma and higher mortality. In parallel, a sustained decline in lymphocyte levels after sepsis diagnosis, mainly due to T-cell reduction, is associated with increased mortality. In septic patients, a notable reduction in γδ T-cell numbers in the intestinal mucosa compared to healthy controls is linked to increased disease severity and higher mortality rates. A recent study revealed that children with severe sepsis and persistent lymphopenia face higher risks of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome or death in pediatric intensive care units, with the lymphopenia persisting as a composite outcome odds ratio of 2.98 (95% CI [1.85–4.02]; p < 0.01). Specific research further delineates that a severe T-cell reduction can only serve as a prognostic marker for immune suppression when accompanied by a high proportion of circulating immature granulocytes, attributable to the enhanced T-cell apoptosis mediated by MDSC present in immature granulocytes.

### Uncommon phenotypes of-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [^4efe3258]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

BCR::ABL1 -positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) presents with a typical phenotype in over 95% of cases. These phenotypical cases are associated with a p210 oncoprotein (M- bcr genotype). In these cases, the consideration of CML is high on the list of differential diagnoses and appropriate genetic studies to confirm the BCR::ABL1 oncogene are de rigueur. The elevated white cell count, dominant granulocytes, myeloid immaturity and the absent to low blast concentration in the blood, the mild anemia, the normal platelet count or mild thrombocytosis and the frequency of basophilia usually point to the tentative diagnosis of CML or CML is included in the differential diagnosis without ambiguity. In a very small fraction of cases, the diagnosis of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML is less evident. These syndromes include (i) BCR::ABL1 -positive thrombocythemia, (ii) so-called neutrophilic BCR::ABL1 -positive CML and (iii) the m- bcr (p190 BCR-ABL1) variant of CML, often with an absolute and relative monocytosis. In these uncommon forms, there are often misleading blood cell counts. An interesting biological feature is the striking predominance of females in these three atypical presentations. In the fourth variant, (iv) eosinophilic predominant CML, the five reported cases have all been in males. We also consider the very rare phenomenon of (v) smoldering CML (synonyms pre-CML and aleukemic CML), which also has a female predominance. The misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of these atypical syndromes is consequential because of the beneficial response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in affected patients.

### The early biomarker of immature granulocyte count in predicting right-side colonic complicated acute diverticulitis: a retrospective cohort study [^8010f9d9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Compared to inflammatory biomarkers, such as WBC, NEU and PLT, IG count has own unique advantages. As we all know, the increase of IG count in peripheral blood indicates activation of bone marrow. It can be generally detected preceding leukocytosis in peripheral blood in response to infection and inflammation. In a series of clinical studies, IG count was considered as an early and effective biomarker in determining the severity of inflammatory events, such as acute appendicitis, acute pancreatitis and sepsis. Our study also supposed that IG count had the predictive value of Rt-side colonic complicated diverticulitis. In addition to preventing deferment of complications, its time of testing process and report out of IG count was shorter than of some biochemistry parameters, such as C-reactive protein(CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), even if they had the certain values in discriminating complicated from uncomplicated diverticulitis. And the additional costs of CRP and PCT also required attention. Similarly to IG count, MDW was a relatively early marker in predicting complicated diverticulitis, as Chang et al.(2023) found. Unfortunately, MDW had the smaller AUC of 0.870 and lower specificity of 80.6% than IG count, and it suggested that the left-side colonic complicated diverticulitis was the risk factor, which differed from our objective locating in Rt-side colon.

SII was another elevated parameter in cAD. SII was calculated as the neutrophil counts (× 10⁹ /L) multiplied by the platelet counts (× 10⁹ /L) and divided by the lymphocyte counts (× 10⁹ /L). As a combinated parameter of estimating the inflammatory severity of diseases, it can easily form consensus and avoid the limitations of single indicators, whatever WBC or CRP. As previous study reported, SII was considered as an effective marker for predicting prognosis of colorectal cancer and identifying severe acute pancreatitis. However, few study was about the efficacy of the SII in detecting acute complicated diverticulitis. Our study demonstrated that if value of SII was greater than 1521.24(× 10⁹ /L)(cut-off value) in patients with Rt-side colonic diverticulitis, it indicted as the complicated diverticulitis. So IG count maybe serve as an useful supplement to single role of neutrophil count and platelet count.

### Defining normal healthy term newborn automated hematologic reference intervals at 24 hours of life [^d3f6507f]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

Automated analyzers have advanced the field of clinical hematology, mandating updated complete blood count (CBC) reference intervals (RIs) to be clinically useful. Contemporary newborn CBC RI publications are mostly retrospective, which some authors have cited as one of their cardinal limitations and recommended future prospective studies.

Objective —

To prospectively establish accurate hematologic RIs for normal healthy term newborns at 24 hours of life given the limitations of the current medical literature.

Design —

This prospective study was conducted at an academic tertiary care center, and hematology samples were collected from 120 participants deemed to be normal healthy term newborns. Distributions were assessed for normality and tested for outliers. Reference intervals were values between the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile.

Results —

The novel RIs obtained for this study population are as follows: absolute immature granulocyte count, 80/μL to 1700/μL; immature granulocyte percentage, 0.6% to 6.1%; reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent, 31.7 to 38.4 pg; immature reticulocyte fraction, 35.9% to 52.8%; immature platelet count, 4.73 × 103/μL to 19.72 × 103/μL; and immature platelet fraction, 1.7% to 9.8%.

Conclusions —

This prospective study has defined hematologic RIs for this newborn population, including new advanced clinical parameters from the Sysmex XN-1000 Automated Hematology Analyzer. These RIs are proposed as the new standard and can serve as a strong foundation for continued research to further explore their value in diagnosing and managing morbidities such as sepsis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

### Uncommon phenotypes of-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [^a8d8d835]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

BCR::ABL1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) presents with a typical phenotype in over 95 percent of cases. These are associated with a p210kDa oncoprotein (M-bcr genotype). In these cases, the consideration of CML is high on the differential diagnosis list and appropriate genetic studies to confirm the BCR::ABL1 oncogene are de rigueur. The elevated white cell count, dominant granulocytes, myeloid immaturity and the absent to low blast concentration in the blood, the mild anemia, the normal platelet count or mild thrombocytosis and the frequency of basophilia usually point to the tentative diagnosis of CML or CML is included in the differential diagnosis without ambiguity. In a very small fraction of cases, the diagnosis of BCR::ABL1-positive CML is less evident. These syndromes include (i) BCR::ABL1-positive thrombocythemia, (ii) so-called neutrophilic BCR::ABL1-positive CML and (iii) the m-bcr (p190BCR-ABL1) variant of CML, often with an absolute and relative monocytosis. In these uncommon forms, there are often misleading blood cell counts. An interesting biological feature is the striking predominance of females in these three atypical presentations. In the fourth variant, (iv) eosinophilic predominant CML, the five reported cases have all been in males. We also consider the very rare phenomenon of (v) smoldering CML (syn. pre-CML or aleukemic CML), which also has a female predominance. The misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of these atypical syndromes is consequential because of the beneficial response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in these patients.

### Combining immature and total neutrophil counts to predict early onset sepsis in term and late preterm newborns: use of the I / T2 [^1dec6b01]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The absolute neutrophil count and the immature/total neutrophil ratio (I/T) provide information about the risk of early onset sepsis in newborns. However, it is not clear how to combine their potentially overlapping information into a single likelihood ratio.

Methods

We obtained electronic records of blood cultures and of complete blood counts with manual differentials drawn < 1 hour apart on 66,846 infants ≥ 34 weeks gestation and < 72 hours of age born at Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Brigham and Women's Hospitals. We hypothesized that dividing the immature neutrophil count (I) by the total neutrophil count (T) squared (I/T) would provide a useful summary of the risk of infection. We evaluated the ability of the I/T to discriminate newborns with pathogenic bacteremia from other newborns tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c).

Results

Discrimination of the I/T (c = 0.79; 95% confidence interval: 0.76–0.82) was similar to that of logistic models with indicator variables for each of 24 combinations of the absolute neutrophil count and the proportion of immature neutrophils (c = 0.80, 95% confidence interval: 0.77–0.83). Discrimination of the I/T improved with age, from 0.70 at < 1 hour to 0.87 at ≥ 4 hours. However, 60% of I/T had likelihood ratios of 0.44–1.3, thus only minimally altering the pretest odds of disease.

Conclusions

Calculating the I/T could enhance prediction of early onset sepsis, but the complete blood counts will remain helpful mainly when done at > 4 hours of age and when the pretest probability of infection is close to the treatment threshold.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to consider suggesting primary (clonal/neoplastic) eosinophilia, generally indicated by an absolute eosinophil count ≥ 1.5×10⁹/L, if one or more of the following are present:

- elevated serum tryptase level

- abnormal T-cell population

- increased blasts, dysplasia, cytogenetic or molecular abnormality, and/or bone marrow fibrosis

- splenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy.

### Neutrophil dysfunction, immature granulocytes, and cell-free DNA are early biomarkers of sepsis in burn-injured patients: a prospective observational cohort study [^35d5c61b]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to measure neutrophil function longitudinally following burn injury and to examine the relationship between neutrophil dysfunction and sepsis.

Background

Sepsis prevalence and its associated mortality is high following burn injury, and sepsis diagnosis is complicated by the ongoing inflammatory response. Previous studies have suggested that neutrophil dysfunction may underlie high infection rates and sepsis postburn; however, neutrophil dysfunction has not been thoroughly characterized over time in burns patients.

Methods

Neutrophil phagocytosis, oxidative burst capacity, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) generation (NETosis) were measured from 1 day to up to 1 year postburn injury in 63 patients with major burns (≥ 15% total body surface area). In addition, immature granulocyte (IG) count, plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and plasma citrullinated histone H3 (Cit H3) levels were measured.

Results

Neutrophil function was reduced for 28 days postburn injury and to a greater degree in patients who developed sepsis, which was also characterized by elevated IG counts. Plasma cfDNA and Cit-H3, a specific marker of NETosis, were elevated during septic episodes. The combination of neutrophil phagocytic capacity, plasma cfDNA levels, and IG count at day 1 postinjury gave good discriminatory power for the identification of septic patients.

Conclusion

Neutrophil function, IG count, and plasma cfDNA levels show potential as biomarkers for the prediction/early diagnosis of sepsis postburn injury and neutrophil dysfunction may actively contribute to the development of sepsis. Targeting neutrophil dysfunction and IG release may be a viable therapeutic intervention to help reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections and sepsis postburn.

### The early biomarker of immature granulocyte count in predicting right-side colonic complicated acute diverticulitis: a retrospective cohort study [^566fd2ac]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the currently first clinical retrospective study to evaluate the accuracy of IG count in predicting Rt-side colonic complicated acute diverticulitis. It concluded that the high level of IG count, WBC and BMI were the independent risk factors. And IG count had been identified as the largest AUC of 0.93 with the optimal sensitivity(80.60%) and specificity (100.00%).

In brief, IG count can be considered as an novel alternative to identify Rt-side colonic complicated diverticulitis and guide the clinical treatment decision. A meta-analysis of S Hajibandeh et.al enrolled nine studies of 2933 patients and suggested that the risk of complicated diverticulitis in the Rt-side colon was lower than in left-side colon(OR 0.21 (0.08, 0.55), P = 0.001). Thus the antibiotic utilization rate should be lower in Rt-side colonic cAD, at least theoretically, the antibiotic usage was even in no sense in most cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis. In reality, antibiotic abuse still faces significant challenges in worldwide. Surprisingly, IG count can be a promising alternative biomarker to decide antibiotic treatment selectively rather than routinely. Furthermore, compared to patients suffering simple AD, the high mortality of patients with complicated AD still continuously puzzled the clinical surgeons. The early predictor of IG count, larger than 0.10 × 10⁹ /L, can be a warning signal of complicated AD to warn surgeons for surgical intervene as soon as possible. Of course, beyond all doubt, abdominal CT scan is the most effective option for diagnosing complicated acute diverticulitis. Nonetheless, the presents of imaging(such as micro-perforates, small abscesses)were latter than the increase of inflammatory cells in CBC tests. Additionally, the high expenditure of $ 98.58 at 128 CT scan increased the financial burden compared to CBC cost of $ 4.23. CT scan was also limited in certain population and circumstances, such as pregnant women, children, as well as the area of lacking imaging equipment. Considering these dilemma, it is possible to be identified as complementary option to early identifying complicated diverticulitis.

### Immature granulocyte fraction in the peripheral blood is a practical indicator for mobilization of CD34 (+) cells [^47a69002]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

We propose a simple parameter that improves prediction of the number of CD34(+) cells in blood cells collected by apheresis for autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation following administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The percentage of immature granulocytes including myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes (LSI for left-shift index) immediately prior to the start of each apheresis correlated with the number of CD34(+) cells in PBSC collections (r = 0.79, P < 0.0001, Y = 0.227X - 0.99, R(2) = 0.623) much better than did the white blood cell count (r = 0.07), currently the most commonly used predictor in deciding the initiation of apheresis. We then used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine a cutoff point for LSI to prevent unnecessary apheresis. At LSI > 7.5, sensitivity and specificity of cutoff points in the probability of obtaining > 1.0 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg BW were 93.3% and 94.3% (95% CI, 91.4–100.0%), respectively. When LSI reaches 15.25, nearly 100% of apheresis will attain the target CD34(+) cell dose. These findings indicate that LSI is a useful and simple method for predicting the yield of CD34(+) cells before the start of PBSC collection and avoiding unnecessary apheresis.

### Delta neutrophil index (DNI) as a potential biomarker for fetal growth restriction: insights from maternal hematological changes and neonatal outcomes [^22d0e8af]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fetal growth is the combination of complex interactions between the genetic growth potential of the fetus and the intrauterine environment of the mother. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is diagnosed when the fetal weight estimated by ultrasound is below the 10th percentile of gestational age. Impaired fetal growth not only presents a high risk of short-term complications, including low birth weight, the need for neonatal intensive care and perinatal death, but also significantly increases the likelihood of long-term consequences, such as obesity, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The causes of FGR are generally classified as maternal, fetal or placental factors. Although some causes and risk factors for FGR are well-documented — such as chromosomal abnormalities (5–20%), maternal and fetal vascular issues, and infections (5–20%) — in 40–50% of cases, a specific cause remains unidentified.

The Delta Neutrophil Index (DNI) is a parameter that reflects the proportion of immature granulocytes (IGs) in the blood circulation. These IGs, which include myelocytes, promyelocytes, and metamyelocytes, serve as precursors to neutrophils and are typically not present in circulating blood under normal conditions. Elevated levels of IGs in peripheral blood have been associated with conditions such as rhinosinusitis, sepsis, acute appendicitis, pyelonephritis, pancreatitis, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. DNI is associated with inflammation because the production of immature neutrophils is accelerated during inflammatory conditions, leading to their rapid release from the bone marrow into the peripheral circulation, which increases DNI. Neutrophils have also been recognized as crucial players in chronic inflammation, consistently being recruited to sites of chronic inflammation, where they activate other immune cells, release serine proteases, and form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). An increase in DNI is observed in both acute and chronic conditions characterized by increased neutrophil production. Modern automated hematology analyzers have made it easier to assess IG counts and percentages (IG%) in complete blood counts, providing a convenient method to evaluate bone marrow function.

### Role of immature granulocytes in monitoring sepsis treatment [^eebf91cd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The main aim of this study was to determine the role of IG% in predicting the response to antibiotic therapy in patients diagnosed with sepsis. When patients are diagnosed with sepsis, empirical antibiotic treatment is often initiated. If blood culture growth and antibiogram results are compatible with the antibiotherapy administered to the patient, empirical antibiotherapy is continued; if not, either the treatment strategy is altered or antibiotics are added to the regimen. Failure to improve hemodynamic and clinical deterioration or regression of inflammatory biomarkers requires a change in empirical antibiotherapy or switch to broad spectrum agents. Using defined variables, patients in whom empirical antibiotherapy was continued as "continuation of current treatment" were allocated to group 1, while those in whom antibiotics were changed or added 3–6 days after empirical treatment were allocated to the "group requiring treatment change" (group 2). Values measured on day 3 were used to predict treatment response. In the authors' hospitals, culture sample results are reported on day 6 at the latest. IG and IG% were measured on the day empirical antibiotic therapy was started and on day 3 of treatment using an automated hematology analyzer (XN1000, Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan). IG% measured on day 3 was compared with that measured on the day of treatment initiation (IG% day 3/IG% day 1). In addition, IG% ratios were compared between the 2 groups.

An a priori power analysis was performed using G*Power 3.1.9.7 to determine the required sample size for comparing IG% between two independent groups. Based on the effect size (Cohen's d = 0.7) estimated from the study by Porizka et al(7). with a two-tailed alpha of 0.05 and power set at 0.90, the minimum required sample size was calculated as 38 participants per group (total n = 76).

### Use of the complete blood cell count in early-onset neonatal sepsis [^d3152601]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Early-onset sepsis (EOS) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates, and its diagnosis remains challenging. The complete blood cell count and differential have been previously evaluated as diagnostic tools for EOS in small, single-center reports. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the complete blood cell count and differential in EOS in a large, multicenter population of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.

Methods

Using a cohort of 166,092 neonates with suspected EOS with cultures admitted to 293 neonatal intensive care units, we calculated odds ratios and receiver operating characteristic curves for complete blood cell count indices and prediction of a positive culture. We determined sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios for various commonly used cutoff values from the complete blood cell count.

Results

Low white blood cell counts, low absolute neutrophil counts and high immature-to-total neutrophil ratios were associated with increasing odds of infection (highest odds ratios: 5.38, 6.84 and 7.97, respectively). Specificity and negative predictive values were high (73.7%-99.9% and > 99.8%). However, sensitivities were low (0.3%-54.5%) for all complete blood cell count indices analyzed.

Conclusion

Low white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count and high immature-to-total neutrophil ratio were associated with increasing odds of infection, but no complete blood cell count-derived index possesses the sensitivity to rule out reliably EOS in neonates.

### The early biomarker of immature granulocyte count in predicting right-side colonic complicated acute diverticulitis: a retrospective cohort study [^d19892d9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colonic acute diverticulitis(AD) is characterized by an acute inflammation in weak site of the bowel wall and micro-perforation of diverticulum. Its prevalence appears to be generally higher in the left colon in Western countries. Conversely, in Asia, it predominantly occurs in right-side(Rt-side) colon with 38–75%, which extremely easily confused with acute appendicitis in the General surgery departments. Of those who had Rt-side colonic acute diverticulitis, approximately 12–15% suffered one or more associated complications of bowel obstruction, stricture, abscess, fistula, or perforation. They are usually defined as complicated acute diverticulitis(cAD), even though its incidence was lower than among left-side colonic AD, reported by a meta-analysis. Low clinical suspicion about cAD leads to persistently high mortality rate of up to 5% due to severe complications over the past decades, which can be improved by early and timely surgical intervention. Meanwhile, it was equally important for reducing the antibiotic abuse in patients with simple acute diverticulitis(sAD). Consequently, it remains to be an enormous challenge for early and quick identification of complicated diverticulitis in clinic.

Peripheral blood routine test currently has been considered as an easily acquired and quick options for assessing severity of infectious diseases. In which, many parameters of white blood cells(WBC), neutrophils(NEU) and monocyte distribution width(MDW), and its derived indicators of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR) have been suggested to predict complicated diverticulitis. Besides that, in recent years, immature granulocytes (IG), namely the precursor of WBC, can be detected in peripheral whole blood earlier than WBC and NEU under the infection, inflammation, sepsis, and other stimuli conditions. And a number of studies had already suggested that IG count had the earlier prognostic value in patients whether with acute pancreatitis or acute complicated appendicitis. Unfortunately, no study has focused on the accuracy of the IG count in diagnosing Rt-side colonic complicated diverticulitis, and its predicted state remain unclear.

IG count may be a novel screening biomarker for identifying complicated diverticulitis. In this retrospective study, we investigated the predictive significance of IG count in patients with Rt-side colonic cAD.

### Management of neonates born at ≤ 34 6 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^b9e39058]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

White blood cell count — diagnostic performance for early-onset sepsis in infants born at < 34 weeks' gestation: In a multicenter analysis that "analyzed data separately for infants born at < 34 weeks' gestation", investigators reported that "all components of the CBC count lacked sensitivity for predicting EOS". "The highest likelihood ratios (LRs) for EOS were associated with extreme values", with "a positive LR of > 3… associated with a WBC count of < 1000 cells per μL, an absolute neutrophil count of < 1000, and an immature-to-total neutrophil ratio of > 0.25". Additionally, "a total WBC count of > 50 000 cells per μL (LR, 2.3) and a platelet count of < 50 000 (LR, 2.2) had a modest relationship to EOS".

### Management of neonates born at ≥ 35 0 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^a67df3e0]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

White blood cell indices — diagnostic performance in EOS: The white blood cell (WBC) count, immature/total neutrophil ratio (I/T), and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) are commonly used to assess the risk of EOS, but in 2 large, multicenter studies among term and late-preterm infants none of the components (WBC count, I/T, nor ANC) performed well. Multiple clinical factors can affect the WBC count and differential, and as the incidence of EOS declines, the clinical utility of the WBC count also declines. Extreme values — total WBC count < 5000 /μL [I/T > 0.3; ANC < 2000/μL] in one study and WBC count < 10000/μL [ANC < 1000/μL; and I/T > 0.5] in the other — were associated with the highest likelihood ratios but very low sensitivities. WBC count > 20 000/μL and platelet counts were not associated with EOS in either study, and the I/T squared [I/T divided by the ANC] performed better than any of the more traditional tests and was independent of age in hours.

### Reporting sysmex XN absolute neutrophil count in samples with leukocyte analyzer flagging [^e2502b78]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide faster laboratory data reporting, we evaluated the accuracy of Sysmex XN (Sysmex Inc, Kobe, Japan) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in the presence of analyzer flagging.

Methods

Sysmex XN and manual microscopy ANC were compared with 80 autovalidated control specimens and with 280 study specimens with analyzer flagging regarding immature granulocytes (IG) > 3% or other leukocyte abnormalities. Specimens with ambiguous neutrophil clusters were excluded.

Results

A slight positive overall method bias was seen for Sysmex XN compared to manual microscopy (n = 280), 0.025 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.023 to 0.069) × 109/L. With IG > 10% (n = 123) the bias was larger, but not clinically significant, 0.17 (95% CI, 0.060–0.25) × 109/L. No clinically significant difference was seen in neutropenic (ANC < 1.5 × 109/L) specimens (n = 91), 0.070 (95% CI, -0.013 to 0.14) × 109/L.

Conclusion

These data indicate that Sysmex XN ANC can be reported in the presence of certain analyzer flagging to improve patient care.

### Granulocyte abundance and maturation state at diagnosis predicts treatment-free remission in CML [^5a0e7dd2]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Erythroid and granulocyte abundance is linked with higher maturation rate

Cytomorphology was associated with TFR through variations in cell proportions and morphology. However, variations in cell proportions might reflect morphological differences not directly associated with TFR. In contrast, morphological variations might relate to variations in cell proportions. We aimed to understand these connections better and studied the association between the proportion and morphology in cell types linked with TFR.

Given that the M:E ratio emerged as a promising biomarker of TFR maintenance, we examined first how the morphology of precursor erythroid cells was associated with their morphology. Erythroblasts demonstrated greater nuclear compactness and cell solidity, and a smaller cytoplasmic area in samples with erythroid abundance (Supplementary Fig. 9). When examining closer, we observed that these samples contained smaller, smoothly shaped cells with round nuclei possibly reflecting higher proportion of orthochromatic erythroblasts.

Next, we studied the association between nuclei ellipticity and cell proportions in both promyelocytes and metamyelocytes. We observed that higher promyelocyte nuclei ellipticity was associated with elevated promyelocytes (2.9% vs. 1.6%, P = 0.008). In contrast, lower metamyelocyte nuclei ellipticity was associated with elevated metamyelocytes (17.9% vs. 15.2%, P = 0.008; Supplementary Fig. 10A).

Lastly, we examined neutrophil cytomorphology but could not observe any association between these and neutrophil proportion. However, we observed that neutrophil nuclei solidity was associated with the proportion of metamyelocytes (Supplementary Fig. 10B–D). Lower nuclear solidity, i.e. increased hypersegmentation, was associated with decreased metamyelocytes.

### Do the flags related to immature granulocytes reported by the sysmex XE-5000 warrant a microscopic slide review? [^afdd109c]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Sysmex XE-5000 instruments (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) count immature granulocytes (IGs) and use the "Imm Gran?" flag to signal unreliable results. This study investigated the usefulness of the "Imm Gran?" flag and the analytical and diagnostic performance of the IG measurements in a side-by-side evaluation.

Methods

In total, 408 samples were analyzed on three XE-5000 instruments. The IG count and the "Imm Gran?" flag reports from all three instruments were used for reproducibility studies. The diagnostic performance of the automated IGs and the "Imm Gran?" flag were studied by comparing the XE-5000 results with the results of the manual differential.

Results

The reproducibility of the "Imm Gran?" flagging between instruments was poor (қ, 0.75–0.80). The most significant contributor to the report of the "Imm Gran?" flag was bands, and the flag played a minor role in detecting blasts. The interinstrument reproducibility of the IG counts was high (intraclass correlation, 0.99). The IG count reported by XE-5000s was higher than the manual IG count (36%-55%), and the difference and the variability tended to increase with increasing levels of IGs.

Conclusions

The "Imm Gran?" flag has a poor analytical quality and gives no substantial information on the presence of blasts in the sample. We therefore suggest reporting the automated IG count without initial microscopic slide review.

### Esophageal adenocarcinoma with leukemoid reaction: a case report [^c7bbae9a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

A WBC count exceeding 50,000/mm 3 associated with extramedullary causes is termed a LR. It results in a severe left shift with the presence of immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Experts now agree that it is not essential the WBC count exceeds 50,000/mm 3 to be diagnose LR; counts beyond the normal upper limit (4000–10,000/mm 3) are sufficient. Some of these cases have been misdiagnosed as acute leukaemia due to the severe elevation in the WBC count. However, leukaemia commonly presents with anaemia and immature myeloid cells on a peripheral blood smear, and bone marrow biopsies typically show hypercellularity. The evidence is available directly by bone marrow biopsy and by an inverse correlation between tumour response and leucocytosis, as well as an increased PLR. LR typically presents with elevated levels of mature polymorphonuclear cells and immature cells of granulocyte lineage on peripheral smears. Leucocyte alkaline phosphatase is typically normal or elevated in LR. Leucocytosis is a typical response to infections, drugs, chromosomal abnormalities, and paraneoplastic phenomen. LR can also be a paraneoplastic manifestation of several cancers. In solid tumours, LR can be caused by an increased granulocyte colony stimulating factor or other growth factors including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is thought to be produced by malignant cells of the cervix, pancreas, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung cancer. In the normal physiologic state, GM-CSF can stimulate proliferation and differentiation of neutrophil colony-forming cells. GM-CSF can also alter several functions of mature neutrophils. During LR, over-expression of GM-CSF is associated with subsequent leucocytosis. Mari K et al. reported a patient with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with remarkable leucocytosis and high G-CSF levels. ESCC is a disease with a poor prognosis, and the prognosis of ESCC with LR is considered even poorer. Shun et al. also reported a case of aggressive G-CSF producing ESCC with increased WBC, and neutrophil counts, and increased C-reactive protein(CRP). The counts of WBC and neutrophils, and serum CRP levels may be markers of its progression. The neutrophil counts are especially important as a marker of progression. Antoine et al. reported that leucocytosis and neutrophilia were independent prognostic factors of poor overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and locoregional control (LRC) in patients with locally advanced ESCC undergoing exclusive chemoradiation. Animal experiments have demonstrated that IL-6 can sustain neutrophil/macrophage colonies in vivo, and IL-6 can act on other immune cells, which may induce the production of several CSFs by the bone marrow. Due to the rarity of PLR, studies on this disease have been very limited. HurtadoCordovi J et al. reported that only 77 (10%) among 758 patients who had solid tumours with hyperleukocytosis in their cohort had PLR. The prognosis of patients with PLR is poor. According to a review, 78% patients died within 12 weeks of the first detection of hyperleukocytosis; only 10% of patients were observed to survive more than 1 year after successful treatment of the malignancy. Owing to the poor prognosis of patients with PLR, it is essential to rule out life-threatening causes prior to making a diagnosis of PLR. In terms of early diagnosis and subsequent disease management, staining for GM-CSF early in the course of the disease may provide valuable information. Treatment strategies are limited in patients with PLR, and these are rarely reported in the literature. The effective treatment for leucocytosis is removal of the inciting tumour. Unfortunately, extirpation is not always definitive. In a retrospective, single-institution study, Granger and Kontoyiannis reported that patients with PLR who survived longer than 1 year had received effective antineoplastic therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery. Moreover, it has been reported that 78% of patients either died or were discharged to hospice within 12 weeks of their initial extreme leucocyte count findings. Here, we report a case of esophageal adenocarcinoma with an abnormal haematological picture dominated by LR. Our patient, underwent radical esophagectomy. Postoperatively, his WBC counts decreased to normal values, and he has been free of recurrence for 6 months.

### Immature granulocyte: an early predictor of strangulated adhesive small bowel obstruction [^66064a06]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, laboratory identification of strangulation in SBO has undergone a transition from "non-specific inflammatory markers" to "mechanism oriented biomarkers". Serum homocysteine (HCY) strongly correlates with irreversible transmural intestinal necrosis with a cut-off value of 15.53 µmol/L, a sensitivity of 89.7%, and specificity of 83.0%. However, it had a similar limitation with non-specific traditional inflammatory markers that HCY only started to increase at 6–8 h of post-ischemia, which significantly constrains early detection of strangulation. Surprisingly, immature granulocytes (IG) count, a convenient and easily obtainable routine blood marker, can rise within 2 h of intestinal ischemia, preceding other hematologic markers. As early as 2022 and 2024 years, the groups of Durak et al. and Çaparlar et al. validated the role of IG count in predicting mesenteric ischemia and intestinal volvulus necrosis with a sensitivity of 76.2–74.1% and specificity of 85.7–98.2%, respectively. Hitherto, no study has evaluated the predictive value of IG count for strangulated adhesive SBO.

In this study, we explored the differences in clinical variables and laboratory markers among strangulated adhesive SBO cases and assessed the predictive value in them.

### Severe congenital neutropenia [^19d19133]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital neutropenia (CN) is a genetically heterogeneous bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by a maturation arrest of myelopoiesis at the level of the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage with peripheral blood absolute neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 10(9)/L. From early infancy patients who have CN suffer from bacterial infections. Leukemias occur in both the autosomal dominant and recessive subtypes of CN. The individual risk for each genetic subtype needs to be evaluated further, because the number of patients tested for the underlying genetic defect is still limited. Acquired G-CSFR (CSF3R) mutations are detected in approximately 80% of patients who had CN and who developed acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting that these mutations are involved in leukemogenesis.

### Use of the complete blood cell count in late-onset neonatal sepsis [^22cf82c3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Late-onset sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in infants. Diagnosis of late-onset sepsis can be challenging. The complete blood cell count and differential have been previously evaluated as diagnostic tools for late-onset sepsis in small, single-center reports.

Objective

We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the complete blood cell count and differential in late-onset sepsis in a large multicenter population.

Study Design

Using a cohort of all infants with cultures and complete blood cell count data from a large administrative database, we calculated odds ratios for infection, as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios for various commonly used cut-off values.

Results

High and low white blood cell counts, high absolute neutrophil counts, high immature-to-total neutrophil ratios and low platelet counts were associated with late-onset sepsis. Associations were weaker with increasing postnatal age at the time of the culture. Specificity was highest for white blood cell counts < 1000/mm and > 50,000/mm (> 99%). Positive likelihood ratios were highest for white blood cell counts < 1000/mm (4.1) and platelet counts < 50,000/mm (3.5).

Conclusion

No complete blood cell count index possessed adequate sensitivity to reliably rule out late-onset sepsis in this population.

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis-United States [^80ce04aa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) laboratory findings — The total white blood cell count is typically normal or slightly increased in patients with RMSF, with increased numbers of immature neutrophils. Thrombocytopenia, slight elevations in hepatic transaminases (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase), and hyponatremia might be present, particularly as the disease advances; however, laboratory values cannot be relied on to guide early treatment decisions because they are often within or slightly deviated from the reference range early in the course of illness. Indicators of diffuse tissue injury, such as elevated levels of creatine kinase or serum lactate dehydrogenase, might be present later in the course.

### Value of procalcitonin measurement for early evidence of severe bacterial infections in the pediatric intensive care unit [^d778544b]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether peak blood procalcitonin (PCT) measured within 48 hours of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission can differentiate severe bacterial infections from sterile inflammation and viral infection and identify potential subgroups of PICU patients for whom PCT may not have clinical utility.

Study Design

This was a retrospective, observational study of 646 critically ill children who had PCT measured within 48 hours of admission to an urban, academic PICU. Patients were stratified into 6 categories by infection status. We compared test characteristics for peak PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and % immature neutrophils. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was determined for each biomarker to discriminate bacterial infection.

Results

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was similar for PCT (0.73, 95% CI 0.69, 0.77) and CRP (0.75, 95% CI 0.71, 0.79; P = 0.36), but both outperformed WBC, ANC, and % immature neutrophils (P < .01 for all pairwise comparisons). The combination of PCT and CRP was no better than either PCT or CRP alone. Diagnostic patterns prone to false-positive and false-negative PCT values were identified.

Conclusions

Peak blood PCT measured close to PICU admission was not superior to CRP in differentiating severe bacterial infection from viral illness and sterile inflammation; both PCT and CRP outperformed WBC, ANC, and % immature neutrophils. PCT appeared especially prone to inaccuracies in detecting localized bacterial central nervous system infections or bacterial coinfection in acute viral illness causing respiratory failure.

### White blood cell ranges and frequency of neutropenia by duffy genotype status [^ddd7cea7]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

These results highlight that an ANC value lower than the common clinical threshold for neutropenia (< 1500 cells per μL) is common among participants with the Duffy-null RBC genotype, especially among younger individuals. Furthermore, > 5% of these individuals have an ANC < 1000 cells per μL. When we examined first measured ANC values, 4.8% of adults with the Duffy-null RBC genotype had an ANC < 1500 cells per μL, compared with 0.5% of adults with the other genotypes. These values are comparable to findings reported from African-ancestry populations from the UK Biobank, in which the respective percentages were 5.1% vs 0.3%.

The current clinical guidelines for evaluating neutropenia include collecting a careful clinical history and physical examination, investigating for signs of infection, and serial monitoring of ANC (≥ 2 values usually 3–6 months apart) and markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein. If ANC values remain stable, and in the absence of concerning symptoms, a diagnosis of stable neutropenia may be inferred. However, a race-based inference that the etiology of the neutropenia is the Duffy-null RBC genotype will often be inaccurate. We believe that this decision model would be improved if a neutropenia evaluation included measurement of the Duffy-null RBC phenotype/genotype and values were interpreted in the context of genotype-specific reference ranges. This could reduce repeated laboratory testing among those with the Duffy-null RBC genotype and would more promptly and accurately identify those individuals without the Duffy-null RBC genotype for whom a low ANC would not be anticipated based on their genotype.

There are limitations to this study. Even though measurements were collected in conjunction with billing activity related to a routine health maintenance examination, participants could have had symptoms or other findings that prompted an examination of blood counts. In particular, routine laboratory testing is less commonly pursued among younger individuals in the absence of clinical concerns. Although we excluded individuals with a history of malignancy and other diseases that could impact leukocyte counts, disease reporting can be incomplete in biobank data resources. There were insufficient data to examine relevant secondary findings such as immature granulocyte fractions.

In summary, for adults with the CC genotype, the lower limit (2.5th percentile) of the ANC distribution is likely between 711 and 1239 cells per μL, compared with 1250 and 2110 cells per μL for the CT/TT genotypes. These reference points may assist providers in determining whether further clinical evaluations are warranted among individuals with low neutrophil count measurements.

### Comparing automated vs manual leukocyte differential counts for quantifying the 'left shift' in the blood of neonates [^df4a7657]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The neutrophil 'left shift' can be measured via the immature to total (I/T) neutrophil ratio or the absolute bands per μl using a manual differential count. It can also be measured from an automated differential count by the immature granulocyte percentage (IG%) or the absolute IG per μl. In neonates, it is unknown if the manual or automated differential count is superior.

Study Design

We directly compared complete blood counts (CBCs) with manual and automated differential counts from infants < 90 days old, and documented whether or not each neonate was infected. We developed reference intervals for I/T ratio, bands per μl, IG% and IG per μl using values from non-infected neonates.

Results

The database had 10714 CBCs. The upper reference interval for I/T ratio was 0.29 in the first 48h and 0.31 thereafter; bands per μl was 3710μl(-1) in the first 48h and 1785μl(-1) thereafter. IG% was 6.2% then 4.2%; IG per μl was 1460μl(-1) then 613μl(-1). Statistical performances of the four methods were equivalent for identifying infection.

Conclusions

We developed reference intervals for four methods of quantifying a neonate's 'left shift'. The information from automated differentials is not inferior to that from manual differentials in identifying infections, but automated differentials have the advantages of a larger sample size, being less expensive, and faster performance times.

### Granulocyte transfusions for neonates with confirmed or suspected sepsis and neutropenia [^0afbdb5c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Neonates have immature granulopoiesis, which frequently results in neutropenia after sepsis. Neutropaenic septic neonates have a higher mortality than non-neutropenic septic neonates. Therefore, granulocyte transfusion to septic neutropenic neonates may improve outcomes.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine the effect of granulocyte or buffy coat transfusions as adjuncts to antibiotics, after confirmed or suspected sepsis in neutropenic neonates, on all-cause mortality during hospital stay and neurological outcome at ≥ year of age. Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of granulocyte transfusions on length of hospital stay in survivors to discharge, adverse effects and immunologic outcomes at ≥ year of age.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, proceedings of the PAS conferences and ongoing trials at clinicaltrials.gov and clinical-trials.com were searched in July 2011.

Selection Criteria

Studies where neutropenic neonates with suspected or confirmed sepsis were randomised or quasi-randomised to granulocyte or buffy coat transfusions at any dose or duration, and reporting any outcome of interest were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals using the fixed effects model were reported for dichotomous outcomes. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed.

Main Results

Four trials were eligible for inclusion. Forty-four infants with sepsis and neutropenia were randomised in three trials to granulocyte transfusions or placebo/no transfusion. In another trial, 35 infants with sepsis and neutropenia on antibiotics were randomised to granulocyte transfusion or IVIG. When granulocyte transfusion was compared with placebo or no transfusion, there was no significant difference in 'all-cause mortality' (three trials; typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.86; typical RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.21). When granulocyte transfusion was compared with intravenous immunoglobulin (one trial), there was a reduction in 'all-cause mortality' of borderline statistical significance (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.04; RD -0.34, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.09; NNT 2.7, 95% CI 1.6 to 9.1). Pulmonary complications were the only adverse effect reported in the trials that used buffy coat transfusions. None of the trials reported on neurological outcome at one year of age or later, length of hospital stay in survivors to discharge or immunological outcome at one year of age or later.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, there is inconclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to support or refute the routine use of granulocyte transfusions in neutropenic, septic neonates. Researchers are encouraged to conduct adequately powered multi-centre trials of granulocyte transfusions in neutropenic septic neonates.

### Circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells correlate with clinical outcome in Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated up-front with a risk-adapted strategy [^f7199c1f]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

In the attempt to find a peripheral blood biological marker that could mirror the dysregulated microenvironment of Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), we analysed the amount of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), including the three main sub-types (monocytic, granulocytic and CD34 + fraction). The absolute MDSC count was investigated in 60 consecutive newly diagnosed HL patients and correlated with clinical variables at diagnosis and outcome. Patients received standard-of-care chemotherapy with the exception of interim fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET-2)-positive patients, who were switched early to a salvage regimen. All MDSC subsets were increased in HL patients compared to normal subjects (P < 0·0001) and were higher in non-responders. However, a strong prognostic significance was limited to immature (CD34(+)) MDSC. A cut-off level of 0·0045 × 10(9) /l for CD34(+) MDSC resulted in 89% (95% confidence interval [CI] 52–99%) sensitivity and 92% (95% CI 81–98%) specificity. The positive predictive value to predict progression-free survival was 0·90 for PET-2 and 0·98 for CD34(+) MDSC count; the negative predictive value was 0·57 for PET-2 and 0·73 for CD34(+) MDSC. PFS was significantly shorter in patients with more than 0·0045 × 10(9) CD34(+) MDSC cells/l at diagnosis and/or PET-2 positivity (P < 0·0001). In conclusion, all circulating MDSC subsets are increased in HL; CD34(+) MDSC predict short PFS, similarly to PET-2 but with the advantage of being available at diagnosis.

### Role of complete blood count in the diagnosis of culture-proven neonatal sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4c5e59ce]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 100000 babies are admitted to neonatal units in the UK each year, primarily due to preterm birth (gestational age < 37 weeks) and suspected infections. Neonatal sepsis, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, accounted for 4640 cases in the UK and 6.31 million cases globally in 2019, as defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes for bacterial infections.

Accurate and timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is critical to improving outcomes. Current UK guidelines, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2021, recommend blood cultures as the gold standard. However, blood cultures are often negative in neonatal sepsis, with sensitivities as low as 40%, and results can take up to 72 hours, delaying definitive treatment decisions. Baseline C reactive protein (CRP) measurements are recommended to monitor treatment efficacy, but their delayed sensitivity limits their role in early diagnosis.

Despite its widespread use outside neonatal care, complete blood count (CBC) is not included in the NICE guidelines for diagnosing sepsis due to insufficient evidence supporting the diagnostic utility of the white cell count (WCC). In contrast, CBC is a well-established diagnostic tool in adults with suspected sepsis. Studies in adults have demonstrated significant differences in neutrophil counts between infected and non-infected patients at various time points after diagnosis (p < 0.001 at 2 days, p = 0.001 at 4 days and p = 0.013 at 7 days).

CBC is a rapid, inexpensive test that requires minimal blood volume (as little as 20 µL) and is routinely measured in neonates to monitor haemoglobin levels and detect anaemia. Recent innovations in automated haematology analysers enable the measurement of functional parameters such as immature-to-total neutrophil ratio (ITR) and mean neutrophil volume (MNV), providing a fresh perspective on the diagnostic utility of CBC. ITR is a measure of neutrophil regeneration — a higher ITR indicates an increase in immature neutrophil production in response to infection. Immature neutrophils are larger than mature neutrophils, so an increase in MNV also occurs.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CBC parameters, particularly functional markers, for neonatal sepsis. By leveraging recent advances in CBC technology and addressing limitations of prior diagnostic approaches, our study seeks to reframe CBC as a potential adjunctive tool for improving early detection and management of neonatal sepsis.

### Prevalence and predictors for 72-h mortality after transfer to acute palliative care unit [^c55d5be8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical and biological variables

The case and control patient cohorts differed with respect to various clinical and biological variables under study. The ability for self-care, captured by the SPI, was significantly different between the two groups: In the case group, 67 patients (86%) had a SPI between 10 and 19 points, with only 14% (N = 11) of patients with a SPI larger than 20 points. In the control group, 45 patients (41%) had a SPI between 10 and 19 points, and 65 patients (59%) had a SPI larger than 20 points (p < 0.001). When it comes to responsiveness at transfer, patients in the control group (N = 85; 77%) were significantly more responsive than patients in the case group (N = 25; 23%) (p < 0.001). With respect to a delirious state and oxygen requirement upon admission, there was no significant difference between case and control groups (p = 0.731). In both groups, less than 20% of patients were delirious, and 35% and 45% of patients in the case and the control group, respectively, were given supplemental oxygen.

Biological markers were available for sub-groups of patients only. CRP upon admission was available for 151 patients. The Median CRP was elevated at 100 mg/l (27–189 mg/l) and 95 mg/l (33–168 mg/l) in the case and control group, respectively, with the slight difference not being statistically significant (p = 0.872). Albumin levels were available for 110 patients, and the difference of 26 mg/dl (21–31 mg/dl) in the case group and 29 mg/dl (26–34 mg/dl) in the control group was significantly different (p = 0.016). Leucocyte, immature granulocyte and thrombocyte counts upon admission were available only for 152, 123 and 151 patients, respectively, and the detected differences did not prove to be statistically different (p = 0.515; p = 0.771; p = 0.450). For a summary of clinical and biological variables, compare Table 3.

### Immature granulocyte: an early predictor of strangulated adhesive small bowel obstruction [^cc7d4d41]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Early identification of strangulation in adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) is crucial for emergency triage and immediate surgical intervention. This study aimed to explore the predictive value of the immature granulocyte (IG) count in assessing strangulation in adhesive SBO.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of patients with adhesive SBO, diagnosed surgically or by abdominal computed tomography (CT) from May 2022 to April 2025, comparing strangulated (SG) and non-strangulated (NSG) cases. Baseline levels of the IG count and related inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the predictive value for strangulation.

Results

250 eligible patients in the SG (n = 167) and NSG (n = 83) groups were enrolled in this study. Compared to the NSG group, the SG group demonstrated significantly higher levels of white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil (NEU), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and IG count with statistical differences (all P < 0.001). In the analysis of logistic regression and ROC, the IG count demonstrated an independent risk for predicting strangulated adhesive SBO (OR 15.41, 95%CI 8.07–31.59, P < 0.001). The IG count had the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.946 among the enrolled inflammatory biomarkers, particularly within 6 h from onset to hospital (AUC 0.961, 95% CI, 0.90–1.00). It showed an optimal cutoff value of 0.280 × 10⁹ /L with a sensitivity of 89.50% and specificity of 100.00% for identifying strangulation in adhesive SBO.

Conclusion

IG count was an early predictor for quick detection of strangulation in adhesive SBO within 6 h from onset to hospital. This finding may fill the clinical gap in recognizing intestinal ischemia at an early stage prior to imaging examination.

### The early biomarker of immature granulocyte count in predicting right-side colonic complicated acute diverticulitis: a retrospective cohort study [^69dc59e8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Early identification of complicated acute diverticulitis(cAD) is especially significant for clinical physician and surgeon to reduce the antibiotic usage and the risk of emergency surgery. This study was aimed to investigate the significance of immature granulocyte(IG) count in early prediction for right-side(Rt-side) cAD.

Methods

The patients with Rt-side colonic acute diverticulitis was enrolled between January, 2019 and March, 2024, and divided into complicated and simple acute diverticulitis group(cAD and sAD). The data about demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters were collected and compared. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operator characteristic(ROC) curves were used to assess the predictive values of these parameters for Rt-side complicated diverticulitis.

Results

289 participants who met the inclusion criteria were followed as 31 patients in cAD group and 258 in sAD group. Compared to sAD group, cAD group had the higher body mass index(BMI) and peripheral blood routine parameters, especially IG count, systemic immune inflammation index(SII) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR), with the statistically significant differences(P < 0.001). Moreover, logistic regression analysis indicated that IG count was a significant and independent predictors for cAD(OR 4.92, 95%CI 3.86–8.39). In the ROC analysis, area under the ROC curves (AUC) was found for IG count(0.93(95%CI 0.88–0.99)) and SII(0.88(95%CI 0.820–0.95)). The optimal cut-off value of IG count was 0.10 with the largest sensitivity of 80.60% and specificity of 100.00% for identifying Rt-side colonic complicated diverticulitis.

Conclusion

IG count was a more comparable and independent predictor for Rt-side colonic complicated diverticulitis with a largest AUC than other markers in complete blood count (CBC). Given its early arise, easy accessibility and no-radiation, it can largely convince physicians' decision-making of antibiotic abuse and surgeons' early intervention in Rt-side colonic cAD.

### The prognostic value of immature granulocyte in patients with acute pancreatitis [^c413185c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis is the inflammation of the pancreas. It can range from mild forms to life-threatening severe cases. There is not yet a marker that can detect severe cases in the early period. Early diagnosis and treatment of this disease has critical importance for prognosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the percentage of immature granulocyte (IG %) in patients with acute pancreatitis in order to predict the severity of the disease and in-hospital mortality.

Method

This study was carried out retrospectively in academic emergency department (ED), faculty of medicine between 01.01.2017 and 30.06.2019. The patients were divided into three groups as mild, moderate and severe. In addition, the patients were divided into two groups: those discharged from the hospital and those who died in the hospital. IG % and other laboratory parameters of the patients were recorded in the study form. The primary outcome for this study is the value of IG% in predicting severity in AP patients. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed.

Results

A total of 218 patients (107 male) were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 56.9 ± 18.3 years. It was found that IG% levels were higher in patients with severe pancreatitis (p = .018). In the ROC analysis that was done to determine the severity of the disease, the cut-off value of IG% was found as > 1.1. As such case, specificity was %38.89, sensitivity was 95.00%, positive predictive value (PPV) was 41.18% and negative predictive value (NPV) was found as 94.53% (Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.698). In ROC analysis that was performed to determine in-hospital mortality, the cut-off value of IG level was found as > 1.8, sensitivity was 50.00%, specificity was 97.12%, PPV was 45.45% and NPV was found as 97.58% (AUC = 0.708). CONCLUSıONS: This study shows that higher IG% levels may correlate with higher disease severity and in-hospital mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis.

### Integration of immature granulocytes quantification with the version 2.0 uniCel DxH 800 in the hematoFlow strategy [^e2e124db]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our aim was to define whether the early granulocyte cell marker (EGC%_DxH) parameter might replace immature granulocytes counts obtained by HematoFlow (IG%_HF) and/or manual differential count (IG%_manual).

Methods

We conducted a study over a 10-day period in February 2014 whereby 402 samples were analyzed for the IG flag. We correlated the EGC%_DxH vs IG%_HF and IG%_manual, identified any discrepant results and finally looked at the impact on our workflow by incorporation of the EGC% into our WBC differential algorithm.

Results

On an initial training set, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed a threshold of 0.9% for EGC%_DxH (sensitivity of 91.7%, specificity of 93.5% and an area under the curve of 0.965). Further analysis of the dataset (259 samples) found a correlation of the EGC%_DxH to all our IG% counting methods (r = 0.963). Incorporation of the EGC%_DxH into the WBC HematoFlow differential resulted in a 36% reduction of samples requiring HematoFlow and/or slide review.

Conclusions

The EGC% generated by the DxH 800 can be easily incorporated into existing HematoFlow and slide review algorithms.

### Automated blood cell counts: state of the art [^aa47e194]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The CBC count and leukocyte differential count (LDC) are among the most frequently requested clinical laboratory tests. These analyses are highly automated, and the correct interpretation of results requires extensive knowledge of the analytic performance of the instruments and the clinical significance of the results they provide. In this review, we analyze the state of the art regarding traditional and new parameters with emphasis on clinical applications and analytic quality. The problems of some traditional parameters of the CBC count, such as platelet counts, some components of the LDC such as monocyte and basophil counts, and other commonly used indices such as red cell volume distribution width and platelet indices such as mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are considered. The new parameters, evaluated from analytic and clinical viewpoints, are the available components of the extended differential count (hematopoietic progenitor cells, immature granulocytes, and erythroblasts), the immature reticulocyte fraction, the reticulocyte indices, the fragmented RBCs, and the immature platelet fraction.

Results

Patients' characteristics

Among 318 patients who were diagnosed as acute colonic diverticulitis, 289 of them complied with study inclusion criteria and was included into our study, 31 had colonic complicated diverticulitis and 258 had simple diverticulitis (Fig. 1). All of patients had Rt-side colonic diverticulitis: among cAD group, 9 in the cecum, 15 in the ascending colon, and 7 in both of cecum and ascending colon; among sAD group, 95 in the cecum, 78 in the ascending colon, and 85 in both of cecum and ascending colon. In comparison to sAD group, the mean age was 49.97 years and 67.74% of the patients were male in cAD group without statistical differences(P > 0.05). And no statistical difference was also observed between two groups in terms of favor of smoking(17 vs. 120), alcohol(19 vs. 127), and onset time of disease(hours, 41.87 vs. 35.54). By contrast, BMI, levels of WBC, NEU, IG count and values of SII, NLR, PLR, PNR in cAD group were significantly higher than in sAD group(P < 0.001), while lymphocyte in cAD group was lower than sAD(P < 0.001). Table 1 summarized the patients' demographics data and the results of clinical characteristics and baseline laboratory parameters.

### Longitudinal investigation of haematological alterations among permethrin-exposed pesticide applicators in the biomarkers of exposure and effect in agriculture study [^acb3e61c]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Permethrin use has been associated with an increased risk of multiple myeloma (MM) among pesticide applicators. However, the biological plausibility and mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to assess whether exposure to permethrin is related to haematological alterations among occupationally exposed pesticide applicators.

Methods

We conducted a longitudinal study among 33 pesticide applicators in the Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect in Agriculture study comparing haematological parameters in the offseason with the day after permethrin exposure and, for 27 participants, approximately 3weeks postexposure. Complete blood counts with white blood cell differential and lymphocyte subsets were measured at each visit. Multivariate linear mixed effects models were used to assess the relationship between natural log-transformed haematological parameters and exposure to permethrin.

Results

The adjusted geometric mean immature granulocyte count was elevated among pesticide applicators following permethrin exposure compared with their offseason levels (37% increase, 95% CI 6% to 76%). Modest but statistically significant (p < 0.05) alterations in red blood cell (RBC) parameters (eg, decreased RBC count and haemoglobin and increased mean corpuscular volume and RBC distribution width-SD) were also observed the day after permethrin use compared with offseason levels; decreases in RBC count and haemoglobin and increases in RBC distribution width-SD persisted approximately 3weeks after permethrin use.

Conclusions

Altered haematological parameters could be indicative of disrupted haematopoiesis, providing insights into the biological plausibility of the observed association between permethrin use and MM risk among pesticide applicators.

### Immature granulocyte: an early predictor of strangulated adhesive small bowel obstruction [^eabd848c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Data were extracted from our institutional electronic medical record. All patient data were anonymized and de-identified prior to collection and analysis. The cohort was divided into two groups, stratified by strangulation status: strangulation group (SG), with intraoperative findings of strangulation (e.g. ischemic, vascular compromise), and non-strangulation group (NSG), either with intraoperative confirmation of viable bowel (adhesive obstruction without ischemia/necrosis), or who was the absence of signs of ischemia on imaging and successfully managed conservatively, such as nil by mouth, nasogastric decompression, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and empirical intravenous antibiotics, etc. The following data were extracted: age, sex, time of onset to hospitalization, main symptoms, initial vital signs, and treatment management. Preoperative or admission laboratory parameters were also collected, including WBC count, NEU, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and IG count. All blood samples in this study were analyzed using the same automated hematology analyzer (Mindray, BC-7500CS) and standardized operating procedure in our institution, ensuring internal consistency of these parameters. The reference interval provided by the manufacturer: WBC count (3.5–9.5 × 10⁹ /L), NEU (1.8–6.3 × 10⁹ /L), lymphocyte count (1.1–3.2 × 10⁹ /L), platelet count (125–350 × 10⁹ /L), and IG count (≤ 0.029 × 10⁹ /L).

NCCN Myeloproliferative Neoplasms — WHO and ICC diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) list four major criteria: platelet count ≥ 450 × 10^9/L; bone marrow biopsy showing proliferation mainly of the megakaryocytic lineage with increased numbers of enlarged, mature megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated nuclei and no significant increase or left shift in neutrophil granulopoiesis or erythropoiesis; WHO criteria for BCR::ABL1-positive CML, PV, PMF, and other myeloid neoplasms are not met; and JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation. Minor criteria are presence of a clonal marker or exclusion of reactive thrombocytosis. The diagnosis of ET requires either all the major criteria or the first 3 major criteria plus a minor criterion to be met.

### Granulocyte transfusions in the G-CSF era. where do we stand? [^ad289d11]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

The efficacy of granulocytes transfusions (GTX) in either the prevention or treatment of neutropenic sepsis has been a controversial issue. Early studies employing steroid mobilised GTX showed variable, dose-dependent results and significant pulmonary toxicity was reported. With the introduction of the recombinant myeloid growth factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), the quantity of granulocytes that could be harvested was substantially increased leading to renewed interest in the clinical application of GTX. The administration of G-CSF to normal donors leads to significantly higher pre-harvest neutrophil counts and consequently larger granulocyte harvests. Infusion of G-CSF stimulated GTX results in measurable increases in the recipients' neutrophil count and may reduce the duration and severity of neutropenia. However, the efficacy of these GTX in treating or preventing established neutropenic sepsis remains to be established in prospective controlled clinical trials.

### The diagnostic value of absolute neutrophil count, band count and morphologic changes of neutrophils in predicting bacterial infections [^5dba37ea]. Medical Principles and Practice (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)" for febrile neutropenia.

The Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is a clinical calculator used primarily in the field of hematology and oncology. It is applicable to patients who have undergone chemotherapy, those with suspected neutropenia, or those at risk for severe infection due to immunosuppression. The ANC is calculated from the total white blood cell count and the percentage of neutrophils, providing a measure of the body's primary defense against bacterial infections.

The clinical utility of the ANC lies in its ability to assess the severity of neutropenia and the risk of infection in patients. It is particularly useful in monitoring patients undergoing chemotherapy, as these individuals are at a high risk for neutropenia and subsequent infection.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ANC. However, it should be noted that the ANC may not accurately reflect the risk of infection in patients with conditions that cause functional neutrophil defects, such as chronic granulomatous disease. Additionally, the ANC may be less useful in patients with conditions that cause neutrophilia, such as corticosteroid use or acute stress, as these conditions can artificially elevate the neutrophil count.

### Serial neutrophil values facilitate predicting the absence of neonatal early-onset sepsis [^b0c50d4c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To validate established neonatal neutrophil reference ranges (RRs) and determine the utility of serial measurements of neutrophil values in the first 24 hours to predict the absence of neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS).

Study Design

Retrospective study of 2073 admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (2009–2011). Neonates were classified as blood culture-positive, proven EOS (n = 9), blood culture-negative but clinically suspect EOS (n = 292), and not infected (n = 1292). Neutrophil values from 745 not-infected neonates without perinatal complications were selected to validate RR distributions. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated; area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were constructed to predict the presence or absence of EOS. Neutrophil value scores were established to determine whether serial neutrophil values predict the absence of EOS.

Results

Seventy-seven percent of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit were evaluated for EOS: 9 (0.56%) had proven EOS with positive blood culture ≤ 37 hours; 18% had clinically suspect EOS. Neutropenia occurred in preterm neonates, and nonspecific neutrophilia was common in uninfected neonates. The distribution of neutrophil values differed significantly between study groups. The specificity for absolute total immature neutrophils and immature to total neutrophil proportions was 91% and 94%, respectively, with negative predictive value of 99% for proven and 78% for proven plus suspect EOS. Absolute total immature neutrophils and immature to total neutrophil proportions had the best predictability for EOS > 6 hours postnatal with an AUC ∼ 0.8. Neutrophil value scores predicted the absence of EOS with AUC of 0.9 and 0.81 for proven and proven plus suspect EOS, respectively.

Conclusion

Age-dependent neutrophil RRs remain valid. Serial neutrophil values at 0, 12, and 24 hours plus blood culture and clinical evaluation can be used to discontinue antimicrobial therapy at 36–48 hours.

### Congenital neutropenia and rare functional phagocyte disorders in children [^c3d2d0e9]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Both profound neutropenia and functional phagocyte disorders render patients susceptible to recurrent, unusual, and/or life-threatening infections. Many disorders also have nonhematologic manifestations and a substantial risk of leukemogenesis. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and interrogation of the complete blood count with differential/bone marrow examination coupled with immunologic and genetic analyses. Treatment of the quantitative neutrophil disorders depends on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, whereas management of functional phagocyte disease is reliant on antimicrobials and/or targeted therapies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant remains the only curative option for most disorders but is not used on a routine basis.

3.5 Patients with NS have higher numbers of granulocytes

Blood leukocytes and their subsets were studied in 9 of the 10 adult patients (Figure 1). One patient had a leukocyte count above the normal range, which was caused by an elevated granulocyte count. Compared with the healthy individuals, patients with NS had a significantly higher granulocyte count (P = 0.04). Absolute numbers of total lymphocytes and monocytes were in the normal range. Within the granulocyte subset, mainly the numbers of neutrophils seemed higher, although this was not significantly different from controls. Two patients had an increased eosinophil count. All patients had a normal basophil count, yet the median count was significantly lower than that of the control group (P = 0.02). Numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were dramatically decreased in the patient group (P < .001). Within the lymphocyte subset, one patient had an increased B‐cell count and one patient had an increased T‐cell count, yet as a group the median T‐cell count was significantly lower than that of healthy controls (P = 0.04). In our study cohort, NK‐cell numbers were quite diverse, but not statistically different from the control group. Still, one patient had increased NK‐cell numbers, whereas two patients had reduced NK‐cell numbers.

### Low-density neutrophil levels are correlated with sporotrichosis severity: insights into subcutaneous fungal infection [^8e56c3ff]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) constitute a distinct subset of neutrophils among PBMCs. They are key mediators in systemic infections, amplifying inflammatory responses and potentially influencing disease severity and chronicity. However, their roles in subcutaneous fungal infections have not been previously investigated. In this study, we observed increased neutrophil counts in the blood and tissues of patients with sporotrichosis through automated blood analysis, histology, and immunohistochemistry. In addition, we found elevated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels by ELISAs. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant increase in CD16+CD66b+ LDNs compared with that in healthy controls. In vitro stimulation with Sporothrix globosa induced LDN generation. We observed positive correlations of LDN frequency with levels of CRP and myeloperoxidase. Conversely, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels were negatively correlated with LDN frequency. LDNs exhibited a combined mature/immature phenotype. Notably, transcriptomic analysis showed downregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in LDNs; functional assays also demonstrated reduced phagocytosis, ROS production, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation after stimulation with Sporothrix globosa. Degranulation did not exhibit significant changes, suggesting that LDNs constitute an impaired subpopulation. Our findings in the context of subcutaneous fungal infections indicate that LDN levels are significantly elevated in sporotrichosis and positively correlated with disease severity.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute promyelocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to treatment monitoring, ELN 2019 guidelines recommend to interpret an increase of WBC counts > 10×10⁹/L after treatment initiation with all-trans retinoic acid and/or arsenic trioxide as a sign of all-trans retinoic acid/arsenic trioxide-induced differentiation and do not reclassify the patient as having high-risk disease.

### Absolute immature platelet count may predict imminent platelet recovery in thrombocytopenic children following chemotherapy [^59a7e0b1]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Immature platelets are the youngest circulating platelets and they reflect the rate of thrombopoiesis. The immature platelet fraction (IPF) or the absolute immature platelet count (AIPC) may predict platelet count recovery following chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients and help guiding prophylactic platelet transfusion therapy.

Procedure

To test IPF and AIPC as predictors of platelet recovery, 19 children with platelet nadirs of less than 20 × 10(9)/L after chemotherapy were prospectively enrolled. IPF, platelet count, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analyzed in 416 paired samples from 37 patients with malignancies to test if IPF-levels were CRP dependent.

Results

A significant increase of 0.6 × 10(9)/L in AIPC was seen between 1 and 2 days prior to platelet count recovery. No predictive day-to-day differences were found for IPF. Platelet count recovery did not occur significantly earlier for patients with a peak IPF > 10% than for those patients with a peak IPF < 10%. IPF and AIPC showed no correlation to CRP. AIPC was in contrast to IPF not influenced by platelet transfusions.

Conclusion

AIPC increased significantly between 24 and 48 hours before platelet recovery whereas IPF showed no significant increase during the same time period. AIPC may be a better indicator than IPF for predicting platelet recovery after chemotherapy in pediatric patients.

### The intensive care infection score-a novel marker for the prediction of infection and its severity [^5a740687]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Blood for the WBC and ICIS measurement was obtained in a K3EDTA tube. Both the WBC and ICIS parameters were measured on a modified fluorescence flow hematology analyzer with fully automated gating (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The ICIS was measured promptly after collection but within a maximum of 24 h. The ICIS score is composed of five blood-cell-derived parameters that characterize the innate immune response. The five parameters include the mean fluorescence intensity of mature (segmented) neutrophils, the difference in hemoglobin concentration between newly formed and mature red blood cells, the total segmented neutrophil count, the antibody secreting lymphocytes, and the accurate immature granulocytes count, as previously described. Each parameter is available from a standard routine method and can be measured within 1 minute without sample preparation on a modified fluorescence flow hematology analyzer with fully automated gating (Symex). The methodology is based on routine hematology fluorescence flow cytometry using different fluorescence reagents for mainly nucleic acids, and specifically designed blood cell membrane surfactant reagents generating information about cell shape and the formation of bioactive lipids from cell membranes. Side and forward scatter light are used to determine the intracellular structure and size of blood cells. By adding all weighting values for all five parameter components, the maximum possible ICIS is 20. Serum CRP (turbidimetric assay) and PCT (electrochemiluminescence BRAHMS immunoassay) measurements were routinely performed using a Cobas 8000 platform (Roche, Almere, Netherlands). Blood for PCT measurement was sampled in a z serum clot activator tube.

### Disorders of neutrophil number and function [^94b6d4f0]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

This review of disorders of neutrophil number and function will discuss important research advances in the field and then provide a clinical diagnostic approach. The focus will be on two recent clinical developments in the field of phagocyte disorders. First, an important natural history study from the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry has recently quantitated the incidence and risk factors for death from sepsis and for progression to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in a large cohort of severe chronic neutropenia patients, many of whom were followed 10 or more years on treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Second, in the past year, a multinational group has announced successful gene therapy of two adults with chronic granulomatous disease, the most common disorder of neutrophil function. However, monitoring of retroviral insertion sites revealed expansion of the multiclonal population of gene-modified cells, raising concerns about eventual leukemogenesis. The review also provides a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of a patient with a suspected disorder of neutrophil number or function.

### Immunotherapeutic early-phase clinical trials and malignant gliomas: a single-center experience and comprehensive immunophenotyping of circulating leukocytes [^595228f3]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, the multivariate analysis failed to identify a number of clinical, laboratory, and molecular parameters useful to develop a specific prognostic score, probably due to the small sample size.

We prospectively investigated whether circulating immune cell subpopulations and their dynamic changes during treatment may provide useful correlations of patient outcomes in a subset of twenty cases part of our EG. Though CD4+ T cells counts have been positively associated with the prognosis in glioma patients treated either with radiation, temozolomide, and vaccine therapy, we did not find any significant correlation between peripheral T-cell populations and patient outcomes in our EG. Instead, interesting findings have emerged from the study of innate immunity compartment.

Significant evidence demonstrated that the number of circulating neutrophils and a high NLR were associated with a worse prognosis in GBM patients. Moreover, NLR as a single threshold value has a well-known negative prognostic significance for patients with advanced cancers treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, whereas its dynamic changes are reported to be a nonlinear predictor of patient outcomes. In our series, an overall reduction in the absolute circulating neutrophils counts during the course of ieCT correlated with significantly better survival. We found that an increase of aged neutrophils at first tumor assessment correlates with a worse prognosis, while a higher absolute number of immature neutrophils is associated with better clinical outcomes. Immature neutrophils are immunostimulatory, promoting T-cell survival, and enhancing proliferation and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production by T cells, while aged neutrophils are immunosuppressive inhibiting T-cell response via CD18-mediated contact-dependent arginase-1 release. Recent work demonstrated suppression of the number, phenotype, and function of circulating DC subsets in patients with GBM, likely due to tumor-induced immunosuppression and dexamethasone use. Moreover, GBM patients exhibiting increased DC levels over time seemed to have a more favorable prognosis. A high number of activated NK cells at diagnosis are associated with a more favorable prognosis in GBM patientsas well as a persistent activation of NK cells induced by DC vaccination correlated with prolonged survival. Most of the cases in our EG showed a progressive decline of both DC and NK cell counts as an expression of a general scenario of cancer immune escape. Conversely, those patients deriving a prolonged clinical benefit from immunotherapy presented an increase in circulating cDCs during treatment. Even a higher count of CD56 bright NK cells at the time of first tumor assessment correlated with a better outcome in our cohort. DCs and NK cells are highly sophisticated players of the innate immune system that function as a bridge between innate- and antigen-specific immunity. cDCs are professional antigen-presenting cells orchestrating adaptive immune responses by antigen uptake, presentation, and costimulation of effector T cells. NK cells mediate immune-surveillance via cytotoxic effector-functions and serve as regulatory lymphocytes interacting with both innate and adaptive immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, DCs, and T lymphocytes. Particularly, CD56 bright NK subset shows little cytotoxic activity and is functionally characterized by distinctive immunoregulatory properties, being a significant source of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 10, and interleukin 13. Our findings are in accordance with previous reports on patients affected by lung cancer and advanced thymoma treated with immune-checkpoint blockadeand emphasize the relevance of innate immune cells activation in achieving benefit from immunomodulating agents. We speculate that monitoring the dynamic changes of neutrophil, NK, and DC subpopulations may identify HGG patients most likely to achieve durable clinical benefit from immunotherapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 — Hairy Cell Leukemia infection prophylaxis and neutropenia management — Anti-infective prophylaxis for a minimum of 3 months and until CD4+ T-cell count is ≥ 200 cells/mm3 is recommended for all patients requiring treatment, and broad-spectrum antibacterial prophylaxis should be considered for patients with neutropenia. Available evidence suggests that the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) shortens the duration of severe neutropenia after treatment with cladribine; however, it has no clinically significant impact on infection-related outcomes, and the use of G-CSFs either as primary prophylaxis or based on the absolute neutrophil count have been shown to be effective for the management of neutropenia. The use of G-CSF might be considered in patients with severe neutropenic fever following chemotherapy.

### Automated enumeration of immature granulocytes [^a011463a]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

The performance characteristics of the XE-2100 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) automated immature granulocyte (IG) count were studied. The automated IG count was compared with the manual morphology count and with a proposed reference flow cytometric count. The comparison data were analyzed by both least-squares and Passing-Bablok regression analysis. Long-term imprecision using preserved blood quality control specimens at different levels showed a range from 2.59% to 3.57% coefficient of variation (CV) for within-run imprecision and 3.57% to 6.85% CV for total imprecision. The within-run reproducibility performed using fresh blood on 3 different specimens showed a range from 5.55% to 8.24% CV. The counts were stable at both room temperature and after refrigeration for 24 hours. Passing-Bablok regression analysis showed excellent agreement between the proposed reference flow cytometric IG count and the XE-2100 IG count, while there was less agreement with the manual morphology count. Our results indicate that the automated IG count can replace the manual morphology count for IG counting in the clinical laboratory. The results also confirm that the flow cytometric IG count is superior to and can replace the manual morphology count as a reference method for IG counting.

A A higher neutrophil proportion was observed in individuals with TS compared to controls. B The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with TS individuals exhibiting higher NLR. NLR was categorized by levels of inflammation severity. C Neutrophil proportion across different karyotypes, showing increased levels in TS compared to all other karyotypes. D Absolute granulocyte count (CD3-, CD19-, CD14- Cells), measured by flow cytometry, were higher in TS. E NLR, based on flow cytometry measurements, placed TS in the mid to moderate inflammation category. F Correlation plot illustrating the relationship between granulocyte count and abdominal fat, in the TS group and 46, XX controls. G, H Elevated expression of neutrophil activation markers S100A8 and S100A9 in TS, indicating a primed inflammatory state. I, J Neutrophil elastase (ELANE) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were upregulated in individuals with TS, associated with chronic inflammation and NETosis. K Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) expression, involved in NETosis, was higher in TS, pointing to increased neutrophil inflammatory response.

Granulocyte measurements using Flow cytometry

As the above neutrophil levels were based on cell proportion estimations from DNAm data, we included an independent cohort consisting of 20 individuals with TS and 107 female controls (the "flow cytometry cohort"), (Fig. 1A). We quantified blood cell types, and sub-populations of immune cells using flow cytometry. Again, granulocytes (CD3-, CD19-, CD14-) were more abundant in TS (Fig. 5D). Individuals with TS had a mean GLR (granulocyte/lymphocyte-ratio) residing around low-grade inflammation, compared to a normal level in controls (Fig. 5E). B-cell and T-cell counts, both numerically and proportionally, were comparable between individuals with TS and controls (Supplementary Data 5). One B-cell subtype: IgD-, CD27-, CD38-, a type of plasmablast, was numerically and proportionally higher in individuals with TS compared to controls. Besides this, the B-cell and T-cell profile of individuals with TS was like that of healthy controls (Supplementary Data 5). In addition, the granulocyte concentration was positively correlated with abdominal fat percentage in individuals with TS (Fig. 5F).

### Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia in the molecular era: a clinician's guide to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment [^a4fa47a8]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Clinical presentation and diagnostic workup

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare and frequently fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm of early childhood with an estimated incidence of 1.2 cases per million and a median age at disease onset of ~ 2 years. Patients typically present with fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and a high circulating white blood cell (WBC) count with peripheral monocytosis and a leukoerythroblastic blood smear. Cough, bloody stools, an erythematous rash, or failure to thrive may also be observed. These symptoms are likely related to infiltration of monocytes into the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and spleen, respectively. Elevated hemoglobin F corrected for age is found in ~ 50% of patients. Apart from an extended infectious disease workup, further traditional diagnostic tools include bone marrow aspiration, a peripheral blood smear, and flow cytometry (diagnostic criteria per the 2016 Revision to World Health Organization [WHO] Classificationare summarized in Table 1). Bone marrow examination can display varying degrees of abnormal myelo- or megakaryopoiesis but must identify fewer than 20% blasts to rule out acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bone marrow findings typically include hypercellularity with granulocytic hyperplasia and full maturation of myeloid progenitors, although increased monocytes are not always present. Dysplasia can be noted across all 3 hematopoietic lineages, and reticulin fibrosis is occasionally observed. In patients with monosomy 7, a predominance of erythroid precursors can be seen. Leukoerythroblastosis is not part of the WHO criteria for diagnosis of JMML but is commonly seen on peripheral blood smear and recapitulates the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative properties of this overlap syndrome. Flow cytometry is often helpful at diagnosisto rule out other acute leukemias but does not play an important role thereafter unless the clinician is worried about progression to AML. Hyperphosphorylation of STAT5 was previously used as an adjunctive criterion for diagnosis but is not routinely offered in clinical laboratories. Similarly, hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in colony-forming assays is a hallmark laboratory feature of JMML. However, GM-CSF hypersensitivity can be present in certain viral infections, is not routinely available, is difficult to interpret even in expert hands, and is therefore rarely used to establish a clinical diagnosis of JMML. A molecular confirmation is now possible in nearly every patient with JMML.

### Hematologic profile of sepsis in neonates: neutrophil CD64 as a diagnostic marker [^32c34da2]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to determine the utility of neutrophil CD64 as a diagnostic marker for sepsis in neonates.

Methods

A prospective study that enrolled consecutive infants with suspected sepsis was performed. Complete blood count with differential, blood culture, and CD64 index measurement were performed, and neutrophil CD64 indices were correlated with the diagnoses of confirmed and suspected sepsis.

Results

There were 293 episodes of sepsis evaluations for 163 infants. Infants with sepsis episodes (confirmed or suspected; n = 40) were of greater gestational age (34.7 ± 0.9 weeks), compared with those (n = 123) with no sepsis (32.6 ± 0.5 weeks), but had similar birth weights (2325 ± 200 vs 1969 ± 94 g) and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes. There was no difference in the duration of hospitalization for the 2 groups. As expected, the hematologic profiles of sepsis episodes (n = 128) were characterized by higher white blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, absolute band counts, and immature/total neutrophil ratios but lower platelet counts. Sepsis episodes had higher neutrophil CD64 indices (5.61 ± 0.85 vs 2.63 ± 0.20). For all sepsis episodes, the CD64 index had an area under the curve, in receiver operating characteristic analysis, of 0.74; with a cutoff value of 2.30, the CD64 index in combination with the absolute neutrophil count had the highest negative predictive value (93%) for ruling out sepsis and 95% sensitivity for diagnosing sepsis. For culture-positive sepsis episodes, the CD64 index had the highest area under the curve (0.852) of all hematologic variables, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 79%, with a cutoff value of 4.02.

Conclusions

Neutrophil CD64 is a highly sensitive marker for neonatal sepsis. Prospective studies incorporating CD64 into a sepsis scoring system are warranted.

### Study details | NCT04462588 | Immature granulocyte [IG] [^d3fbfa7f]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Immature granulocytes are monitored in peripheral blood as immature polymorphonuclear cells because of the activation of bone marrow. Although their counts can be determined through direct inspection, they can be provided with automated systems within complete blood count parameters as well as technological developments. The increase in their number specifically suggests the activation of the bone marrow and can provide information about the infectious process before leukocytosis is observed. As per these results, patients with Alvarado Score 7 and above were diagnosed with acute appendicitis. Patients diagnosed with complicated acute appendicitis based on imaging methods, patients who are pregnant, patients who did not want to be included were excluded from the study. During follow-up, vital signs of patients were verified every 6 h.

At the 24th h of follow-up, the patients were asked for their complaints and physical examinations were performed. Control of complete blood count, CRP, and abdominal US were performed. At the 24th hour of the follow-up, Alvarado score was repeated to patients. Patients who had no regression in the clinic and laboratory results were considered to be unresponsive to conservative treatment and rescue appendectomy was performed. Patients with a regression in physical examination and laboratory results and those with an appendix that responded to medical treatment as per imaging methods were considered to have responded to conservative treatment; and oral intake was initiated without surgery.

Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio levels were manually calculated. The IG fraction includes promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes but not band neutrophils or myeloblasts. Moreover, DNI is the IG count to white blood cell ratio. Statistical Evaluation: IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences for windows, Version 20. 0 software package was used to evaluate statistical data. Therefore, 64 patients were required to achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 10% among IG count and percentage, the means using student t-test and repeated measures ANOVA at the 0. 05 significance level.

Type of ICI agents, oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, albumin level, platelet count, immature granulocytes, absolute monocyte, chloride level, red cell distribution width, and alcohol intake were the top 10 key predictors used by the XGBT algorithm. Conclusion Machine learning algorithms trained using routinely collected data outperformed traditional statistical models when predicting 90-day ACU. The XGBT algorithm has the potential to identify high–ACU risk patients and enable preventive interventions to avoid ACU.

46Thus, we argue that the ECOG score may be informally used to provide some insight into a patient's health status 46and, thus, risk of ACU although the score was not designed specifically for ACU risk assessment. In the absence of any other gold standard metric, it might have been that the ECOG was suitable for this purpose. Algorithm examination and interpretation. The visual calibration inspection indicated that our XGBT algorithm tended to underpredict in the range of predicted probabilities < 0. 35, whereas it overpredicted in the range of predicted probabilities ≥ 0.

The result of VI analysis indicated that the ICI agent types, variations in oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, albumin level, platelet count, immature granulocytes percentage, means of absolute monocyte and chloride level, latest red cell distribution width percentage, and alcohol use were the top 10 key predictors used by the XGBT algorithm to generate accurate outputs. The result of SHAP analysis provided further insights into how the important predictors contribute to model outputs. For a case randomly selected from the peri–COVID-19 sample, high variations in albumin level, DBP, and IGRE; mean chloride level; and last RDW-CV were distinct positive contributors for the patient, leading to a greater probability of ACU determined by our XGBT model, and can be considered as individualized ACU risk factors.

### The association of delta neutrophil index with the prognosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^160e9606]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important point in this study was that AECOPD with CAP group who were readmitted ≤ 30 days and DNI ≥ 3.5% showed the lowest cumulative survival rate compared to the other groups. ROC curve demonstrated that DNI (≥ 3.5%) with readmission duration (≤ 30 days) can affect the mortality of AECOPD patients who were readmitted.

Currently, initial DNI with serum WBC and CRP which are commonly used markers is known to be useful for predicting inflammation and infection. DNI, the difference between the leukocyte differentials measured in cytochemical myeloperoxidase channel and those assayed in the nuclear lobularity channel, reflects the fraction of circulating immature granulocytes. Previous study reported that granulocyte precursors less mature than bands can be a better predictor of infection than band neutrophil counts. The diagnostic value of DNI (reflecting the fraction of circulating immature granulocytes) was superior to WBC, absolute neutrophil count or other widely available laboratory markers for severe sepsis/septic shock.

Many clinicians have studied the usefulness of blood biomarkers such as CRP and procalcitonin for early assessment of sepsis. Recently, systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the DNI has prognostic value in adults with sepsis and high DNI values tend to be associated with mortality in septic patients. Several studies have been reported to use DNI for the diagnosis or prognosis of other infectious diseases including pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and acute prostatitis. However, there are no reports on the usefulness of DNI in COPD patients. In our paper, we focused on the AECOPD patients who readmitted within 180 days of discharge.

The observational study showed that the readmission for AECOPD within 30 days is associated with a progressive increased long-term risk of death. In this study, ROC curve showed that DNI was a useful biologic marker for predicting the mortality rate of AECOPD in addition to readmission within 30 days. DNI levels were higher in AECOPD with CAP patients than without CAP. This indicates that DNI levels are associated with infection even in AECOPD. However, the mortality rate was the highest in patients readmitted within 30 days, suggesting that readmission within 30 days had a greater impact on prognosis than DNI level.

### Association between elevated white blood cell counts and thrombotic events in polycythemia vera: analysis from REVEAL [^1bf93daf]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

REVEAL represents the largest prospective observational cohort of patients with PV to date. This analysis of data from REVEAL helped evaluate the association of hematocrit level, WBC count, platelet count, and absolute neutrophil count with TE risk in patients with PV. The results demonstrate significant associations in individual models between elevated hematocrit levels, elevated WBC count, and elevated absolute neutrophil count and TE risk. Similar associations with TE risk were observed in models of sustained elevation of hematocrit levels, WBC count, and absolute neutrophil count, supporting the conclusion that these associations are not because of transient changes in blood counts. Although a significant association was observed between a platelet count elevation > 400 × 10 9 /L and TE risk, the association was not maintained for a platelet count > 600 × 10 9 /L or for a sustained platelet count > 400 × 10 9 /L. Importantly, when the hematocrit level was controlled at ≤ 45%, a WBC count > 11 × 10 9 /L was associated with an approximately twofold increase in TE risk vs WBC count ≤ 11 × 10 9 /L; although this association was not significant, using a WBC count threshold of > 12 × 10 9 /L did result in a significant association with TE risk. Advanced age and a history of TEs were also significantly associated with increased TE risk across all models evaluated, whereas male sex was associated with decreased TE risk.

The present results are consistent with previous observations of hematocrit, advanced age, and history of TE as risk factors for TE, and support the inclusion of WBC count as an additional risk factor. Multiple prior studies have investigated the association of elevated WBC counts with the risk of TE with mixed results (summarized in supplemental Table 5). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 40 studies indicated that associations between leukocytosis and risk of thrombosis are inconclusive, which was suggested to be because of inconsistency among the studies in how WBC thresholds were selected with respect to prognostic accuracy. Although a randomized, controlled trial investigating the efficacy of WBC count control on TE reduction has yet to be performed, the recent prospective, interventional MAJIC-PV study found that patients who achieved normalization of all blood counts had significantly longer TE-free survival than patients who did not reach this end point. These observations, together with the present results from REVEAL, support the notion that TE risk can be reduced by controlling both hematocrit level and WBC count.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^df0ee864]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Factors that affect absolute CD4 count — basis, variability, and preferred parameter: The absolute CD4 count is a calculated value based on the total white blood cell (WBC) count and the percentages of total and CD4 T lymphocytes, and this absolute number may fluctuate or be influenced by factors affecting WBC count and lymphocyte percentages, such as use of bone marrow–suppressive medications, chronic corticosteroids, or acute infections; splenectomy or coinfection with human T-lymphotropic virus type I may cause misleadingly elevated CD4 counts, and in these settings CD4 percentage remains stable and may be a more appropriate parameter to assess a person's immune function.

### Granulocyte transfusions for preventing infections in people with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction [^3d47873e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite modern antimicrobials and supportive therapy, bacterial and fungal infections are still major complications in people with prolonged disease-related or therapy-related neutropenia. Since the late 1990s there has been increasing demand for donated granulocyte transfusions to treat or prevent severe infections in people who lack their own functional granulocytes. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions compared with a control population not receiving this intervention for preventing all-cause mortality, mortality due to infection, and evidence of infection due to infection or due to any other cause in people with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil function.

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), theTransfusion Evidence Library (from 1980) and ongoing trial databases to April 20 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing people receiving granulocyte transfusions to prevent the development of infection with a control group receiving no granulocyte transfusions. Neonates are the subject of another Cochrane review and were excluded from this review. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, but this review focuses on mortality, mortality due to infection and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. One trial is still ongoing, leaving a total of 11 trials eligible involving 653 participants. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2006 and enrolled participants from fairly comparable patient populations. None of the studies included people with neutrophil dysfunction. Ten studies included only adults, and two studies included children and adults. Ten of these studies contained separate data for each arm and were able to be critically appraised. One study re-randomised people and therefore quantitative analysis was unable to be performed. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low to low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to many of the studies being at high risk of bias, and many of the outcome estimates being imprecise. All-cause mortality was reported for nine studies (609 participants). There was no difference in all-cause mortality over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (seven studies; 437 participants; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.36, very low-quality evidence). Mortality due to infection was reported for seven studies (398 participants). There was no difference in mortality due to infection over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (six studies; 286 participants; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44, very low-quality evidence). The number of people with localised or systemic bacterial or fungal infections was reported for nine studies (609 participants). There were differences between the granulocyte dose subgroups (test for subgroup differences P = 0.01). There was no difference in the number of people with infections over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not in the low-dose granulocyte group (< 1.0 x 10(10) granulocytes per day) (four studies, 204 participants; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.20; very low-quality evidence). There was a decreased number of people with infections over 30 days in the people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions in the intermediate-dose granulocyte group (1.0 x 10(10) to 4.0 x 10(10) granulocytes per day) (4 studies; 293 participants; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63, low-quality evidence). There was a decreased number of participants with bacteraemia and fungaemia in the participants receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (nine studies; 609 participants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.65, low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants with localised bacterial or fungal infection in the participants receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (six studies; 296 participants; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; very low-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were only reported for participants receiving granulocyte transfusions and donors of granulocyte transfusions.

Authors' Conclusions

In people who are neutropenic due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or a haematopoietic stem cell transplant, there is low-grade evidence that prophylactic granulocyte transfusions decrease the risk of bacteraemia or fungaemia. There is low-grade evidence that the effect of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions may be dose-dependent, a dose of at least 10 x 10(10) per day being more effective at decreasing the risk of infection. There is insufficient evidence to determine any difference in mortality rates due to infection, all-cause mortality, or serious adverse events.

### Low blood counts: immune mediated, idiopathic, or myelodysplasia [^29cdd94f]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Traditionally, cytopenias are classified as deficiency mediated, immune mediated, BM failure induced, renal, or idiopathic, with the latter including the so-called idiopathic cytopenias of undetermined significance (ICUS). Clinical findings, symptoms, blood counts, BM findings, and other laboratory parameters are usually sufficient to reveal the type and cause of a marked cytopenia. However, in patients with chronic mild cytopenia, it may be a challenge for the physician to establish a correct diagnosis. In such patients, laboratory features and findings often reflect a diagnostic interface, so that criteria that are otherwise robust may hardly be applicable or are not helpful. Even if the BM is examined, the diagnosis often remains uncertain in these patients. In addition, more than one potential cause of cytopenia may be present, especially in the elderly. A myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or another BM disorder, but also an overt autoimmune or other inflammatory disease, may develop during follow-up in these patients. A key problem is that in an early phase of MDS, most laboratory and clinical signs are "nonspecific". One of the very few reliable peripheral blood parameters distinguishing between an early or "pre-phase" of MDS and most other causes of a mild cytopenia are the numbers of circulating colony-forming progenitor cells. In addition, flow cytometric and molecular investigations may sometimes assist in the delineation between clonal and reactive conditions underlying mild cytopenias. This review provides an overview of diagnostic approaches and algorithms for patients with mild unexplained cytopenia(s).
