## Question

management of stress induced secondary adrenal insufficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of stress-induced secondary adrenal insufficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and thresholds. Next, I will outline chronic replacement therapy, followed by stress-dosing strategies across severities. After that, I need to check tapering and recovery monitoring. Finally, I should confirm patient education, special populations, and summarize a practical algorithm, making sure I cite the most authoritative guidelines and reviews throughout.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the condition. "Stress-induced secondary adrenal insufficiency" most accurately maps to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, also called tertiary adrenal insufficiency, which arises from exogenous glucocorticoids suppressing the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis; this is the most common form of adrenal insufficiency in adults, with risk rising with dose, duration, potency, route, and individual susceptibility, and recovery can take months to years after cessation [^86136e90] [^5057e1c1] [^be8f470f].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment. In patients on or tapering glucocorticoids, I should suspect GIAI when symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, weight loss, or hypotension occur, especially during intercurrent illness or after withdrawal; biochemical confirmation typically uses an 8–9 am serum cortisol after holding glucocorticoids for at least 24 hours, interpreting values as > 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) suggesting recovery, 150–300 nmol/L (5–10 μg/dL) as indeterminate, and < 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) as persistent suppression; dynamic testing with 250 μg ACTH can be considered if indeterminate, but I need to ensure glucocorticoids are held for 24 hours to avoid interference [^84dad82b] [^bbe8c57b] [^2ed99688].

> Hold on, I should verify chronic replacement therapy details. For stable, non-acute GIAI, physiologic glucocorticoid replacement aims to mimic circadian cortisol rhythms using hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/day in two or three divided doses, or prednisone/prednisolone 3–5 mg/day once or twice daily; dexamethasone is generally avoided for chronic replacement due to difficulty with dose titration and Cushingoid effects, and fludrocortisone is not indicated because mineralocorticoid function is preserved in secondary/tertiary AI [^a4c7096e] [^b0f1ffd0] [^aaf1cdff] [^58fa401e].

> I need to ensure stress-dosing logic is precise. For minor stress (e.g., fever < 38°C, mild infection, minor procedures under local anesthesia without GI upset), I should double the physiologic dose to about hydrocortisone 40 mg/day in divided doses for 2–5 days, adjusting for whatever baseline glucocorticoid the patient is already taking; if already on ≥ 40 mg/day hydrocortisone or equivalent, additional increase may not be needed unless unstable [^780faa94] [^5ec37ee5].

> For moderate stress, let me think about parenteral coverage. For moderate illness, major infection, trauma, or procedures under regional anesthesia, I should use parenteral glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone 50–75 mg IV every 6–8 hours or 100–200 mg/day by continuous infusion, continuing until the stress resolves and the patient is clinically stable; this aligns with perioperative and critical care guidance for secondary AI and GIAI [^6f4a997a] [^2a3779af] [^e06e2ac6].

> But wait, what if this is adrenal crisis? I should confirm the emergency protocol. Suspected adrenal crisis warrants immediate hydrocortisone 100 mg IV or IM, followed by 200 mg hydrocortisone per 24 hours by continuous infusion or 50 mg every 6 hours, plus aggressive isotonic saline resuscitation; treatment must not be delayed for labs, and this applies to GIAI as well as primary/secondary AI [^411cd97d] [^cb26e7a5] [^2a3779af].

> Next, I should review tapering and recovery monitoring so I don't miss the window for HPA recovery. Tapering should proceed only when the underlying disease is controlled; short courses under 3–4 weeks can usually be stopped without testing, whereas longer courses should be tapered to a physiologic dose (about prednisone 4–6 mg/day or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/day) and then either gradually tapered with clinical monitoring or assessed with morning cortisol; recovery can take 2–4 years in some cases, and persistent suppression beyond 4 years suggests unlikely recovery and continued replacement [^5dfc9453] [^4c73f223] [^586e3d63] [^980f0422].

> I should double-check patient education elements because crises often reflect knowledge gaps. All patients at risk should receive written sick-day rules, a steroid emergency card, medical alert identification, and access to injectable hydrocortisone with training for self- or caregiver-administration; education should be reinforced at each visit, and patients should know to double or triple doses during febrile illness and to seek urgent care if vomiting prevents oral intake [^86c1c079] [^22c0a0bd] [^202dcccf] [^7b1d5730].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In pregnancy, labor represents major stress and warrants parenteral hydrocortisone coverage similar to major surgery; in pediatrics, stress dosing is weight- or surface area–based with hydrocortisone 50 mg/m² IV/IM for crisis and 50–100 mg/m²/day divided q6h, with oral stress dosing scaled to double or triple physiologic replacement during illness; in perioperative care, patients on or recently on glucocorticoids should receive stress-dose coverage tailored to procedure severity, with many centers using hydrocortisone 100 mg IV pre-op for major surgery and tapering over 24–72 hours as clinically indicated [^ce670c09] [^6f4a997a] [^e06e2ac6].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating GIAI with CIRCI. Critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency is a distinct entity with different diagnostic criteria and indications for low-dose hydrocortisone in septic shock; it should not be confused with pre-existing HPA axis suppression from exogenous steroids, and management pathways differ accordingly [^529b6537].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Identify patients at risk based on dose, duration, and route of glucocorticoids; confirm suspected GIAI with morning cortisol after 24-hour hold and consider ACTH testing if indeterminate; initiate physiologic replacement when indicated; provide education and emergency kit; for stress, escalate to double physiologic orally for minor stress and parenteral hydrocortisone for moderate-to-major stress or crisis; during taper, monitor clinically or with morning cortisol and refer to endocrinology if suppression persists beyond 1 year or if adrenal crisis occurs [^84dad82b] [^5ec37ee5] [^2ed99688] [^980f0422].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and correct any earlier overstatements. GIAI is common and preventable; recovery is variable and can be prolonged; stress-dosing must be individualized to the severity of illness and the patient's baseline regimen; and education is the cornerstone of crisis prevention, with a low threshold to treat suspected adrenal crisis immediately rather than waiting for labs [^86136e90] [^5057e1c1] [^cb26e7a5].

Stress-induced secondary adrenal insufficiency is best managed by **stress-dose glucocorticoids** during illness or surgery, with **hydrocortisone 100 mg IV/IM** for suspected adrenal crisis, followed by 200 mg/day IV/IM in divided doses until stable, plus aggressive IV fluids [^2a3779af] [^411cd97d]. For minor stress, **double the usual dose** (e.g. hydrocortisone 40 mg/day in divided doses) for 2–3 days; for moderate stress, use 50–75 mg/day IV/IM in divided doses; for major stress or surgery, use 100–200 mg/day IV/IM in divided doses, tapering as the stress resolves [^5ec37ee5] [^6f4a997a]. Educate patients on sick-day rules, provide emergency hydrocortisone, and ensure close follow-up to adjust therapy and monitor recovery of HPA axis function [^86c1c079] [^202dcccf].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Clinical features include fatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, and hyponatremia; **adrenal crisis** presents with severe hypotension, shock, altered mental status, and electrolyte disturbances [^85a13890]. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion plus **morning cortisol and ACTH**; cortisol < 5 mcg/dL suggests insufficiency, 5–10 mcg/dL is indeterminate, and > 10 mcg/dL makes insufficiency unlikely. Confirm with ACTH stimulation if needed, and interpret results in clinical context [^84dad82b] [^bbe8c57b].

---

## General principles of management

- **Glucocorticoid replacement**: Use hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/day in 2–3 divided doses, or prednisone 3–5 mg/day once or twice daily; avoid dexamethasone due to difficulty with dose titration and Cushingoid effects [^a4c7096e] [^b0f1ffd0] [^aaf1cdff].

- **Mineralocorticoid replacement**: Not required in secondary adrenal insufficiency because aldosterone production is usually preserved [^58fa401e].

- **Patient education**: Teach sick-day rules, provide emergency hydrocortisone, and ensure medical alert identification [^86c1c079] [^22c0a0bd].

## Management of stress-induced secondary adrenal insufficiency

### Stress dosing guidelines

Stress dosing should be **individualized** based on the severity of stress, baseline glucocorticoid dose, and clinical judgment [^2a3779af].

| **Severity of stress** | **Recommended stress dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Minor stress (e.g. mild infection, fever < 38°C, minor procedures) | Double usual dose (e.g. hydrocortisone 40 mg/day in divided doses) | 2–3 days |
| Moderate stress (e.g. moderate infection, fever > 38°C, minor surgery) | 50–75 mg/day IV/IM in divided doses | 3–5 days |
| Major stress (e.g. major surgery, severe infection, trauma, adrenal crisis) | 100–200 mg/day IV/IM in divided doses or continuous infusion | Until stable, then taper |

---

### Acute adrenal crisis management

- **Immediate treatment**: Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV/IM bolus, followed by 200 mg/day IV/IM in divided doses or continuous infusion [^2a3779af] [^411cd97d].

- **Fluid resuscitation**: Aggressive IV normal saline to correct hypovolemia and electrolyte disturbances [^cb26e7a5].

- **Monitoring**: Continuous hemodynamic monitoring, frequent electrolyte checks, and glucose assessment [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Perioperative management**: Patients undergoing surgery require stress-dose glucocorticoids based on surgical severity, typically 100 mg hydrocortisone IV before anesthesia, followed by 200 mg/day IV in divided doses, tapering as recovery allows [^6f4a997a] [^e06e2ac6].

- **Pregnancy**: Physiological changes increase cortisol needs; stress dosing is recommended during labor and delivery, similar to major surgical stress [^ce670c09].

- **Pediatric patients**: Stress dosing is weight-based, typically hydrocortisone 50–100 mg/m²/day IV/IM in divided doses during stress or crisis [^6f4a997a].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical assessment should track **signs of over- or under-replacement**, blood pressure, electrolytes, and glucose. HPA axis recovery can be monitored with morning cortisol or ACTH stimulation testing when clinically indicated, especially during glucocorticoid tapering or withdrawal [^84dad82b] [^bbe8c57b]. Patient education should be reinforced at each visit, covering stress dosing, emergency management, and when to seek medical attention [^202dcccf].

---

## Potential complications of inadequate management

Inadequate stress dosing can precipitate **adrenal crisis**, a life-threatening emergency with high morbidity and mortality [^38b36067]. Chronic under-replacement leads to persistent fatigue, weight loss, and impaired quality of life, whereas over-replacement increases risks of Cushingoid features, osteoporosis, and metabolic complications [^870122dc].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Stress dosing**: Tailor to stress severity, doubling for minor stress, 50–75 mg/day for moderate stress, and 100–200 mg/day for major stress or crisis [^5ec37ee5] [^2a3779af].

- **Adrenal crisis**: Immediate hydrocortisone 100 mg IV/IM, followed by 200 mg/day IV/IM, plus aggressive fluids [^2a3779af] [^411cd97d].

- **Patient education**: Essential for prevention and early intervention; provide emergency hydrocortisone and medical alert identification [^86c1c079] [^22c0a0bd].

- **Monitoring**: Regular clinical and biochemical assessment to guide therapy and detect HPA axis recovery [^84dad82b] [^bbe8c57b].

---

Effective management of stress-induced secondary adrenal insufficiency hinges on **timely stress dosing**, rapid treatment of adrenal crisis, and ongoing patient education and monitoring to prevent complications and support HPA axis recovery.

Adrenal insufficiency, primarily presenting as an adrenal crisis, is a life-threatening emergency and requires prompt therapeutic management including fluid resuscitation and stress dose hydrocortisone administration. Primary adrenal insufficiency is most frequently caused by autoimmune adrenalitis, and hypothalamic-pituitary tumors represent the most frequent cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, the exact underlying diagnosis needs to be confirmed by a stepwise diagnostic approach, with an open eye for other differential diagnostic possibilities. Chronic replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and, in primary adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoids requires careful monitoring. However, current replacement strategies still require optimization as evidenced by recent studies demonstrating significantly impaired subjective health status and increased mortality in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Future studies will have to explore the potential of dehydroepiandrosterone replacement and modified delayed-release hydrocortisone to improve the prospects of patients with adrenal insufficiency.

### Approach to the patient with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^5057e1c1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by exogenous glucocorticoid suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and is the most prevalent form of adrenal insufficiency. The condition is important to diagnose given the risk of life-threatening adrenal crisis and impact on patients' quality of life. The diagnosis is made with a stimulation test such as the ACTH test. Until now, testing for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency has often been based on clinical suspicion rather than routinely but accumulating evidence indicates that a significant number of cases will remain unrecognized. During ongoing oral glucocorticoid treatment or initially after withdrawal, ~50% of patients have adrenal insufficiency, but, outside clinical studies, ≤ 1% of patients have adrenal testing recorded. More than 70% of cases are identified during acute hospital admission, where the diagnosis can easily be missed because symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are nonspecific and overlap those of the underlying and intercurrent conditions. Treatment of severe glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should follow the principles for treatment of central adrenal insufficiency. The clinical implications and thus indication to treat mild-moderate adrenal deficiency after glucocorticoid withdrawal has not been established. Also, the indication of adding stress dosages of glucocorticoid during ongoing glucocorticoid treatment remains unclear. In patients with established glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, high rates of poor confidence in self-management and delayed glucocorticoid administration in the acute setting with an imminent adrenal crisis call for improved awareness and education of clinicians and patients. This article reviews different facets of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and discusses approaches to the condition in common clinical situations.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — management during suspected adrenal crisis or stress specifies that for suspected adrenal crisis give hydrocortisone 100mg injection I.V. or I.M. followed by hydrocortisone 200mg infusion over 24 hours and provide fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline solution; hydrocortisone infusion should be continued only in patients with confirmed adrenal crisis. During prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea without haemodynamic instability, absorption of oral glucocorticoids may be reduced and parenteral glucocorticoids should be considered to prevent adrenal crisis. For moderate to major stress, parenteral glucocorticoids are required until the stress has resolved to prevent adrenal crisis. For minor stress, extra glucocorticoids may not be needed for some patients already on glucocorticoids, whereas other patients should increase their daily glucocorticoid dose until the stress has resolved; in all cases, the need for extra cover and regimen must be guided by individual patient requirements and clinical judgment.

### Guidelines for the management of glucocorticoids during the peri-operative period for patients with adrenal insufficiency: guidelines from the association of anaesthetists, the royal college of physicians and the society for endocrinology UK [^e06e2ac6]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

These guidelines aim to ensure that patients with adrenal insufficiency are identified and adequately supplemented with glucocorticoids during the peri-operative period. There are two major categories of adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is due to diseases of the adrenal gland (failure of the hormone-producing gland), and secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion by the pituitary gland, or deficient corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion by the hypothalamus (failure of the regulatory centres). Patients taking physiological replacement doses of corticosteroids for either primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency are at significant risk of adrenal crisis and must be given stress doses of hydrocortisone during the peri-operative period. Many more patients other than those with adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary causes of adrenal failure are receiving glucocorticoids as treatment for other medical conditions. Daily doses of prednisolone of 5 mg or greater in adults and 10–15 mg.m -2 hydrocortisone equivalent or greater in children may result in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression if administered for 1 month or more by oral, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular or topical routes; this chronic administration of glucocorticoids is the most common cause of secondary adrenal suppression, sometimes referred to as tertiary adrenal insufficiency. A pragmatic approach to adrenal replacement during major stress is required; considering the evidence available, blanket recommendations would not be appropriate, and it is essential for the clinician to remember that adrenal replacement dosing following surgical stress or illness is in addition to usual steroid treatment. Patients with previously undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency sometimes present for the first time following the stress of surgery. Anaesthetists must be familiar with the symptoms and signs of acute adrenal insufficiency so that inadequate supplementation or undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency can be detected and treated promptly. Delays may prove fatal.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^c6ba4508]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — acute stress dosing and suspected adrenal crisis management states that parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. Good clinical practice.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^58fa401e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Prior studies have shown that adrenal insufficiency may last even up to 2–4 years after glucocorticoid cessation, owing to slow recovery of adrenal cortisol production. Persistent impairment of cortisol secretion beyond four years suggests that recovery of adrenal function is very unlikely and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued. Additional regular testing beyond four years may not be helpful but can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

The panel suggests that patients with persistent adrenal insufficiency while on physiologic daily dose equivalent of glucocorticoids for longer than one year should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist to assess for underlying causes of adrenal insufficiency other than glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (eg, pituitary causes). The panel suggests that patients who experience an adrenal crisis while on glucocorticoids should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone (Table 1). Furthermore, it is necessary to provide education to these patients regarding the adjustment of glucocorticoid substitution therapy doses during stressful situations to prevent adrenal crises or to manage them (see Section 3).

R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

Rationale

Secretion of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone is largely regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and potassium levels. Accordingly, mineralocorticoid function is expected to be preserved in glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, as in other forms of secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. Substitution therapy with fludrocortisone is not indicated.

3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^5ec37ee5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

As discussed in sections R1.2, R1.3, and R3.2, patients need to be educated on stress dosing of glucocorticoids aiming to prevent adrenal crises and their negative sequelae (Fig. 3). Potential adrenal insufficiency and the need for stress dosing should be considered even after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy and replacement, particularly in those patients that had not undergone biochemical testing to confirm recovery of the HPA-axis. Based on a retrospective analysis mortality is increased particularly in the immediate period following the cessation of glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency who are under minor stress (eg, fever, infection requiring antibiotics, physical trauma, significant emotional stress) not leading to hemodynamic instability and with no evidence of oral glucocorticoid malabsorption (vomiting, diarrhea) or are undergoing a surgical procedure under local anesthesia will require coverage with stress dose of oral glucocorticoids (as a general guide, see Table 8). The recommended stress dose of hydrocortisone is the same as for patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency of other etiology: patients should receive double the physiologic replacement dose (ie, hydrocortisone 40 mg daily, usually split in three doses 20 mg on rising, 10 mg 12 midday, 10 mg 5). In patients using other glucocorticoid formulations, a dose equivalent to 40 mg hydrocortisone is suggested and this regime needs to be offered for the duration of the stress period eg, prednisone 10 mg total daily dose to be given in one or two divided doses (as a general guide, see Table 8). Particularly for patients undergoing surgery under general or regional anesthesia associated with long recovery time, parenteral stress doses of hydrocortisone or equivalent doses of other glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone are recommended (as a general guide, see Table 8). We base our suggested stress-dose glucocorticoid regimens on clinical practice and the guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists, the Royal College of Physicians, the Endocrine Society and the Society for Endocrinology UK. However, we acknowledge that in the absence of robust evidence and head-to-head comparison of different glucocorticoid regimens, practices vary considerably among centers and lower doses are also routinely used in patients under moderate or major stress.

### Critical illness-induced corticosteroid insufficiency: what It is not and what It could Be [^529b6537]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

What Is CIRCI Likely Not? Back to the Case Presentations…

First, the term critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency or CIRCI should not be used to describe impaired function of the HPA axis already present prior to the onset of a critical illness which is exacerbated by an acute triggering event. In case 1, the patient was likely suffering from a pre-existing (undiagnosed/untreated/latent) intrinsic disease affecting the HPA axis (eg, Addison's disease) which led to a full-blown adrenal crisis triggered by the elective nephrectomy, which may have included ipsilateral adrenalectomy. People with latent diseases affecting the HPA axis should always be monitored carefully in the peri-operative phase after elective surgery but also when admitted in an urgent setting (eg, trauma or burn victims). Appropriate treatment should be given promptly when an adrenal crisis is suspected (clinical practice guidelines; primary, secondary, and tertiary adrenal insufficiency is reviewed in; Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Diagnostic approach and steroid treatment for suspected adrenal crisis, refractory septic shock and critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency.

In case 2, we briefly described a prototypical phenotype of an emergency ICU admission of a patient with septic shock. According to the in 2017 established guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CIRCI, despite lack of consensus on a single test to reliably diagnose CIRCI, the patient's increment in plasma total cortisol of ≤ 9 µg/dL after ACTH stimulation could be interpreted as relative adrenal insufficiency or CIRCI, as it was rebranded back then (Fig. 1). However, as explained in the introduction and reviewed in, the low increment in plasma total cortisol is likely the result of a substantial increase in cortisol distribution volume, rather than of an already maximally stimulated adrenal cortex that is unable to produce more glucocorticoids. Hence, a low increment in total cortisol in response to ACTH is thus merely indicative of the high severity of illness. The observed hemodynamic response to the administered stress doses of glucocorticoids, most clearly vasoconstriction allowing reducing of the dose of vasopressors, is a pharmacological effect and this does not necessarily mean that the endogenously produced amount of glucocorticoids would be insufficient. The lack of a uniform mortality benefit across several RCTs questions whether the observed pharmacological hemodynamic effects of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in patients suffering from septic shock are also clinically relevant for patient-centered outcomes. In line with these findings, most recent surviving sepsis guidelines suggest as a weak recommendation to only initiate hydrocortisone treatment in septic shock patients with ongoing and high vasopressor need, without performing an ACTH stimulation test.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^3fd5ebf9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Clinicians prescribing long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy should actively educate their patients about the potential development of adverse manifestations associated with exogenous Cushing syndrome during extended use. Furthermore, patients need to be informed about the risks of adrenal insufficiency, especially when tapering glucocorticoid medication below the physiologic daily dose equivalent (see Definitions section). Clinicians should also provide comprehensive guidance on the importance of stress dosing with glucocorticoids. (see recommendation 3.1). Informing patients of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids and methods to monitor and mitigate these outcomes is crucial to enhancing the beneficial aspects of glucocorticoid therapy while minimizing the undesired adverse events and risks thereof. Education on stress and emergency dosing can prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hospitalizations for adrenal crises. Lastly, all patients initiating a glucocorticoid taper should be educated on the possibility of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal have substantial overlap with symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and in some cases a disease flare, and can impede the tapering of glucocorticoids (see recommendation 2.3). Anticipation of these potential symptoms can increase awareness and minimize the need for urgent care.

R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^c08fa99f]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Overview of topics to discuss when prescribing oral glucocorticoids describes that all patients on long-term supraphysiologic therapy should be counseled on the risk for developing exogenous Cushing syndrome at the time of initiation with education on common sequelae including weight gain, sarcopenia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and bone demineralization; the table also lists the risk for developing chronic adrenal insufficiency with emphasis that even transient adrenal insufficiency requires education to raise awareness of the need to stress dose when appropriate; for education on stress dosing strategies, eligible patients are those who have reduced dosing to physiologic or subphysiologic levels and should receive dedicated education at least when dosing approaches a physiologic range to prepare for routine and emergent stress dosing; education on injectable emergency glucocorticoid administration is included among considerations; and for glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, eligible patients are those ready to begin tapering at the time tapering begins, noting that some patients experience symptoms as the doses are tapered.

Glucocorticoid tapering and persistent adrenal insufficiency — patients with a history of glucocorticoid treatment/exposure presenting with manifestations of Cushing syndrome should be assumed to have a fully suppressed hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and managed accordingly, and we suggest evaluation by an endocrinology specialist if there is no recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent and also for patients on glucocorticoids with a history of adrenal crisis. Adrenal insufficiency may last even up to 2–4 years after cessation, and persistent impairment beyond four years suggests recovery is very unlikely and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued, with additional testing beyond four years considered case-by-case. Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone, and education is necessary on adjusting substitution doses during stressful situations to prevent or manage adrenal crises.

Treatment of secondary adrenal insufficiency

If glucocorticoid‐induced AI is diagnosed, treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. In an acutely unwell patient, urgent rehydration and hydrocortisone administration are required. For chronic AI, glucocorticoid replacement is indicated and should be administered in such a way as to replicate circadian cortisol production as much as possible. Typically, hydrocortisone or prednisolone is used. Since the recovery of HPA axis function is possible, patients with AI consequent on exogenous glucocorticoid use should not automatically be assumed to require lifelong, chronic corticosteroid replacement; weaning/tapering may be feasible. In addition, in some patients, full corticosteroid replacement may only be necessary in emergencies or in situations of stress or illness. Patient and caregiver education is therefore vital in cases of AI; patients must understand their condition and how their needs for glucocorticoid replacement change because of stress, illness or trauma. A key element of the safe management of AI is ensuring that the patient, their relatives and healthcare professionals are alert to the possibility of AI and the need to rapidly intervene to prevent deterioration. Accordingly, the use of 'steroid cards', emergency bracelets/necklaces and the provision of 'steroid rescue packs' containing additional oral and parenteral glucocorticoid are strongly recommended.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency is the most common subtype of adrenal insufficiency; it is caused by certain medications and pituitary destruction (pituitary masses, inflammation, or infiltration) and is rarely associated with certain germline variants. In this review, we discuss the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical presentation of secondary adrenal insufficiency and focus on the diagnostic and management challenges. We also review the management of selected special populations of patients and discuss patient-important outcomes associated with secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — important considerations and stress precautions: The figure states that the proposed cortisol cut-offs are only a guide and may vary according to the cortisol assay used and local protocols, that they only apply to patients who are not under major stress, and that they do not apply to subjects with abnormal CBG and albumin. Footnotes add that exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of the physiologic replacement dose range; that some patients with cortisol values close to the proposed 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) cut-off may have suboptimal cortisol response when exposed to major stress, so clinicians should rely on clinical judgment, offer stress glucocorticoid coverage, and that dynamic testing may also be considered; and that some patients may develop glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms and may benefit from gradual tapering rather than abrupt discontinuation.

Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it "necessitates careful education and management of affected patients." Tapering "can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency," and "in general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly with a supraphysiological dosage range, followed by a slower taper when on physiologic glucocorticoid dosing." The "degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure" and "recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals."

Primary adrenal insufficiency (adrenalitis) with immune checkpoint inhibitors — recognition, evaluation, and management focus on urgent identification, careful diagnostic timing around recent glucocorticoid exposure, and severity-based steroid replacement. Early recognition is emphasized due to hemodynamic and electrolyte risks, and distinguishing primary from secondary adrenal insufficiency is important because mineralocorticoid replacement may be required for primary disease. Pretest probability should guide interpretation, and clinicians should exclude recent dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids that can suppress cortisol for up to 72 hours; empiric hydrocortisone (HC) can be given with retesting off HC for 18–24 hours. Management by severity includes physiologic HC dosing for mild symptoms (15–25 mg/d in divided doses) with continuation of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and for suspected adrenal crisis hospitalization with 100 mg intravenous HC and fluids followed by 200 mg per 24 hours of HC via continuous infusion or 6‑hourly injections of 50 mg. Most patients with primary adrenal insufficiency require fludrocortisone (0.05–0.2 mg/d) titrated to prevent orthostatic hypotension, refractory hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia; patients should receive counseling on stress dosing and an adrenal action plan, and clinicians should be aware of adrenal crisis risk when starting levothyroxine due to increased cortisol clearance.

### Are guidelines for glucocorticoid coverage in adrenal insufficiency currently followed? [^46bd3618]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To search for evidence of acute adrenal failure linked to inappropriate use of stress management protocols.

Study Design

Patients followed up for primary adrenal insufficiency (n = 102) or secondary adrenal insufficiency (n = 34) between 1973 and 2007 were included. All hospitalizations, both urgent (n = 157) and elective (n = 90), were examined. We recorded clinical evidence of acute adrenal failure, parental management before admission, and details of glucocorticoid prescription and administration in the hospital setting.

Results

For urgent hospitalizations, subgroup and time period did not influence the percentage of patients hospitalized (primary adrenal insufficiency 45%; secondary adrenal insufficiency 38%; P = 0.55). The use of stress glucocorticoid doses by parents increased significantly after 1997 (P < .05), although still only 47% increased glucocorticoids before hospitalization. Stress doses were more frequently administered on arrival in our emergency department after 1990 (P < .05); patients with signs or symptoms of acute adrenal failure decreased to 27% after 1997 (P < .01). Twenty-four percent of all hospitalizations were marked by suboptimal adherence to glucocorticoid stress protocols, with rare but significant clinical consequences.

Conclusions

In spite of an increased use of glucocorticoid stress dose protocols by parents and physicians, patients remain at risk of morbidity and death from acute adrenal failure. This risk may be minimized with conscientious application of stress protocols, but other patient-specific risk factors may also be implicated.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — future research priorities include improving the evidence base and harmonizing cortisol testing. The document states that evidence for most recommendations is low or very low and calls for epidemiology research to define the true risk of adrenal clinical crisis and long-term consequences. It indicates that biomedical and psychosocial research to understand glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted to better differentiate it from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and that more research is needed to identify glucocorticoids with less hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression and to explore therapeutic strategies such as concurrent HPA axis stimulation to prevent suppression. For diagnostics, it notes a need for harmonization of cortisol assays and asks for cut-off values to be established using mass spectrometry and for clinical care to adapt this measurement for routine cortisol measurements.

Clinical practice points — adrenal insufficiency (AI) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs): Primary AI can present with adrenal crisis and electrolyte abnormalities, and distinguishing primary from secondary AI guides mineralocorticoid use; testing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), aldosterone, and renin is helpful. A low morning cortisol may be diagnostic at "3 to 4 ug/dL," and an elevated ACTH can confirm primary AI, though exogenous steroids or concomitant secondary AI must be considered if levels are equivocal. Patients should receive education on stress dosing and be treated with higher parenteral doses during major procedures or acute hospitalization.

R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation.

Suggested glucocorticoid regimens in patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency during exposure to stress

Rationale

Adrenal crisis (also known as acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis) can occur in patients taking oral supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, if drug availability suddenly decreases (eg, missed doses, gastroenteritis). It is a life-threatening emergency that must be promptly recognized and treated. Therefore, timely therapy is essential and takes precedence over the evaluation for other causes of symptoms that are in accordance with adrenal crisis. Adrenal crisis is characterized by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce enough cortisol to respond appropriately to stressors such as infections, trauma, and surgery (Table 9). The pathophysiology of adrenal crisis is complex and not fully understood, but it is invariably characterized by volume depletion and vasoplegia resulting in hypotension and — if left untreated — shock and eventually death. Adrenal crisis can occur not only in patients treated with oral glucocorticoids but also in patients receiving only inhaled, topical, intra-articular, or other glucocorticoid formulations. This highlights the potential clinical risks associated with the untoward systemic absorption of non-oral glucocorticoids. As mentioned above, adrenal crisis should be considered in patients in the period immediately following cessation of glucocorticoid therapy.

Adrenal crisis prevention and stress dosing with current or recent glucocorticoid use — we recommend that patients who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when exposed to stress, with oral glucocorticoids used for minor stress without hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting/diarrhea and parenteral glucocorticoids for moderate to major stress, anesthesia, prolonged avoidance/inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting/diarrhea. Such patients under minor stress or local anesthesia will require coverage with stress doses of oral glucocorticoids, and the recommended stress dose is double the physiologic replacement dose (ie, hydrocortisone 40 mg daily).

### New guidelines on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency: the end of short synacthen test in rheumatology? [^6d7bc88b]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of GIAI were recently published for the first time by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the Endocrine Society (ES). The experts recommend that the risk for adrenal insufficiency should be considered for GC treatment durations exceeding 3–4 weeks and doses greater than the physiological levels (ie, equivalent of 15–25 mg/day hydrocortisone or 4–6 mg/day prednisone). Figure 1 summarises the two proposed approaches for managing the risk of adrenal insufficiency during the discontinuation of GC therapy. The initial step in both approaches involves tapering GC doses to physiological replacement levels, following a switch from long-acting GCs (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to short-acting GCs (eg, prednisone or hydrocortisone) when applicable. Interestingly, the recent STAR study demonstrated that tapering prednisone by 1 mg/day each month or replacing prednisone with 20 mg/day of hydrocortisone for 3 months, followed by a reduction to 10 mg/day for an additional 3 months, resulted in comparable rates of successful GC withdrawal at 1 year in patients with RA. Once tapering of GC doses to physiological levels has been achieved, the ESE/ES experts propose two options: either gradually tapering GCs while monitoring for clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency (option 1), or, more cautiously, assessing morning serum cortisol levels at least 24 hours after the last GC dose (option 2). To date, no studies have shown the superiority of either approach. Physicians must keep in mind that, in addition to implementing an appropriate GC discontinuation scheme, preventing adrenal crises necessitates patient education on sick-day rules, emphasising the importance of temporarily increasing GC doses during periods of physiological stress or surgical procedures.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: a review [^86136e90]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency:

- **Definition**: Corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, also known as adrenal suppression, is a condition arising from prolonged or high-dose exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, which suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to a decrease in endogenous cortisol production.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology involves the inhibition of the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone and ACTH due to the exogenous corticosteroids, leading to reduced production and secretion of cortisol from the adrenal glands. When the exogenous corticosteroids are reduced or stopped, the suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may not immediately resume normal function, leading to a deficiency in cortisol, especially during times of stress.
- **Epidemiology**: Corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency is the most common form of adrenal insufficiency in adult patients. Long-term oral corticosteroid use in the general population is estimated at 0.5–1.8%, with an absolute risk of 48.7% for developing adrenal insufficiency.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency include prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy, high-dose ICSs, and abrupt cessation of corticosteroids after prolonged use. Other risk factors include underlying diseases, age, and the number of treating clinicians involved in the care of the patient, as these factors may increase the likelihood of polypharmacy and the risk of iatrogenic events.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. These symptoms can be exacerbated by stress or infection, potentially leading to an adrenal crisis characterized by severe hypotension and shock.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency is generally good with appropriate management, which involves gradual tapering of the exogenous corticosteroids and supportive care. If left untreated or if treatment is delayed, the condition can lead to severe complications, such as adrenal crisis.

### What is the best long-term management strategy for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency? [^aa306c8b]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is treated with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. Recent data revealed that health-related quality of life in adrenal insufficiency is impaired in many patients and that patients with adrenal insufficiency are also threatened by an increased mortality and morbidity. This may be caused by inadequate glucocortiocid therapy and adrenal crisis. Therefore, the optimization of hormone replacement therapy remains one of the most challenging tasks in endocrinology because it is largely based on clinical grounds because of the lack of objective assessment tools. This article provides answers to the important daily clinical questions, such as correct dose finding, dose adaptation in special situations, e g, pregnancy, improvement of quality of life and measures for protection from adrenal crisis. Other important aspects discussed are side effects of glucocortiocid replacement therapy and interactions with other drugs.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — tapering and discontinuation strategies are described with limited evidence: "There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering," and "Once glucocorticoids are targeted down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy." One approach is "a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (e.g., 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps," whereas others "prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated." Evidence generation is ongoing as "An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOAST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved (87)." During taper, "Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency," and "If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented."

Rationale — Responsibilities and referral thresholds in non-endocrine glucocorticoid therapy: The guideline states that management of glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical skill to be handled by the prescribing clinician, with underlying disease guiding taper speed, and notes that the patient population is large (at least 1% of the general population) relative to endocrinology capacity. When stopping therapy, prescribing clinicians should educate their patient on tapering methods, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose; referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered when long-term supraphysiologic therapy causes HPA axis suppression greater than 1 year or when adrenal crises occur.

### Acute adrenal insufficiency [^90cbde9b]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder, usually with gradually evolving clinical symptoms and signs. Occasionally, an acute adrenal insufficiency crisis can become a life-threatening condition because of acute interruption of a normal or hyperfunctioning adrenal or pituitary gland or sudden interruption of a adrenal replacement therapy. Acute stress situations can aggravate the symptomatology. A simple strategy or diagnostic screening and early intervention with sodium chloride-containing fluids and hydrocortisone should be widely implemented for cases with suspicion of an acute Addison disease crisis. In contrast, the chronic replacement dosage for patients with adrenal insufficiency should be as low as possible with clear instructions for dosage adjustments in case of stress or acute emergencies.

### Adrenal insufficiency… [^184cdfa9]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening condition that occurs secondary to impaired secretion of adrenal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones. This condition can be caused by primary destruction or dysfunction of the adrenal glands or impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In children, the most common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are impaired adrenal steroidogenesis and adrenal destruction or dysfunction, whereas exogenous corticosteroid therapy withdrawal or poor adherence to scheduled corticosteroid dosing with long-standing treatment constitute the most common cause of acquired adrenal insufficiency.

Although there are classic clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency, its early clinical presentation is most commonly vague and undefined, requiring a high index of suspicion. The relevance of early identification of adrenal insufficiency is to avoid the potential lethal outcome secondary to severe cardiovascular and hemodynamic insufficiency. The clinician must be aware of the need for increased corticosteroid dose supplementation during stress periods. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments.

Introduction

At least 1% of the population use chronic glucocorticoid therapy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Virtually every discipline of medicine applies glucocorticoids via multiple modes of administration (including oral, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, topical, and intravenous), and frequently for prolonged duration. Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is an inevitable effect of chronic exogenous glucocorticoid therapy and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency necessitates careful education and management, and in the rare cases of adrenal crisis, prompt diagnosis and therapy. Considering the widespread use of glucocorticoids and the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, the present clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid the endocrinology specialists, as well as general practitioners and other specialists involved in the care of these patients.

Rationale

Empowering patients with knowledge of the benefits and risks of glucocorticoid therapy is critical. Patients require information in an age, education level, and learning style-appropriate format, along with access to supportive social resources such as family members or care providers and disease-oriented support groups. We recommend the inclusion of at least one family member or primary caregiver in all education sessions.

Patient education and empowerment to adjust glucocorticoid doses according to stressors are essential to prevent severe symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis. Confidence in self-management to prevent adrenal crisis was demonstrated to be low in a large study that surveyed patients with adrenal insufficiency, including patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Poor disease knowledge and lack of awareness of adrenal insufficiency subtype diagnosis were associated with higher rates of adrenal crisis. Standardized patient education programs for patients and their relatives proved to be useful for sustainably improving the level of knowledge regarding the prevention of adrenal crisis, as well as self-confidence in dealing with the disease.

The risk for developing adrenal insufficiency and the potential for adrenal crisis during glucocorticoid treatment and taper is low but increases with the cumulative number of risk factors including glucocorticoid potency, administration route, dose and treatment duration (Table 3).

Table 3.
Risk factors for developing adrenal insufficiency, and susceptibility to adrenal crisis, during glucocorticoid therapy and withdrawal from therapy

The educational content and timing of education delivery should be individualized to each patient. This relates to adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy, symptoms of withdrawal and adrenal crisis and means to prevent and treat adrenal crisis. Patients at low risk for developing adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis may not require substantial education when initiated on glucocorticoid therapy. In contrast, patients with a moderate-to-high number of risk factors should receive more intensive education to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes. They may require multiple, well-timed trainings that should be reinforced until their glucocorticoid therapy is discontinued (Table 2).

2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○)

### Adrenal insufficiency [^85a13890]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency can arise from a primary adrenal disorder, secondary to adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, or by suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone by exogenous glucocorticoid or opioid medications. Hallmark clinical features are unintentional weight loss, anorexia, postural hypotension, profound fatigue, muscle and abdominal pain, and hyponatraemia. Additionally, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency usually develop skin hyperpigmentation and crave salt. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is usually delayed because the initial presentation is often non-specific; physician awareness must be improved to avoid adrenal crisis. Despite state-of-the-art steroid replacement therapy, reduced quality of life and work capacity, and increased mortality is reported in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Active and repeated patient education on managing adrenal insufficiency, including advice on how to increase medication during intercurrent illness, medical or dental procedures, and profound stress, is required to prevent adrenal crisis, which occurs in about 50% of patients with adrenal insufficiency after diagnosis. It is good practice for physicians to provide patients with a steroid card, parenteral hydrocortisone, and training for parenteral hydrocortisone administration, in case of vomiting or severe illness. New modes of glucocorticoid delivery could improve the quality of life in some patients with adrenal insufficiency, and further advances in oral and parenteral therapy will probably emerge in the next few years.

Summary of Methods Used for Guideline Development

The methods used for establishing the guideline have been described in detail previously. In short, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used as a methodological basis. The first step was to define the clinical questions (see below) followed by systematic literature searches. We estimated an average effect for specific outcomes where possible and rated the quality of the evidence behind the recommendations as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), or strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Not all recommendations were formally graded (see below).

Considered for the recommendations were the quality of the evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and individual values and preferences (patient preferences, goals for health, costs, management inconvenience, feasibility of implementation). The recommendations are worded as "recommend" (strong recommendation) or "suggest" (weak recommendation). The meaning of a strong recommendation is that all reasonably informed persons (clinicians, policy makers and patients) would want the management in accordance with the recommendation, while for a weak recommendation, most persons would still act in accordance with the guideline, but a substantial number would not. Formal evidence syntheses were performed and graded only for recommendations addressing our initial clinical questions (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints" section). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded, but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all. Consensus was reached upon discussion; minority positions were considered in the rationale behind recommendations.

Review Process

A draft of the guideline was reviewed by four experts in the field (see "Acknowledgments" section) and was distributed to all ESE and ES members for commenting. All comments and suggestions were then discussed and implemented as thought appropriate by the guideline working group (Supplementary Table S9; see section on Supplementary Material).

Management and prevention of adrenal crisis in patients with PAI: We recommend that patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with an immediate parenteral injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone (50 mg/m2 for children) followed by appropriate fluid resuscitation and 200 mg of hydrocortisone/24 hours (50–100 mg/m2 for children) via continuous iv therapy or 6 hourly injection, with age- and body surface-appropriate dosing required in children; if hydrocortisone is unavailable, we suggest prednisolone as an alternative, and dexamethasone is the least preferred alternative and should only be given if no other glucocorticoid is available; for prevention, we suggest adjusting glucocorticoid dose according to severity of illness or magnitude of the stressor, we suggest patient education concerning glucocorticoid adjustments and adrenal crisis-prevention strategies including parenteral self- or lay-administration of emergency glucocorticoids, we recommend that all patients should be equipped with a steroid emergency card and medical alert identification, and we recommend that every patient should be equipped with a glucocorticoid injection kit for emergency use and be educated on how to use it.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency [^58338712]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency continues to be a challenge for patients, their physicians, and researchers. During the past decade, long-term studies have shown increased mortality and morbidity and impaired quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency. These findings might, at least partially, be due to the failure of glucocorticoid replacement therapy to closely resemble physiological diurnal secretion of cortisol. The potential effect of newly developed glucocorticoid drugs is a focus of research, as are the mechanisms potentially underlying increased morbidity and mortality. Adrenal crisis remains a threat to lives, and awareness and preventative measures now receive increasing attention. Awareness should be raised in medical teams and patients about adrenal insufficiency and management of adrenal crisis to improve clinical outcome.

Summary of Recommendations

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

1. General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on, or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice) R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)
2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○) R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice) R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice) R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice) R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○) R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○) R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum, with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○) As a guide: 1.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; 2.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months); 3.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months. R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○) R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1.000000000000000e+00 with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2.000000000000000e+00 using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3.000000000000000e+00 using high-dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4.000000000000000e+00 using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5.000000000000000e+00 who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6.000000000000000e+00 receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. R 2.10 — We suggest that patients with current or previous glucocorticoid treatment presenting with signs and symptoms of exogenous Cushing syndrome are assumed to have glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. (Good clinical practice) R 2.11 — We suggest that patients aiming to discontinue glucocorticoids, but without recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent, should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. We suggest that patients on glucocorticoids and history of adrenal crisis should also be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. (Good clinical practice) R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.
3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. (Good clinical practice)

### Iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency in adults [^8fd5803d]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency (IAI) is the most common form of adrenal insufficiency in adult patients, although its overall exact prevalence remains unclear. IAI is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including adrenal crisis, impaired quality of life and increased mortality; therefore, it is imperative that clinicians maintain a high index of suspicion in patients at risk of IAI to facilitate timely diagnosis and appropriate management. Herein, we review the major causes, clinical consequences, diagnosis and care of patients with IAI. The management of IAI, particularly glucocorticoid-induced (or tertiary) adrenal insufficiency, can be particularly challenging, and the provision of adequate glucocorticoid replacement must be balanced against minimizing the cardiometabolic effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure and optimizing recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We review current treatment strategies and their limitations and discuss developments in optimizing treatment of IAI. This comprehensive Review aims to aid clinicians in identifying who is at risk of IAI, how to approach screening of at-risk populations and how to treat patients with IAI, with a focus on emergency management and prevention of an adrenal crisis.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — non-biochemical tapering and monitoring: In Scenario 1, biochemical confirmation of normal cortisol production is not desired/feasible; the steps are to gradually taper down glucocorticoids and eventually stop, and to closely monitor the patient for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency/glucocorticoid withdrawal throughout the tapering period and after glucocorticoid discontinuation. If there are clinical concerns, options are to move to Scenario 2 or temporarily increase the glucocorticoid dose and taper down over a longer period.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^434743b2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations (European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry) had participating members. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposing factors. This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and hypotension. We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 μg) as the "gold standard" diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis. If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be sought. We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20–35 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults. In children, hydrocortisone (∼8 mg/m(2)/d) is recommended. Patients should be educated about stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral emergency administration. Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticosteroids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease.

Abstract

Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. This results in at least 1% of the population using chronic glucocorticoid therapy, being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. This risk is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility. Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it necessitates careful education and management of affected patients. Tapering glucocorticoids can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency. In general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly within a supraphysiological range, followed by a slower taper when on physiological glucocorticoid dosing. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals. This first European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society joint clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid clinicians involved in the care of patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to corticosteroid therapy, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to suspect adrenal crisis in patients with current or recent corticosteroid use who have not undergone biochemical testing to rule out corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, irrespective of the corticosteroid type, mode of administration, and dose. Treat patients with suspected adrenal crisis with parenteral corticosteroids and fluid resuscitation.

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice — the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — adrenal crisis prevention and education are emphasized. Adrenal crisis prevention is described as one of the main goals of management and is achieved through regular patient education about signs and symptoms, guidance on when and how to increase glucocorticoid doses (sick day rules), and provision of patient-held prompts such as the ESE steroid emergency card. Compared with other adrenal insufficiency etiologies, patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency were reported to be less aware of their diagnosis, less engaged with preventative strategies, to experience more delays during emergency treatment for adrenal crises, and to have more difficulty managing their condition with poorer self-perceived health, highlighting the need for prevention strategies and education of patients and healthcare professionals.

### Adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill: a new look at an old problem [^4dffca09]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Stress from many sources, including pain, fever, and hypotension, activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with the sustained secretion of corticotropin and cortisol. Increased glucocorticoid action is an essential component of the stress response, and even minor degrees of adrenal insufficiency can be fatal in the stressed host. HPA dysfunction is a common and underdiagnosed disorder in the critically ill. We review the risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, and management of HPA dysfunction in the critically ill.

### Adrenal crisis: prevention and management in adult patients [^f27633ef]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Glucocorticoid replacement therapy has been available for more than 50 years, however adrenal crisis remains a significant cause of death in patients with AI. Improved patient education with an emphasis on stress dosing, medical alert identification and glucocorticoid emergency kits are pivotal in reducing the prevalence of this potentially life-threatening presentation.

### Perioperative management of patients treated with glucocorticoids [^d5b6b48a]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

HPA suppression is a common consequence of glucocorticoid therapy, whereas overt secondary adrenal insufficiency is a rare but life-threatening condition. Prolonged hypotension and a response to adequate doses of a glucocorticoid agent are not reliable ways to assess adrenocortical function. One must also demonstrate plasma cortisol levels that are inappropriately low for the clinical situation. Hypotension in patients previously treated with glucocorticoids is caused by loss of the permissive effect of glucocorticoids on vascular tone, which may be related in turn to enhanced PGI2 production in the absence of glucocorticoids. It is not caused by mineralocorticoid deficiency. Recurrent problems of study design and interpretation have plagued this area of investigation. Any patient who has received a glucocorticoid in doses equivalent to at least 20 mg a day of prednisone for more than 5 days is at risk for HPA suppression. If the doses are closer to but above the physiologic range, 1 month is probably the minimal interval. Recovery from prolonged exposure to high doses of glucocorticoids may take up to 1 year. Pituitary function returns before adrenocortical function. Recovery from short courses of treatment (e.g., 5 days) occurs more rapidly, in about 5 days. Recovery is time-dependent and spontaneous. The rate of recovery is a function of the dose and duration of therapy before tapering is started and while the dose is being reduced. ACTH therapy does not cause adrenocortical suppression but offers no advantage over glucocorticoids, has several disadvantages, and should no longer be used. Patients on alternate day glucocorticoid therapy have some suppression of basal cortisol levels but have normal or nearly normal responses to provocative tests of adrenocortical function. The standard short ACTH stimulation test is a reliable means of assessing adrenocortical function preoperatively. The low dose (1 microgram) short ACTH test is promising but has not been sufficiently well characterized, requires serial dilutions and cannot be recommended at this time. Studies of the physiologic adrenocortical response to surgical stress provide a basis for revised dose recommendations for perioperative coverage in the patient with known or suspected HPA suppression. Recommendations of a multidisciplinary group are presented.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects including co-morbidities, co-medication, age and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency or by the medical context such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Figure 2.
Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery (R 2.7). If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7. and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery.

R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum (Considering this continuum, suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context.), with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○)

As a guide:

we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely;
we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months);
we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — intercurrent illness and perioperative stress dosing: For home management of illness with fever, hydrocortisone replacement doses are doubled (> 38°C) or tripled (> 39°C) until recovery (usually 2 to 3 d). When unable to tolerate oral medication due to gastroenteritis or trauma, adults receive im or sc hydrocortisone 100 mg; children receive im hydrocortisone 50 mg/m^2 or estimate; infants 25 mg; school-age children 50 mg; adolescents 100 mg. For minor to moderate surgical stress, hydrocortisone 25–75 mg/24 h is used (usually 1 to 2 d), and for children im hydrocortisone 50 mg/m^2 or hydrocortisone replacement doses doubled or tripled. For major surgery with general anesthesia, trauma, delivery, or disease requiring intensive care, hydrocortisone 100 mg per iv injection is followed by continuous iv infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone/24 h (alternatively 50 mg every 6 h iv or im), with children given hydrocortisone 50 mg/m^2 iv followed by hydrocortisone 50–100 mg/m^2/d divided q 6 h; weight-appropriate continuous iv fluids include 5% dextrose and 0.2 or 0.45% NaCl, with rapid tapering and switch to oral regimen depending on clinical state.

### Adrenal insufficiency: review of clinical outcomes with current glucocorticoid replacement therapy [^870122dc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid replacement therapy in patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI), whether primary (Addison's disease) or secondary (due to hypopituitarism), has been established for some 50 years. The current standard treatment regimen involves twice- or thrice-daily dosing with a glucocorticoid, most commonly oral hydrocortisone. Based on previous small-scale studies and clinical perception, life expectancy with conventional glucocorticoid replacement therapy has been considered normal, with a low incidence of adverse events. Data from the past 10–15 years, however, have shown that morbidity remains high and life expectancy is reduced. The increased morbidity and decreased life expectancy appear to be due to both increased exposure to cortisol and insufficient cortisol coverage during infections and other stress-related events. This is thought to reflect a failure of treatment to replicate the natural circadian rhythm of cortisol release, together with a failure to identify and deliver individualized cortisol exposure and to manage patients adequately when increased doses are required. The resulting over- or under-treatment may result in Cushing-like symptoms or adrenal crisis, respectively. This review summarizes the morbidity and mortality seen in patients receiving the current standard of care for AI and suggests areas for improvement in glucocorticoid replacement therapy.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to consider switching long-acting corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting corticosteroids are no longer needed.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults… [^8aed8eec]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Simel: Well, let's talk about the management. And specifically, let's first talk about the outpatient who has cortisol deficiency, who's not acutely ill, but has the low cortisol levels. How do you go about replacing the cortisol. And there's no perfect way to do this. So the idea is to use the lowest dose possible of the glucocorticoid to help your patient achieve a good quality of life. This is typically around 15 to 25 milligrams of hydrocortisone total for the day or three to five milligrams of prednisone or prednisolone per day. The hydrocortisone is usually given as a split dose, once first thing in the morning and once in the early. And so there's no way for us as physicians or healthcare providers to know what the mismatch between their physiologic glucocorticoid dose and their stress cortisol requirement is. We kind of have to guesstimate that.

So for most stressors, a febrile illness that someone might encounter like a flu, a painful injury, we typically recommending double or triple the dose for a couple of days until the illness has subsided. Therefore, at the time of anesthesia and before the surgery starts, they require a stress dose of intravenous glucocorticoid, typically 100 milligrams of IV hydrocortisone. And then what happens after that depends on the severity of the surgery, the duration that the patient is expected to be, say, intubated or in recovery. And if the instructions are not easy, we would advise that the hospital team consult the inpatient endocrine service to help follow that patient. And in this review, we actually have a table that has many recommendations for common stressors patients might encounter from febrile illnesses to surgeries to colonoscopies and the general advisable stress dose. But there's always some customization required if you veer beyond those general recommendations.

There's no universal definition of an adrenal crisis, but generally it's described as a life-threatening cortisol deficiency in the context of some major illness or stressor presenting with hypotension, shock, or altered mental status. So these patients require immediate super physiologic glucocorticoid therapy. In this case, it would be intravenous large hydrocortisone bolus, like 100 milligrams, followed by boluses of 50 to 100 milligrams of hydrocortisone every four to six hours, or a continuous intravenous infusion.

Perioperative and critical illness cortisol physiology — implications for dosing include traditional estimates that adults secrete 75–100 mg of cortisol/d with major surgery and 50 mg/d with minor surgery, and in reviews cortisol secretion in the first 24 hours after surgery rarely exceeded 200 mg. Lower hydrocortisone doses (25–75 mg/24 h) have been advocated for surgical stress in secondary adrenal insufficiency, but this has not been studied in patients with PAI. During critical illness, reduced cortisol metabolism due to a reduction in cortisol clearance of more than 50% has been shown, although the implications for glucocorticoid dosing in PAI have not been studied.

Future Research

Evidence for the majority of above recommendations regarding glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is low or very low. Therefore, future epidemiology research needs to define the true risk of clinical adrenal crisis and adrenal insufficiency. Additional data regarding morbidity and mortality of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is required to understand the associated health risk, which will ultimately define the approach to care for patients tapering long-term glucocorticoid therapy.
There is a need for further definition of risk factors contributing to the development and susceptibility of adrenal insufficiency, such as genetic predisposition, environmental influences, concurrent medication and underlying disease for which glucocorticoid therapy is initiated for.
Biomedical and psychosocial research into understanding of glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted, ideally providing clinical scoring systems or biomarkers, in order to better differentiate glucocorticoid withdrawal from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.
Established dynamic tests for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency identify a relatively large proportion of patients with biochemical HPA axis insufficiency following glucocorticoid therapy, yet there is only a very low reported number of patients that develop clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency and only an exceedingly low number of patients develop adrenal crisis. Therefore, more specific and predictive tests and follow-up parameters (including salivary cortisol and potentially continuous monitoring of interstitial cortisol) are needed to identify at-risk patients who would benefit from dedicated preventive intervention.
More research is needed aiming to identify glucocorticoids retaining immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties, but having less effect on HPA axis suppression and an improved adverse effect profile. In addition, the exploration of other therapeutic strategies, such as concurrent HPA axis stimulation to prevent suppression should also be entertained.
There is a need for a harmonization of cortisol assays. While most cut-off values were established using different immunoassays, usually overestimating true cortisol values due to varying degrees of cross-reactivity with other steroid metabolites, the advent of mass spectrometry allows for a specific measurement of cortisol. Future research needs to establish cut-off values using mass spectrometry and clinical care needs to adapt this measurement for routine cortisol measurements.

Rationale

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patient on methods to taper the dose, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose (Table 2). In the vast majority of cases, glucocorticoid taper does not cause any clinical endocrine concerns. In rare cases, however, when long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy has resulted in prolonged suppression of HPA axis (greater than 1 year), or when patients experience adrenal crises, referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered (see recommendation 2.11). However, it should be recognized that endocrinology providers have no specialized diagnostic approaches or therapies to facilitate unique care of glucocorticoid tapering. In this regard, the education and approach to stopping glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical process that every clinician who prescribes glucocorticoids should be familiar with.

R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — biochemical confirmation pathway: In patients receiving supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses and at high risk of adrenal insufficiency, taper down glucocorticoids to physiologic replacement doses (avoid dexamethasone), then in Scenario 2 measure early-morning serum cortisol 24 hours after the last glucocorticoid dose. A likelihood bar from HIGH to LOW displays cortisol thresholds at 150 nmol/L 5.0 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L 10.0 μg/dL. Actions presented are to continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few months, continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few weeks and consider dynamic testing, or stop glucocorticoid replacement. Separately, we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — Endocrine Society guideline conclusions recommend diagnostic testing to exclude PAI in all patients with indicative symptoms or signs, and "we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients," with the statement that "This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and hypotension." For diagnosis, "We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 μg) as the "gold standard" diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis," and "If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels." Etiologic evaluation advises that "Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase," and "In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be sought." For treatment, "We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20–35 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults." Pediatric dosing guidance states, "In children, hydrocortisone (~8 mg/m^2/d) is recommended." Patient safety and long-term care are emphasized: "Patients should be educated about stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral emergency administration," and "Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticosteroids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease."

### New guidelines on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency: the end of short synacthen test in rheumatology? [^c5800c08]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Prolonged administration of GCs at supraphysiological levels suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by inhibiting the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by corticotropic cells in the anterior pituitary, ultimately leading to adrenal cortex atrophy. Incomplete recovery of the HPA axis following GC discontinuation may result in adrenal insufficiency associated with severe clinical outcomes, such as adrenal crisis and increased mortality. Therefore, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion in patients at risk of GIAI to facilitate rapid diagnosis and appropriate management. Assessing this risk is particularly challenging due to significant interindividual variation in HPA axis recovery after GC tapering or withdrawal. Key risk factors to consider include GC potency, route of administration, dose, duration of treatment and patient age. Genetic polymorphisms also play a role, although to a lesser extent, as they are not routinely assessed in clinical practice.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — morning serum cortisol testing is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy, obtained as a morning serum cortisol level measured between 8:00 and 9:00 AM after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours and only after reaching a physiologic equivalent daily dose such as prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose. Given assay variability, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency; in patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible and we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs, and if cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered. Supporting data include that in suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity, and in patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crises.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to attempt tapering corticosteroids in patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy only if the underlying disease for which corticosteroids were prescribed is controlled, and corticosteroids are no longer required. Taper corticosteroids in these cases until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (4–6 mg prednisone).

### Safety and efficacy of prednisolone in adrenal insufficiency… [^34d5d281]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Steroid replacement therapy is vital for the health of patients with adrenal insufficiency, who are unable to produce the natural stress hormone, cortisol. The objectives of steroid replacement therapy are to replace the body's physiological requirements for cortisol without over-replacement and consequent Cushing's syndrome. Equally, under-replacement presents the risk of patients experiencing potentially fatal Addisonian crises. Appropriately replacing a patient's steroid requirement is a significant challenge. Hydrocortisone is used in the majority of patients with AI in the UK. However, HC has a short duration of action, necessitating dosing 3 times a day. Low-dose prednisolone is an alternative to HC which needs only once-daily. There have been no studies directly comparing low-dose PR to HC treatment.

This is a two-arm, two-period, double-blind, randomised, cross-over study comparing the low dose PR and standard regimens of HC in the treatment of AI. Drug: Prednisolone Drug: Hydrocortisone

### Adrenal insufficiency [^53c4a33d]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening condition that occurs secondary to impaired secretion of adrenal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones. This condition can be caused by primary destruction or dysfunction of the adrenal glands or impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In children, the most common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are impaired adrenal steroidogenesis (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) and adrenal destruction or dysfunction (autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome and adrenoleukodystrophy), whereas exogenous corticosteroid therapy withdrawal or poor adherence to scheduled corticosteroid dosing with long-standing treatment constitute the most common cause of acquired adrenal insufficiency. Although there are classic clinical signs (eg, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia) of adrenal insufficiency, its early clinical presentation is most commonly vague and undefined, requiring a high index of suspicion. The relevance of early identification of adrenal insufficiency is to avoid the potential lethal outcome secondary to severe cardiovascular and hemodynamic insufficiency. The clinician must be aware of the need for increased corticosteroid dose supplementation during stress periods.

Table 9.
Signs and symptoms of adrenal crisis and potential precipitating factors

Adrenal crisis is a clinical diagnosis and should be suspected in patients with current or recent use of any glucocorticoid formulation presenting with hypotension, collapse, or acute abdominal symptoms (Table 9). Hyponatremia may also be associated. A high degree of clinical suspicion is paramount, as patients may not have been tested for suspected glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency prior to the acute event and adrenal crisis may be the first manifestation of the disease. Treatment must not be delayed by laboratory or imaging investigations. If an established or impending adrenal crisis is suspected, the patient should immediately receive an injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone intravenously or intramuscularly followed by rapid volume resuscitation with intravenous administration of 0.9% saline solution (or equivalent). Patients with confirmed adrenal crisis should be maintained on hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg hydrocortisone per 24 hours (preferably by continuous intravenous infusion, alternatively by intravenous or intramuscular injection of 50 mg hydrocortisone every 6 hours) until clinical recovery and further guidance by an endocrinology specialist. In patients with very high body weight, higher doses might be considered. Some centers use equivalent parenteral doses of other glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone; head-to-head comparison data of different treatment strategies for adrenal crisis are lacking. Any identifiable potential triggers (eg, infections, trauma) should be treated where possible. Short-term administration of parenteral glucocorticoids at the recommended doses is safe; hence, treatment should be initiated even if an adrenal crisis diagnosis is eventually ruled out.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: a review… [^77c5e572]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Patients with adrenal insufficiency typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and anorexia and weight loss. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients who have recently tapered or discontinued a supraphysiological dose of glucocorticoids. Early-morning measurements of serum cortisol, corticotropin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate are used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Patients with intermediate early-morning cortisol levels should undergo repeat early-morning cortisol testing or corticotropin stimulation testing.

Treatment of adrenal insufficiency involves supplemental glucocorticoids. Mineralocorticoids should be added for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal crisis, a syndrome that can cause hypotension and shock, hyponatremia, altered mental status, and death if untreated, can occur in patients with adrenal insufficiency who have inadequate glucocorticoid therapy, acute illness, and physical stress. Therefore, all patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed how to increase glucocorticoids during acute illness and prescribed injectable glucocorticoids to prevent or treat adrenal crisis. Conclusions and Relevance. Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is a common condition.

Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency involves early-morning measurement of cortisol, corticotropin, and DHEAS. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be treated with glucocorticoids and instructed how to prevent and treat adrenal crisis.

### Adrenal crisis: prevention and management in adult patients [^38b36067]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Adrenal crisis is an acute life-threatening emergency contributing to the excess mortality that is reported in patients with adrenal insufficiency. The incidence of adrenal crisis is estimated to be 8 per 100 patient years in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Patients with adrenal crisis present systemically unwell with nonspecific signs and symptoms often leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. An adrenal crisis may be the first presentation of adrenal insufficiency or can occur in patients who have been established on glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Infections are the major precipitating factor, but other causes include physical stress such as a surgical procedure or trauma, forgetting or discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy, pronounced physical activity, and psychological stress. The emergency treatment involves prompt recognition and administration of parenteral hydrocortisone, rehydration and management of electrolyte abnormalities. Prevention is centred around patient education. All patients should be educated on stress dosing and parenteral glucocorticoid administration. They should carry a steroid dependency alert card and wear a medical alert bracelet or similar identification. Despite many improvements in the management of patients with adrenal insufficiency, adrenal crisis continues to occur and represents a major source of morbidity, mortality and distress for patients. Improved patient and clinician education and measures to facilitate parenteral hydrocortisone self-administration in impending crisis are central to the management of this life-threatening event.

### Adrenal insufficiency in acute severe illness… [^27833dcf]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The normal adrenal response to acute illness or stress is an increase in production of cortisol, which has important protective effects. Unfortunately, this needed increase may be lacking in some persons because of exogenous use of corticosteroids that suppress native cortisol production, or dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis seen in some cases of severe illness. Cooper and Stewart reviewed the risk factors for adrenal insufficiency, clinical factors that should raise suspicion for inadequate adrenal function, and treatment with exogenous steroids for deficient patients. Among the disease states that have been associated with HPA dysfunction are pituitary infarction, adrenal insufficiency caused by tumor invasion or infection, head injury, and sepsis. Human immunodeficiency virus infection may affect the HPA axis in a number of deleterious ways.

Both opportunistic agents and their drug treatment can lead to adrenal insufficiency, which occurs commonly in critically ill patients with HIV infection. Native cortisol production is enzymatically inhibited by the anesthetic agent etomidate and the antifungal medication ketoconazole. Exogenous use of corticosteroids can suppress the HPA axis with as little as 7. 5 mg of prednisone/prednisolone or
0. 75 mg of dexamethasone daily for more than three weeks. This suppression may last for months after the exogenous steroid is stopped. Additional information may be gained in unclear cases by administering a corticotropin stimulation test. A rise in serum cortisol of less than 9 mcg per dL after stimulation supports the likelihood of inadequate adrenal function. Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in a critically ill patient is typically accomplished with 50 mg of hydrocortisone given via an intravenous or intramuscular route every six hours.

A large study of empiric use of supplemental steroids in patients with septic shock showed reduced mortality and time spent on vasopressors. Mineralocorticoid replacement was given in addition to the hydrocortisone supplement in these patients. The authors caution that supraphysiologic high-dose steroid replacement has not been shown to improve outcomes in critically ill patients and may actually be harmful. Long-term supplemental steroids may be needed in some patients when HPA axis dysfunction persists after the severe illness has passed.
