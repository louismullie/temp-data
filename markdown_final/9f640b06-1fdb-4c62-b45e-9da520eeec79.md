## Question

What are the common symptoms of HFpEF?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and how to interpret them diagnostically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cardinal symptom and its exercise-related pattern. Then, I should verify the broader symptom cluster and how it differs from HFrEF. Next, I will examine the two main phenotypes of presentation (resting congestion vs exertional-only). After that, I need to check sex-specific differences and the impact of comorbidities. Finally, I will integrate how these symptoms map onto diagnostic algorithms and what to do when symptoms are present but resting tests are inconclusive.

> Let me first confirm the cardinal symptom. Exertional dyspnea is the most common and characteristic symptom in HFpEF, often disproportionate to resting findings and frequently the initial complaint prompting evaluation, which aligns with the pathophysiology of elevated left-sided filling pressures during exercise despite preserved resting ejection fraction [^116UzWfo] [^113M6wD4] [^115Y7Lb9].

> Wait, let me verify the exercise pattern more precisely. Many patients have "unexplained" exertional dyspnea without overt signs of congestion at rest. Approximately 35% present this way, whereas about 65% have clear rest congestion on exam or imaging, underscoring that symptoms can be exertion-only early in the disease course and that resting natriuretic peptides may be normal in a substantial minority, especially with obesity [^113M6wD4] [^117S4U8b].

> I will now examine the broader symptom cluster. Fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and weakness are common and often co-present with dyspnea; orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea occur when resting congestion is present, and edema reflects systemic congestion, while chest discomfort may be anginal or nonanginal depending on coronary disease and microvascular dysfunction, all of which degrade quality of life to levels comparable to or worse than HFrEF in many cohorts [^116UzWfo] [^113M6wD4] [^115WAga5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about specificity. These symptoms are nonspecific and frequently overlap with pulmonary disease, obesity, anemia, deconditioning, and anxiety. This is why objective evidence of cardiac structural or functional abnormalities and supportive biomarkers or hemodynamics are required to substantiate HFpEF once other mimics are excluded [^11311doB] [^114zqKZX] [^1111NMMw].

> Next, I should review the two main phenotypes. Patients with resting congestion typically display orthopnea, PND, rales, elevated jugular venous pressure, edema, and cardiomegaly on chest radiography, whereas those with exertional-only symptoms may have normal resting natriuretic peptides and echocardiography, with abnormalities unmasked by exercise testing or invasive hemodynamics showing exercise-induced elevation of filling pressures; this heterogeneity partly explains diagnostic uncertainty and the need for stepwise algorithms [^113M6wD4] [^116QJXAW] [^116FM5c7].

> Let me consider sex-specific differences. Women with HFpEF more often report severe dyspnea and worse health status, and they exhibit more concentric remodeling with smaller chamber size and higher diastolic stiffness, which may contribute to earlier symptom expression despite similar or even higher measured LVEF. Importantly, sex-neutral EF thresholds can underestimate dysfunction in women, so symptom severity should be interpreted in context [^113hrMkY] [^115Y4dRC].

> I need to ensure I account for comorbidities that shape symptom expression. Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and COPD are prevalent and can amplify dyspnea and fatigue through pulmonary congestion, right ventricular-pulmonary vascular uncoupling, anemia, and skeletal muscle deconditioning; the burden of noncardiac organ dysfunction tracks with more severe symptoms and worse outcomes, particularly in patients with prior HF hospitalizations [^116UzWfo] [^113M6wD4] [^116gMCCa].

> But wait, what if symptoms are present and resting tests are inconclusive? In that scenario, I should double-check for HFpEF mimics and then proceed to functional testing such as exercise echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, or invasive hemodynamic exercise testing to uncover exercise-induced elevation of filling pressures; both the HFA-PEFF and H2FPEF scores can aid pretest probability and triage to advanced testing when results are indeterminate [^116FM5c7] [^116Q4zYe] [^115Y7Lb9].

> In summary, I should confirm that exertional dyspnea is the hallmark symptom of HFpEF, typically accompanied by fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, with orthopnea, PND, and edema reflecting resting congestion. Symptoms are nonspecific and often multifactorial, vary by sex and comorbidity burden, and may be exertion-only early in the disease, necessitating structured diagnostic pathways to distinguish HFpEF from its many mimics and to phenotype the underlying mechanisms [^116UzWfo] [^113M6wD4] [^11311doB].

---

HFpEF typically presents with **exertional dyspnea and fatigue** as the most common symptoms, often accompanied by exercise intolerance, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema [^115WAga5] [^113V7kVs]. Symptoms are frequently nonspecific and overlap with comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and COPD, making diagnosis challenging [^111X2kyC] [^115t11ue]. Many patients have **normal natriuretic peptides at rest**, so normal levels do not exclude HFpEF, particularly in obesity or atrial fibrillation [^117S4U8b] [^11311doB]. Exercise testing or echocardiography may be needed to unmask exertional elevation in filling pressures when resting evaluation is inconclusive [^116FM5c7] [^116QJXAW].

---

## Common symptoms of HFpEF

HFpEF symptoms reflect **elevated left ventricular filling pressures** and impaired cardiac output during exertion, often exacerbated by comorbidities [^111X2kyC] [^113M6wD4]. The most frequently reported symptoms include:

| **Symptom** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Exertional dyspnea | Shortness of breath with physical activity or exertion, often the earliest and most prominent symptom [^113M6wD4] [^115Y7Lb9]. |
| Fatigue and exercise intolerance | Persistent tiredness, reduced stamina, and difficulty performing routine activities due to impaired cardiac output and oxygen delivery [^113M6wD4] [^115WAga5]. |
| Orthopnea | Shortness of breath when lying flat, relieved by sitting or standing, indicating elevated left atrial pressure [^113nSzin] [^113V7kVs]. |
| Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) | Sudden awakening from sleep due to shortness of breath, reflecting transient pulmonary congestion [^113V7kVs]. |
| Peripheral edema | Swelling of the lower extremities due to fluid retention and elevated right-sided pressures [^113V7kVs] [^1172j4p3]. |
| Chest discomfort | Often nonspecific, may reflect ischemia or elevated filling pressures [^notfound]. |

---

## Clinical signs associated with HFpEF

Physical examination may reveal **signs of congestion** and cardiac dysfunction, including:

- **Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)**: Reflects elevated right atrial pressure and volume overload [^1172j4p3].
- **Pulmonary crackles (rales)**: Indicative of pulmonary congestion and interstitial edema [^1172j4p3].
- **Third heart sound (S3)**: Suggests elevated filling pressures and ventricular compliance abnormalities [^1172j4p3].
- **Peripheral edema**: Commonly observed in the lower extremities due to fluid retention [^1172j4p3].

---

## Symptom variability and overlap with comorbidities

HFpEF symptoms are **highly variable** and often overlap with those of common comorbidities, complicating diagnosis:

- **Obesity**: Contributes to dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance, independently of cardiac dysfunction [^116eCf7v].
- **Hypertension and diabetes**: Frequently coexist with HFpEF, exacerbating symptoms and functional impairment [^113M6wD4] [^112KF8BY].
- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Shares symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, making differentiation challenging [^115t11ue] [^1111NMMw].

---

## Diagnostic challenges and limitations

Diagnosing HFpEF based on symptoms alone is challenging due to their nonspecific nature and overlap with other conditions. Several factors contribute to diagnostic uncertainty:

- **Normal natriuretic peptide levels**: Up to 30% of patients with HFpEF may have normal BNP or NT-proBNP levels, particularly in obesity or atrial fibrillation [^117S4U8b] [^113nSzin].
- **Normal resting echocardiography**: Many patients exhibit normal echocardiographic findings at rest, necessitating exercise or provocative testing to unmask elevated filling pressures [^116FM5c7] [^113M6wD4].
- **Lack of standardized diagnostic criteria**: Variability in diagnostic algorithms and criteria further complicates accurate diagnosis [^113MXfYb] [^114SJ84Q].

---

## Role of exercise testing and advanced diagnostic tools

Given the limitations of resting evaluation, **exercise testing and advanced diagnostic tools** are often required to confirm HFpEF:

- **Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)**: Helps differentiate cardiac from pulmonary causes of dyspnea and assesses functional capacity [^115Y7Lb9] [^1144k2vq].
- **Exercise echocardiography**: Identifies exercise-induced elevation in filling pressures and diastolic dysfunction [^116QJXAW].
- **Invasive hemodynamic testing**: Gold standard for diagnosing HFpEF, particularly in ambiguous cases [^112MHsHQ] [^116QJXAW].

---

## Impact of symptoms on quality of life and prognosis

HFpEF symptoms significantly impair quality of life, with patients experiencing **comparable or worse health status than those with HFrEF**. Symptom burden is associated with increased hospitalizations, reduced functional capacity, and poor long-term outcomes [^113M6wD4] [^116xtPXm].

---

HFpEF commonly presents with **exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance**, often accompanied by orthopnea, PND, and peripheral edema. Symptoms are nonspecific and overlap with comorbidities, complicating diagnosis. Advanced diagnostic tools, including exercise testing and invasive hemodynamics, are frequently required to confirm HFpEF and guide management.

Clinical Perspective

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for about half of HF cases, with a rising prevalence. Despite recent therapeutic successes, prevention, diagnosis, and prognosis assessment in HFpEF remain limited by its heterogeneous clinical presentation and varied pathophysiological origins. Given the importance of exertional intolerance as a cardinal manifestation of HFpEF whether or not resting congestion exists, the use of exercise testing to quantify physiological abnormalities underlying these symptoms is an important component of HFpEF care and investigation. Physiological exercise response patterns can be used to define specific impairments across various organ systems in HFpEF, including decreased cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake [VO₂]), impaired peripheral oxygen extraction, abnormalities in pulmonary vascular–right ventricular coupling during exercise, and left ventricular–vascular interactions that result in a steep rise in left heart filling pressures. Prior investigations of these exercise phenotypes in HFpEF primarily focused on diagnosis and assessing phenotypes, disease severity, and therapeutic response. While recent advances in molecular phenotyping of tissues and biofluids in HF provide a lens into potential mechanisms and functional biomarkers of disease, few studies have used these tools in combination with detailed phenotyping during exercise. Uniting exercise and molecular phenotypes provides an opportunity not only to define potential mechanisms of HFpEF but also to noninvasively interrogate an individual's propensity to develop HFpEF without the need for invasive measurements during exercise.

Here, we defined the relation of a broad resting cardiovascular proteome (277 proteins) with key physiological exercise response patterns in 151 individuals with and without HFpEF. Participants were drawn from a cohort of individuals referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with invasive hemodynamic monitoring for evaluation of dyspnea with exertion and therefore largely represent individuals with HFpEF without overt congestion at rest. We employed statistical (machine) learning approaches to define proteomic signatures of hemodynamic and functional measures, using these models to prioritize contributions of known/novel pathways to divergent HFpEF pathophenotypes. Given the relevance of proteomics to early disease detection, we evaluated whether these signatures identify individuals at high risk for incident HFpEF in a distinct and carefully phenotyped at‐risk, community‐based cohort. Our overall objective was to assess whether cardiovascular proteomics related to individual‐level physiological performance during exercise would identify functional pathways and clinical HFpEF risk (Figure 1).

European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Given that exercise impairment is the central clinical expression of HFpEF, a focused appraisal of the role of exercise functional evaluation in the diagnostic process, pathophysiological insights, and evaluation of therapeutic interventions in HFpEF is warranted. While non‐invasive CPET in isolation may be insufficient to discriminate HFpEF from non‐cardiac dyspnoea in some patients without adding invasive testing, its role as an early stage investigation to exclude pulmonary disease, and its potential role in more advanced phenotyping or to gauge treatment response, may be important emerging uses. The purposes of this HFA/European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) clinical consensus statement are to provide an updated document focusing on: (i) the sources of exercise limitation and its pathophysiology in HFpEF phenotypes; (ii) the role of CPET in differentiating pulmonary from cardiac mechanisms for unexplained exertional dyspnoea from the early diagnostic process to the advanced stages, highlighting its value for risk stratification and therapeutic tailoring; and (iii) the interventions that may improve exercise performance in HFpEF effectively targeting the multiple limiting steps of oxygen (O₂) kinetics.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — scope and diagnostic definition are outlined, noting that heart failure (HF) carries a lifetime risk at age 40 of approximately 20%, and that HFpEF continues to rise and now accounts for more than 50% of HF cases with outcomes comparable to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), while often under-recognized with substantial resource utilization. Per the Universal Definition of HF, diagnosis requires symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by structural/functional cardiac abnormalities and at least 1 of the following: elevated natriuretic peptides or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion. HFpEF is defined as a clinical diagnosis of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, whereas EFs between 40% and 50% are noted as HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). The document also notes that HFpEF is not synonymous with diastolic dysfunction and lists pivotal issues to address in HFpEF care, including how to approach a person with shortness of breath, overcome diagnostic dilemmas and identify a need for further testing, rule out mimics to avoid missed diagnosis, manage comorbidities and care complexities, initiate and optimize GDMTs, determine when and why to refer to a cardiologist or HF specialist, improve access to care, and recognize sex-specific differences in diagnosis and care management.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: new approaches to diagnosis and management [^114Uj3yJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The majority of older patients who develop heart failure (HF), particularly older women, have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients with HFpEF have severe symptoms of exercise intolerance, poor quality‐of‐life, frequent hospitalizations, and increased mortality. The prevalence of HFpEF is increasing and its prognosis is worsening. However, despite its importance, our understanding of the pathophysiology of HFpEF is incomplete, and drug development has proved immensely challenging. Currently, there are no universally accepted therapies that alter the clinical course of HFpEF. Originally viewed as a disorder due solely to abnormalities in left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, our understanding has evolved such that HFpEF is now understood as a systemic syndrome, involving multiple organ systems, likely triggered by inflammation and with an important contribution of aging, lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition, and multiple‐comorbidities, features that are typical of a geriatric syndrome. HFpEF is usually progressive due to complex mechanisms of systemic and cardiac adaptation that vary over time, particularly with aging. In this review, we examine evolving data regarding HFpEF that may help explain past challenges and provide future directions to care patients with this highly prevalent, heterogeneous clinical syndrome.

### Emerging horizons in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: the role of SGLT2 inhibitors [^1162Q666]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition characterised by a number of signs and symptoms, e.g. elevated jugular venous pulse (JVP), peripheral oedema and breathlessness and fatigue, respectively. Diagnosis is based on presence of signs and/or symptoms of HF and echocardiographic findings evidencing cardiac dysfunction. Further classification involves measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Ejection fraction (EF) values vary slightly depending on guidelines, but it is generally accepted that HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is defined as HF with an EF of less than or equal to 40%. Patients with an ejection fraction between 41% and 49% have HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is accepted as being a challenging diagnosis. Therefore, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends a simplified approach to diagnosis: signs and symptoms of HF, an LVEF of more than or equal to 50%, and objective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnormalities consistent with presence of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction/raised LV filling pressures (such as LV hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement or raised natriuretic peptides). Diagnosis involves the use of history, clinical examination, natriuretic peptide levels and echocardiography. However, some patients with HFpEF will get symptoms only on exertion, but do not have clinical signs at rest and therefore the aforementioned diagnostic testing may be inconclusive; this is where other investigations such as exercise stress testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and invasive haemodynamic testing can also be used to diagnose HFpEF or else confirm or exclude other diagnoses too. Patients with HFpEF tend to be older, female and are more likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease and anaemia.

Therapeutic Implications

When HFpEF and CAD coexist, management needs to focus on CAD as well as on diuretic and antihypertensive therapy. Shortness of breath is unquestionably a cardinal symptom of HFpEF. 207 However, when it fails to resolve with loop diuretic therapy, shortness of breath may be an angina equivalent. Focusing on HFpEF may delay stress imaging studies or coronary angiography in patients who, with HFpEF and equivocal response to loop diuretic, remain symptomatic because of ongoing myocardial ischemia.

Advanced heart failure (HF) specialist referral in HFpEF — although many individuals may not be candidates for advanced HF therapies due to advanced age or substantial comorbidities, referral from cardiovascular specialists to advanced HF specialists might be perceived as less useful; however, referral to an HF specialist can be helpful in cases of diagnostic or therapeutic uncertainty and to identify potential clinical trial candidates. Triggers for referral might include persistent or worsening symptoms, adverse clinical events such as hospitalization, or other features suggesting that the individuals are at high risk for disease progression, hospitalization, or death.

2.4 Do any meds improve outcomes in HFpEF?

Tables 1 and 2 shows non‐pharmacological and pharmacological clinical trials that were positive in HFpEF on their primary endpoints. Not shown here are the trials that were negative or neutral, which are far greater in number. However, unlike HFrEF, there are currently no disease‐modifying agents available for HFpEF that improve clinical outcomes. Indeed recently, Sacubitril‐valsartan did not result in a significantly lower rate of total hospitalizations for HF and death among patients with HFpEF. 44 This leads to the question: Why have most pharmacological therapies to date not shown clear benefit in HFpEF? To date, pharmacologic interventions applied in HFpEF have been principally based upon the assumption of underlying, severe neurohormonal abnormalities. However, neurohormonal derangements appear more limited in breadth and severity in HFpEF than in HFrEF. Furthermore, diagnosis of HFpEF is challenging due to the lack of a single objective marker that defines the syndrome, such as a reduced LVEF in HFrEF and the high frequency of comorbidities that may mimic or accompany the HFpEF syndrome. In addition, exercise intolerance, the cardinal manifestation of HF regardless of EF, has a complex pathophysiology and is rarely explained by a single process. Furthermore, most HFpEF studies have only measured diastolic function at rest rather than during exercise where symptoms become manifest. 45, 46 So far, clinical trials generally enrolled "all comers" with clinical syndrome of HF and objective evidence of preserved LVEF. However, evolving evidence indicates that HFpEF is a much more complex disorder than originally thought, influenced by aging processes as explained before, likely systemic in nature, involving many organs and organ systems in addition to the heart, and also involving abnormalities in vascular and skeletal muscle function as well, and likely has multiple phenotypes. These issues and concepts have generally not been addressed in trial designs to date. Given such a multi‐factorial, complex milieu, it is not surprising that drugs and interventions aimed primarily at a central hemodynamics repeatedly failed to strongly impact overall outcomes in HFpEF. As discussed in more detail below, lifestyle modifications (exercise and diet) have been more consistently successful, likely due to addressing HFpEF as a systemic syndrome, and by addressing peripheral, non‐cardiac factors that appear more mutable than cardiac factors.

### Treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction… [^1175yAsN]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a syndrome that occurs in about one-half of all patients with HF and is being recognized with increasing frequency. Although its specific causes have not been elucidated in the majority of patients, HFpEF occurs most commonly in elderly individuals who have 1 or more comorbidities that include hypertension, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and chronic kidney disease. While by its usual definition the left ventricular ejection fraction is 45% or more, HFpEF may also be characterized by diastolic dysfunction that impairs ventricular filling resulting from slowed ventricular relaxation and an increase in passive ventricular stiffness. In some patients with HFpEF, this elevation in filling pressure is manifest only during exercise, whereas in others it is more sustained, and results in pulmonary hypertension.

1.

A variety of abnormalities in cardiac structure and/or function occur in HFpEF, including increases in the diameter of cardiomyocytes, and ventricular hypertrophy, as well as expansion of the fibrous tissue that makes up the extracellular cardiac matrix. The latter, which also occurs in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, appears to result from augmentation of the synthesis and cross-linking of collagen, accompanied by a reduction of its degradation. Abnormalities of diastolic function, increased left ventricular mass to volume ratio, and enlargement of the left atrium are key features of HFpEF that can be recognized by echocardiography. 2 However, there is a wide spectrum of echocardiographic features of HFpEF that may be normal in some patients. Patients exhibiting more prominent structural and functional abnormalities are at higher risk for cardiovascular events.
2.

As expected, more patients assigned to spironolactone developed hyperkalemia and an increase in serum creatinine. From a strictly statistical point of view, the results of TOPCAT must be regarded as neutral. However, HFpEF is often a disabling and life-shortening condition. Other than the administration of diuretics for fluid accumulation and the management of hypertension, there is little to offer these patients. Based on the findings in TOPCAT in North and South America and in the absence of other more definitive data, it now appears reasonable to treat patients with HFpEF resembling those enrolled in North and South America with spironolactone to improve outcomes.

1 Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a progressive, multifactorial, and heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms and signs that result from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. It is categorized based on ejection fraction (EF) into HF with reduced EF (HFrEF, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 40%), HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF, LVEF 41%–49%), HF with improved EF (previous LVEF ≤ 40% and a follow‐up measurement of LVEF > 40%), and HF with preserved EF (HFpEF, LVEF ≥ 50%), HFpEF can be further classified into HF with normal EF (HFnEF, 50% ≤ LVEF ≤ 65%) and HF with supra‐normal EF (HFsnEF, LVEF > 65%). Among them, HFpEF constitutes 50% of HF cases, which is correlative with ageing, hypertension, obesity, and characterized by an elevated left ventricular filling pressure, with comparable rates of readmission and mortality to HFrEF. Due to the different treatment approaches for HFpEF compared to HFrEF, and the irreversible nature of HF progression, early and accurate diagnosis of HFpEF is particularly crucial for slowing the progression of the condition. However, the pathogenesis of HFpEF is intricate, involving various physiological pathways including systemic inflammation, inadequate release of natriuretic peptides, activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), and sympathetic nervous system. Clinical diagnosis has always been challenging due to the high heterogeneity of HFpEF and lack of specific early symptoms and signs. Invasive hemodynamic measurements serve as the gold standard for diagnosing HFpEF, defined by a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ≥ 15 mmHg at rest or a left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure (LVEDP) ≥ 16 mmHg, and a PCWP ≥ 25 mmHg under stress. However, the invasive nature of the gold standard limits its clinical application. Echocardiography can provide valuable insight into the pathophysiology and underlying phenotypes of HFpEF, facilitating its diagnosis. Echocardiographic parameters, when combined with serological biomarkers like N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), are recommended in current European HF guidelines as highly sensitive but moderately specific markers of HF. Although there is growing interest in utilizing exercise stress echocardiography for early HFpEF diagnosis, its operational complexity and limited patient acceptance have restricted its widespread application. Currently, the H2FPEF and HFA‐PEFF scoring systems serve as the primary methods for diagnosing HFpEF among physicians, offering advantages such as non‐invasiveness, repeatability, and efficiency. Although studies have shown that both the HFA‐PEFF and H2FPEF scoring systems have strong diagnostic efficacy for HFpEF, a single system still has clinical gray areas. Using both systems together can improve diagnostic performance, but it is more complex and cumbersome, increasing the medical burden. Therefore, there is a need for a simpler and highly effective noninvasive diagnostic tool for HFpEF that remains clinically significant.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^114zqKZX]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition and classification of heart failure — left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)–based categories across major guidelines are listed. ACC/AHA (2013) defines heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) as ≤ 40% with Symptoms and signs; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) as ≥ 50% with Symptoms and signs; HFpEF, borderline as 41%–49% with Symptoms and signs; and HFpEF, improved as > 40% with Symptoms and signs. ESC (2016) defines HFrEF as < 40% with Symptoms and signs; heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) as 40–49% requiring Symptoms and signs, elevated levels of natriuretic peptides and ≥ 1 additional criterion of relevant structural heart disease (LVH or LAE) or diastolic dysfunction; and HFpEF as ≥ 50% with the same additional requirements. JCS/JHFS (2017) defines HFrEF as < 40%, HFmrEF as 40% to < 50%, and HFpEF as ≥ 50%.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: recent concepts in diagnosis, mechanisms and management [^111rHhnj]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

It is estimated that half of all patients with heart failure (HF) have HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Yet this form of HF remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Differentiating HFpEF from other causes of dyspnoea may require advanced diagnostic methods, such as exercise echocardiography, invasive haemodynamics and investigations for 'HFpEF mimickers'. While the classification of HF has relied heavily on cut-points in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), recent evidence points towards a gradual shift in underlying mechanisms, phenotypes and response to therapies as LVEF increases. For example, among patients with HF, the proportion of hospitalisations and deaths due to cardiac causes decreases as LVEF increases. Medication classes that are efficacious in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have been less so at higher LVEF ranges, decreasing the risk of HF hospitalisation but not cardiovascular or all-cause death in HFpEF. These observations reflect the burden of non-cardiac comorbidities as LVEF increases and highlight the complex pathophysiological mechanisms, both cardiac and non-cardiac, underpinning HFpEF. Treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduces the risk of composite cardiovascular events, driven by a reduction in HF hospitalisations; renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockers and angiotensin-neprilysin inhibitors result in smaller reductions in HF hospitalisations among patients with HFpEF. Comprehensive management of HFpEF includes exercise as well as treatment of risk factors and comorbidities. Classification based on phenotypes may facilitate a more targeted approach to treatment than LVEF categorisation, which sets arbitrary cut-points when LVEF is a continuum. This narrative review summarises the pathophysiology, diagnosis, classification and management of patients with HFpEF.

### Current gaps in HFpEF trials: time to reconsider patients' selection and to target phenotypes [^113MXfYb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly prevalent clinical condition associated with cardiovascular aging, characterized by different pathophysiological mechanisms and poor outcomes. In this manuscript, we analysed the main differences in terms of updated diagnostic criteria and patients' selection in the most recent HFpEF trials. Recent algorithm purposed for HFpEF diagnosis, does not reflect common criteria adopted in clinical trials. Patients included in the larger studies experienced different characteristics in terms of clinical presentation and echocardiographic features. Current concerns complicate results interpretation and could hypothesize different stages of disease progression, rather than different cardiac phenotypes. Both the lack of diagnostic standardization and the population heterogeneity, might explain why trials investigating the effects of different therapeutic interventions failed to show improved outcomes for patients with HFpEF. Accordingly, we propose to exceed current view mainly based on the morphological adaptations evaluating patients' characterisation, their cardiovascular risk, associated diseases, and structural features consistent with disease progression. Detailed clinical, imaging and biological characterisation of this population, along with the identification of mechanisms linked with disease progression and prognosis, would allow for tailored treatments and provide important mechanistic insights into the complex HFpEF pathophysiology.

### Evaluation and management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114wSHhy]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has grown to become the dominant form of heart failure worldwide, in tandem with ageing of the general population and the increasing prevalences of obesity, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The clinical syndrome of HFpEF is heterogeneous and must be distinguished from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction as well as other aetiologies that have different treatment strategies. The diagnosis of HFpEF is challenging and ultimately relates to the conceptual definition of heart failure as a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms that are associated with a reduced capacity of the heart to pump blood adequately at normal filling pressures during diastole. Clinical trials to date have been largely unsuccessful in identifying effective treatments for HFpEF but evidence supports the use of diuretics, mineralocorticoid antagonists and lifestyle interventions. Pathophysiological heterogeneity in the presentation of HFpEF is substantial, and ongoing studies are underway to evaluate the optimal methods to classify patients into phenotypically homogeneous subpopulations to facilitate better individualization of treatment.

### Murine models of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a "Fishing expedition" [^116HpEhV]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

Summary

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by signs and symptoms of heart failure in the presence of a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Despite accounting for up to 50% of all clinical presentations of heart failure, the mechanisms implicated in HFpEF are poorly understood, thus precluding effective therapy. The pathophysiological heterogeneity in the HFpEF phenotype also contributes to this disease and likely to the absence of evidence-based therapies. Limited access to human samples and imperfect animal models that completely recapitulate the human HFpEF phenotype have impeded our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings that exist in this disease. Aging and comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes and obesity, pulmonary hypertension, and renal dysfunction are highly associated with HFpEF, yet the relationship and contribution between them remains ill-defined. This review discusses some of the distinctive clinical features of HFpEF in association with these comorbidities and highlights the advantages and disadvantage of commonly used murine models used to study the HFpEF phenotype.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Clinical assessment for suspected HFpEF — Physical examination "may demonstrate signs of congestion, including elevated jugular venous pressure, presence of an S3 gallop, pulmonary crackles or rales, hepatomegaly, ascites, or lower extremity edema". "Electrocardiography should be performed in all patients with suspected HFpEF", and electrocardiographic evaluation "can screen for atrial fibrillation, which may be occult in HFpEF and is prevalent in 15% to 41% of patients". "Chest radiography should be performed in the evaluation of HFpEF, particularly in patients presenting with dyspnea", as it "may show signs of volume overload (Kerley B-lines, pleural effusion, pulmonary congestion) or reveal other noncardiac causes of dyspnea", though "Radiographic findings appear to have low sensitivity in detecting patients with HFpEF compared with PCWP measurements by cardiac catheterization".

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112KF8BY]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for nearly half of all heart failure cases and has a prevalence that is expected to rise with the growing ageing population. HFpEF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Specific HFpEF risk factors include age, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and atrial fibrillation. Haemodynamic contributions to HFpEF include changes in left ventricular structure, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, left atrial myopathy, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, chronotropic incompetence, and vascular dysfunction. Inflammation, fibrosis, impaired nitric oxide signalling, sarcomere dysfunction, and mitochondrial and metabolic defects contribute to the cellular and molecular changes observed in HFpEF. HFpEF impacts multiple organ systems beyond the heart, including the skeletal muscle, peripheral vasculature, lungs, kidneys and brain. The diagnosis of HFpEF can be made in individuals with signs and symptoms of heart failure with abnormality in natriuretic peptide levels or evidence of cardiopulmonary congestion, facilitated by the use of HFpEF risk scores and additional imaging and testing with the exclusion of HFpEF mimics. Management includes initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy and management of comorbidities. Given the significant impact of HFpEF on quality of life, future research efforts should include a particular focus on how patients can live better with this disease.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is among the most common causes of hospitalization and death worldwide. In western countries, 1–9 cases per 1000 persons are diagnosed with HF every year, and its prevalence is about 1–2% of the adult population.HF is defined as a clinical syndrome consisting of cardinal symptoms and/or signs due to structural and/or functional abnormalities of the heart resulting in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise. Based on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, HF is diagnosed using physical examination, natriuretic peptide (NP) level in plasma, and echocardiography examination. Based on ejection fraction (EF) as a critical echocardiographic parameter, HF can be categorized into three subgroups: reduced EF (HFrEF, EF < 40%), mid‐range EF (HFmrEF, 40% ≤ EF < 50%), or preserved EF (HFpEF, EF ≥ 50%). Currently, B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and especially the N‐terminal (NT)‐prohormone BNP (NT‐proBNP) are the most accepted and extensively characterized biomarkers for the diagnosis of HF. However, the diagnostic utility of NT‐proBNP for HFpEF remains debatable. Ideally, novel biomarkers may help refine the diagnosis of the different subtypes of HF and be of additional value for the diagnosis of HFpEF.

### A stepwise guide to the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111X2kyC]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a growing epidemic owing to an increasingly obese and aging patient population. Making the diagnosis of HFpEF is often challenging because patients frequently have multiple comorbidities and alternative reasons for dyspnea and exercise intolerance, symptoms that are hallmark to the disease. Additionally, a universal diagnostic algorithm and definition of HFpEF is lacking. The treatment of HFpEF has been equally challenging, as there remain exceedingly few therapies show to improve survival in HFpEF and thus management to date has focused on intensive optimization of HFpEF risk factors. In this review, we highlight a stepwise approach to the diagnosis and treatment of HFpEF including (1) how to establish a clinical diagnosis of HFpEF, (2) when to refer for invasive diagnostic testing, (3) current treatment approaches to HFpEF including pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and risk factor modification interventions, and (4) when to refer to a dedicated HFpEF center or advanced heart failure specialist. With this systematic stepwise approach to HFpEF diagnosis and management, we aim to improve accurate diagnosis of the disease as well as raise awareness of available therapeutic options for this challenging patient population.

### Deliberating the diagnostic dilemma of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116XVQsN]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a lack of consensus on how we define heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with wide variation in diagnostic criteria across society guidelines. This lack of uniformity in disease definition stems in part from an incomplete understanding of disease pathobiology, phenotypic heterogeneity, and natural history. We review current knowledge gaps and existing diagnostic tools and algorithms. We present a simple approach to implement these tools within the constraints of the current knowledge base, addressing separately (1) hospitalized individuals with rest congestion, where diagnosis is more straightforward; and (2) individuals with exercise intolerance, where diagnosis is more complex. Here, a potential role for advanced or provocative testing, including evaluation of hemodynamic responses to exercise is considered. More importantly, we propose focus areas for future studies to develop accurate and feasible diagnostic tools for HFpEF, including animal models that recapitulate human HFpEF, and human studies that both address a fundamental understanding of HFpEF pathobiology, and new diagnostic approaches and tools, as well. In sum, there is an urgent need to more accurately define the syndrome of HFpEF to inform diagnosis, patient selection for clinical trials, and, ultimately, future therapeutic approaches.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: present status and future directions [^114UpzMi]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Commonly, the systolic function in HFpEF remains within the normal range, but the diastolic function is variable. HFpEF is not equivalent to diastolic dysfunction or diastolic HF. Diastolic dysfunction can be defined as a functional defect in relaxation, ventricular filling, or distensibility. Diastolic dysfunction indicates abnormal ventricular mechanical ability. HFpEF is a clinical term used to indicate HF with normal contractile function but without any consideration of diastolic function. Diastolic dysfunction itself is a kind of benign aging process and can be observed in the absence of HF symptoms. Although HFpEF and diastolic heart failure are not synonymous, many clinical features overlap. Chronic sustained diastolic dysfunction is a definite risk factor for HFpEF.

Another type of HF with subnormal ejection fraction has recently been described, with 40% < ejection fraction < 50%. This ejection fraction is midway between that of a normal and failing heart and has been defined as HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF). Clinically, HFmrEF shares features of both HFpEF and HFrEF. In the absence of a cohort study for HFmrEF, the management approaches vary. Some clinicians treat HFmrEF and HFrEF similarly, while others treat these as cases of borderline HFpEF. Some experts argue that HFmrEF represents a transition between HFpEF and HFrEF, but the evidence is not convincing. The symptoms and hospitalization patterns resemble those of HFpEF, while clinical features, prognosis, and outcomes of HFmrEF are similar to those of HFrEF.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: mechanisms, clinical features, and therapies [^115NFcD4]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical syndrome comprising heart failure (HF) symptoms but with a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) that is not diminished, eg, HF with preserved EF, is increasingly the predominant form of HF in the developed world, and soon to reach epidemic proportions. It remains among the most challenging of clinical syndromes for the practicing clinician and scientist alike, with a multitude of proposed mechanisms involving the heart and other organs and complex interplay with common comorbidities. Importantly, its morbidity and mortality are on par with HF with reduced EF, and as the list of failed treatments continues to grow, HF with preserved EF clearly represents a major unmet medical need. The field is greatly in need of a more unified approach to its definition and view of the syndrome that engages integrative and reserve pathophysiology beyond that related to the heart alone. We need to reflect on prior treatment failures and the message this is providing, and redirect our approaches likely with a paradigm shift in how the disease is viewed. Success will require interactions between clinicians, translational researchers, and basic physiologists. Here, we review recent translational and clinical research into HF with preserved EF and give perspectives on its evolving demographics and epidemiology, the role of multiorgan deficiencies, potential mechanisms that involve the heart and other organs, clinical trials, and future directions.

With the recent publication of the DELIVER trial results in combination with those of EMPEROR-Preserved and PRESERVED-HF, we expect to see an update of the ESC guidelines to reflect the use of SGLT2 inhibitor for patients with HFpEF. Due to variations in coexisting comorbid conditions driving the condition, multiple clinical phenotypes and underlying pathophysiologies are responsible for the manifestation of HFpEF. Despite this, current clinical practice lacks personalised and targeted treatment options for patients with this complex clinical syndrome. Future clinical practice should strive to deliver personalised therapy for this highly prevalent and growing cohort of patients.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^1175zZR5]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Half of patients with heart failure (HF) have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Morbidity and mortality in HFpEF are similar to values observed in patients with HF and reduced EF, yet no effective treatment has been identified. While early research focused on the importance of diastolic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of HFpEF, recent studies have revealed that multiple non-diastolic abnormalities in cardiovascular function also contribute. Diagnosis of HFpEF is frequently challenging and relies upon careful clinical evaluation, echo-Doppler cardiography, and invasive haemodynamic assessment. In this review, the principal mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, and clinical trials are reviewed, along with a discussion of novel treatment strategies that are currently under investigation or hold promise for the future.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: diagnosis and management [^113V7kVs]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, also referred to as diastolic heart failure, causes almost one-half of the 5 million cases of heart failure in the United States. It is more common among older patients and women, and results from abnormalities of active ventricular relaxation and passive ventricular compliance, leading to a decline in stroke volume and cardiac output. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction should be suspected in patients with typical symptoms (e.g., fatigue, weakness, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema) and signs (S3 heart sound, displaced apical pulse, and jugular venous distension) of chronic heart failure. Echocardiographic findings of normal ejection fraction with impaired diastolic function confirm the diagnosis. Measurement of natriuretic peptides is useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the ambulatory setting. Multiple trials have not found medications to be an effective treatment, except for diuretics. Patients with congestive symptoms should be treated with a diuretic. If hypertension is present, it should be treated according to evidence-based guidelines. Exercise and treatment by multidisciplinary teams may be helpful. Atrial fibrillation should be treated using a rate-control strategy and appropriate anticoagulation. Revascularization should be considered for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and coronary artery disease. The prognosis is comparable to that of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and is worsened by higher levels of brain natriuretic peptide, older age, a history of myocardial infarction, and reduced diastolic function.

### Clinical phenotypes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1142n61U]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Any attempt at clinical classification is, by essence, arbitrary. Nevertheless, defining clinical phenotypes in HFpEF may help the management of patients with HFpEF and possibly lead to therapeutic progress. Elderly patients with long‐standing hypertension and HFpEF are likely to benefit from a different therapeutic approach than middle‐aged obese HFpEF patients. Patients who seek medical attention for PH‐related symptoms are clearly in need of specific therapy. When HFpEF and CAD coexist, great attention needs to be given to both conditions. Last, HFpEF is associated with a multitude of comorbid conditions that require specific therapies.

### Echocardiography reporting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Delphi consensus study [^116gbwHB]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex clinical syndrome, wherein patients experience signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF), with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%. It is estimated that at least 50% of patients with HF have HFpEF. Given its association with ageing and obesity, incidence and mortality rates are expected to rise over time, posing a significant problem for the healthcare system. The pathogenesis of HFpEF is multifactorial, and patients may present to different healthcare providers. Non-specific symptoms and signs, and variation in local pathways make diagnosis and management of patients challenging. Lack of awareness among healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding the pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria and treatment of HFpEF likely contributes to underdiagnosis. Variability in HF pathways and management disparities across the UK result in a significant number of patients being managed within primary care alone.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2018 chronic HF guidelines recommend an N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) blood test for patients with suspected HF. If elevated, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and specialist assessment should follow. Echocardiography assesses systolic, diastolic, valvular and pericardial functions, crucial for diagnosing HF and excluding HF mimics. In patients with HFpEF, ejection fraction is not reduced, but other parameters such as left atrial enlargement, left ventricular diastolic function (LVDF) with elevated left ventricular filling pressures (LVFP) and left ventricular hypertrophy are variably found. Echocardiography can also identify possible underlying aetiologies, such as cardiac amyloidosis.

The British Society of Echocardiography (BSE) 2024 guidance recommends reporting terms that should describe the observed physiology and haemodynamics so that LVDF is reported as normal or abnormal, and if abnormal, whether LVFP are normal or elevated. For patients who describe symptoms of breathlessness with echocardiographic findings of LV diastolic impairment with elevated LVFP, LVEF ≥ 50%, no more than moderate left-sided valve disease, and no other identifiable cause of their symptoms, the following reporting statement is recommended to highlight the echocardiographic red flags: 'these findings may be consistent with HFpEF and should be considered in the context of clinical presentation and symptoms'.

However, despite the current BSE recommendations for the assessment of LVDF and cardiac amyloidosis, diastolic function analysis remains complex and the suspicion of HFpEF based on echocardiographic findings is rarely raised. This work sought to collate a consensus on echocardiographic reporting of suspected HFpEF in the UK and in the wider context of improving recognition and the referral process.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — diagnostic and therapeutic challenges include that there is "no single test that definitively establishes the diagnosis", so clinicians "must consider" potential mimics that may present with "signs of congestion and/or symptoms of dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or congestion with preserved EF". Even after diagnosis, "therapeutic challenges remain", and clinicians must consider comorbidities, nonpharmacological options, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) "to improve quality of life, reduce HF as well as non-HF hospitalizations, and improve survival". Delivery of care "requires multidisciplinary collaboration", and the document's purpose is to provide "practical and streamlined pathways for diagnosis and management, incorporating the emerging data from clinical trials".

Approach to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) emphasizes that clinicians should perform testing, as guided by history and physical examination, to exclude cardiac and noncardiac heart failure (HF) mimics and identify comorbidities in individuals with dyspnea and/or edema and preserved EF, and should implement an HFpEF treatment plan with specific attention to management of comorbidities, nonpharmacological management, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Because many individuals with HFpEF do not present initially to cardiovascular specialists, multidisciplinary collaboration comprises essential components of care, including: primary care clinicians recognizing HFpEF as a potential diagnosis in persons with dyspnea, exertional intolerance, and edema, initiating diagnostic testing and appropriate GDMT, and recognizing when a cardiology referral is warranted; cardiology specialists (cardiologists and cardiology advanced practice professionals) who may also assess for alternative diagnoses explaining dyspnea, edema, and preserved EF and optimize GDMT; heart failure specialists who pursue advanced testing in case of diagnostic dilemma, manage special or unusual cardiomyopathies, identify clinical trial eligibility, and assess need and eligibility for advanced therapies including heart transplantation; and collaboration that may include electrophysiologists, interventional cardiologists or cardiac surgeons, endocrinologists, nephrologists, and pulmonologists.

### Insight into different phenotypic presentations of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112jej2j]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for half of all HF diagnoses, and its prevalence is increasing at an alarming rate. Lately, it has been recognized as a clinical syndrome due to diverse underlying etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms. The classic echocardiographic features of HFpEF have been well described as preserved ejection fraction (≥ 50%), left ventricular hypertrophy, and left atrial enlargement. However, echocardiography can play a key role in identifying the principal underlying mechanism responsible for HFpEF in the individual patient. The recognition of different phenotypic presentations of HFpEF (infiltrative, metabolic, genetic, and inflammatory) can assist the clinician in tailoring the appropriate management, and offer prognostic information. The goal of this review is to highlight several key phenotypes of HFpEF and illustrate the classic clinical scenario and echocardiographic features of each phenotype with real patient cases.

### Management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a review [^115SFEVx]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this article was to review the clinical management of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF).

Methods

For this critical review, electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed) were searched for relevant basic research studies and randomized clinical trials recently published or presented at major meetings. Details of in-progress or planned studies were obtained from the ClinicalTrials.gov website. The range of publication dates was the year 2000 to 2015. Search terms included HFPEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, HFPSF, heart failure with preserved systolic function, diastolic heart failure, diastolic dysfunction, HFNEF, heart failure with normal ejection fraction, treatment, management, therapy.

Findings

Patients with HFPEF account for up to half of all patients with a clinical diagnosis of HF. Key contributing factors include hypertension, obesity, and atrial fibrillation, and other chronic diseases, including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and anemia, frequently coexist. To date, large-scale clinical trials, particularly those focused on antagonism of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, have provided limited evidence of clinical benefit.

Implications

The aggressive management of contributing factors, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial ischemia, is key in the management of HFPEF. New insights into the mechanisms and thus the identification of potential therapeutic strategies are urgently required.

### Biological phenotypes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116Bym5y]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, which result in the heterogeneous phenotypes that are evident clinically, and which have potentially confounded previous HFpEF trials. A greater understanding of the in vivo human processes involved, and in particular, which are the causes and which are the downstream effects, may allow the syndrome of HFpEF to be distilled into distinct diagnoses based on the underlying biology. From this, specific interventions can follow, targeting individuals identified on the basis of their biological phenotype. This review describes the biological phenotypes of HFpEF and therapeutic interventions aimed at targeting these phenotypes.

HFpEF diagnostic scoring systems — To support diagnosis of suspected heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), both the H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF algorithms use a scoring system. H2FPEF was derived and validated using a gold-standard reference of invasive exercise hemodynamic measurements and is the more practical system for use by clinicians; its 6 components are Heavy (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m²), Hypertension (on 2 or more antihypertensive medications), Atrial Fibrillation, Pulmonary hypertension (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 35 mm Hg on Doppler echocardiography), Elder (age > 60 years), and Filling pressures (E/e′ > 9 on Doppler echocardiography), and "A score of 6 or more is highly suggestive of HFpEF". HFA-PEFF was developed based on expert consensus, is more involved with potential hemodynamic assessment, and includes 4 steps: Step 1 Pretest assessment (clinical assessment and standard diagnostic tests, including natriuretic peptides, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms), Step 2 Echocardiographic and natriuretic peptide score, Step 3 Functional testing in cases of uncertainty (diastolic stress test with exercise stress echocardiography followed by invasive hemodynamic measurements, if needed), and Step 4 Final etiology (testing to exclude other cardiac causes of dyspnea and/or edema such as infiltrative/restrictive cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, or pericardial disease); the algorithm includes natriuretic peptides and notes that natriuretic peptide levels are generally lower in individuals with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF.

Definition

Contemporary definitions of HF distinguish HF types based on differences in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Current international guidelines (ESC and American Heart Association (AHA)) divide HF into HFrEF with LVEF of < 40%, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) with LVEF between 41% and 49%, and HFpEF with LVEF of > 50%. Figure 1 presents internationally accepted definition and diagnostic criteria distinguishing types of HF. Per this definition, HFpEF is a clinical syndrome consisting of symptoms and signs of HF, with evidence of structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and/or raised natriuretic peptides (NPs), and with an LVEF of ≥ to 50%. What is worth noting though is that NP may not be raised in about 20% of patients presenting with true HFpEF. In the Diagnostic process section, we provide further explanation of the underlying causes of normal NP in patients with HFpEF.

Figure 1
Types of HF according to differences of LVEF based on internationally accepted universal definition of HF.HF, heart failure; HFmrEF, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; LV, left ventricular; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction.

Prior to use of the term HFpEF, 'diastolic dysfunction' term was used to describe this complex clinical syndrome; however, its use has been discouraged since it became clear that diastolic dysfunction is not unique to HFpEF, but it coexists in HFrEF and HFmrEF too. Originally, HFpEF was viewed as a disorder due solely to abnormalities in LV diastolic function; however, the understanding has evolved such that HFpEF is now understood as a systemic syndrome, involving multiple organ systems, likely triggered by inflammation and with an important contribution of ageing, lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition and multiple comorbidities.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: present status and future directions [^112LqFRb]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical importance of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has recently become apparent. HFpEF refers to heart failure (HF) symptoms with normal or near-normal cardiac function on echocardiography. Common clinical features of HFpEF include diastolic dysfunction, reduced compliance, and ventricular hypokinesia. HFpEF differs from the better-known HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Despite having a "preserved ejection fraction", patients with HFpEF have symptoms such as shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and limited exercise capability. Furthermore, the mortality rate and cumulative survival rate are as severe in HFpEF as they are in HFrEF. While beta-blockers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulators can improve the survival rate in HFrEF, no known therapeutic agents show similar effectiveness in HFpEF. Researchers have examined molecular events in the development of HFpEF using small and middle-sized animal models. This review discusses HFpEF with regard to etiology and clinical features and introduces the use of mouse and other animal models of human HFpEF.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in women — presentation and diagnosis includes sex-specific differences with great attributable risk from traditional risk factors and unique risk factors, a distinct symptom profile, and distinct echocardiographic findings. On echocardiographic imaging, women with HFpEF are more likely to have more significant concentric left ventricular (LV) remodeling accompanied by more impaired LV relaxation and higher diastolic stiffness, and with more concentric remodeling women tend to have smaller LV chamber size and are thus more prone to demonstrate higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared with men. The use of sex-neutral thresholds for "normal" may result in underestimation of LV dysfunction in women; an LVEF of 50% to 55% may be abnormal in a woman, and sex-neutral EF thresholds are noted to lead to underestimation of LV dysfunction. In contrast to echocardiography, natriuretic peptides perform relatively similarly for a diagnosis of exclusion of HFpEF in women compared with men, with similar caveats regarding appropriate cutpoints and the effect of comorbidities.

Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of HFpEF is complex, and systemic changes related to comorbid conditions drive myocardial dysfunction. Various mechanisms have been suggested as causing the pathophysiology of HFpEF, either individually or in combination with LV diastolic dysfunction. Over the last decade, a new paradigm has been presented, describing a sequence of events leading to HFpEF. A systemic proinflammatory state induced by concomitant comorbidities is thought to be at the core the pathological process in HFpEF. As illustrated in figure 2, HFpEF is a caused by diverse underlying conditions and comorbidities, resulting in a population of people with diverse characteristics. Future vision for the treatment of HFpEF is a personalised approach including precise risk stratification, using targeted therapies and preventative intervention.

In HFpEF, the myocardium displays a number of functional and structural abnormalities. Comorbid conditions initiate a systemic proinflammatory state which leads to coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation. This inflammation ignites a cascade of changes at the molecular level that promotes myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. These contribute to increased LV diastolic stiffness, which slows LV relaxation. LV diastolic filling pressures increase, leading to impaired cardiac output, which gives rise to symptoms of HF. Altered intramyocardial signalling, energetic abnormalities and impaired density and autoregulation of the microcirculation have also been noted. The remodelling in HFpEF differs from that seen in HFrEF, driven primarily by a loss of cardiomyocytes.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1165Skcq]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — clinical diagnosis requires the presence of signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (HF) and an echocardiographic determination of normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) generally accepted to be ≥ 50% in the absence of other cardiac or noncardiac causes for the patient's symptoms. The recognition of the clinical HF syndrome is the first step in diagnosing HFpEF; although the Framingham criteria demonstrate excellent specificity for the diagnosis of HF, they lack sensitivity, particularly in elderly patients who may have not had acute HF decompensation, and therefore a patient may have HFpEF even in the absence of satisfying specific clinical criteria for HF. Early presenting symptoms of HFpEF may be relatively nonspecific, including exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or fatigue, and clinical suspicion should be further raised if these symptoms occur with one or more commonly associated risk factors, including history of hypertension, elderly age (> 60 years), obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m²), history of diabetes mellitus, or history of atrial fibrillation.

Heart failure phenotypes and definitions — Heart failure (HF) is defined by symptoms and/or signs from structural/functional cardiac abnormalities with specific objective criteria, and ejection fraction (EF) phenotypes are categorized as follows: HF is defined as symptoms/signs of HF with structural/functional abnormalities and at least 1 of elevated natriuretic peptides or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion; heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) requires a clinical diagnosis of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%; heart failure with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF) requires clinical HF with LVEF 41% to 49%; HF with improved EF is previous LVEF ≤ 40% with a follow-up measurement > 40%; heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) is clinical HF with LVEF ≥ 50% not attributable to infiltrative cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, pericardial disease, or high-output HF; and HFpEF mimics are clinical HF with LVEF ≥ 50% with a primary noncardiac cause (kidney or liver disease) or an underlying cardiac cause including infiltrative or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular or pericardial disease, or high-output HF.

Cardiac mimics — diagnostic assessment in suspected heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is advised: Rather than presuming that all individuals with evidence of congestion and preserved EF have HFpEF, such individuals should undergo further diagnostic assessment, as dictated by the clinical presentation, to identify underlying causes for which there are disease-directed therapies. Consideration of two case examples shows identical symptoms and echocardiogram findings; by the Universal Definition of HF, both have HF and both have H2FPEF scores suggestive of HFpEF, yet the first individual likely has HFpEF with associated comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD), whereas the second individual has a high likelihood of HFpEF attributed to a specific source, transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, and the second individual likely has an HFpEF mimic attributable to a specific disease entity and requiring specific disease-directed therapy.

### How to manage heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: practical guidance for clinicians [^113Fz8uh]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Although patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%) comprise nearly half of those with chronic heart failure, evidence-based treatment options for this population have historically been limited. Recently, however, emerging data from prospective, randomized trials enrolling patients with HFpEF have greatly altered the range of pharmacologic options to modify disease progression in selected patients with HFpEF. In the context of this evolving landscape, clinicians are increasingly in need of practical guidance regarding the best approach to management of this growing population. In this review, the authors build on the recently published heart failure guidelines by integrating contemporary data from recent randomized trials to provide a contemporary framework for diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of patients with HFpEF. Where gaps in knowledge persist, the authors provide "best available" data from post hoc analyses of clinical trials or data from observational studies to guide management until more definitive studies are available.

Incorporating exercise testing within thealgorithm

The HFA‐PEFF algorithm includes ergometry and 6MWT, however CPET is not recommended as a typical element of the initial HFpEF workup, mainly because of the low specificity to diagnose HFpEF. Nonetheless, the role of cardiac versus pulmonary predominance in generating symptoms is crucial.

The use of CPET along the steps of the HFA‐PEFF appears also quite relevant for implementing the diagnostic and clinical oriented approach. Peak VO₂ should be paralleled by the VE/VCO₂ slope analysis in the search for a right heart involvement and PH coexistence, adding both specificity and specificity to HFpEF diagnosis.

The CPET may then play a role in an in‐depth phenotyping of the functional response assisting in the identification and relative importance of the individual defective mechanisms in the O₂ cascade, allowing assignment of patients to a specific exercise‐based HFpEF phenotype.

Therefore, translating these concepts to the HFA‐PEFF algorithm would enable important implementations in the diagnosis and clinical workup of HFpEF. Accordingly, we propose that CPET assessment should be referred in more details in Step 1 (P, pre‐assessment) to ascertain the degree of functional limitation and to address toward the primary origin of symptoms, and in Step 4 (F, final aetiology) for a comprehensive analysis of O₂ cascade organ‐related defective mechanisms. This conceivable pathophysiological‐oriented supported approach would certainly require dedicated studies aimed at exactly defining the prioritization order to get an ideal operationalization of gas exchange analysis even better when combined with imaging and invasive haemodynamic evaluation,(Graphical Abstract). Information in terms of prognosis and clinical work‐up should be derived at all steps proposed.

Step 1 (P): pre‐assessment

Exercise gas exchange can delineate cardiac and extracardiac reserve capacity impairments contributing to exertional intolerance. Importantly, abnormal findings under resting (e.g. spirometry, echocardiography) may anticipate but not definitively prove their relevance to exertional dyspnoea. If the diagnosis of HFpEF is ruled out by the HFA‐PEFF score (Step 2 [E]), or by a diastolic stress test (Step 3 [F1]), the collected data at CPET evaluation could provide alternative explanations of cardiac and non‐cardiac reasons of exertional dyspnoea, or at least provide evidence to pursue further examinations to determine the true source of symptoms.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: everything the clinician needs to know [^116UzWfo]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is increasingly recognised and diagnosed in clinical practice, a trend driven by an ageing population and a rise in contributing comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes. Representing at least half of all heart failure cases, HFpEF is recognised as a complex clinical syndrome. Its diagnosis and management are challenging due to its diverse pathophysiology, varied epidemiological patterns, and evolving diagnostic and treatment approaches. This Seminar synthesises the latest insights on HFpEF, integrating findings from recent clinical trials, epidemiological research, and the latest guideline recommendations. We delve into the definition, pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, and management strategies (non-pharmacological and pharmacological) for HFpEF. We highlight ongoing clinical trials and future developments in the field. Specifically, this Seminar offers practical guidance tailored for primary care practitioners, generalists, and cardiologists who do not specialise in heart failure, simplifying the complexities in the diagnosis and management of HFpEF. We provide practical, evidence-based recommendations, emphasising the importance of addressing comorbidities and integrating the latest pharmacological treatments, such as SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Supervised exercise training for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and American college of cardiology [^115WAga5]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is one of the most common forms of heart failure; its prevalence is increasing, and outcomes are worsening. Affected patients often experience severe exertional dyspnea and debilitating fatigue, as well as poor quality of life, frequent hospitalizations, and a high mortality rate. Until recently, most pharmacological intervention trials for HFpEF yielded neutral primary outcomes. In contrast, trials of exercise-based interventions have consistently demonstrated large, significant, clinically meaningful improvements in symptoms, objectively determined exercise capacity, and usually quality of life. This success may be attributed, at least in part, to the pleiotropic effects of exercise, which may favorably affect the full range of abnormalities-peripheral vascular, skeletal muscle, and cardiovascular-that contribute to exercise intolerance in HFpEF. Accordingly, this scientific statement critically examines the currently available literature on the effects of exercise-based therapies for chronic stable HFpEF, potential mechanisms for improvement of exercise capacity and symptoms, and how these data compare with exercise therapy for other cardiovascular conditions. Specifically, data reviewed herein demonstrate a comparable or larger magnitude of improvement in exercise capacity from supervised exercise training in patients with chronic HFpEF compared with those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, although Medicare reimbursement is available only for the latter group. Finally, critical gaps in implementation of exercise-based therapies for patients with HFpEF, including exercise setting, training modalities, combinations with other strategies such as diet and medications, long-term adherence, incorporation of innovative and more accessible delivery methods, and management of recently hospitalized patients are highlighted to provide guidance for future research.

Simple three-step diagnostic pathway:

Signs and symptoms of HF.
An LVEF of ≥ 50%.
Objective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnormalities consistent with LV diastolic dysfunction/raised LV filling pressures, including raised NPs (see table 1).

Table 1
Objective evidence used in the diagnosis of HFpEF

If resting ECHO and laboratory indicators are inconclusive, a diastolic stress test can help. Invasive haemodynamic exercise testing is used to confirm the diagnosis of HFpEF. A pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of ≥ 15 mm Hg at rest or ≥ 25 mm Hg with exercise or LV end-diastolic pressure of ≥ 16 mm Hg (at rest) is deemed diagnostic.

Current guidelines do not require gold standard testing in every patient to make a diagnosis of HFpEF. Because in majority of patients the diagnosis can be made based on the combination of symptoms, signs, ECHO findings and NT-proBNP level, further testing is often not necessary. However, for those cases where patients present with persistent symptoms but simple tests do not confirm a diagnosis of HFpEF, we can consider either exercise stress ECHO or invasive haemodynamic exercise testing. Unfortunately, there are no real-world data suggesting how frequently the invasive haemodynamic exercise testing is used in clinical practice.

Because many patients with HFpEF have only symptoms during exertion, acquiring ECHO during exercise can unmask LV diastolic and systolic functions. Two most studied parameters indicative of increase in PCWP and pulmonary artery systolic pressure are early diastolic transmitral flow velocity to early diastolic mitral annular tissue velocity (E:e') ratio and the tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity. Guidelines emphasise that the larger the amount of non-invasive indicators of raised LV filling pressures, the greater the likelihood of a diagnosis of HFpEF.

### The key role of diagnostic imaging in early HFpEF [^115skqvm]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a prevalent, costly, and highly morbid syndrome that affects more than one-half of all patients with heart failure. For patients with HFpEF, it is crucial to identify patients as early as possible in stage C for prompt diagnosis and intervention. However, detecting HFpEF in its early stage can be challenging without suspecting its potential, particularly in cases without overt volume overload or those with elevated left atrial pressure only during exercise (ie, early stage C HFpEF). Consequently, it has become increasingly important to investigate and understand early HFpEF in greater detail, with the overall goal of reducing the burden of overt and advanced stage C HFpEF in the population. The authors provide a comprehensive update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic testing, and management of the early stage of HFpEF, with a particular focus on diagnostic imaging.

### MicroRNA signatures differentiate preserved from reduced ejection fraction heart failure [^113KjSWp]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) has reached epidemic proportions, affecting ∼1–3% of the population within European countries, amounting to 15 million people. The syndrome is characterized by significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, with 5-year mortality of newly diagnosed HF as high as 50%and 10-year survival of 26.7%. Effective management of HF depends on an accurate and rapid diagnosis. Currently, this requires assessment of symptoms and physical signs in combination with advanced and expensive imaging of cardiac structure and function. Symptom-based diagnostic challenges occur as co-morbidities of HF have similar presentations, and practical challenges are posed by the fact that the majority of HF cases are found in the community setting, where imaging equipment and expertise are not readily available. In addition, it has been well demonstrated that HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) cannot be readily differentiated on clinical grounds and requires assessment by these imaging tests. This barrier to effective diagnosis and work-up of heart failure is underscored by data from the UK indicating that more than half of patients with a community diagnosis of HF do not have echocardiography performed and therefore have a 'questionable diagnosis'. Having the ability to diagnose HF more confidently within the community and to be able to differentiate between HFpEF and HFrEF would be of significant clinical value as the management of these conditions differs and patients could be more readily triaged while waiting for extensive clinical work-up within the cardiology department in hospitals.

### Characterization of the progression from ambulatory to hospitalized heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116gMCCa]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous syndrome. Some patients develop elevated filling pressures exclusively during exercise and never require hospitalization, whereas others periodically develop congestion that requires inpatient treatment. The features differentiating these cohorts are unclear.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of 7 National Institutes of Health-sponsored multicenter trials of HFpEF (EF ≥ 50%, N = 727). Patients were stratified by history of hospitalization because of HF, comparing patients never hospitalized (HFpEF NH) to those with a prior hospitalization (HFpEF PH). Currently hospitalized (HFpEF CH) patients were included to fill the spectrum. Clinical characteristics, cardiac structure, biomarkers, quality of life, functional capacity, activity levels, and outcomes were compared.

Results

As expected, HFpEF CH (n = 338) displayed the greatest severity of congestion, as assessed by N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels, edema and orthopnea. As compared to HFpEF NH (n = 109), HFpEF PH (n = 280) displayed greater comorbidity burden, with more lung disease, renal dysfunction and anemia, along with lower activity levels (accelerometry), poorer exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance and peak exercise capacity), and more orthopnea. Patients with current or prior hospitalization displayed higher rates of future HF hospitalization, but quality of life was similarly impaired in all patients with HFpEF, regardless of hospitalization history.

Conclusions

A greater burden of noncardiac organ dysfunction, sedentariness, functional impairment, and higher event rates distinguish patients with HFpEF and prior HF hospitalization from those never hospitalized. Despite lower event rates, quality of life is severely and similarly limited in patients with no history of hospitalization. These data suggest that the 2 clinical profiles of HFpEF may require different treatment strategies.

Redfield MM, Borlaug BA. Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction: A Review. JAMA. 2023; 329: 827–838. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2023. 2020 Importance Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, defined as HF with an EF of 50% or higher at diagnosis, affects approximately 3 million people in the US and up to 32 million people worldwide. Patients with HFpEF are hospitalized approximately 1. 4 times per year and have an annual mortality rate of approximately 15%. Observations Risk factors for HFpEF include older age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Approximately 65% of patients with HFpEF present with dyspnea and physical examination, chest radiographic, echocardiographic, or invasive hemodynamic evidence of HF with overt congestion at rest. Approximately 35% of patients with HFpEF present with "unexplained" dyspnea on exertion, meaning they do not have clear physical, radiographic, or echocardiographic signs of HF.

These patients have elevated atrial pressures with exercise as measured with invasive hemodynamic stress testing or estimated with Doppler echocardiography stress testing. In unselected patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea, the H2FPEF score incorporating clinical and resting Doppler echocardiographic variables can assist with diagnosis. Specific causes of the clinical syndrome of HF with normal EF other than HFpEF should be identified and treated, such as valvular, infiltrative, or pericardial disease. First-line pharmacologic therapy consists of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, which reduced HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death by approximately 20% compared with placebo in randomized clinical trials.

### Epidemiology and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction: rationale and design of the study [^1169hT4o]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Despite major advances in our understanding of 'systolic' heart failure, at present the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy of heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) is poorly understood, in large part because of the lack of robust and widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Although there is a good evidence base for the treatment of systolic heart failure, similar data are lacking for the treatment of HFpEF. Methods In our study, we will screen a consecutive series of 5000 subjects aged ≥ 60 from the community. Following symptom questionnaire and echocardiography, metabolic exercise testing will be used to confirm whether or not patients thought clinically to have HFpEF are in fact exercise limited and that this limitation is cardiac in origin. Blood samples for plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) will be taken at rest and following exercise in symptomatic patients and matching controls.

Conclusions

At the end of our study we will establish community prevalence and population characteristics of HFpEF, and also evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of current echocardiography parameters and BNP for the diagnosis of the condition.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: new approaches to diagnosis and management [^112pfcjm]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

3 CONCLUSIONS

HFpEF is the most common form of HF in the community, its prevalence is increasing, and prognosis has not improved or even worsened. It is nearly unique to older adults and is a true geriatric syndrome. Despite a moderate number of clinical trials, therapeutic successes to date have been few, and clinical management is largely empiric. An evolving paradigm suggests that, like other geriatric syndromes, HFpEF is complex and multifactorial, probably systemic, and clinically heterogeneous and has a multifactorial pathophysiology, underlying age‐related changes, frequent multiple chronic comorbidities and multiorgan involvement. Understanding the relationship between HFpEF and aging may help with understanding the biology of HFpEF more generally. In addition, machine learning techniques suggested by Shah et al, when applied to large phenotyped (both biological and clinical) datasets in combination with clinical outcomes may help to improve our understanding of how biological phenotypes integrate with clinical phenotypes. Efforts are underway to utilize these concepts to identify novel therapeutic targets, improve the design of future clinical trials, and to develop effective clinical management algorithms. Finally, the complexities of these patients demand an approach that is more holistic by addressing not only direct HF‐related conditions but also optimal management of geriatric syndromes, focusing on quality of life.

2.14 HFpEF management based on clinical phenotypes

A key evolving concept in HFpEF therapy is that the disorder is highly heterogeneous and manifestations can vary markedly from patient to patient even within a specific HFpEF patient population. 72 More recently, Shah et al proposed a matrix combining predisposition phenotypes with clinical presentation phenotypes as a starting point to guide clinical care in HFpEF (Figure 3). 7 The approach starts with general treatment recommendations beneficial to the majority of HFpEF patients because they address the presentation phenotypes of lung congestion and the most common phenotype of overweight/obesity, present in > 80% of HFpEF patients. Subsequently, supplementary recommendations are suggested for additional phenotypes, such as metabolic/obesity, arterial hypertension, renal dysfunction, and coronary artery disease. Additional clinical presentation phenotypes are suggested in whom specific therapeutic interventions could be meaningful like chronotropic incompetence, pulmonary hypertension, skeletal muscle weakness, and AF. This phenotype‐specific approach may prove a valuable advance.

2.15 HFpEF management based on biologic phenotypes

An understanding of which are the causes and which are the downstream effects, may allow the HFpEF syndrome to be concentrated into distinct diagnoses based on the underlying biology. From this, specific interventions can follow, targeting individuals identified on the basis of their biological phenotype. This concept was recently expanded upon by Lewis et al, 74 suggesting that determining the underlying pathobiologic disease mechanism which ultimately leads to specific clinical phenotypes can drive discernment of "biological phenotype" and integrate with the clinical" phenotypes" thereby further enhancing the potential gains from individualized approaches on the basis of enhanced phenotypic categorization. Biological heterogeneity has potentially compromised in prior HFpEF trials, thus HFpEF now needs "to get personal".

### Is the weight over? An improved HFpEF risk score [^116eCf7v]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Given recent advances in therapeutic options for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), noninvasive screening and diagnostic tools are critical to accurately identify patients and ensure they get timely treatment to improve health and prevent adverse outcomes. This can be challenging since patients with HFpEF often have other concomitant comorbid conditions that can present with similar symptoms — for example, obesity, present in over half of patients with HFpEF, can contribute to exercise intolerance and fatigue independent of HFpEF.

There are 2 commonly used risk scores currently used for HFpEF in clinical practice. The H2FPEF score, published in 2018, is comprised of 6 factors: body mass index (BMI), age, number of antihypertensive medications, diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction via E/e' ratio, and echocardiographic measures of estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure. The HFA-PEFF score, introduced in 2019, includes additional echocardiographic data points, as well as natriuretic peptide levels. Despite the high specificity and sensitivity of these scores individually, in a validation study of patients with unexplained dyspnea, the H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF scores resulted as "indeterminate" in approximately half of patients. In current HFpEF algorithms, indeterminate scores result in downstream recommendations for exercise invasive hemodynamic, or stress echocardiographic, testing to confirm diagnosis; however, neither of these are routinely done in real-world practice. While these tools can be helpful, the aforementioned limitations indicate the need for improved tools for addressing diagnostic uncertainty in practice.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis and treatment: an updated review of the evidence [^112Mc9L2]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last several decades, clinicians and clinical scientists have had growing interest in heart failure (HF) diagnosis and treatment. While HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) is a well-known clinical entity with several therapeutic strategies proven to be successful, HF with preserved ejection fraction is a more heterogenous syndrome with a prevalence that has increased in the last two decades, without effective therapeutic strategies. Great strides have been made in the detection of predisposing risk factors and pathological mechanisms; however, pharmacological therapies have shown to be ineffective in reducing cardiovascular mortality in the HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) population, opening the way to the necessity of developing new precision medicine based approaches. On the other hand, novel therapies and device interventions still require refinements with the ultimate goal of offering new clinically treatments for the HFpEF population. The aim of the present review is to provide insights into the HFpEF pathophysiology, diagnostic pathways and the latest updates on treatment strategies and their potential future application in routine clinical practice.

### Prognostic value of anxiety between heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114SoFY1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Both depression and anxiety are common in patients with heart failure (HF). 1, 2, 3 Considerable research supports the fact that depression is an independent predictive factor for mortality and readmission in patients with HF. 3, 4 However, evidence of the impact of anxiety on mortality and readmission among patients with HF varies, and studies disagree whether there is a significant 5, 6 or insignificant association that exists between the 2 prognoses. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

According to the 2016 European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Guidelines, most cases of HF can be divided into HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; LVEF ≥ 50%). 15 Despite many similarities in symptoms and signs, the results of review studies indicate that HFrEF and HFpEF have different clinical characteristics (ie, bimodal EF distribution and response to therapies) and pathophysiological mechanisms (ie, ventricular remodeling, endothelial dysfunctions, and vascular stiffness). 16

### Does my patient with multiple comorbidities have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and does It matter? [^112ZhPBq]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is a common diagnosis and accounts for half or more of all cases of heart failure. Despite its high prevalence and significant morbidity, the pathophysiology of HFpEF remains incompletely understood. Patients diagnosed with HFpEF often have significant cardiac and extra-cardiac comorbidities. Given the availability of evidence-based treatments for common comorbidities, but not for HFpEF, the necessity of diagnosing HFpEF among symptomatic elderly patients with multiple comorbidities is unclear. This commentary raises the question of whether the search for the diagnosis of HFpEF should instead be refocused to the management of common comorbidities without necessitating the heart failure diagnosis.

The recognition of the magnitude of the problem of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the past 20 years has spurred an explosion of clinical investigation and growing intensity of informative outcome trials. This article addresses the historic development of this component of the heart failure syndrome, including the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and existing and planned therapeutic studies. Looking forward, more specific phenotyping and even genotyping of subpopulations should lead to improvements in outcomes from future trials.

HFpEF-specific considerations include "EF 50% or greater", "Lower levels of natriuretic peptides relative to HFrEF for a given elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure", and that "Higher BMI (prevalent in HFpEF) is inversely associated with natriuretic peptide levels". When using natriuretic peptides, ambulatory thresholds are "BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL", and hospitalized thresholds are "BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 300 pg/mL". As a complementary reference, the Framingham HF Diagnostic Criteria state that "Two or more major criteria or 1 major criterion plus 2 minor criteria are strictly required to make the diagnosis", with major criteria including "orthopnea, jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux, rales, S3 gallop rhythm, acute pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly", and minor criteria including "dyspnea on exertion, nocturnal cough, ankle edema, tachycardia with heart rate over 120 beats per minute, hepatomegaly, and pleural effusion".

### Differences in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction management between care providers: an international survey [^113rY5Eu]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) represents a life‐threatening syndrome and a major global public health concern, affecting over 64 million individuals worldwide.HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for around 30% of HF cases, with its incidence and prevalence on a continuous rise, forecasting that it will soon become the predominant HF phenotype. Its prognosis is poor, with a 5‐year crude mortality and readmission rate similar to that of HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF), although HFpEF has a lower incidence of cardiovascular death and cardiovascular hospitalizations.

Diagnosing HFpEF remains challenging, often going undetected due to the absence of clear diagnostic criteria, lack of non‐invasive gold‐standard diagnostic tests, and non‐specific symptoms. Identification of HFpEF involves all levels of care. Given the older age, high comorbidity burden, and symptoms that often overlap with other conditions, a significant proportion of HFpEF patients are encountered by non‐HF specialists, predominantly non‐cardiologists.

Following a series of neutral randomized clinical trials (RCTs), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as the first drug class shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in HFpEF. The availability of this pharmacological treatment and its class I recommendation in international HF guidelines highlight the crucial need for prompt identification and treatment of HFpEF across diverse healthcare settings. Primary care physicians and internal medicine doctors are strongly advised to recognize HFpEF, initiate diagnostic testing and the relative guideline‐directed medical treatment. Addressing comorbidities is crucial, as well as referring to a cardiologist when needed. Cardiologists are responsible for confirming the HFpEF diagnosis, optimizing guideline‐directed medical therapy, and evaluating the need for consulting an HF specialist. Despite significant variability between countries in the definition and availability of HF specialists, their involvement is essential when the diagnosis remains debatable, for example, in patients with HF symptoms and preserved EF but without the typical HFpEF phenotype (e.g. elderly women with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and renal disease, or obese men with metabolic syndrome), or when patients present red flags for potential underlying specific treatable cardiomyopathies. These conditions include coronary artery disease, constrictive pericarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis (CA), and other form of infiltrative cardiac diseases. Upon confirming these conditions, HF specialists can initiate specific disease‐modifying therapies.

This survey aimed to assess and compare HFpEF management across different specialties, that is, cardiologists versus HF specialists versus non‐cardiologists.

### Nonpharmacological approaches to managing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116K1Vvg]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a condition in which the pumping function of the heart is abnormal under the influence of various clinical syndromes and cardiovascular diseases, resulting in a relative and absolute deficit in cardiac output with subsequent structural changes and functional decline in the body. The recently published universal definition of HF classified HF based on ejection fraction: (1) heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%; (2) HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction: LVEF 41% ≈49%; (3) heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): LVEF ≥ 50%; and (4) HF with improved ejection fraction: baseline LVEF ≤ 40%, LVEF increase ≥ LVEF > 40% at the second measurement. Despite the availability of evidence-based pharmacological treatments, such as SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and diuretics, the management of HFpEF remains challenging. This complexity can be attributed, in part, to the intricate pathophysiological mechanisms inherent to HFpEF and the prevalence of numerous coexisting comorbidities within this patient cohort. As a result, there is still a pressing need for the development of effective treatment strategies for HFpEF, which has led to increased interest in nonpharmacological interventions as potential therapeutic alternatives.

### Assessing LV contractility identifies populations with preserved ejection fraction at risk of adverse heart failure outcomes [^1167AB6W]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Current recommendations classify heart failure (HF) by left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, largely based on the inclusion criteria of randomized controlled trials. There are well-known limitations of LV ejection fraction, including modest reproducibility, load dependence, and the fact that this measure represents the percentage change in LV volumes during the cardiac cycle, rather than contractility. LV ejection fraction also provides little prognostic information within those with HF with preserved ejection fraction. The ratio of systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume index, or cardiac contractility index, provides additional information that helps reclassify individuals with HF with preserved ejection fraction. Below-median cardiac contractility index identifies a group with distinct clinical characteristics who are at increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Below-median cardiac contractility index also identifies healthy individuals without HF and apparently normal heart function who are at increased risk of incident HF. Assessing LV contractility may help identify patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction who could benefit from targeted therapies.

See Editorial by

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome characterized by breathlessness, fatigue, frequent hospitalization, and premature death. Current recommendations classify individuals by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the most commonly reported imaging biomarker of systolic function. Around half of people with HF have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and these individuals have similar symptoms and impairments in quality of life as those with HF with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).LVEF is a complex summary measure of systolic function with known limitations, including modest reproducibility, load dependence, and represents the percentage change in left ventricular (LV) volume, rather than contractility.

Although diastolic dysfunction is a key mechanism underpinning the pathophysiology of HFpEF, the presence of subtle or concomitant contractile dysfunction is an additional putative mechanism associated with adverse outcomes. Simply classifying individuals as having an LVEF that is normal may risk misclassifying individuals who have any degree of systolic dysfunction. While the ability to more easily identify subtle contractile dysfunction could help further refine the phenotypic classification of HFpEF, stratify risk, and identify those who have the potential to derive benefit from disease-modifying pharmacological therapies.

The ratio of LV end-systolic pressure to LV end-systolic volume provides a relatively afterload-independent assessment of LV contractility. An entirely noninvasive assessment of LV contractility is possible by using systolic blood pressure as a surrogate of LV end-systolic pressure. The ratio of systolic blood pressure to LV end-systolic volume index, or cardiac contractility index (CCI), is an accepted method of determining the force-frequency relationship in humans; – however, its prognostic significance in unselected populations is unknown.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and preserved EF (HFpEF) — classification and diagnostic considerations emphasize EF thresholds with supportive objective measures: Patients "are classified in this document as HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF)" and "are usually in a dynamic trajectory to improvement from HFrEF or to deterioration to HFrEF", so "1 EF measurement at 1 time point may not be adequate". The diagnosis "can be challenging", and "the classic clinical signs and symptoms of HF, together with EF of 41% to 49% or ≥ 50%, respectively, are necessary for the diagnosis of the HFmrEF and HFpEF", yet additional objective measures "can improve the diagnostic specificity". "Elevated natriuretic peptide levels are supportive of the diagnosis, but normal levels do not exclude a diagnosis of HFmrEF or HFpEF". To improve specificity, "the clinical diagnosis of HF in these EF categories should be further supported by objective measures", with the committee proposing evidence of "spontaneous (at rest) or provokable (eg, during exercise, fluid challenge) increased LV filling pressures".

### Heart Failure with preserved ejection Fraction: JACC scientific statement [^114fx4eA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) continue to rise in tandem with the increasing age and burdens of obesity, sedentariness, and cardiometabolic disorders. Despite recent advances in the understanding of its pathophysiological effects on the heart, lungs, and extracardiac tissues, and introduction of new, easily implemented approaches to diagnosis, HFpEF remains under-recognized in everyday practice. This under-recognition presents an even greater concern given the recent identification of highly effective pharmacologic-based and lifestyle-based treatments that can improve clinical status and reduce morbidity and mortality. HFpEF is a heterogenous syndrome and recent studies have suggested an important role for careful, pathophysiological-based phenotyping to improve patient characterization and to better individualize treatment. In this JACC Scientific Statement, we provide an in-depth and updated examination of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of HFpEF.

### Differential clinical profiles, exercise responses, and outcomes associated with existing HFpEF definitions [^114SJ84Q]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is common, yet there is currently no consensus on how to define HFpEF according to various society and clinical trial criteria. How clinical and hemodynamic profiles of patients vary across definitions is unclear. We sought to determine clinical characteristics, as well as physiologic and prognostic implications of applying various criteria to define HFpEF.

Methods

We examined consecutive patients with chronic exertional dyspnea (New York Heart Association class II to IV) and ejection fraction ≥ 50% referred for comprehensive cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive hemodynamic monitoring. We applied societal and clinical trial HFpEF definitions and compared clinical profiles, exercise responses, and cardiovascular outcomes.

Results

Of 461 patients (age 58 ± 15 years, 62% women), 416 met American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), 205 met European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and 55 met Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) criteria for HFpEF. Clinical profiles and exercise capacity varied across definitions, with peak oxygen uptake of 16.2 ± 5.2 (ACC/AHA), 14.1 ± 4.2 (ESC), and 12.7 ± 3.1 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ (HFSA). A total of 243 patients had hemodynamic evidence of HFpEF (abnormal rest or exercise filling pressures), of whom 222 met ACC/AHA, 161 met ESC, and 41 met HFSA criteria. Over a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes ranged from 75 (ACC/AHA) to 298 events per 1000 person-years (HFSA). Application of clinical trial definitions of HFpEF similarly resulted in distinct patient classification and prognostication.

Conclusions

Use of different HFpEF classifications variably enriches for future cardiovascular events, but at the expense of not including up to 85% of individuals with physiologic evidence of HFpEF. Comprehensive phenotyping of patients with suspected heart failure highlights the limitations and heterogeneity of current HFpEF definitions and may help to refine HFpEF subgrouping to test therapeutic interventions.

### How to diagnose heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: the HFA-PEFF diagnostic algorithm: a consensus recommendation from the heart failure association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^116FM5c7]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Making a firm diagnosis of chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains a challenge. We recommend a new stepwise diagnostic process, the 'HFA-PEFF diagnostic algorithm'. Step 1 (P = Pre-test assessment) is typically performed in the ambulatory setting and includes assessment for HF symptoms and signs, typical clinical demographics (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elderly, atrial fibrillation), and diagnostic laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. In the absence of overt non-cardiac causes of breathlessness, HFpEF can be suspected if there is a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, no significant heart valve disease or cardiac ischaemia, and at least one typical risk factor. Elevated natriuretic peptides support, but normal levels do not exclude a diagnosis of HFpEF. The second step (E: Echocardiography and Natriuretic Peptide Score) requires comprehensive echocardiography and is typically performed by a cardiologist. Measures include mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e'), left ventricular (LV) filling pressure estimated using E/e', left atrial volume index, LV mass index, LV relative wall thickness, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, LV global longitudinal systolic strain, and serum natriuretic peptide levels. Major (2 points) and Minor (1 point) criteria were defined from these measures. A score ≥ 5 points implies definite HFpEF; ≤ 1 point makes HFpEF unlikely. An intermediate score (2–4 points) implies diagnostic uncertainty, in which case Step 3 (F1: Functional testing) is recommended with echocardiographic or invasive haemodynamic exercise stress tests. Step 4 (F2: Final aetiology) is recommended to establish a possible specific cause of HFpEF or alternative explanations. Further research is needed for a better classification of HFpEF.

Heart failure (HF) is classified based upon the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous disorder with increasing prevalence in the elderly that remains incompletely understood and inadequately treated as no therapy has shown favorable effects. In this review, we summarize the current theories regarding HFpEF pathogenesis, propose a phenotype-based classification of HFpEF, discuss prevention strategies, explain why clinical trials on HFpEF treatment have failed, and make suggestions for the future.

### Echocardiography reporting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Delphi consensus study [^116cnhN3]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography reports for suspected HFpEF should be adapted to include the phrase 'These findings may be consistent with HFpEF and should be considered in the context of clinical presentation and symptoms'

Traditionally, echocardiography reports have avoided using terminology concurrent with a diagnosis of HFpEF, as commonly they are produced without knowledge of the other components of the diagnosis, for example NT-proBNP and clinical signs and features. However, the recent BSE echocardiographic assessment of LVDF poster has introduced specific reporting terms based on observations.

At the BSE annual conference in Cardiff in October 2023, updated guidelines, subsequently published in June 2024, recommended the use of terms such as 'normal diastolic function for age', 'impaired LV diastolic function with normal filling pressure at rest', and 'impaired LV diastolic function with elevated filling pressure at rest'. For patients with LVEF ≥ 50%, no more than moderate left-sided valve disease, and exertional breathlessness, reports should include the phrase: 'These findings may be consistent with HFpEF and should be considered in the context of clinical presentation and symptoms'. Including this statement in echocardiography reports is intended to improve the management of patients with HFpEF.

The underlying aetiology of findings should be included in echocardiography reports (eg, arterial hypertension) as 'not suggestive', 'equivocal' or 'suggestive'

HFpEF is a complex clinical syndrome with multiple underlying causes. The HFpEF syndrome is an umbrella term, and identification of a specific phenotype provides an opportunity for a tailored treatment approach according to the patient's clinical profile. The most commonly identified phenotypes of primary HFpEF include arterial hypertension (60–80%), elderly (60%–70%) and coronary artery disease (40–70%), but there are many more. It is therefore important that all relevant information suggestive of aetiology is reflected in the echocardiography report. Although definitive diagnosis requires confirmatory testing, appropriate reporting could facilitate onward referral to a specialist. This recommendation aligns with the BSE guidelines for performing a comprehensive TTE in adults.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116QcuVb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Cardiovascular specialist referral in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — for individuals with suspected or proven HFpEF cared for by noncardiovascular specialists, referral should be made for consultation regarding: 1) confirmation of the diagnosis and/or exclusion of other conditions; 2) optimization of risk factors and comorbidities; 3) assessment of prognosis and the potential for advanced HF therapies; and 4) establishment of a framework for ongoing collaboration with primary care clinicians. A convenient acronym for when to consider specialist referral is CHECK-IN, including: 1) poorly controlled comorbidities (such as hypertension, CAD, AF, and kidney dysfunction); 2) concern for diagnoses that resemble HFpEF but require specialized management (such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or cardiac amyloidosis); and 3) worsening prognosis in HFpEF (need for hospitalization, increased diuretic agent requirement, refractory HF symptoms). Given the potential to substantially improve prognosis, specialist referral is advisable in the substantial majority, and following referral, ongoing evaluation and titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to goal may be coordinated between the cardiovascular specialist and primary care clinician with long-term follow-up typically involving the cardiovascular specialist working in a team manner.

### Echocardiography reporting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Delphi consensus study [^114d2Vns]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This Delphi consensus resulted in a set of recommendations aimed at addressing significant gaps and improving healthcare services and outcomes for patients with HFpEF.

HFpEF pathways should be standardised across the UK with timely referral for specialist review and echocardiography assessment

At the policy level, there is widespread recognition of the need to improve the prioritisation of HFpEF across all levels of healthcare settings. The management of these patients is a significant problem within the UK healthcare system due to the complexity of the condition.

A standardised approach to reporting suspected HFpEF, including relevant diagnostic features, may help to minimise duplicate requests (eg, from primary and secondary care). However, it is recognised that increased availability of echocardiography services and specialists is needed to reduce waiting times, which can exceed a year in some regions. The need for a standardised approach for diagnosis and treatment was also identified in the 2023 American College of Cardiology expert consensus on HFpEF.

Services should consider the development and adoption (or incorporation into existing processes) of a referral form for specialist assessment to serve as a basic diagnostic algorithm and encourage appropriate referrals

The term 'form' here could represent an example structure for information flow to ensure collection of a minimum dataset to standardise the referral process. At its most basic, this may be in the form of a printed copy but may also be adopted into current electronic reporting systemsin use in the NHS and potential integration into AI-driven reporting algorithms supported by an evidence base.

This Delphi consensus demonstrated national agreement with NICE guidance, which outlined that diagnosing HF requires a full specialist assessment, with echocardiography being a key component.NICE guidelines recommend that echocardiography be performed within 2 weeks for patients with significantly elevated NT-proBNP levels and within 6 weeks for moderately elevated values. Results of this study demonstrate a strong awareness of these guidelines among specialists. However, there is significant variation across the UK in meeting these timelines. While some regions have urgent referral pathways, others do not, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment that negatively impact patient outcomes.

Timely referral of patients to HF specialists can reduce hospital admissions, alleviate demand on outpatient clinics, and improve patient outcomes and experience. However, patients with HF face challenges in accessing specialist services in the UK, indicating that the referral process is inconsistent. In practice, current referral forms often lack essential information and do not effectively facilitate communication between specialists. An amended referral form could include NT-proBNP, signs and symptoms of HF as a minimum data set to address these gaps.

### Exercise testing in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: an appraisal through diagnosis, pathophysiology and therapy – A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association and European association of preventive cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology [^115Y7Lb9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common and costly clinical condition primarily affecting older adults with multiple comorbid disorders and risk factors of the metabolic syndrome, e.g. hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance. The diagnosis of HFpEF is challenging, and two influential diagnostic scores have recently been introduced into clinical practice as tools to help establish the diagnosis: the HFA‐PEFF score of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)and a composite score (H 2 FPEF) designed by the Mayo Clinic group.

Patients with HFpEF may present with typical signs and symptoms of HF, with or without increased levels of N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide, left ventricular (LV) diastolic impairment, and limited contractile reserve. Most individuals also complain dyspnoea on exertion as dominant manifestation. Remarkably, in the PARAGON‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB Global Outcomes in HFpEF) trial, 50% of the HFpEF population was enrolled based on the evidence of exercise limitation, and exercise‐induced dyspnoea occurred in the 98% of cases. The degree of exercise intolerance observed in HFpEF is similar to that seen in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), with impairments in the oxygen uptake (VO₂) cascade and in the physiological response of multiple organ systems. The relative cardiac and extracardiac contributions to exercise limitation require precise recognition and objective measurements.

Clinical context and diagnostic workup for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) emphasizes that clinical context, including demographic and comorbid risk factors, is important in diagnosis, and that a history and physical examination with echocardiogram may suggest right ventricular HF, pulmonary hypertension, or valvular heart disease, or raise suspicion for myocardial or pericardial diseases requiring further workup. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may support the diagnosis of infiltrative or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or pericardial disease, and further workup with invasive hemodynamics and, in some cases, endomyocardial biopsy or other systemic workup may be needed in selected individuals. The text emphasizes the contribution of noncardiovascular entities and HFpEF mimics to congestion, reinforcing the importance of establishing the diagnosis to optimize disease-directed therapies, and notes that even after mimics are excluded, extending the HFpEF label to identify associated comorbidities emphasizes addressing them to improve symptoms and outcomes.

European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

This reasoning intriguingly advocates a profiling of the O 2 cascade limitations in every patient, which then could be targeted accordingly.

Exertional limitation in HFpEF is not just related to abnormalities in the O₂ cascade (forward convective and diffusive O₂ properties), as increases in pulmonary capillary pressure also cause 'backward' induction of lung congestion resulting in changes in pulmonary mechanics, gas diffusion, and ventilation–perfusion matching. These changes may occur in tandem with or independent of abnormalities in O 2 delivery. In addition, symptoms of effort intolerance in HFpEF may relate to afferent signals originating in the heart, great vessels, and skeletal muscle receptors sensitive to muscle contraction and metabolic byproducts of cellular respiration (ergoreflex).

Ultimately, patients could be assigned to a specific exercise phenotype based on the profile displayed, and these groups may be amenable to specific and targeted therapies. This approach appears a promising avenue to be further explored and validated with precision medicine.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: new approaches to diagnosis and management [^1173qvuT]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of older patients who develop heart failure (HF), particularly older women, have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients with HFpEF have severe symptoms of exercise intolerance, poor quality-of-life, frequent hospitalizations, and increased mortality. The prevalence of HFpEF is increasing and its prognosis is worsening. However, despite its importance, our understanding of the pathophysiology of HFpEF is incomplete, and drug development has proved immensely challenging. Currently, there are no universally accepted therapies that alter the clinical course of HFpEF. Originally viewed as a disorder due solely to abnormalities in left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, our understanding has evolved such that HFpEF is now understood as a systemic syndrome, involving multiple organ systems, likely triggered by inflammation and with an important contribution of aging, lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition, and multiple-comorbidities, features that are typical of a geriatric syndrome. HFpEF is usually progressive due to complex mechanisms of systemic and cardiac adaptation that vary over time, particularly with aging. In this review, we examine evolving data regarding HFpEF that may help explain past challenges and provide future directions to care patients with this highly prevalent, heterogeneous clinical syndrome.

Exercise intolerance is one of the cardinal symptoms of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We review its mechanistic basis using evidence from exercise studies. One barrier to a consensus understanding of the pathophysiology is heterogeneity of the patient population. Therefore, we pay special attention to varying study definitions of the disease and their possible impact on the causal factors that are implicated. We then discuss the role of exercise testing and its potential to subtype HFpEF in to more homogeneous mechanism-based subclasses.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a review [^113M6wD4]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), defined as HF with an EF of 50% or higher at diagnosis, affects approximately 3 million people in the US and up to 32 million people worldwide. Patients with HFpEF are hospitalized approximately 1.4 times per year and have an annual mortality rate of approximately 15%.

Observations

Risk factors for HFpEF include older age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Approximately 65% of patients with HFpEF present with dyspnea and physical examination, chest radiographic, echocardiographic, or invasive hemodynamic evidence of HF with overt congestion (volume overload) at rest. Approximately 35% of patients with HFpEF present with "unexplained" dyspnea on exertion, meaning they do not have clear physical, radiographic, or echocardiographic signs of HF. These patients have elevated atrial pressures with exercise as measured with invasive hemodynamic stress testing or estimated with Doppler echocardiography stress testing. In unselected patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea, the H2FPEF score incorporating clinical (age, hypertension, obesity, atrial fibrillation status) and resting Doppler echocardiographic (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure or left atrial pressure) variables can assist with diagnosis (H2FPEF score range, 0–9; score > 5 indicates more than 95% probability of HFpEF). Specific causes of the clinical syndrome of HF with normal EF other than HFpEF should be identified and treated, such as valvular, infiltrative, or pericardial disease. First-line pharmacologic therapy consists of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, which reduced HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death by approximately 20% compared with placebo in randomized clinical trials. Compared with usual care, exercise training and diet-induced weight loss produced clinically meaningful increases in functional capacity and quality of life in randomized clinical trials. Diuretics (typically loop diuretics, such as furosemide or torsemide) should be prescribed to patients with overt congestion to improve symptoms. Education in HF self-care (eg, adherence to medications and dietary restrictions, monitoring of symptoms and vital signs) can help avoid HF decompensation.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 3 million people in the US have HFpEF. First-line therapy consists of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors, exercise, HF self-care, loop diuretics as needed to maintain euvolemia, and weight loss for patients with obesity and HFpEF.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: new approaches to diagnosis and management [^116xtPXm]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most common form of HF in patients older than 65 years and represents > 50% of prevalent HF cases in community. 1 In the highest age decile, (≥ 90 years old), nearly all patients with HF have preserved EF. HFpEF is associated with high morbidity and mortality. After HF hospitalization, the 5‐year survival of HFpEF is a dismal 35%, worse than many cancers. 2 The risk of death in patients with HFpEF increases with increasing comorbidity burden. 3 Even after adjustment for comorbid conditions, mortality rates associated with HFpEF are higher than in general population age‐matched controls. 4 Patients with HFpEF have similarly high rehospitalization rates as patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). 5 In patients hospitalized with HFpEF, 20% are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge and > 50% within 1 year. 6 Quality of life in HFpEF is as poor as or worse than HFrEF and is associated with physical activity levels that are as suppressed as those observed in patients with moderate‐to‐severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 7 Despite this, there are currently few effective therapies for HFpEF, as most approved therapies for HFrEF have been demonstrated to be ineffective for HFpEF, suggesting major differences in fundamental pathophysiology and therapeutic targets in HFpEF compared to HFrEF. We review relatively recent data that have enhanced our understanding of this complex disorder and that may lead to improved care of patients with this highly prevalent disorder.

### Diastolic dysfunction and sex-specific progression to HFpEF: current gaps in knowledge and future directions [^115t11ue]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)

HFpEF refers to a syndrome in which elevated left ventricular filling pressures and pulmonary pressures resulting from LVDD, cause symptoms and/or signs suggestive of HF, while left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved (≥ 50%). This might cause an increase in natriuretic peptide levels. The most reported symptom in both women and men with HFpEF is exercise-induced shortness of breath. Heart failure with reduced ejection (HFrEF) fraction is considered the counterpart of HFpEF, since left ventricular ejection fraction is decreased. But, also in HFrEF, LVDD contributes to signs and symptoms through increased left ventricular filling pressures. However, in this review, we will mainly focus on HFpEF.

The diagnosis of HFpEF is complex, also because of the multiple cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities associated with the disease, such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and renal dysfunction. These comorbidities may be a cause, contributing factor for developing HFpEF, or an alternative diagnosis ("mimic") for patients presenting with shortness of breath or reduced exercise tolerance. Most of HFpEF comorbidities are hypothesized to contribute to a systemic pro-inflammatory state that can lead to endothelial dysfunction and impaired coronary flow reserve and coronary microvascular dysfunction. The latter were proven to have greater impact on the incidence of major outcomes in women compared to men referred for coronary angiography.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: uncertainties and dilemmas [^112gdpq7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Many uncertainties surround the syndrome of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which was the topic reviewed in an Expert Meeting at the University of Ferrara. This concluded that the absence of clear diagnostic clinical criteria was the major barrier to progress. There was general agreement that symptoms or signs of heart failure, normal LVEF despite an elevated plasma concentration of natriuretic peptides, and signs of abnormal LV relaxation, LV filling, LV hypertrophy, or left atrial enlargement, or diastolic dysfunction supported the diagnosis. However, HFpEF, like all heart failure syndromes, is heterogeneous in aetiology and pathophysiology, rather than being a single disease. HFpEF may account for about half of all patients with heart failure. The classical risk factors for developing HFpEF include age and co-morbidities, notably hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and the metabolic syndrome. When complicated by increasing congestion requiring hospital admission, the prognosis is poor; 30% or more of patients will die within 1 year (nearly two-thirds die from cardiovascular causes). Patients with chronic stable symptoms have a much better prognosis. Despite many clinical trials, there is no solid evidence that any treatment alters the natural history of HFpEF. Several treatments have shown promising early results and are now being tested in substantial randomized clinical trials. Further basic research is required to better characterize the disease and accelerate progress. Our review highlights the many difficulties encountered in performing randomized clinical trials in HFpEF, often due to difficulties in characterizing HFpEF itself.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^117S4U8b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide testing in suspected HFpEF — Levels of natriuretic peptides (NPs), including brain NP and N-terminal pro–B-type NP, should be checked in patients presenting with suspected HFpEF or undifferentiated dyspnea. NP levels are generally higher in patients with HFpEF compared with subjects without HF and have useful prognostic implications, yet NP levels are known to be lower in patients with HFpEF compared with those with HF with reduced EF, and obesity is associated with lower NP levels. Prior studies have indicated that up to 30% of patients with HFpEF can have normal NP levels despite signs and symptoms of HF, echocardiographic abnormalities, and elevated LV filling pressures on invasive hemodynamic testing; therefore, a normal NP level does not necessarily rule out a diagnosis of HFpEF, particularly in obese patients with HFpEF.

### Evolution of a geriatric syndrome: pathophysiology and treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^117FqKrK]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

The majority of older adults who develop heart failure (HF), particularly older women, have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). The prevalence of this syndrome is increasing, and the prognosis is not improving, unlike that of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Individuals with HFpEF have severe symptoms of effort intolerance, poor quality of life, frequent hospitalizations, and greater likelihood of death. Despite the importance of HFpEF, there are numerous major gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology and management. Although it was originally viewed as a disorder due solely to abnormalities in left ventricular diastolic function, our understanding has evolved such that HFpEF is now understood as a systemic syndrome involving multiple organ systems, and it is likely that it is triggered by inflammation and other as-yet-unidentified circulating factors, with important contributions of aging and multiple comorbidities, features generally typical of other geriatric syndromes. We present an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and future directions in this disorder in older persons.

### Primary and secondary diastolic dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112wLpBz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 50% of patients with symptoms and signs of heart failure have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% and are often simply referred to as 'heart failure with preserved EF', 'HFpEF'. Many of such patients have HF secondary to specific cardiac conditions (i.e., valvular or pericardial disease) in which the symptoms and signs occur despite the LVEF being preserved due to diastolic dysfunction secondary to the underlying disease (secondary HFpEF), differently from those HFpEF patients in which the impaired LV filling is due to a primary diastolic dysfunction (primary HFpEF). When primary HFpEF patients are properly diagnosed, they appear to have a milder form of HF with a lower cardiovascular mortality compared with HFrEF and secondary HFpEF population, but a risk of HF hospitalization that is significantly higher than patients with similar cardiovascular risk factors but without the diagnosis of HFpEF. We herein review the diagnostic approach to HFpEF and present a differential diagnosis of HFpEF in a primary and secondary form.

2.1 Making the HFpEF diagnosis: Challenges

Diagnosing HF in older adults poses specific challenges; false‐positive clinical diagnoses are not uncommon. 6 The most common symptoms of HFpEF are exertional dyspnea. However, symptoms of reduced exercise tolerance are common in the older adults and have been shown to reflect normal physiological changes related to aging or could be related to non‐cardiac etiologies. Furthermore, the diagnosis of HF in the older patients may be difficult due to the presence of co‐morbidities, some of which can mimic HF signs and further confound the diagnosis of HF. 8 In addition, older patients with HFpEF may not present with "classic" HF symptoms and may instead have very subtle clinical presentations. Up to one‐third of HFpEF outpatients may have a B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level that is below the typical diagnostic thresholds. 8 This can challenge the common practice of using BNP to make HF diagnosis. In addition, limited predictive capabilities of the echocardiographic variables for diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction further puzzle the clinical picture. There is also no universally agreed upon definition to define HFpEF. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) consensus states that the diagnosis of HFpEF is based on typical symptoms and signs of HF in a patient with a normal range LVEF, and no significant valvular abnormalities by echocardiography and no other obvious precipitating factors for HF. 9 By contrast, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) requires diastolic dysfunction for the diagnosis of HFpEF, along with symptoms and signs of HF and normal or mildly abnormal LV function. 10

### HFNEF, HFpEF, HF-PEF, or DHF: what is in an acronym? [^1176Jm6K]. JACC: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that many patients presenting with heart failure have a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. There has been debate about the correct name for this condition including originally Diastolic Heart Failure (DHF), Heart Failure with a Normal Ejection Fraction (HFNEF), and more recently Heart Failure with a Preserved Ejection Fraction, usually abbreviated to HFpEF. In this viewpoint is it argued that 'Preserved' is the least appropriate word to use, as ejection fraction declines over time and furthermore it is never explained why the 'p' is small. The most honest acronym is HFNEF.
