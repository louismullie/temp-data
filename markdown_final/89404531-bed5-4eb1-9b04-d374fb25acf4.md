## Question

Nose bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of epistaxis (nosebleed), including initial assessment and triage, first-line hemostatic measures and their evidence base, escalation to packing, cautery, and topical agents such as tranexamic acid, considerations for special populations like anticoagulated patients and those with HHT, advanced interventions for refractory bleeding, and ensuring documentation, follow-up, and patient education, concluding with a concise algorithmic summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment and triage to determine who needs prompt management. Then, I should verify first-line hemostatic measures and their evidence base. Next, I will examine escalation to packing, cautery, and topical agents, including tranexamic acid. After that, I need to consider special populations such as anticoagulated patients and HHT. Then, I should review advanced interventions for refractory bleeding. Finally, I will ensure documentation, follow-up, and patient education are addressed, and close with a concise algorithmic summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by a rapid determination of whether the patient needs prompt management based on severity, duration, hemodynamic impact, and risk factors such as anticoagulation or bleeding disorders, because this frames everything downstream and prevents delays in life-threatening cases [^114vn9eq] [^117RtExB].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line maneuver for active anterior bleeding: firm sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for at least 5 minutes, ideally 10–15 minutes, with the head slightly forward to reduce aspiration risk. I initially thought 5 minutes might suffice, but the AHA/ARC first aid guidance supports 10–15 minutes and advises seeking care if bleeding persists beyond that window, so I should correct toward the longer, evidence-aligned duration [^114J6uta] [^115qD1dq] [^1124ppVR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vasoconstrictors; I should confirm their role as adjuncts to compression. Oxymetazoline or phenylephrine can be applied topically to improve hemostasis, with randomized data suggesting higher control rates when vasoconstrictors precede cautery, but I need to ensure caution in patients with cardiovascular disease and to avoid indiscriminate use in young children, favoring clinician-guided dosing in pediatrics [^116LHEUr] [^112Smkjh].

> I will now examine when to escalate to packing: if bleeding precludes visualization of the site or if compression fails, nasal packing is indicated. I should double-check that resorbable packing is preferred in patients with suspected bleeding disorders or on anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy to reduce mucosal trauma and facilitate safer removal, and I must document the type of packing and provide clear removal and warning instructions to the patient [^111bgntH] [^114MrX2x] [^1127WPDc].

> Next, I should review targeted therapy once a bleeding site is identified: silver nitrate cautery remains a mainstay, and I need to ensure the site is anesthetized and that cautery is limited to the active or suspected vessel to avoid excessive mucosal injury. Let me verify that evidence supports pretreatment with vasoconstrictors to improve success and that lubricating agents afterward aid healing and comfort [^111dQFTx] [^116LHEUr].

> But wait, what about tranexamic acid? I should confirm its role and reconcile mixed data. High-quality network meta-analyses and meta-analyses suggest topical TXA reduces 2–7 day rebleeding compared with conservative care or traditional packing, yet some RCTs show no difference versus placebo in packing avoidance; given favorable safety and potential benefit, TXA is a reasonable adjunct when available, especially in patients on antiplatelet therapy where it may outperform standard packing in early hemostasis, but I should counsel that evidence is evolving and technique matters [^112TQfSa] [^114V68Lv] [^114U6g8E] [^114U16oT].

> I need to ensure I address anticoagulated patients thoughtfully: in the absence of life-threatening bleeding, I should initiate first-line local measures before reversing anticoagulation or transfusing, because reversal carries thrombotic risk. For severe bleeding, I should follow a severity-based pathway that may include holding further anticoagulant doses, selective reversal, and coordination with the prescribing team for resumption planning, especially in VKA patients with high INR or DOAC users where routine clotting assays are unreliable [^113MyRv7] [^116vKXNV] [^114V68Lv].

> Let me consider HHT specifically: recurrent bilateral epistaxis with or without oral mucosal telangiectasias should prompt evaluation for HHT, and I should prefer resorbable packing and consider disease-specific therapies. If refractory despite moisturizers, ablative therapies, and TXA, nasal closure can be considered in selected patients, ideally in coordination with HHT specialists [^111LjzbZ] [^111ypByA].

> I should confirm the approach to refractory or posterior bleeding: persistent or recurrent bleeding despite packing or cautery warrants evaluation for endoscopic arterial ligation, typically sphenopalatine artery ligation, or endovascular embolization. TESPAL has high success rates and favorable safety compared with prolonged packing, and embolization is effective but should be individualized based on anatomy, comorbidities, and local expertise [^113Z9G2i] [^112S85kN] [^1176bGfN].

> Next, I should review pediatric nuances: most pediatric epistaxis is anterior and mild, so conservative measures and absorbable packing are preferred. I need to check for red flags such as very young infants with epistaxis, recurrent severe episodes, or signs suggesting bleeding disorder or nonaccidental trauma, where a lower threshold for hematologic evaluation and safeguarding is warranted [^1128Rk4r] [^112QJMz8] [^112TwHHe].

> I will now examine documentation and follow-up: I should record bleeding history, medication use including anticoagulants and intranasal agents, family history of bleeding, and procedural details. After invasive treatments, I need to ensure 30-day outcome tracking or care transition documentation, and I should educate patients on warning signs, packing care, and when to return, given high variability in follow-up and recurrence rates after packing [^111s4Kyi] [^117SJKCb] [^111z9g6w].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure alignment: triage severity and hemodynamic stability. Apply 10–15 minutes of firm compression with head forward. Add topical vasoconstrictor if needed. Escalate to packing if bleeding persists or visualization is not possible, favoring resorbable materials in anticoagulated patients. Identify and cauterize the bleeding site when feasible. Consider topical TXA as an adjunct. For refractory or posterior bleeds, pursue endoscopic ligation or embolization. Tailor anticoagulation decisions to severity and coordinate follow-up and education to reduce recurrence and complications [^112xmPUC] [^115qD1dq] [^114J6uta] [^112TQfSa] [^113Z9G2i].

---

Nosebleeds (epistaxis) are common and usually self-limited [^111t9GNZ], but **firm, sustained compression** [^1146Hjuq] of the lower third of the nose for at least 5–10 minutes [^114J6uta] is the essential first step [^115qD1dq]. If bleeding persists, **add topical vasoconstrictors** (oxymetazoline or phenylephrine) [^112Smkjh] and consider topical tranexamic acid [^112TQfSa], which reduces rebleeding [^114U6g8E]. Use **anterior nasal packing** [^111bgntH] for refractory cases, reserving posterior packing or balloon devices for severe posterior bleeds [^111WAqNw]. Identify and treat underlying causes (hypertension, anticoagulation, bleeding disorders) [^111WAqNw] and educate on prevention (humidification, nasal lubricants, avoiding trauma) [^1143JKsy]. Escalate to cautery, endoscopic ligation, or embolization [^112xmPUC] for persistent or recurrent bleeding [^1176bGfN].

---

## Initial assessment and triage

- **Airway and hemodynamic stability**: Assess airway, breathing, and circulation first [^114zpvtu]; posterior bleeds or large-volume loss may compromise airway or cause hemodynamic instability [^113mwuv1] [^116vKXNV].

- **Severity assessment**: Duration > 30 minutes, recurrent episodes, or bleeding from both nares/mouth suggests severe epistaxis [^117RtExB].

- **Risk factors**: Document anticoagulant/antiplatelet use, bleeding disorders, intranasal drug use, and comorbidities (hypertension, liver/renal disease) [^111s4Kyi] [^1148sTYH].

---

## First-line management

- **Nasal compression**: Firm, sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for ≥ 5–10 minutes [^114J6uta] is first-line [^111t9GNZ]; head slightly forward, breathe through the mouth [^115qD1dq].

- **Topical vasoconstrictors**: Oxymetazoline or phenylephrine spray/pledgets can be applied with compression to improve control [^112Smkjh] [^116LHEUr].

- **Tranexamic acid**: Topical TXA reduces rebleeding [^112TQfSa] and is a useful adjunct [^114U6g8E].

---

## Indications for medical intervention

Medical intervention is indicated when **compression fails after 10–15 minutes** [^1124ppVR], for **severe or posterior bleeding**, or when the patient is on anticoagulants or has a bleeding disorder [^113MyRv7].

---

## Medical interventions

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Technique** | **Complications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Anterior nasal packing | Refractory anterior bleeding | - Rapid Rhino <br/> - Merocel <br/> - Gauze | - Discomfort <br/> - Infection <br/> - Mucosal trauma [^1155C1nG] |
| Posterior nasal packing | Posterior bleeding | - Balloon (Foley, Epistat) <br/> - Traditional gauze | - Discomfort <br/> - Infection <br/> - Aspiration risk [^114zpvtu] |
| Cauterization | Identified bleeding site | - Silver nitrate <br/> - Electrocautery | - Mucosal injury <br/> - Septal perforation [^116Ure5b] |
| Tranexamic acid | Adjunct to reduce rebleeding | Topical application | Minimal [^114U6g8E] |
| Antibiotics | Packing > 24–48 hours | Amoxicillin-clavulanate | Allergic reactions, resistance [^notfound] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Anticoagulated patients**: Use resorbable packing [^114MrX2x]; avoid routine reversal unless life-threatening [^113MyRv7] [^116vKXNV].

- **Pediatric patients**: Most are anterior; use absorbable packing, avoid routine labs unless recurrent or severe [^1128Rk4r] [^114zQpov].

- **Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)**: Prefer resorbable packing; consider systemic therapy or nasal closure if refractory [^111LjzbZ] [^111ypByA].

---

## Prevention and patient education

Prevention focuses on **humidification** (humidifiers, saline sprays, nasal lubricants) [^116pN4VM] and avoiding trauma (nose picking, forceful blowing, irritants) [^114zQpov]. Patient education should cover home management (compression, head position) [^115qD1dq] and red flags that warrant urgent care (persistent bleeding, lightheadedness, hematemesis) [^115qD1dq].

---

## Follow-up and referral

Follow-up should occur within 7–14 days after packing or cautery to assess healing and recurrence [^notfound]. Referral to ENT is indicated for **persistent or recurrent bleeding** despite initial management, for **suspected posterior bleeding**, or for **underlying pathology** (tumor, vascular malformation) [^114z7xX1].

---

## Complications of untreated or poorly managed epistaxis

- **Persistent bleeding**: Anemia, hemodynamic instability [^116vKXNV].

- **Aspiration**: Blood in airway, respiratory compromise [^113mwuv1].

- **Infection**: Sinusitis, sepsis, toxic shock syndrome [^notfound].

- **Mucosal injury**: Septal perforation, adhesions [^116Ure5b].

---

## Summary of management algorithm

Initial assessment → compression → vasoconstrictor ± TXA → anterior packing → posterior packing → cautery → surgical ligation/embolization [^112xmPUC]. Most nosebleeds are **anterior and self-limited** [^1177ydtC]; **firm compression** is the cornerstone, with escalation based on severity and persistence [^114zpvtu].

Introduction

Haemorrhage from the nose is formally referred to as "epistaxis". Haemostasis within the nose can be compromised by mucosal abnormalities, vessel pathology, or coagulation disorders. The aetiology of epistaxis is divided into groups: local and systemic factors. Local factors include the following: trauma, local inflammatory reactions, foreign bodies, postsurgical anatomical deformities, intranasal tumours, chemical inhalants, nasal-prong oxygen administration, and continuous positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea. Systemic causes of epistaxis include the following: vascular disorders, especially hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT); blood dyscrasias; hematologic malignancies; and drugs affecting the normal clotting mechanism. Epistaxis arising from the anterior septal area (anterior epistaxis) is more common in children and young adults; it is the most common type of epistaxis and is more often venous in origin. This condition is usually responsive to treatment because it is readily accessible for nasal packing if bleeding does not resolve spontaneously. Therefore, endovascular therapy is usually not indicated for anterior epistaxis.

Approximately 5% of epistaxis episodes arise from the posterior and superior portions of the nasal cavity, and the majority of posterior epistaxis episodes arise from the arteries of the septum. Posterior epistaxis is more common in older patients than in children The most common factors associated with posterior epistaxis are hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, previous episodes of epistaxis, alcohol use, and anticoagulant use. However, the majority of these cases are idiopathic. Refractory epistaxis is defined as recurrent or persistent bleeding after appropriate packing or multiple episodes of epistaxis during a short period of time, each requiring medical attention. Embolisation for intractable epistaxis was first reported as an alternative to surgery and other methods by Sokoloff.

### Our approach to adult patients with epistaxis [^113cHeZf]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is one of the most frequently encountered emergency problems in our country, as it is throughout the world. In epistaxis, the benefits of implementing clinical guidelines are evident in both daily practice and medical education. In this article, the authors aimed to present their approach to adult patients with epistaxis and to share their experience, which considered the life quality of the patients to be at the forefront, based on some of their patients. In management of epistaxis, the implementation of the simplest method, minimally affecting the life quality of the patient, may be easier with a stepped approach. The authors consider that the stepped approach that they have implemented and presented in their study may lead to using less invasive methods and may accordingly improve the life quality of the patient.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^115XCtZW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis guideline — initial assessment and first-line measures: At initial contact, clinicians should distinguish patients needing urgent care, and for those with active bleeding requiring prompt management they should use firm sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for 5 minutes or longer. If bleeding obscures site identification despite compression, clinicians should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing and should use resorbable packing for suspected bleeding disorders or anticoagulation/antiplatelet use. Clinicians should educate packed patients about the type of packing, timing and plan for removal if not resorbable, postprocedure care, and symptoms warranting prompt reassessment; should document factors that increase frequency or severity of bleeding, including bleeding history, anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, or intranasal drug use; and should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present).

Epistaxis — variation in treatment and predictors for nasal packing and early intervention are reported, with male sex (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10–1.17) and long-term anticoagulation (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10–1.33) independently increasing the likelihood of treatment with nasal packing. Packing occurred more often in the Midwest (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.24–2.30) and South (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.12–1.34) compared with the West and more frequently in nontrauma hospitals (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19–2.05). Patients admitted on a weekday were more likely to receive early intervention than those admitted on a weekend (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.34–2.58).

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^114vn9eq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis — prompt management (Statement 1) directs that at the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not, and this is a Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The quality improvement opportunity is to identify those patients who need immediate diagnosis and treatment, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, a Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, and policy level Recommendation. Benefits include prevention of morbidity and in rare cases mortality, increased likelihood of timely treatment, more efficient allocation of resources to patients in greatest need of treatment, reduction of patient and family stress, and avoidance of unnecessary interventions in patients who are not actively bleeding, while risks and harms include delayed treatment of patients who may actually need intervention, overtreatment of patients who are not actively bleeding, and increased patient anxiety; no costs are associated with this recommendation, and the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness is noted in that the actual appropriate timing for "prompt" management is not specified and assessment of bleeding severity may occur during telephone/electronic communications or during face-to-face patient encounter, and the purpose is to assist clinicians in determining the severity of a nosebleed as well as the appropriate clinical setting where the patient should be seen for management.

### A rare but important entity: epistaxis in infants [^112QJMz8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Epistaxis is a common emergency department (ED) complaint; however, this entity is rare among children younger than 2 years of age. In this age group, epistaxis may be a presenting sign of a bleeding disorder or nonaccidental trauma.

Case Report

We present a case of a 2-month-old infant who was evaluated in the pediatric ED for epistaxis and discharged home. The infant returned 2 days later with facial swelling and irritability, and was found to have significant head trauma. In this article we review the epidemiology and differential diagnoses for epistaxis among infants, as well as the initial approach to the evaluation of this uncommon clinical entity in this age group. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Potential etiologies for epistaxis among infants and young children include severe systemic disease and nonaccidental trauma. Given its rarity and possible clinical significance, the approach to epistaxis differs in this age group. Emergency physicians should screen for and exclude a bleeding disorder while also having a very low threshold for a nonaccidental trauma evaluation.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management from the hematologist's perspective [^116pN4VM]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Management of epistaxis

The first step in epistaxis management should always be appropriate patient counseling and use of preventive measures within the home to prevent the nasal mucosa from becoming dry. These may include nasal humidification, use of over-the-counter saline sprays or ointments to keep the nasal mucosa moist, and avoidance of nasal trauma (i.e. from nose blowing and/or nose picking).

When epistaxis occurs that does not cease within a short period of time at home, nasal packing and direct use of topical agents such as tranexamic acid-soaked gauze in an outpatient clinic or emergency room setting may help curtail bleeding but may also increase trauma to the nasal mucosa. Additional local measures that are commonly employed to control bleeding include laser treatments to the nasal mucosa and septodermoplasty. Historically, laser photocoagulation and other interventional procedures have been the cornerstone of therapy, although this may begin to shift with effective disease-modifying systemic therapeutics on the horizon, detailed later in this review. Nasal closureis an effective but extreme form of therapy that is rarely used.

### Management of epistaxis [^1177ydtC]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently encounter patients with epistaxis (nasal bleeding). In rare cases, this condition may lead to massive bleeding and even death. Although epistaxis can have an anterior or posterior source, it most often originates in the anterior nasal cavity. A directed history and physical examination generally determine the cause of the bleeding. Both local and systemic processes can play a role in epistaxis. Nasal bleeding usually responds to first-aid measures such as compression. When epistaxis does not respond to simple measures, the source of the bleeding should be located and treated appropriately. Treatments to be considered include topical vasoconstriction, chemical cautery, electrocautery, nasal packing (nasal tampon or gauze impregnated with petroleum jelly), posterior gauze packing, use of a balloon system (including a modified Foley catheter), and arterial ligation or embolization. Topical or systemic antibiotics should be used in selected patients. Hospital admission should be considered for patients with significant comorbid conditions or complications of blood loss. Referral to an otolaryngologist is appropriate when bleeding is refractory, complications are present, or specialized treatment (balloon placement, arterial ligation, angiographic arterial embolization) is required.

### Epistaxis: outpatient management | AAFP… [^116Ure5b]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Anatomy Approximately 90% of epistaxis cases arise from the anterior part of the nasal septum; this is known as anterior epistaxis. 5–7 Anterior bleeding most commonly occurs from the rich vascular supply at the Kiesselbach plexus. 8 This plexus is formed by terminal branches of the internal carotid artery and external carotid artery. 3, 6, 9. Physical Examination The physical examination should begin with assessment of vital signs, mental status, and airway patency. When examining the nose, a nasal speculum and good light source, such as a head-lamp, are useful. The Kiesselbach plexus should be examined first for bleeding, followed by the vestibule, septum, and turbinates. If a bleeding source cannot be identified in these areas, there is concern for posterior bleeding.

If bleeding persists after attempts to control anterior bleeding with compression and packing, management of a possible posterior source should be initiated. Once airway patency has been determined, compressive therapy should be applied to stop bleeding in the anterior nasal plexus. Firm pressure is placed on the bilateral nostrils, below the nasal bones, for 10 to 15 minutes without interruption. Simple manual pinching may be used, or a nasal clip can be fashioned using tongue depressors taped together. After compressive therapy, the nares should be inspected for any sign of continued bleeding. Any hematoma must be evacuated for proper inspection. This can be accomplished through the patient blowing the nose, suction, irrigation, or direct forceps evacuation. Proper lighting is crucial; a headlamp provides adequate lighting and leaves the hands free to maneuver. A nasal speculum is useful to increase the field of vision during inspection.

14 Electrical desiccation in the same pattern is also an effective way to control bleeding in the nares. 10 Blind cauterization is not recommended, because excessive destruction of the nasal mucosa with silver nitrate or electrical desiccation can lead to ulceration and septal perforation. If compressive therapy is inadequate and directive therapy is ineffective or impossible because of continued brisk bleeding, topical therapy and nasal packing are the next options. Traditional nasal packing involves placing cotton stripping impregnated with petroleum jelly into the base of the nasal cavity, and layering until the nares are completely compressed.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^1176bGfN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis — ligation and/or embolization for persistent nosebleeds: The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. Recommendation based on observational and case-control studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C based on observational studies and case-control studies, level of confidence in evidence is High, benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit over harm, policy level is Recommendation, role of patient preferences is Large, and intentional vagueness states the GDG did not specify a preferred surgical procedure or preference for surgery versus endovascular embolization as selection would depend on clinical factors and expertise available.

### Is topical tranexamic acid effective in treating epistaxis? [^114tLqKV]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Epistaxis is a common emergency department (ED) presentation. Many cases are self‐limited, but other cases may require an intervention to stop bleeding. Methods to manage epistaxis include nasal compression, topical vasoconstrictors, cautery, nasal packing, and even surgical ligation in severe cases.

Though generally effective, nasal packing is associated with complications such as pain, mucosal irritation, rebleeding with pack removal, infection, and tissue necrosis. As a result, the search for alternative methods to treat epistaxis continues. Tranexamic acid (TXA), a well‐known antifibrinolytic agent, is used commonly in the emergency room in the setting of trauma and has been used in the operating room to reduce bleeding. It has recently gained popularity as a treatment modality for epistaxis. The goal of this review is to determine whether topical TXA is an effective treatment modality for epistaxis.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^114hAJ5J]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nosebleed (epistaxis) guideline — classification and use of evidence-based statements: Guidelines are intended to produce optimal health outcomes for patients, to minimize harm, and to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, and the evidence-based approach requires that the evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements. Evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the statement is followed; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a "strong recommendation" than with a "recommendation", while "Options" offer the most opportunity for practice variability. The document notes that guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment and may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinical discretion in a particular clinical circumstance, and that clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs and must also operate within their scope of practice and according to their training; a major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process.

The management of epistaxis should begin with general measures, including calming the patient (with sedatives if necessary), application of a cold compress to the nape of the neck, decreasing the blood pressure if the patient is hypertensive, fluid resuscitation, and correction of any underlying coagulopathy. Local measures include the following: various methods of bleeding control, such as local application of haemostatic agents, infiltration of the bleeding area with vasoconstrictive agents, and cautery. Anterior nasal packing is performed by positioning strips of ointment-saturated gauze so as to produce satisfactory pressure on the bleeding mucosa. Posterior nasal packing is an option if anterior packing is insufficient to stop the haemorrhage or if the bleeding originates posteriorly. Posterior nasal packing requires general anaesthesia. A balloon catheter is inflated in the nasopharynx to stop the flow of blood posteriorly, and the anterior part of the nasal cavity is packed. The catheter coming out of the nose is fixed in place. The patient should be monitored because posterior nasal packing can lead to nasal trauma, vasovagal reaction, and infection. Traditional gauze packing or balloon devices may be left in the nasal cavity for ≤ 48 h to prevent such complications. The success rate of posterior packing is reported to be between 48 and 83%. Subsequent therapy can include either surgical endonasal coagulation or ligation. An endoscopic approach has been used for direct electrocauterisation of the active bleeding site and endoscopic ligation of the sphenopalatine and ethmoidal arteries. Surgical intervention is clearly indicated in anterior ethmoid bleeding because the ethmoidal arteries arise from the ophthalmic artery, the embolisation of which is generally considered to be dangerous.

### Risk factors and management outcomes in pediatric epistaxis at an emergency department [^1125Rd6f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Most cases of pediatric epistaxis are spontaneous and self-resolve. However, a subset of children may experience significant bleeding and require procedural or medical intervention.

Objective

We aim to identify risk factors associated with moderate and severe epistaxis in the emergency department (ED) and explore management outcomes.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all patients under 22 years old with epistaxis who presented to our ED between 2013 and 2022. Epistaxis severity was defined as mild (required nasal compression or intranasal medications), moderate (required cautery or packing), or severe (required factor replacement, transfusion, hospital admission, or surgery). We performed univariable and multinomial regression analyses, with risk factors and outcomes analyzed according to severity.

Results

Of 858 visits, 41 (5%) patients had moderate and 67 (8%) had severe epistaxis. Patients with moderate epistaxis were older than those with mild and severe epistaxis (median 15.6 vs. 8.3 vs. 10.7 years, p < 0.001). In regression analysis, moderate epistaxis was associated with older age, prior ED visit within 72 h, and antiplatelet medication use (p < 0.01). Severe epistaxis was associated with bleeding disorders, nasal procedures within 30 days, and anticoagulation medication use (p ≤ 0.001). Bleeding over 30 min prior to arrival was associated with both moderate and severe epistaxis (p < 0.05). Of the 67 patients with severe epistaxis, 10 (15%) required factor replacement, 28 (42%) required transfusion, 52 (77%) required hospital admission, and 5 (7%) underwent surgery.

Conclusion

Epistaxis severity is associated with certain risk factors. However, most cases of pediatric epistaxis are mild and do not require intervention or ED evaluation.

### Epistaxis: outpatient management [^114zpvtu]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is a common emergency encountered by primary care physicians. Up to 60% of the general population experience epistaxis, and 6% seek medical attention for it. More than 90% of cases arise from the anterior nasal circulation, and most treatments can be easily performed in the outpatient setting. Evaluation of a patient presenting with epistaxis should begin with assessment of vital signs, mental status, and airway patency. When examining the nose, a nasal speculum and a good light source, such as a headlamp, can be useful. Compressive therapy is the first step to controlling anterior epistaxis. Oxymetazoline nasal spray or application of cotton soaked in oxymetazoline or epinephrine 1: 1,000 may be useful adjuncts to compressive therapy. Directive nasal cautery, most commonly using silver nitrate, can be used to control localized continued bleeding or prominent vessels that are the suspected bleeding source. Finally, topical therapy and nasal packing can be used if other methods are unsuccessful. Compared with anterior epistaxis, posterior epistaxis is more likely to require hospitalization and twice as likely to need nasal packing. Posterior nasal packing is often associated with pain and a risk of aspiration if it is dislodged. After stabilization, patients with posterior packing often require referral to otolaryngology or the emergency department for definitive treatments.

### Clinical recommendations for epistaxis management during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1128MHe4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Epistaxis is a common complaint in the general population, and its treatment is a common procedure in emergency departments. In the COVID-19 era, procedures involving airway management are a particular risk for health care workers due to the high virulence of the virus, the transmission through aerosol, and the risk of contagion from asymptomatic patients. In this article, we propose a simple memorandum of clinical recommendations to minimize the risk of operator infection deriving from epistaxis management. The correct use of personal protective equipment and strict compliance with the behavioral guidelines are essential to reduce the potential risk of infection. In particular, the use of filtering masks is strongly recommended since all patients, including those referring for epistaxis, should be treated as being COVID-19 positive in the emergency department. The safety of health care workers is essential not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to limit virus transmission.

### Comparative effectiveness of various noninvasive local treatments in patients with epistaxis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112TQfSa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The best initial strategy for managing epistaxis is unclear. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the effectiveness of various noninvasive treatments for patients with epistaxis.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2022 without language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing immediate hemostasis, 2-day and 7-day rebleeding outcomes, as well as the use of noninvasive interventions for the treatment of epistaxis were selected. Frequentist NMA was performed.

Results

The systematic review included 20 RCTs (2994 participants) involving 12 different interventions. The NMA demonstrated that topical treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA) significantly reduced the odds of 2-day rebleeding compared with the control conservative treatment (odds ratio [OR] 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21–0.61) and traditional anterior nasal packing (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76). The sensitivity analysis yielded robust results, and the overall evidence was high. Topical TXA significantly reduced the odds of 7-day rebleeding compared with traditional nasal packing (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.70), with moderate evidence owing to the heterogeneous results. Despite the significant effects of topical TXA on achieving immediate hemostasis and Rapid Rhino nasal packing on preventing 2-day rebleeding compared to the control and traditional nasal packing, the evidence is low to very low due to heterogeneity, inconsistency, and within-study bias.

Conclusions

In the treatment of epistaxis, topical TXA may be superior to conservative treatment or traditional nasal packing, particularly in preventing 2-day rebleeding.

### Epistaxis [^115fCA3f]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is a common occurrence. The estimated lifetime incidence of epistaxis is approximately 60% and it ranges in severity from a minor nuisance to a life-threatening hemorrhage. Evaluation of recurrent or severe cases includes a search for underlying causes, such as bleeding disorders and neoplasia. Many techniques, materials, and procedures treat nasal bleeding effectively and sometimes more than one treatment must be used. Otolaryngologists must be prepared to deal with severe or refractory bleeding through the use of medications, packing materials, and radiologic or surgical interventions. This article reviews nasal vascular anatomy, common causes of epistaxis, and treatments, including biomaterials and minimally invasive surgical techniques.

Epistaxis guideline — endoscopic evaluation, targeted therapy, escalation, and follow-up: For recurrent nasal bleeding despite prior packing or cautery, or recurrent unilateral bleeding, clinicians should perform or refer for nasal endoscopy to identify the site and guide management. When a site is identified, clinicians should treat with appropriate interventions, which may include topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents, and if cautery is chosen they should anesthetize the site and restrict application only to the active or suspected site(s). For persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or cauterization, clinicians should evaluate or refer for candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization. In the absence of life-threatening bleeding in patients using anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications, clinicians should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of these medications. Clinicians should assess or refer for assessment of nasal and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients with recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a relevant family history to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome, should educate patients and caregivers on prevention, home treatment, and indications to seek care, and should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care after treatments such as nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization.

### Pediatric epistaxis-effectiveness of conservative management [^1128Rk4r]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Epistaxis is an emergency medical condition that sometimes requires admission to the emergency department. Pediatric epistaxis differs from epistaxis in the older population in terms of etiology, severity, and management. Our objective was to identify the distinctive features of pediatric epistaxis and determine the appropriate management.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of 231 medical records of children (< 18 years old) with epistaxis of a total of 1171 cases in the general population who presented to our medical center's emergency department between 2013 and 2018.

Results

Among 231 admissions, 10 children (4.3%) presented more than once. Male patients accounted for the majority of cases (64.5%), and the average age was 9.4 years. Two children were treated with aspirin because of cardiac valve disease. Anterior bleeding was detected in 101 cases (43.7%), whereas posterior origin was observed in 8 cases (3.5%). In 122 cases (52.8%), there was no active bleeding observed. Nose injury was the cause of epistaxis in 24 cases (10.4%), and 16 admissions (6.9%) followed nasal surgical interventions. Nineteen children (8%) had abnormal coagulation tests, and 7 patients (3%) received blood transfusions. Chemical cauterization was performed in 89 cases (39.3%), and anterior packing was needed in only 9 cases (3.9%). Nine children required hospitalization (3.9%), and 2 needed surgical intervention to control bleeding. Compared with the adult population, there were significantly fewer cases of active bleeding, recurrent epistaxis, anterior packing, or need for hospitalization in the pediatric population.

Conclusions

Epistaxis is significantly less severe in the pediatric population, with only a few cases requiring major intervention. Endoscopic examination of the entire nasal cavity and routine coagulation tests are not mandatory unless there is a history of recurrent epistaxis, known coagulopathy, antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy, or a suspicion of juvenile idiopathic angiofibroma. We suggest using absorbable packs, which offer advantages over cauterization or nonabsorbable packs.

### Demographic differences in emergency room epistaxis treatment patterns and outcomes [^111xWyfU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

While demographic trends in ED management for epistaxis are nuanced, our data suggests a general trend that minority patients are less likely to receive epistaxis control procedures. Our results showed that certain minority patients were more likely to receive conservative treatment but less likely to receive more invasive interventions. Additional research is needed to determine the etiology of the variations identified.

Abstract

Objective

Investigate the association between demographic characteristics and emergency department (ED) epistaxis management and outcomes.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

TriNetX US collaborative database.

Methods

Adults presenting to the ED for epistaxis were retrospectively followed for 7 days. Spanish‐speaking patients were propensity score matched to English‐speaking patients by demographics and medical history. Outcomes included use of nasal decongestant, nasal packing or cautery, diagnostic nasal endoscopy, endoscopic control of hemorrhage, hospital admission, and mortality. The analysis was also performed with stratification by race and ethnicity.

Results

Spanish‐speaking patients were less likely to receive nasal packing or cautery [odds ratio, OR: 0.78; 95% confidence interval, CI: (0.68; 0.90)] or diagnostic nasal endoscopy [OR: 0.72; 95% CI: (0.52; 0.98)] compared to English‐speaking patients. Black patients were more likely to receive treatment with a nasal decongestant spray [OR: 1.31; 95% CI: (1.27, 1.36)], but less likely to receive any other treatment compared to White patients. Asian patients were less likely to undergo nasal packing or cautery [OR: 0.90; 95% CI: (0.82; 0.99)], but had more ED visits [(1.37; 1.32) P < .01] compared to White patients. Hispanic patients were less likely to be admitted [OR: 0.93; 95% CI: (0.87; 0.98)], and averaged fewer ED visits [(1.27; 1.30) P = < .0001] compared to non‐Hispanic patients.

Conclusion

While demographic trends in ED epistaxis management are nuanced, our results suggest that Spanish‐speaking, Black, Asian, and Hispanic patients are less likely to receive diagnostic and epistaxis control procedures. Additional research is needed to determine the etiology of these differences.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^111t9GNZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥ 3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It focuses on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians via phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients-patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function-are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the guideline development group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based on their experience and assessment of individual patients.

Action Statements

The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include one or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation, about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy, was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

Epistaxis is a common medical problem that rarely requires surgical intervention. However, when medical or surgical intervention is required, epistaxis can sometimes be difficult to control. Knowledge of nasopharyngeal anatomy is absolutely essential to the proper management of epistaxis. This article begins with a discussion of the essential anatomy of the region and the basic epidemiology of epistaxis, followed by a review of initial treatment as well as devices and procedures specifically designed for the control of epistaxis.

Statement 2 — nasal compression for active epistaxis specifies that the clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness notes that a nose clip is an alternative to digital compression if available and tolerated, the GDG felt that a minimum of 5 minutes was necessary to control bleeding and that longer or repeated compression may be helpful, and vasoconstrictors can be applied in conjunction with compression. Although there are no studies defining duration, 15 minutes of sustained compression was used in a single identified clinical trial; despite 1 randomized controlled trial (n = 61) suggesting a possible advantage for a nose clip, the panel judged evidence insufficient to recommend a clip over simple digital compression. Evidence grading indicates Grade C with medium confidence.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for epistaxis, more specifically with respect to first aid, AHA/ARC 2024 guidelines recommend to instruct a person experiencing epistaxis to seek medical attention if:

- bleeding does not stop after 15 minutes of continuous manual pressure or lightheadedness occur from epistaxis

- bleeding is due to trauma and patients have signs of brain injury, obvious nasal deformity, or signs of facial fracture

- they are taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication or have a blood-clotting disorder, unless bleeding has stopped.

Posterior nosebleed; Hemodynamic instability due to blood loss; A decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL, or required ≥ 2 units of RBCs (or ≥ 15 mL/kg in pediatric patients)". If yes, label "Bleeding is Severe" and: do not give additional anticoagulant/antiplatelet doses while bleeding is active, initiate appropriate local measures to control epistaxis, administer appropriate reversal agent to control bleeding and stabilize the patient, and assess for and treat contributory comorbidities. If no, label "Bleeding is Non-Severe" and: do not give additional anticoagulant/antiplatelet doses while bleeding is active, initiate appropriate local measures, if hospitalization or transfusion is required and on a VKA consider oral or IV Vitamin K, and do not reverse anticoagulation or transfuse platelets if bleeding can be otherwise controlled. At discharge, discuss with the patient's primary team regarding continuing or discontinuing anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.

### Tranexamic acid for patients with nasal haemorrhage (epistaxis) [^114U6g8E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epistaxis (nosebleed) most commonly affects children and the elderly. The majority of episodes are managed at home with simple measures. In more severe cases medical intervention is required to either cauterise the bleeding vessel, or to pack the nose with various materials. Tranexamic acid is used in a number of clinical settings to stop bleeding by preventing clot breakdown (fibrinolysis). It may have a role in the management of epistaxis as an adjunct to standard treatments, reducing the need for further intervention.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tranexamic acid (oral, intravenous or topical) compared with placebo, no additional intervention or any other haemostatic agent in the management of patients with epistaxis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register (via CRS Web); Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via CRS Web); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 October 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tranexamic acid (in addition to usual care) compared with usual care plus placebo, usual care alone or usual care plus any other haemostatic agent, to control epistaxis in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (as measured by the proportion of patients re-bleeding within a period of up to 10 days) and significant adverse effects (seizures, thromboembolic events). Secondary outcomes were control of epistaxis as measured by the time to stop initial bleeding (the proportion of patients whose bleeding is controlled within a period of up to 30 minutes); severity of re-bleeding (as measured by (a) the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention and (b) the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion); length of hospital stay and other adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included six RCTs (692 participants). The overall risk of bias in the studies was low. Two studies assessed oral administration of tranexamic acid, given regularly over several days, and compared it to placebo. In the other four studies, a single application of topical tranexamic acid was compared with placebo (one study) and a combination of epinephrine and lidocaine or phenylephrine (three studies). All participants were adults. Tranexamic acid versus placeboFor our primary outcome, control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (proportion re-bleeding within 10 days), we were able to pool data from three studies. The pooled result demonstrated a benefit of tranexamic acid compared to placebo, the risk of re-bleeding reducing from 67% to 47% (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.90; three studies; 225 participants; moderate-quality evidence). When we compared the effects of oral and topical tranexamic acid separately the risk of re-bleeding with oral tranexamic acid reduced from 69% to 49%, RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.96; two studies, 157 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and with topical tranexamic acid it reduced from 66% to 43%, RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.05; single study, 68 participants). We rated the quality of evidence provided by the single study as low, therefore it is uncertain whether topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. No study specifically sought to identify and report our primary outcome: significant adverse effects (i.e. seizures, thromboembolic events). The secondary outcome time to stop initial bleeding (proportion with bleeding controlled within 30 minutes) was measured in one study using topical tranexamic acid and there was no evidence of a difference at 30 minutes (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11; 68 participants; low-quality evidence). No studies reported the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention (e.g. repacking, surgery, embolisation). One study of oral tranexamic acid reported the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion and found no difference between groups: 5/45 (11%) versus 6/44 (14%) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.48; 89 participants; low-quality evidence). Two studies reported hospital length of stay. One study reported a significantly shorter stay in the oral tranexamic acid group (mean difference (MD) -1.60 days, 95% CI -2.49 to -0.71; 68 participants). The other study found no evidence of a difference between the groups. Tranexamic acid versus other haemostatic agentsWhen we pooled the data from three studies the proportion of patients whose bleeding stopped within 10 minutes was significantly higher in the topical tranexamic acid group compared to the group receiving another haemostatic agent (70% versus 30%: RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.92; 460 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Adverse effects across all studiesFive studies recorded 'adverse effects' in a general way. None found any difference between the groups in the occurrence of minor adverse effects (e.g. mild nausea and diarrhoea, 'bad taste' of gel). In one study a patient developed a superficial thrombophlebitis of both legs following discharge, however it is not reported in which group this occurred. No "other serious adverse effect" was reported in any study.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that there is probably a reduction in the risk of re-bleeding with the use of either oral or topical tranexamic acid in addition to usual care in adult patients with epistaxis, compared to placebo with usual care. However, the quality of evidence relating solely to topical tranexamic acid was low (one study only), so we are uncertain whether or not topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. We found moderate-quality evidence that topical tranexamic acid is probably better than other topical agents in stopping bleeding in the first 10 minutes. There have been only three RCTs on this subject since 1995. Since then there have been significant changes in nasal cauterisation and packing techniques (for example, techniques including nasal endoscopy and more invasive approaches such as endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation). New trials would inform us about the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in light of these developments.

### A rare and life-threatening cause of epistaxis [^113Gt6oD]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Epistaxis is a potentially life-threatening condition that can compromise a patient's airway, breathing and circulation. Early recognition of underlying bleeding diatheses that are amenable to medical therapy is imperative in order for timely treatment and to reduce morbidity. We present a case in which acquired haemophilia was diagnosed in an 83-year-old man presenting with seemingly uncomplicated epistaxis. The patient suffered multisite haemorrhages and haemodynamic compromise before definitive management with monoclonal antibody therapy. The case highlights the difficulties in managing this rare condition. It also emphasises the importance of clotting assay analysis in patients who present with epistaxis in the absence of an underlying anticoagulant.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) executive summary [^117Star6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the great majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥ 3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It will focus on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians with phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients, patients with hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT) and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function, are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the working group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based upon their experience and assessment of individual patients.

Action Statements

The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

Supporting text — post-treatment follow-up for epistaxis emphasizes outcome tracking and specific revisit criteria: The purpose of this statement is to assist clinicians in evaluating and documenting 30-day outcomes after treatment for epistaxis, and documenting transition of care to another qualified clinician in the electronic medical record is sufficient to meet this recommendation. Clinicians should evaluate patients following treatment for epistaxis if (1) bleeding has not resolved, (2) invasive treatments were performed, or (3) additional evaluation and testing suggest a potential underlying condition that predisposes to more nosebleeds. Recurrence rates vary by technique and patient factors, ranging from an estimated < 10% after surgical artery ligation or arterial embolization to as much as a 50% recurrence for nasal packing, and many treated patients become lost to follow-up over time, complicating assessment of persistent or recurrent bleeding.

### Efficacy of topical tranexamic acid in epistaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DJcrC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epistaxis is a very common presentation in the emergency department (ED), accounting for approximately 1 in 200 ED visits in the United States. Currently, standard practice includes the initial use of topical anesthetics and vasoconstrictors, followed by more invasive treatments such as nasal packing, cauterization or surgical ligation for refractory cases. Over the years several studies have investigated the potential use of topical Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in the management of epistaxis. We have conducted a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of topical TXA versus other standard practices or placebo in the management of epistaxis.

Methods

PubMed and Scopus databases were searched from inception to April 2021. We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies investigating the efficacy of TXA in bleeding cessation in epistaxis in adults. The primary outcome measured was the prevalence of bleeding cessation after treatment at first assessment. Other outcomes were bleeding reoccurrence between 24 and 72 h and at 7–8 days. A random-effects model was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) for outcomes.

Results

A total of eight studies were included in the analysis, including seven randomized trials and one retrospective study. We included a total of 1299 patients, 596 (46%) received TXA while 703 (54%) received control treatment (placebo, lidocaine plus vasoconstrictors or local anesthetics). Patients who were treated with TXA were 3.5 times (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3–9.7) more likely to achieve bleeding cessation at the first assessment. Patients treated with TXA had 63% (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.20–0.66) less likelihood of returning due to rebleeding at 24–72 h.

Conclusion

Topical TXA is associated with better bleeding cessation rates after treatment compared to the standard practices.

Epistaxis management in patients using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications — The statement addresses "patients using anticoagulation medications… and antiplatelet medications" and notes they may "have a large volume of blood loss (> 250 mL)" and "require blood transfusion for treatment". Even for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or heparin users, "the first step… is the use of 'first-line' treatments, including nasal compression, vasoconstrictors, moisturizing or lubricating agents, nasal cautery, and/or nasal packing". Reversal carries risks: "overcorrection of a patient's INR can increase risk of thromboembolic events" and "4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant activated factor VII… may also induce hypercoagulability". For VKAs, "reversal strategy should be driven by the patient's clinical condition and bleeding severity as well as INR", and "Patients with an INR > 4.5 are more likely to require hospital admission and have prolonged hospital stays". For direct oral anticoagulants, "clotting assays such as prothrombin time/INR and partial thromboplastin time do not reliably reflect the degree of anticoagulation". Regarding antiplatelet therapy, the PATCH trial found transfusion recipients were "more likely to have an in-hospital adverse event and a higher 90-day mortality rate", and "Clinicians should balance the chance for benefit against the risk for harm when considering platelet transfusion". Adjunctive agents "do not specifically reverse… but they do improve hemostasis and are effective in treating mucocutaneous bleeding"; in a small randomized trial of antiplatelet users, topical tranexamic acid (TXA) achieved cessation within "10 minutes" with "73% vs 29%, respectively; P < .001" compared with standard anterior nasal packing.

Epistaxis — severity of bleeding can be gauged by duration and episode frequency, noting that a standard definition of severe epistaxis does not exist. Bleeding duration > 30 minutes over a 24-hour period was considered severe, and a history of hospitalization for nosebleed, prior blood transfusion for nosebleeds, or > 3 recent episodes of nasal bleeding may indicate the need for prompt evaluation. When evaluating, evidence of or suspicion for prolonged or large volume bleeding, bleeding from both sides of the nose or from the mouth, or any signs of acute hypovolemia should warrant prompt management.

### Epistaxis: diagnosis and treatment [^112LyZRD]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are called on to evaluate and treat various emergencies, including acute epistaxis. Epistaxis is relatively benign in nature, but it can produce a serious, life-threatening situation. It has been estimated that up to 60% of the population has had at least 1 episode of epistaxis throughout their lifetime. Of this group, 6% seek medical care to treat epistaxis, with 1.6 in 10,000 requiring hospitalization. With fewer and fewer otorhinolaryngologists participating on hospital call schedules, it is critical for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon to be familiar with the anatomy, diagnosis, and treatment of acute epistaxis and associated medical concerns. Considerations concerning mechanism of injury, coagulopathies, and potential treatment options need to be assessed quickly and accurately to ensure the most appropriate treatment and positive outcome for the patient. The need to treat epistaxis in an emergent setting will often require the involvement of an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. By reviewing the anatomy, potential complications arising from associated medical conditions, and treatment options, patients can be accurately assessed and treated appropriately.

The added benefit of octreotide and thalidomide has not been demonstrated, multidisciplinary care involving interventional gastroenterology and radiology is recommended, and for epistaxis (the second most common bleeding complication in LVAD patients) initial management entails topical vasoconstriction, cautery, and nasal packing/tamponade, with invasive embolization and supportive transfusion possibly required; early involvement of otolaryngology is advisable.

### Demographic differences in emergency room epistaxis treatment patterns and outcomes [^116toELg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Epistaxis is one of the most common otolaryngologic complaints in the United States with up to 60% of the US population experiencing at least 1 episode of epistaxis in their lifetime. However, only about 6% seek medical treatment, with even less requiring admission to the hospital. Treatment for epistaxis is highly variable and is usually influenced by the etiology and patient comorbidities. Clinical guidelines have been created to standardize care in an attempt to optimize patient outcomes while minimizing unnecessary treatments. Traditionally, epistaxis is initially treated conservatively with nasal pressure and a nasal decongestant spray. Subsequent stepwise escalation of treatment consists of nasal packing, cautery, and ultimately surgery or embolization. Recommendations have been delineated based on the anatomic origin of the bleed. Anterior epistaxis is managed by applying pressure to the nostrils, silver nitrate cauterization, or anterior nasal packing, while posterior bleeds generally require nasal packing or endoscopic surgical procedures. Cauterization has been shown to be the most effective at controlling anterior bleeds with an 80% success rate, while posterior bleeds are best controlled with endoscopic surgery with a 97% success rate.

Disparities exist in the demographics of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) for epistaxis, as these patients tend to be male, older, non‐Caucasian, and have a lower socioeconomic status. A study of the pediatric population revealed that children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds comprised a higher proportion of epistaxis presentations. However, these patients were less likely to be treated with an epistaxis control procedure or surgery. In the adult population, Sethi et al found that older patients and those of a low‐socioeconomic quartile were more likely to receive nasal packing. It has been well established that social and racial disparities exist in the ED and can negatively influence health care decision making. Language barriers in health care have been reported to adversely affect health outcomes, health care access, patient satisfaction and safety. However, it is currently unknown how primary language impacts ED epistaxis treatment patterns. This study aims to investigate how Spanish‐language and other demographic characteristics are associated with ED epistaxis management and outcomes.

### Is topical tranexamic acid effective in treating epistaxis? [^114U16oT]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

LITERATURE REVIEW

In 2019, Akkan et al. conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial of 135 patients with spontaneous anterior epistaxis. This study compared three treatment options: local application of TXA with an atomizer followed by nasal compression, nasal packing with Merocel packs, and nasal compression. The primary outcome was resolution of anterior epistaxis after 15 min and the secondary outcome was rebleeding rate within 24 h. There was no significant difference in cessation of epistaxis between the tranexamic acid and the packing groups, and there was a significantly higher success rate when comparing those two groups with the compression only group. In terms of rebleeding at 24 h, 86.7% of patients in the TXA group, 74% in the nasal packing group, and 60% in the compression group did not rebleed. Results from this study suggest that TXA combined with pressure is as effective as nasal packing with Merocel for anterior epistaxis.

In 2020, Reuben et al. conducted a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter randomized controlled trial across the United Kingdom. This study consisted of 496 patients presenting to the ED with spontaneous epistaxis which persisted after initial treatment with topical vasoconstriction. Patients received either topical TXA on a cotton wool dental roll or placebo (sterile water) for 10 min with up to two trial treatments if the first application did not resolve the bleeding. The primary outcome of interest was the need for anterior nasal packing, with secondary outcomes of hospital admission, need for blood transfusion, recurrent bleeding, and thrombotic events. In terms of packing, the authors found no significant difference between the TXA and placebo groups. There were also no statistically significant differences between groups for secondary outcome measures. This study therefore suggests that topical TXA is no more effective than placebo at reducing need for nasal packing. Limitations of this study include the possibility of selection bias as the authors note some participants were excluded due to research nurse availability. Another limitation is that a lower dose of TXA was used when compared to other studies and the comparison was saline rather than a topical vasoconstricting agent.

Statement 3a — Nasal packing: For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should start ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. Level of confidence in evidence is Medium, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, based on observational studies and 2 randomized controlled trials. Benefits include effective and prompt control of nasal bleeding, reduce morbidity, protect airway, reduce need for blood products, allow for additional assessment and management to control bleeding, while risks, harm, and cost include failure to control bleeding, delay in care, can make subsequent examination more difficult, patient discomfort, mucosal damage from packing insertion/removal, damage to intranasal structures, possible infection, possible antibiotic exposure, adverse respiratory effects of nasal obstruction, and cost of packing materials and procedure. Benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit over harm, policy level is Recommendation, intentional vagueness notes the duration of packing is not specified but that long durations should be avoided, and the role of patient preferences is Small to moderate. Quality improvement opportunity is to promote effective treatment for nosebleed patients.

### Intractable epistaxis: looking beyond the usual sites [^115kv7Uk]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Intractable epistaxis is a challenge to manage and often requires multiple interventions, both medical and surgical. After anterior and posterior packing, many options exist on how to manage the patient.

Patients and Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who presented to a private ear, nose, and throat practice with intractable epistaxis from January 2010 until July 2015. The clinical notes were reviewed, noting the demographic characteristics of the patients and the treatment plan that followed. In particular, we determined the site of bleeding that was documented. Of the 17 patients with intractable epistaxis identified, 5 had the site of bleeding documented and were included in the study.

Results

The documented areas that may have contributed to bleeding included the nasal olfactory region (n = 3), nasal inferior meatus (n = 1), and sphenoethmoid recess (n = 1).

Conclusions

After resuscitation and hematologic investigation, nasal endoscopy should be considered in patients with intractable epistaxis.

### An unusual case of epistaxis in a four month old [^114f9geW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Epistaxis is a routine complaint in Emergency Medicine and presents most commonly in adults and children and its incidence increases with age. It is rare in infants and neonates. We discuss a case of epistaxis in a four-month-old male who presented to a critical access hospital. What initially appeared to be routine brisk epistaxis was later discovered to be a large, complex, epiglottic hemangioma. The patient was stabilized using topical tranexamic acid, nasal packing with ketamine sedation, and sent to a tertiary care center for definitive management. He required advanced airway management in the OR for definitive airway management for airway-obstructing hemangioma excision.

### Does choice of nasal pack matter? A systematic review and meta-analysis of merocel and rapid rhino [^116YADGj]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Epistaxis is one of the most common rhinological emergencies. Management often involves nasal packing when initial measures fail. This paper compares Rapid Rhino (RR) and Merocel in the management and prevention of epistaxis.

Data Sources

Studies from Embase, PubMed and Medline were included.

Review Methods

A systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis were performed, pre-registered on PROSPERO and adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Studies were screened, followed by data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata. Pain score effect size was based on raw means at packing removal, while rebleeding effect size used Freeman-Tukey's proportion. Pain score at removal and rebleeding requiring repacking was assessed.

Results

The systematic review yielded 4637 studies for screening, with 51 meeting inclusion criteria. In primary epistaxis, RR was associated with less pain upon insertion and removal. In the surgical setting, RR demonstrated superior hemostasis and greater patient comfort. The meta-analysis demonstrated that for post-surgical packing, RR was significantly less painful on removal than Merocel (Mean = 2.50 [1.72, 3.28] vs. 6.34 [5.58, 7.10]; p = 0.00). Similarly, for primary epistaxis, RR removal was significantly less painful than Merocel (Mean = 2.28 [0.95, 3.61] vs. 4.14 [3.31, 4.97]; p = 0.02). All tests of group differences for rebleeding demonstrated no significant differences between nasal packs.

Conclusion

RR was found to be significantly less painful upon removal in primary and post-surgical epistaxis. Although the systematic review demonstrates that RR is associated with less bleeding than Merocel, the meta-analysis demonstrated no statistically significant difference.

Hypertension and epistaxis: The causative role of hypertension in nosebleeds is not established, higher blood pressure readings are seen in patients presenting to the emergency department or otolaryngologist with a nosebleed as compared with patients presenting with other conditions, and it was not clear that the elevated blood pressure in the patients in this study actually caused the nosebleeds; evidence supporting the role of blood pressure lowering in the acute treatment of nosebleeds is lacking, although a small prospective cohort study of 80 patients with nosebleed demonstrated that patients with higher blood pressures at presentation required more complex interventions to achieve control of the nosebleed.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^112S85kN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis — supporting data for advanced interventions: Although many cases of epistaxis will resolve with conservative management, approximately 6% of patients will require management more invasive than cautery or packing for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis. Historically, prolonged posterior nasal packing (2–7 days) had mediocre hemostasis with recurrent bleeding in up to 52% of cases and was associated with prolonged hospitalization and significant discomfort. Transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) is now the most commonly employed surgical arterial ligation technique with a reported success rate of up to 98%, and complication rates with TESPAL are relatively low, including postoperative hemorrhage (3.4%), with a similar reported mortality rate as compared with embolization; recent treatment algorithms employ surgical arterial ligation and/or endovascular embolization as second-line therapies for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis.

### Demographic differences in emergency room epistaxis treatment patterns and outcomes [^116ePQcp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Language

Language barriers in health care can adversely affect health outcomes, health care access, patient satisfaction, and safety. Language incongruent encounters have been found to increase the risk of miscommunication, misdiagnosis, medication errors, complications, and even death. This has been shown in the pediatric population as Spanish‐language increases the risk of return to the ED after discharge, suggesting potential undertreatment. While our study was not designed to measure whether patients were appropriately treated, we found that Spanish‐speaking patients were less likely to receive any nasal packing or cautery and diagnostic endoscopy when presenting to the ED compared to English‐speaking patients. However, the results showed no differences in average visits to the ED the week of the initial visit, inpatient admission, mortality, or endoscopic control of hemorrhage. Other language‐speaking patients were the only group less likely to receive nasal decongestants. This group was also more likely to receive diagnostic nasal endoscopy. However, the other language‐speaking group includes patients of various different backgrounds which limits its generalizability.

### Nosebleeds in children… [^114zQpov]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Although annoying, nosebleeds are generally not serious. They are very common, affecting about 30% of children younger than 5 years and 50% of children 5 years and older. The bleeding originates in the nose and may come out of one or both sides of the nose or the mouth. Bleeding from the front of the nose is called an anterior nosebleed. Bleeding from the back of the nose is called a posterior nosebleed. Dry air and crusting in the nose may make the nose even more likely to bleed. Anything that dries out or injures the inside of the nose can cause a nosebleed. This includes inflammation from an upper respiratory infection or allergies, use of decongestant nasal sprays, heated indoor spaces, high altitudes, dry climates, injuring your face or nose, and inserting anything into your nose. Most nosebleeds are anterior nose bleeds. Rarely, posterior nose bleeds occur from larger blood vessels in the back of the nose.

This may look like bleeding that mostly goes down the throat rather than out the nose, and it may be difficult to stop. Medical conditions that prevent blood from clotting may cause or worsen nosebleeds in children. To stop a nosebleed at home, keep calm and instruct your child to breathe through their mouth; sit up with your child leaning slightly forward with head tilted forward; and pinch the soft part of nose above the nostrils together continuously for at least 10 minutes. After the bleeding stops, there may be large clumps of blood that come out of the nose or mouth. This is normal, as it is the body's way of stopping the bleeding. If the bleeding does not stop after 30 minutes, the volume of blood is more than 1 cup, or your child is having difficulty breathing or is vomiting from swallowing blood, seek emergency medical attention. Treatment depends on the cause of bleeding and is determined by your medical professional.

Nosebleeds often improve or stop with the prevention methods listed above. If a nosebleed does not stop with pressure, a doctor may put something in the nose called a nasal pack to put pressure on the bleeding. Sometimes a doctor will put a medication on the area of bleeding to cause the bleeding to stop; this is called cauterization. The inside of the nose is numbed, and the bleeding blood vessel is sealed.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^116LHEUr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis with an identified anterior bleeding site — treatment options and evidence include that initial therapy may consist of topical treatments, including application of vasoconstricting agents such as oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, epinephrine, or cocaine and/or use of nasal cautery, with lubricants and moisturizing agents after bleeding ceases. Oxymetazoline and phenylephrine are over-the-counter vasoconstrictors, and 65% to 75% of patients have resolution of nasal bleeding with oxymetazoline, though increased risk of cardiac or other systemic complications is noted. A trial showed no differences in mean arterial pressure with intranasal phenylephrine 0.25%, oxymetazoline 0.05%, or lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine compared with saline. These agents should be used cautiously in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, or cerebrovascular conditions; for children, oxymetazoline use in children aged < 6 years is recommended only with advice of a clinician, and more dilute (0.125%) phenylephrine nasal solutions can be used in children aged ≥ 2 years. Topical epinephrine is also effective, but concern about cardiovascular effects from systemic absorption favors the use of oxymetazoline, and while a review supported safety in healthy adults during endoscopic sinus surgery, safety in acute nosebleed has not been studied; cocaine is used infrequently due to possible cardiac side effects and other toxicities. In adults, a randomized controlled study comparing nasal pinching for 10 minutes versus topical vasoconstriction (0.5% oxymetazoline or 1:10,000 epinephrine) applied for 30 minutes followed by silver nitrate cauterization found bleeding control in 86% to 90% with vasoconstrictor pretreatment versus 64% with pinching alone prior to cautery. A Cochrane review of 5 studies found no clear differences among antiseptic cream, petroleum jelly, and/or silver nitrate cautery (with or without antiseptic cream), although a 75% silver nitrate cautery stick was judged more effective and less painful than a 95% stick. A consensus statement from the British Rhinology Society strongly recommended first-line cautery at an identified bleeding site and made a weak recommendation for vasoconstrictor use prior to cautery.

First aid for epistaxis — Recommendations are specified with class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) as follows: "1 C-LD 1. A person experiencing epistaxis should sit with their head slightly forward with their nostrils pinched for 10 to 15 minutes". Escalation thresholds include "1 C-EO 2. A person experiencing epistaxis that does not stop after 15 minutes of continuous manual pressure or who becomes lightheaded from epistaxis should seek medical attention". For trauma, "1 C-EO 3. A person with epistaxis due to trauma should seek medical attention if they experience signs of brain injury, obvious nasal deformity, or signs of facial fracture". For higher-risk patients, "2a C-LD 4. It is reasonable for a person experiencing epistaxis who is taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication, or who has a blood-clotting disorder, to seek care from a health care professional, unless bleeding has stopped". The guideline notes uncertainty regarding cooling: "2b C-LD 5. The usefulness of cryotherapy (ice) for managing epistaxis in the first aid setting is unknown". Context for this topic includes "ILCOR performed a systematic review of cryotherapy for epistaxis in 2021". and "An updated literature search was performed by the writing group in 2023".

Interventions for nosebleed — initial measures and packing utilization: The majority of nosebleeds originate from the nasal septum, although the lateral nasal wall has a rich vascular supply as well. Initial ("first-line") treatment can include combinations of direct nasal compression, application of topical agents including vasoconstrictors, cautery of the bleeding site with chemicals or electrocautery, or packing with a variety of absorbable and nonabsorbable materials. In the NEDS review, 19.7% of emergency room visits for epistaxis involved treatment with nasal packing; among those requiring packing, Fifty-two percent also had nasal cautery; 41% had anterior packing alone; and 7% had anterior and posterior nasal packing performed.

### Outcomes analysis in epistaxis management: development of a therapeutic algorithm [^1152gRX8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This study explored the outcomes of epistaxis treatment modalities to optimize management and enable the development of a therapeutic algorithm.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Tertiary care hospital.

Subjects and Methods

Adult patients presenting between 2005 and 2011 with epistaxis underwent cauterization, tamponade, and/or proximal vascular control. Outcomes of treatment modalities were compared. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for coagulopathy, hypertension, and bleeding site.

Results

The population included 147 patients (94 men, 53 women). For initial epistaxis, nondissolvable packing demonstrated the highest initial treatment failure rate of 57.4% (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.33–8.59 compared with cautery). No significant differences were noted among initial posterior epistaxis treatment modalities. Length of nondissolvable pack placement for 3, 4, or 5 days had no significant impact on recurrence. Among patients who failed initial management, those who next underwent cautery or proximal vascular control required a significantly shorter inpatient stay of 5.3 vs 6.8 days compared with those who underwent packing (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04–0.68). There were no treatment failures following surgical arterial ligation.

Conclusion

Initial management of anterior epistaxis with chemical cautery had a higher success rate and a lower number of total required interventions than did nondissolvable packing. Duration of packing did not affect recurrence. In patients who failed initially, progression to cautery or proximal vascular control led to significantly shorter inpatient stays than did packing.
