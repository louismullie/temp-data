## Question

How long after prednisone until receiving vaccination

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to wait after prednisone before receiving vaccination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the vaccine type, because live versus inactivated vaccines follow different rules. Then, I should verify the prednisone dose and duration thresholds that define "high-dose" immunosuppression. Next, I will check the timing recommendations for live vaccines, followed by the timing for inactivated vaccines. After that, I need to consider special populations and edge cases, and finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the vaccine taxonomy, because everything hinges on this distinction. Live attenuated vaccines include MMR, varicella, yellow fever, live intranasal influenza, and others, and they carry a risk of disseminated infection in immunocompromised hosts, whereas inactivated vaccines include influenza (injected), pneumococcal, hepatitis B, COVID-19, and others, which are generally safe even in immunosuppressed patients, though immunogenicity may be reduced at higher steroid doses [^116tgoWt] [^116QnqEG].

> I need to verify the dose and duration thresholds that constitute "high-dose" systemic corticosteroids. Multiple authoritative sources converge on prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day (or ≥ 2 mg/kg/day in children weighing > 10 kg) for ≥ 2 weeks as the threshold where live vaccines are contraindicated and vaccine responses are more likely to be impaired, whereas doses < 20 mg/day, especially ≤ 10 mg/day, are considered lower risk for immunosuppression, though immunogenicity may still be modestly affected as doses approach 20 mg/day [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG] [^113s3XbY] [^116QnqEG].

> Now, for live vaccines, I should confirm the waiting period after stopping high-dose prednisone. The CDC Yellow Book advises waiting at least 1 month after discontinuation of high-dose systemic corticosteroids before administering live vaccines, and this 1-month interval is echoed by ACIP for zoster and by travel medicine guidance for yellow fever and other live vaccines; some older or more conservative sources suggested 3 months, but contemporary guidance favors 1 month for corticosteroids specifically, reserving longer intervals for other immunosuppressants like rituximab or chemotherapy [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG] [^116KQy8H] [^1133iZxy] [^113s3XbY].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance for inactivated vaccines, because I don't want to overgeneralize. Inactivated vaccines are not contraindicated during corticosteroid therapy; they can be given at any time, but immunogenicity may be reduced at higher steroid doses. Thus, many guidelines recommend giving inactivated vaccines when the steroid dose is lowest feasible, and in rheumatic disease populations, the ACR suggests deferring non-influenza inactivated vaccines until prednisone is < 20 mg/day if clinically acceptable, while still allowing influenza vaccination even at higher doses due to its importance and favorable risk-benefit profile [^116QnqEG] [^114BeNdo] [^112yvnaK] [^1121SPdb].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and edge cases. In children, the same ≥ 2 mg/kg/day or ≥ 20 mg/day thresholds apply, and the 1-month rule after stopping high-dose steroids still holds for live vaccines. In travelers facing imminent exposure to yellow fever or measles, some guidance allows consideration of live vaccination after a shorter interval with specialist input, but this is exceptional and requires individualized risk assessment. For patients with IBD or other inflammatory conditions, gastroenterology guidance emphasizes updating inactivated vaccines promptly and preferentially off steroids or at the lowest tolerable dose, while still avoiding live vaccines during high-dose immunosuppression [^116WGMpG] [^116rZByc] [^111HHyGo].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer, but I should double-check that I'm aligning with the highest-credibility sources. If you received high-dose prednisone (≥ 20 mg/day) for ≥ 2 weeks, wait at least 1 month after discontinuation before any live vaccine. If you are still on high-dose prednisone, live vaccines should be deferred. If you received low-to-moderate doses (< 20 mg/day, especially ≤ 10 mg/day), live vaccines are generally acceptable, though some clinicians still prefer to wait until the dose is lower when feasible. For inactivated vaccines, proceed at the earliest opportunity, ideally when the steroid dose is lowest, recognizing that even at doses ≥ 20 mg/day, inactivated vaccines are safe but may be less immunogenic, so timing to a lower dose is reasonable if it won't dangerously delay protection [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG] [^114BeNdo] [^116QnqEG].

> But wait, what if the prednisone course was short-term, like a 5–7 day burst? I should confirm that. Short-term bursts of prednisone (< 2 weeks) at high dose are not considered sufficiently immunosuppressive to require a mandatory waiting period for live vaccines, though some experts still advise a brief interval out of caution; inactivated vaccines can be given immediately in this scenario, as the immunologic impact is minimal with brief courses [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG] [^114GYArE].

> I will now examine the reverse scenario, because patients often ask about starting steroids after vaccination. If live vaccination has just been given, many guidelines recommend waiting about 4 weeks before initiating immunosuppression to allow vaccine virus replication to complete, whereas inactivated vaccines do not require a waiting period before starting steroids; this helps preserve vaccine efficacy and reduce the risk of attenuated vaccine failure [^116rZByc] [^116WGMpG].

> Final check and bottom line: for high-dose prednisone (≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 2 weeks), wait at least 1 month after stopping before live vaccines. For low-to-moderate doses, live vaccines are generally acceptable, though lower is better. For inactivated vaccines, do not delay; give them as soon as possible, preferably at the lowest feasible steroid dose, and consider repeating or boosting later if immunogenicity is a concern in high-dose steroid users [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG] [^114BeNdo] [^116QnqEG].

Patients should wait **at least 1 month** after stopping prednisone at doses ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 2 weeks before giving any live vaccine [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG]. For lower doses or shorter courses, **no delay is needed** for inactivated vaccines, and live vaccines can be given once the dose is below 20 mg/day for at least 2 weeks [^116QnqEG] [^114GYArE]. If prednisone is ongoing, prioritize inactivated vaccines and defer live vaccines until the dose is reduced and enough time has passed to restore immune function [^114BeNdo] [^113mpFcp].

---

## Definitions and thresholds

High-dose prednisone is defined as **≥ 20 mg/day (or ≥ 2 mg/kg/day in children) for ≥ 2 weeks** [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG]. Low-to-moderate dose is **< 20 mg/day**, and short-term use is **< 14 days** [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG].

---

## Vaccine types and their implications

Vaccines are broadly categorized as **live attenuated vaccines** (e.g. MMR, varicella, yellow fever, live influenza) and **inactivated vaccines** (e.g. influenza, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, COVID-19) [^116tgoWt]. Live vaccines carry a risk of systemic infection in immunocompromised patients, whereas inactivated vaccines do not [^1155Jpxa].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

### Live vaccines

- **High-dose prednisone (≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 2 weeks)**: Wait at least 1 month after discontinuation before administering live vaccines [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG].
- **Low-to-moderate dose or short-term use**: Live vaccines can be administered once the dose is reduced to < 20 mg/day for at least 2 weeks [^114GYArE].
- **Ongoing prednisone therapy**: Defer live vaccines until the dose is reduced and sufficient time has elapsed to restore immune function [^113mpFcp].

---

### Inactivated vaccines

- **High-dose prednisone**: Inactivated vaccines can be administered without delay, but efficacy may be reduced; consider timing at the lowest feasible dose or providing additional doses later [^116QnqEG] [^114BeNdo].
- **Low-to-moderate dose or short-term use**: No delay is necessary; administer as indicated [^116QnqEG].

---

## Special considerations

- **Children**: The same thresholds apply, with caution regarding growth and developmental effects of prolonged corticosteroid use [^notfound].
- **Travel vaccines**: Yellow fever and other travel-related live vaccines follow the same 1-month rule after high-dose prednisone [^112PNBYU] [^113PAugJ].
- **COVID-19 vaccines**: Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines can be administered during corticosteroid therapy, though efficacy may be reduced; consider additional doses or boosters as per current guidance [^116QnqEG] [^115ZF3tN].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

| **Prednisone dose and duration** | **Live vaccines** | **Inactivated vaccines** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 2 weeks | Wait ≥ 1 month after discontinuation | Administer as indicated; consider additional doses |
| < 20 mg/day or < 14 days | Administer once dose is < 20 mg/day for ≥ 2 weeks | Administer as indicated |
| Ongoing therapy | Defer until dose reduction and immune recovery | Administer as indicated; consider timing at lowest dose |

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **High-dose prednisone (≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 2 weeks)**: Wait at least 1 month after discontinuation before live vaccines [^112PNBYU] [^116WGMpG].
- **Low-to-moderate dose or short-term use**: No delay for inactivated vaccines; live vaccines once dose is < 20 mg/day for ≥ 2 weeks [^116QnqEG] [^114GYArE].
- **Ongoing prednisone therapy**: Prioritize inactivated vaccines; defer live vaccines until dose reduction and immune recovery [^114BeNdo] [^113mpFcp].

---

The timing of vaccination after prednisone depends on the **dose and duration** of corticosteroid therapy and the **type of vaccine**. High-dose prednisone requires a 1-month waiting period after discontinuation before live vaccines, whereas inactivated vaccines can be administered without delay, though efficacy may be reduced.

Steroids, relapse status, and timing of live-virus vaccination — The guideline panel identified no evidence that vaccines increase the risk of relapse or worsen relapse severity, but studies are limited, and experts remain concerned about vaccination during an active MS relapse. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices states that many clinicians consider a dose equivalent to either 2 mg/kg of body weight or a total of 20 mg/day of prednisone as sufficiently immunosuppressive to raise concern about live-virus vaccination, that corticosteroids used in greater than physiologic doses also may reduce the immune response to vaccines, and that physicians should wait at least 3 months after discontinuation before administering a live-virus vaccine to patients who have received high-dose, systemic steroids for greater than or equal to 2 weeks. Immunization is not typically an urgent need and, in most cases, can be temporarily delayed without a marked increase in infection risk.

Despite widespread adoption of "high-dose" glucocorticoid definitions across international immunisation guidelines (ie, prednisone-equivalent dosing > 20mg/day, or > 2mg/kg/day in children), the rationale remains unclear. Literature searches were performed through academic databases for this narrative review to identify relevant evidence regarding glucocorticoid dosing on vaccine responses and safety. In people receiving prednisone < 7mg/day, vaccine responses are maintained. In people on "high-dose" glucocorticoids (> 20mg/day), antibody titres and seropositivity are reduced, whereas the impact of low- to medium-dose glucocorticoids (7 to 20mg/day) on vaccine efficacy remains inconclusive. Due to inconsistent paediatric dosing regimens, data is insufficient to support a unified "high-dose" glucocorticoid threshold. Non-live vaccines are well tolerated in patients receiving glucocorticoids with rheumatic/inflammatory disorders, but enhanced reactogenicity after live vaccination may occur in those with severe immunodeficiencies. Clinicians should consider individual risk-benefit profiles, rather than following strict dosing thresholds, when curating immunisation programs for patients prescribed glucocorticoids.

Steroids and other immunosuppressive therapies — timing and dose thresholds: Avoid vaccinating people who have received high-dose corticosteroid therapy (in general, considered to be ≥ 20 mg or 2 mg/kg body weight of prednisone, or its equivalent, daily for ≥ 14 days) with MMR or MMRV for at least 1 month after cessation of steroid therapy. Corticosteroid therapy usually is not a contraindication when administration is short-term (< 14 days) or a low to moderate dose (< 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day).

5.2.1.3 Vaccination

Statement 82. We recommend that a vaccination history should be obtained and vaccinations updated for all patients with Crohn's disease, those with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis at diagnosis, and prior to commencing immunomodulator or biologics in all patients. Live vaccinations may be given at least 4 weeks before starting and at a minimum of 3 months after stopping, but not while receiving immunosuppressive therapy (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 93%).

Statement 83. We recommend that IBD patients receiving immunomodulators or biologics should receive influenza vaccination each autumn, and pneumococcal vaccination with a booster after 5 years (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.5%).

A vaccination history should be taken both at diagnosis and prior to starting immunosuppressive therapy (see box 4). General advice regarding vaccination is given in box 5.

Box 5
General considerations regarding vaccination

Live vaccines are contraindicated if your patient is on immunosuppression or with significant protein calorie malnutrition: live vaccines include BCG, attenuated (oral) influenza vaccine, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), polio, rotavirus, oral typhoid Ty21a, varicella zoster, yellow fever. Immunosuppressive therapies include: glucocorticoids (prednisolone ≥ 20 mg/day or equivalent for 2 weeks or more), thiopurines, methotrexate, biological therapy and tofacitinib.
Shingles vaccination (current UK age recommendation is at age 70 years or up to the age of 79 years if not given at age 70 years) may be administered to those on low-level immunosuppression (defined as ≤ 20 mg prednisolone/day for > 14 days, either alone or in combination with low-dose non-biological oral immunomodulators (methotrexate ≤ 25 mg/week, azathioprine ≤ 3 mg/kg/day or mercaptopurine ≤ 1.5 mg/kg/day).
Immunomodulators should be withheld for 4 weeks after live vaccine administration.
Live vaccines should be avoided for at least 3 months after discontinuing treatment with immunosuppressive therapies above.
Infants exposed to biologics in utero should not receive live vaccines for 6 months after birth.
IBD patients on immunosuppressant therapy should receive pneumococcal vaccine and annual influenza vaccination (prior to starting treatment if possible) with a single pneumococcal booster at 5 years.

Immunocompromised travelers — timing of live vaccination after immunosuppression is therapy-specific; the length of time healthcare professionals should wait after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies before administering a live vaccine is not uniform and depends on the therapy. For cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and highly immunosuppressive medications the waiting period is 3 months; for lymphocyte-depleting agents (e.g., alemtuzumab, rituximab) the waiting period is ≥ 6 months, although IDSA guidelines suggest that the waiting period should be ≥ 1 year; for immunosuppressive corticosteroid regimens, the waiting period is 1 month; and restarting immunosuppression after live vaccination has not been studied, but some experts would recommend waiting ≥ 1 month. For high-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy specifically, healthcare professionals should wait ≥ 1 month after discontinuation before administering a live vaccine, and prednisone (or its equivalent) in people who weigh > 10 kg when administered for ≥ 2 weeks is described as sufficiently immunosuppressive to raise concern about the safety of vaccination with live vaccines.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116KQy8H]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Zoster vaccine — immunosuppressive therapy thresholds state that persons on immunosuppressive therapy, including high-dose corticosteroids (≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) lasting for 2 or more weeks, should have zoster vaccination deferred for at least 1 month after discontinuation; short-term corticosteroid therapy (< 14 days), low-to-moderate dose (< 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent), topical/inhaled/intra-articular routes, or long-term alternate-day treatment are not considered sufficiently immunosuppressive and persons receiving this dose or schedule can receive zoster vaccine; therapy with low-doses of methotrexate (≤ 0.4 mg/Kg/week), azathioprine (≤ 3.0 mg/Kg/day), or 6-mercaptopurine (≤ 1.5 mg/Kg/day) are also not contraindications for administration of zoster vaccine.

### Effect of prednisone on response to influenza virus vaccine in asthmatic children… [^111R2n6H]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Interventions All study patients underwent immunization with the 1996–1997 trivalent subvirion influenza virus vaccine containing 15-µg hemagglutinin antigens each of A/Texas/36/91, A/Wuhan/359/95, and B/Beijing/184/93. The prednisone cohort received a burst of oral prednisone therapy. Prevaccination serum samples were obtained from each subject on enrollment, and postvaccination samples were obtained 3 to 6 weeks after the last vaccination dose. Children were monitored in the clinic for 20 minutes after vaccination for severe reactions. Parents were instructed to note any reactions to the immunization within the first 24 hours, including injection-site pain and fever. The mean interval between the last vaccination and serologic sampling for the postvaccination titer was 33. 4 days for the prednisone group and
32. 3 days for the control group.

Both groups reported less than 3% incidence of adverse effects to the vaccination. The most frequent adverse event in each group was tenderness at the injection site. Serology There were excellent responses in both groups to the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 antigens, but the response to the B antigen in both groups was poor. There were no statistically significant differences in the responses of both groups to the 3 components of the vaccine in the proportion achieving a 4-fold rise in titer or the proportion with protective titers of at least 1:

14 Despite these detrimental effects on humoral and cellular immunity, other studies have shown that there is no inhibition of primary or secondary responses to antigens in humans taking high-dose glucocorticoids. 15Claman16 has shown that patients who were taking 15 to 20 mg/d of prednisone had a normal response to immunization.

### Infectious complications with the use of biologic response modifiers in infants and children [^114tJa6x]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric biologic response modifiers (BRMs) — immunization before initiation should follow current recommendations for persons 0 through 18 years of age, with a thorough immunization history and testing for specific antibody concentrations where documentation is inadequate; for varicella with undocumented vaccination, serologic testing is not indicated and vaccination is recommended if there is sufficient time to administer it (4 weeks minimum) before the BRM. All recommended inactivated vaccines should be given at least 2 weeks before the initiation of BRMs, and live vaccines (rotavirus, live-attenuated influenza, varicella, measles, mumps, and rubella) should be given a minimum of 4 weeks in advance; the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can be given the same day as a tuberculin skin test (TST), but if MMR is given before TST, the TST should be delayed for 4 to 6 weeks, and inactivated, polysaccharide, recombinant or subunit vaccines and toxoids do not interfere with TST interpretation. For patients receiving steroids, live-virus vaccines should not be given except in special circumstances, and those receiving higher doses (≥ 2 mg/kg per day of prednisone or its equivalent or ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 14 days for those weighing > 10 kg) should not receive any live-virus vaccines until corticosteroid therapy has been discontinued for at least 1 month.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^113YqznD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Corticosteroid-associated secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — evaluation, vaccination, management, and prophylaxis: Because corticosteroid-associated SHG is not typically linked to increased infection risk, screening and monitoring of IgG levels is not routinely recommended, and vaccine responses may be preserved in chronic oral corticosteroid users; in the absence of severe or recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections, use of immunoglobulin G replacement therapy (IgG-RT) is not routinely recommended. For patients with underlying immunocompromising conditions receiving high-dose corticosteroids, Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis is recommended when taking prednisone > 20 mg daily or equivalent for ≥ 1 month and continued for 1 month after discontinuation.

### Yellow fever vaccine: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^113PAugJ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Yellow fever (YF) vaccine — Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies — YF vaccine is contraindicated for person whose immunologic response is either suppressed or modulated by current or recent radiation therapies or drugs, including high-dose systemic corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, TNF-α inhibitors (e.g., etanercept), IL-1 blocking agent (e.g., anakinra), and other monoclonal antibodies targeting immune cells (e.g., rituximab, alemtuzumab). Although the immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids can vary, a dose of either ≥ 2 mg/kg of body weight or a total ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent for persons who weigh > 10 kg when administered for ≥ 2 weeks is considered sufficiently immunosuppressive to contraindicate the use of live attenuated vaccines. Corticosteroids are not a contraindication when administration is ended in any of the following circumstances: short-term (i.e., < 2 weeks); a low-to-moderate dose (< 20 mg of prednisone or its equivalent per day); long-term, alternate-day treatment with short-acting preparations; maintenance physiologic doses (replacement therapy); or administered topically (skin or eyes), inhaled, or by intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection. Administration of live viral vaccines should be deferred in persons who have discontinued these therapies until immune function has improved, and if someone receiving immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies cannot avoid travel to an area in which YF is endemic, a medical waiver should be provided, and counseling on protective measures against mosquito bites should be emphasized.

### Vaccinations in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [^112YJhrt]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Timing of vaccination

Vaccination status is best checked and updated before the start of immunotherapy: live vaccines are not contraindicated at that time and inactivated vaccines elicit an optimal immune response in immunocompetent individuals. In IBD, it has even been suggested to vaccinate at the time of diagnosis, particularly in patients with risk factors for a rapid evolution towards severe disease requiring immunosuppressive therapies. Inactivated vaccines can be administered safely to patients under immunotherapy, but live vaccines must be given 3–4 weeks before (re)start of therapy, to ensure that virus replication has ended before impairing the patient's immune competence (evidence Level D).

The duration of therapy discontinuation needed in order to safely administer a live vaccine depends on the type, dose and duration of the therapy. As a rule of thumb, a period of 3 months is estimated for the immune status to be completely restored (evidence Level D), except for corticosteroid therapy, where a waiting period of 1 month is thought to be sufficient (evidence Level D).

Vaccination of household contacts

Close contacts of persons with altered immune competence can safely receive all age-appropriate vaccines (evidence Level B), with the exception of live oral poliomyelitis vaccine, which has been replaced by the injectable inactivated vaccine in industrialized countries. MMR, varicella and rotavirus vaccines should be administered when indicated. MMR vaccine viruses are not transmitted to contacts, and transmission of varicella vaccine is rare. The risk of rotavirus transmission to immunocompromized household contacts is estimated to be much lower than the risk of contracting wild-type rotavirus infection. However, to minimize potential rotavirus transmission, hand hygiene measures after contact with faeces of a rotavirus-vaccinated infant should last for at least 1 week.

In summary, vaccination is a very valuable measure to prevent increased morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable disease in the IMID population that is at increased risk for a number of vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccinations are best given to IMID patients before introduction of immunotherapy, since live vaccines (MMR, BCG and yellow fever) are generally contraindicated during immunotherapy and vaccine response is optimal in immunocompetent individuals. Vaccination with inactive vaccines can be given normally in these patients, keeping in mind that — depending on the degree of immunosuppression — the response to the vaccine and potentially the period of protection are more limited in these patients. Vaccines for patients on immunotherapy travelling to endemic countries or frequently travelling around the world should be discussed with a travel medicine specialist.

Risk stratifying and timing vaccinations

Rheumatology departments require guidance on how to manage DMARD/biologic therapies in the context of mass COVID-19 vaccination and this guidance will evolve with time. Existing EULAR guidance is available but may not be sufficient in the context of a global pandemic. In every case the benefits of reducing medication needs to be weighed against the risk of disease flare, which apart from the obvious disadvantage is known to reduce vaccination effectiveness. Key considerations are summarized in Table 3 below.

Table 3
Outline of key therapeutic considerations when vaccinating against COVID-19 alongside DMARDs/biologic therapies

A summary of the possible challenges specific to rituximab is depicted in Fig. 1. 1
Factors influencing rituximab treatment decisions

For MTX, withholding treatment for 2 weeks following each vaccine dose may help improve humoral response. This is speculative in the context of novel vaccine techniques but could be considered in patients on MTX (and perhaps JAK inhibitors) at low to moderate risk of disease flare. Where a flare occurs, they would require treatment and high doses of prednisolone should be avoided where possible due to its possible effects on vaccine responses and COVID-19 morbidity. However, once again, it is important to stress that the priority is to proceed with vaccination and modification of therapy should not delay this.

The situation with JAK inhibitors is unknown, as unlike the MTX study they have only been withheld for 1 week post-vaccination so far. Some data from work on the influenza and PPSV-23 vaccines and the strong type 1 interferon response generated by the mRNA vaccines suggest that withholding JAK inhibitors might improve COVID-19 vaccine responses, but this is speculative. While for abatacept, the data are conflicting and given its mode of action, which could inhibit T-cell responses, treatment guidance urgently requires further evidence.

In all cases, any decision to delay treatment should be the result of an informed discussion by each patient and physician on a case-by-case basis.

### Should we stop methotrexate or not for vaccination? [^115mwce8]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

The first consideration is whether the lowest antibody response evaluated by different assay in these studies can be interpreted as a good and validated predictive marker of vaccine protection. The rationale is simple and refer to the association of dose response of antibody titres after vaccination and protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a prospective cohort of patients with autoimmune disease, COVID-19 infection occurred in 7.4% of patients (threefold increased risk) and were associated with nonresponders to the vaccine defined by no antibody titres. They reported that MTX was associated with lower antibody titres but not with breakthrough infection in contrast with other treatment such as mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab and glucocorticoid. In two studies reported by Arumahandi de Silva et al and Stahl et al, age was the major determinant to explain the decrease in the humoral response in MTX-treated patient with RA. This was recently confirmed in the study published by Frommert et al by a negative impact of age, MTX, type of vaccine and dosage interval on vaccine antibodies response. Withholding MTX after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine resulted in a similar humoral response in a randomised controlled trial. Therefore, pausing MTX could be proposed for the second vaccine dose and in patients over 65 years of age.

### Early experience of COVID-19 vaccination in adults with systemic rheumatic diseases: results from the COVID-19 global rheumatology alliance vaccine survey [^111jjh8n]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Whether to hold antirheumatic medications for vaccination, and for how long, remains unclear for many medication classes. Hypothetical concerns about reduced immunogenicity have recently been corroborated by antibody titre studies. Recommendations from the ACR, for instance, have reflected these concerns. Initial guidance in February of 2021 recommended holding methotrexate, JAK inhibitors, abatacept and rituximab in certain patients with controlled disease; an April 2021 update also included mycophenolate mofetil. These guidelines were based on limited data, including one randomised controlled trial of methotrexate holding for influenza vaccination in patients with RA, and two studies of holding tofacitinib in patients with RA. Our survey found that most patients would be willing to temporarily discontinue their medications but had concerns about a flare of their systemic rheumatic disease. As expected, current glucocorticoid users had an especially high frequency of respondents who were less willing to hold these medications. This may be explained by prior experience of flares when stopping or lowering dose of glucocorticoids, concerns about adrenal insufficiency or a relationship between glucocorticoid use and active disease. However, despite reported willingness, only a minority of participants discontinued any medication around COVID-19 vaccination. Future studies are needed to firmly establish an evidence base for temporarily holding specific antirheumatic therapies to enhance vaccine efficacy while balancing risk for disease flare.

### Use of vaccines and immune globulins in persons with… [^1133iZxy]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

The exact amount of systemic corticosteroids and the duration of their administration needed to suppress the immune system of an otherwise healthy child are not well defined. The immunosuppressive effects of steroid treatment vary, but many clinicians consider a dose equivalent to either 2 mg/kg of body weight or a total of 20 mg/day of prednisone as sufficiently immunosuppressive to raise concern about the safety of immunization with live-virus vaccines. Corticosteroids used in greater than physiologic doses also may reduce the immune response to vaccines. Physicians should wait at least 3 months after discontinuation of therapy before administering a live-virus vaccine to patients who have received high-dose, systemic steroids for greater than or equal to 2 weeks. Vaccination during chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be avoided because antibody responses are suboptimal.

Patients vaccinated while on immunosuppressive therapy or in the 2 weeks before starting therapy should be considered unimmunized and should be revaccinated at least 3 months after discontinuation of therapy. Passive immunoprophylaxis with immune globulins may be indicated for immunocompromised persons instead of or in addition to vaccination. The efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination for some of these patients, including those on dialysis, may be considerably lower than for immunocompetent patients, their antibody levels may be lower, and they may require repeat vaccination or an increased dose of vaccine. Because secondary antibody responses are less affected than primary antibody responses, immunization strategies should be formulated early in the course of progressive renal disease.

If OPV is inadvertently administered to a household or intimate contact of an immunocompromised patient, close contact between the patient and the recipient of OPV should be avoided for approximately 1 month after vaccination, the period of maximum excretion of vaccine virus. Because of the possibility of immunodeficiency in other children born to a family in which there has been one such case, OPV should not be administered to a member of a household in which there is a history of inherited immunodeficiency until the immune status of the recipient and other children in the family is documented. Amantadine prophylaxis or treatment also should be considered during periods of increased type A influenza activity in the community. However, strict attention must be given to administering reduced doses of amantadine to patients with renal failure.

### Prednisone (Rayos) [^111ZsGgx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with RAYOS and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.

Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of RAYOS abruptly or without medical supervision, to advise any medical attendants that they are taking it, and to seek medical advice at once should they develop fever or other signs of infection. Patients should be told to take RAYOS exactly as prescribed, follow the instructions on the prescription label, and not stop taking RAYOS without first checking with their healthcare providers, as there may be a need for gradual dose reduction.
Patients should discuss with their physician if they have had recent or ongoing infections or if they have recently received a vaccine.
Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.
There are a number of medicines that can interact with RAYOS. Patients should inform their healthcare provider of all the medicines they are taking, including over-the-counter and prescription medicines (such as phenytoin, diuretics, digitalis or digoxin, rifampin, amphotericin B, cyclosporine, insulin or diabetes medicines, ketoconazole, estrogens including birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy, blood thinners such as warfarin, aspirin or other NSAIDs, barbiturates), dietary supplements, and herbal products. If patients are taking any of these drugs, alternate therapy, dosage adjustment, and/or special test may be needed during the treatment.
For missed doses, patients should be told to take the missed dose as soon as they remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, the missed dose should be skipped and the medicine taken at the next regularly schedule time. Patients should not take an extra dose to make up for the missed dose.
Patients should be told to take RAYOS with food. Patients should be advised not to break, divide, or chew RAYOS.
Patients should be advised of common adverse reactions that could occur with RAYOS use to include fluid retention, alteration in glucose tolerance, elevation in blood pressure, behavioral and mood changes, increased appetite and weight gain.
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Does an adjustment to the dosing and timing of immunomodulatory drugs alter the immunogenicity of the COVID-19 vaccines in patients with autoimmune and inflammatory rheumatic disease (AIIRD)? [^112SaxLC]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Our initial recommendation to reduce the dose of methotrexate to 7.5 mg per week for 2 weeks following each vaccine dose differs from the ACR recommendation that methotrexate should be held for 1 week after each vaccine dose. This is based on our reading of the Park study which indicated that a dose of ≤ 7.5 mg methotrexate per week for 2 weeks following the influenza vaccine resulted in comparable vaccine response to the four influenza antigens studied as did holding methotrexate for 2 weeks (see Park et al, figure 3). As the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines required two doses, we also reasoned that the lower dose of methotrexate versus stopping methotrexate for 2 weeks would be less likely to result in disease flare.

This study has a number of limitations. We did not measure antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein but relied on the patients' self-reported history of COVID-19 infection. The study was not randomised as to who adjusted and did not make adjustments to their medication although this did not appear to affect outcomes. We did not control for patients on RTX and ABA who were on additional immunosuppressive therapies aside from prednisone and sample size was relatively small for several of the drugs studied. Finally, we do not provide any data on cellular immune responses.

This study suggests that holding JAKi, lowering the dose of MTX or altering the timing of the vaccine in relation to RTX or ABA administration did not alter immunogenicity as measured by SARS-CoV-2 Abs to the S1 spike antigen. Although these findings may assist in future recommendations for dosing and timing of immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of COVID-19 vaccinations including boosters in patients with AIIRD, conclusive evidence for this question can only be provided by well controlled prospective randomised clinical trials.

Medications that compromise the immune system — persons who are moderate to severely immunocompromised include those on active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (i.e., 20 mg or more of prednisone or equivalent per day when administered for 2 or more weeks), alkylating agents, antimetabolites, transplant-related immunosuppressive drugs, cancer chemotherapeutic agents classified as severely immunosuppressive, tumor necrosis factor blockers, and other biologic agents that are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory; live vaccines are contraindicated in these populations. B cell–depleting agents (e.g., cladribine, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ozanimod, rituximab, siponimod) and lymphocyte-depleting agents (e.g., alemtuzumab, thymoglobulin) induce major immunosuppression. Doses of inactivated vaccines received while receiving immunosuppressive medications or during the 2 weeks before starting such medications should not be counted toward a primary vaccination series or relied upon to induce adequate immune responses, and patients should be revaccinated with all indicated inactivated vaccines at least 3 months after post immunosuppressive therapy is discontinued.

### Varicella vaccine recommendations… [^112dGhPz]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Contraindications for Varicella Vaccination People with contraindications for varicella vaccine should not receive varicella vaccine, including anyone who: People Receiving Salicylates
- People should avoid using salicylates for 6 weeks after getting varicella vaccine. This is because of the association between aspirin use and Reye syndrome following varicella infection, and also the potential risk of Reye syndrome if a person is given aspirin after varicella vaccination.
- Take caution when vaccinating children who are receiving salicylates. However, no adverse events have been reported.
- Children with rheumatoid arthritis or other conditions that require therapeutic aspirin should be monitored closely after they get vaccinated.

People Who May Have Some Degree of Immunodeficiency
- People with impaired humoral immunity
- People receiving systemic steroids for certain conditions, such as asthma, and who are receiving steroids < 2 mg/kg of body weight or total of < 20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent and are not otherwise immunocompromised
- There is a lack of data on whether people who use inhaled, nasal, or topical steroids can be vaccinated safely. However, based on clinical experience, these people can generally tolerate vaccination well.
- Some experts suggest withholding steroids for 2 to 3 weeks after vaccination if that can be done safely.
- People receiving high doses of systemic steroids if steroid therapy has been discontinued for ≥ 1 month
- People with leukemia, lymphoma, or other malignancies that are in remission and who have not received chemotherapy for ≥ 3 months.

All of these vaccinated people had rash after vaccination. As a result, 13 people, including household members and people in long-term care facilities, got infected with vaccine virus varicella. One additional case had a mechanism other than direct transmission from a vaccine recipient, possibly exposure to vaccine aerosol during preparation of the vaccine for administration. There has not been any documented transmission of varicella from vaccinated healthcare personnel.
- Ideally, the vaccine should be given within 3 to 5 days after the person is exposed. This may prevent varicella or make it less severe.
- Even if it has been more than 5 days, the vaccine should still be offered. This will provide protection against varicella if a person is exposed again in the future and the previous exposure did not result in infection.

Summary of COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Trial Data

At the time of this writing, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the emergency use of two vaccines for COVID-19, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna two-dose vaccines. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has an efficacy of 95%, measured from 7 days after the second dose. Moderna's vaccine has demonstrated similar efficacy and is reported to be approximately 94%, measured from 14 days following the second dose. While the efficacy and safety of these vaccines is well described for healthy patients, there are certain patient populations that may be hesitant to receive the vaccine based on their other medical comorbidities. One such patient population is those who are chronic pain patients routinely receiving steroid injections or prescribed immunosuppressant medications, making the timeline of when they should receive the COVID-19 vaccine unclear.

When considering the Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial data, the manufacturer excluded patients based upon the following: anticipated needs for immunosuppressive treatment within 6 months of starting the trial, immunocompromised individuals with known or suspected immunodeficiencies, individuals with a history of autoimmune disease or active autoimmune disease, and individuals who receive treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents or systemic corticosteroids (eg, for cancer or an autoimmune disease, and/or utilize inhaled/nebulized corticosteroids). While these trials excluded those utilizing systemic corticosteroids, there was no discussion of the need to exclude patients receiving more targeted steroid therapy on an elective basis. Rather, exclusion criteria emphasized the need to exclude only those who were severely immunocompromised. As for Moderna's exclusion criteria, those patients in an immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state, including HIV, asplenia and recurrent severe infections, as well as those who received systemic immunosuppressant or immune-modifying drugs for > 14 days within 6 months prior to screening (for corticosteroids ≥ 20 milligram (mg)/day of prednisone equivalent), were all excluded from the clinical trial data. These considerations are important in determining the best recommendations and practices.

The evidence base for the 3-month period is poor, and while drug blood levels will be minimal by this time, it is unclear whether alterations to white cell populations may have more persistent subtle effects on immunity. The USA Centre for Disease Prevention and Control states in their IDSA guidelines that zoster live vaccination can be considered for patients aged 60 or over while on treatment with low-level immunosuppression (defined as prednisolone doses < 20 mg, methotrexate weekly dose ≤ 0.4 mg/kg, azathioprine ≤ 3 mg/kg/day or mercaptopurine ≤ 1.5 mg/kg/day). In the UK the age recommendation for zoster vaccine is at age 70 or up to the age of 79 if not given at age 70, and the Green Book also advises that shingles vaccination may be administered to those on low-level immunosuppression (defined as ≤ 20 mg prednisolone/day for > 14 days, either alone or in combination with low-dose non-biological oral immunomodulators (methotrexate ≤ 25 mg/week, azathioprine ≤ 3 mg/kg/day or mercaptopurine ≤ 1.5 mg/kg/day)).

The UK Department of Health Green Book vaccination guide Chapter 6also suggests that all live vaccines can be considered for those on low-dose immunosuppression as defined above, including low-dose immunosuppressive drugs in combination with prednisolone up to 20 mg. There is evidence from a small controlled study that the use of zoster vaccine in IBD patients on low-level immunosuppression does not result in adverse effects, although antibody titres were somewhat lower than those in vaccinated IBD patients not taking immunosuppressive drugs. Live vaccination must not be given to those taking biologics, and should only be undertaken for those on low-level immunosuppression after careful consideration of the risks and benefits in conjunction with the patient.

The Green Book advises that live vaccination should be delayed until 6 months of age in children exposed in utero to biologics.

Immunosuppressive Medications and Impact on COVID-19 Outcomes in Patients With IMIDs

The immunosuppressive medications taken by patients with IMIDs, rather than the disease itself, may be the primary contributor to poor outcomes following COVID-19 in this population. Specifically, in a retrospective matched cohort study of US veterans with RA between January 1 and December 10, 2020 (before availability of COVID-19 vaccination), those who received treatment with glucocorticoids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) had the highest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19–related hospitalization or death. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 66% higher (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.36–2.03) and the risk of COVID-19–related hospitalization or death was 112% higher (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.48–3.03) among veterans with RA who were treated with prednisone and biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs relative to individuals without RA. The increased risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with IMIDs has been linked to certain immunosuppressive therapies, such as rituximab, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and glucocorticoids.

Patients with IMIDs are concerned about flares of their underlying disease after acute COVID-19. However, in certain cases the IMID flaring may be caused by immunosuppressive medication disruption rather than by COVID-19 itself. A prospective study in the United States examined 174 patients with IMIDs who survived COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and November 3, 2021 (a minority [9%] of patients were vaccinated before infection), and found that 41% experienced an IMID flare after COVID-19. The time between COVID-19 and the IMID flare was < 1 week in 20%, between 1 and 4 weeks in 44%, and between 4 and 12 weeks in 27% of patients. Medication disruption at COVID-19 onset likely contributed to the IMID flaring observed in this study; among patients who were prescribed DMARDs, 51% reported changes to their use at COVID-19 onset, including temporarily stopping, lengthening the dosing interval, decreasing the dose, and starting a new DMARD.

Live vaccine contraindications during and after immunosuppression — dose thresholds: Once immunosuppressive therapies are started, live vaccines are generally contraindicated. In the US, live vaccines are contraindicated during primary immunosuppression including patients receiving an anti-TNFα agent at any dosage or other biologic agent (eg, rituximab), corticosteroid therapy at high dose of ≥ 20 mg (or in patients weighing < 10 kg, ≥ 2 mg/kg/day), methotrexate (> 0.4 mg/kg/wk), azathioprine (> 3 mg/kg/day), or 6-mercaptopurine (> 1.5 mg/kg/day). For similar safety and efficacy reasons, live attenuated vaccines should not be given after discontinuation of high-level immunosuppression, unless 3 months have passed since last dose.

### Contraindications and precautions | Vaccines&immunizations… [^116tgoWt]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Severely immunocompromised persons generally should not receive live vaccines. Because of the theoretical risk to the fetus, women known to be pregnant generally should not receive live, attenuated virus vaccines. Persons who experienced encephalopathy within 7 days after administration of a previous dose of pertussis-containing vaccine not attributable to another identifiable cause should not receive additional doses of a vaccine that contains pertussis. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency disease and a history of intussusception are both contraindications to the receipt of rotavirus vaccines. Only persons with laboratory confirmation of immunity according to strict guidance at Laboratory Testing Requirements for Vaccination with Dengvaxia Dengue Vaccine should receive dengue vaccination. Substantially immunosuppressive steroid dose is considered to be ≥ 2 weeks of daily receipt of 20 mg or 2 mg/kg body weight of prednisone or equivalent.

LAIV should not be administered to persons who have taken influenza antiviral medications within the previous 48 hours. Persons who care for severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protective environment should not receive LAIV, or should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after receipt. These values are based on the clearance of the particular antiviral. LAIV4 should not be administered to persons who have taken oseltamivir or zanamivir within the previous 48 hours, peramivir within the previous 5 days, or baloxavir within the previous 17 days. This "contraindication" is due to concern with reduced effectiveness of the vaccine. MMR and varicella-containing vaccines can be administered on the same day. If not administered on the same day, these vaccines should be separated by at least 28 days.

No adverse events associated with the use of aspirin or aspirin-containing products after varicella vaccination have been reported; however, the vaccine manufacturer recommends that vaccine recipients avoid using aspirin or aspirin-containing products for 6 weeks after receiving varicella vaccines because of the association between aspirin use and Reye syndrome after varicella. Vaccination with subsequent close monitoring should be considered for children who have rheumatoid arthritis or other conditions requiring therapeutic aspirin. The risk for serious complications associated with aspirin is likely to be greater in children in whom natural varicella develops than it is in children who receive the vaccine containing attenuated VZV. No association has been documented between Reye syndrome and analgesics or antipyretics that do not contain aspirin".

### Should we vaccinate during an active rheumatic disease? [^116hcQkL]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Timing of vaccination and its relationship with concomitant immunosuppressive therapy has been a matter of debate in the field of AutoImmune Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases (AIIRD). Vaccination is crucial in the prevention of infections, which, in the setting of AIIRD, are known risk factors for disease flare and expose patients to increase risk of complications and mortality. As evidenced from real-life studies, vaccines do not significantly affect disease activity. Conversely, disease activity (especially in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) may predict for vaccine response: high disease activity correlates with decreased seroconversion. For this reason, according to the EULAR 2019 recommendation, vaccination should preferably be administered during quiescent AIIRD. Beside disease activity, background immunosuppressive therapy should be considered when performing vaccination, as different Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) decrease vaccine immunogenicity. AIIRD patients should be vaccinated, independently from the vaccine type, before starting immunosuppression. If the patient is on active immunosuppressive therapy, the best window of opportunity to boost vaccine response is during AIIRD quiescence, as low disease activity increases seroconversion and allows safe immunosuppressant spacing. In conclusion, the majority of AIIRD patients should receive vaccination, preferably during quiescent disease and taking into consideration immunosuppressant spacing.

### Infection risk and safety of corticosteroid use [^112mvgQf]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Their use comes with several well-established risks, including osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, glaucoma, and diabetes. The risk of infection is of utmost concern and is well documented, although randomized controlled trials of short-term and lower-dose steroids have generally shown little or no increased risk. Observational studies from the real world, however, have consistently shown dose-dependent increases in risk for serious infections as well as certain opportunistic infections. In patients who begin chronic steroid therapy, vaccination and screening strategies should be used in an attempt to mitigate this risk.

### Real-world evidence of the use of glucocorticoids for severe COVID-19 [^114Zsxns]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The call from most experts and medical societies has been for a 'judicious and dynamic' use of steroids for COVID-19. Siddiqi and Mehrareflected on the need to use the treatments differentially in native and immunosuppressed states, while the Endocrine Societies have issued special recommendations for patients with adrenal insufficiency and previous glucocorticoid use during the time of COVID-19. These results support that rationale.

Our study has some limitations. First, because of the retrospective design, data were obtained from clinical records. Second, other variables, such as oxygen saturation and non-intensive care unit (ICU) intubated patient care, may have contributed to a higher mortality. However, this clinical scenario still occurs around the world because healthcare is overstretched with the new COVID variants, which have been affecting even fully vaccinated people. Third, specific biomarkers such as interleukins and cytokines are not available in our center, something that may help provide a differential profile among these patients, because all of them fulfill criteria for 'severe inflammation' but a clear-cut 'cytokine storm' could not be diagnosed. Finally, we do not have information relating long-term outcomes after steroid use. However, the patients who received high doses of steroid according to the criteria considered for this study are routinely discharged with an oral steroid, with a subsequent reduction and withdrawal in 6 weeks unless a contraindication for their use is detected. The patients with previous steroid use (for rheumatic or chronic inflammatory conditions) are tapered to their previous baseline dose and referred to their specialists for further indications.

The main strength of this work is that is a real-life study in a third-level hospital that was adapted to treat severe COVID-19 patients. This reflects the freely prescribed treatment issued by specialized frontline physicians, according to their usual clinical practice and the scientific information available at that time. Also, we reported a relevant clinical and biochemical profile on these patients, common to several developing countries, in comparison with other clinical trials that studied steroids in COVID-19.

### Safety and immunogenicity of yellow fever 17D vaccine in adults receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy: an observational cohort study [^117MgWFC]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the safety and immunogenicity of live attenuated yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine in adults receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy.

Methods

All adult travelers on systemic corticosteroid therapy who had received the YF17D vaccine in 24 French vaccination centers were prospectively enrolled and matched with healthy controls (1:2) on age and history of YF17D immunization. Safety was assessed in a self-administered standardized questionnaire within 10 days after immunization. YF-specific neutralizing antibody titers were measured 6 months after vaccination in patients receiving corticosteroids.

Results

Between July 2008 and February 2011, 102 vaccine recipients completed the safety study (34 receiving corticosteroids and 68 controls). The median age was 54.9 years (interquartile range [IQR] 45.1–60.3 years) and 45 participants had a history of previous YF17D immunization. The median time receiving corticosteroid therapy was 10 months (IQR 1–67 months) and the prednisone or equivalent dosage was 7 mg/day (IQR 5–20). Main indications were autoimmune diseases (n = 14), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 9), and upper respiratory tract infections (n = 8). No serious adverse event was reported; however, patients receiving corticosteroids reported more frequent moderate/severe local reactions than controls (12% and 2%, respectively; relative risk 8.0, 95% confidence interval 1.4–45.9). All subjects receiving corticosteroids who were tested (n = 20) had neutralizing antibody titers > 10 after vaccination.

Conclusion

After YF17D immunization, moderate/severe local reactions may be more frequent in patients receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy. Immunogenicity seems satisfactory. Large-scale studies are needed to confirm these results.

Impact of antirheumatic therapy on vaccine response

Table 2 below summarizes a review of the literature on the impact of anti-rheumatic therapy on vaccine response. Further discussion is under the relevant headings.

Table 2
Summary of the evidence for the effect of common DMARDs/biologic therapies on vaccine response

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids affect vaccine efficacy in a dose-dependent manner. Several studies have assessed the impact of corticosteroid therapy on humoral response to the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. Doses > 10 mg prednisolone daily were associated with a degree of impaired humoral immunity in a longitudinal study; however, lower doses had little impact. Steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisolone were associated with poorer outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

csDMARDs

Other than MTX, there is limited evidence for significant impairment of humoral vaccine responses to other conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine and leflunomide may reduce vaccine antibody titres but have not been shown to inhibit a seroprotective response to the pneumococcal or influenza vaccines.

Much of the trial data on mycophenolate is from organ transplant patients. These trials did not assess responses where mycophenolate was withheld, due to the high risk of graft rejection. Mycophenolate was shown to reduce antibody titres but not below the threshold for seroprotection.

MTX has been shown to impair humoral response to the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. This is unsurprising given its ability (and use) to reduce antibody formation to monoclonal antibodies. Withholding MTX around the time of vaccination has been assessed for 4 weeks before influenza vaccination, 2 weeks either side of vaccination and 4 weeks post-vaccination. Holding MTX for 4 weeks after immunization substantially improved vaccine titres. A subsequent study suggested that the critical period for vaccine-induced humoral immunity was the 2-week period following vaccination. Longer periods of withholding MTX were not shown to confer better vaccine responses but were associated with an increased incidence of disease flare. It appears MTX has the same impact on vaccination when used in combination with other DMARDs. The same risk–benefit assessment is required for a decision on temporary withholding.

Special consideration should be made regarding the Varicella vaccine; if parents cannot recall a history of natural infection, Varicella vaccine should be administered, and if the patient and/or parents are unsure, Varicella antibody titers should be checked. If patients do not have a history of Varicella infection or Varicella immunization, they should be vaccinated before starting immunosuppressive therapy, and it is recommended that patients wait at least 1 month after discontinuing corticosteroids before immunization with Varicella vaccine. Patients should also be tested for latent hepatitis B or seronegativity (hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAb] negative) because treatment with anti-TNF agents has been reported to result in HBV reactivation.

### Leveraging near-real-time patient and population data to incorporate fluctuating risk of severe COVID-19: development and prospective validation of a personalised risk prediction tool [^112azVKu]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient-level predictors and potential risk factors

Candidate predictors of severe disease were based on published literature and included age, sex, race, ethnicity, region, vaccine type, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, body mass index, receipt of at least one additional vaccine dose (booster), treatment with immune-suppressive drugs (chemotherapy, cytokine blockers, glucocorticoids, leukocyte inhibitors, and/or lymphocyte depleting drugs) before infection, and 30 separate comorbidities defined per the Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW). See sTable 1 for definitions of all data elements.

Immune suppressive medication variables were defined based on documented administrations (intravenous medications) and/or dispenses (oral medications) during a pre-specified window period at the time of the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Thus, presence of the exposure for estimating risk of severe disease could vary longitudinally at the level of the individual patient. For example, if a patient received corticosteroids for a one-month period, their elevation in risk would last for the duration of receipt of the medication plus an additional 30 days. If they were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 during this window period, they would be considered to be exposed. After the end of the 30-day window, if the medication were discontinued, the patient would be considered unexposed to corticosteroids. Duration of the impact of the immune suppressive medication varied by drug and ranged from one month prior to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (glucocorticoids) to 18 months (lymphocyte-depleting medications, e.g. rituximab). Immune suppression from chemotherapy was estimated to last six months. All definitions are identical to those previously published except that comorbidities were ascertained using a 1-year period prior to the date of the breakthrough infection.

### Methotrexate in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: advice and recommendations from the MARAJIA expert consensus meeting [^113n4bfc]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In a prospective study, safety and immunogenicity of the VZV vaccine among 25 patients with pediatric rheumatic diseases treated with MTX and corticosteroids were compared to 18 healthy children. The vaccine proved to be safe in MTX treated patients, and no severe treatment-related adverse effects were observed during the one year follow up period. Both patients and controls had a low seroconversion rate one year after vaccination. However, a recent study showed a low seroconversion rate in susceptible healthy children after one dose of vaccine, and indeed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines advocate the use of 2 doses. In clinical practice, a booster dose of VZV vaccine is normally administered to patients who fail to exhibit an immunological response after the first dose.

Kiray et al. demonstrated that there is no effect of MTX on purified protein derivative (PPD) induration size several years after BCG vaccination. The PPD positivity rate was similar in MTX users and nonusers, even if the response to PPD was significantly lower in BCG-vaccinated children with JIA compared to healthy children. However, because of the lack of safety data, BCG vaccinations should not be administered to patients on immunosuppressive drugs (including MTX) or biologicals.

According to available data, no detrimental effect of MTX on the short-term immunogenicity or on the persistence of antibodies over time and no relevant increase in vaccine-associated adverse events were found in patients treated with MTX. Non-live vaccines are generally adequately immunogenic and safe. It appears that live-attenuated vaccines can be safely and effectively administered to patients with JIA on MTX, unless they are also on additional immunosuppressive drugs or biologicals. In these cases, evidence on safety is scarce. Live-attenuated booster vaccinations can be considered on an individual basis, although the data do not currently support the formulation of a specific recommendation for live-attenuated vaccines. There is no evidence in pediatric patients about the safe time intervals for the administration of live vaccines after cessation of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory drugs such as MTX.

### COVID-19 vaccination and antirheumatic therapy [^112esBNv]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination will be the largest vaccination programme in the history of the NHS. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy will be among the earliest to be vaccinated. Some evidence indicates immunosuppressive therapy inhibits humoral response to the influenza, pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. The degree to which this will translate to impaired COVID-19 vaccine responses is unclear. Other evidence suggests withholding MTX for 2 weeks post-vaccination may improve responses. Rituximab has been shown to impair humoral responses for 6months or longer post-administration. Decisions on withholding or interrupting immunosuppressive therapy around COVID-19 vaccination will need to be made prior to the availability of data on specific COVID-19 vaccine response in these patients. With this in mind, this article outlines the existing data on the effect of antirheumatic therapy on vaccine responses in patients with inflammatory arthritis and formulates a possible pragmatic management strategy for COVID-19 vaccination.

Immunosuppressive Therapy Affects Responses to Vaccination, Regardless of the Underlying Diagnosis

Evidence has also shown that the immunosuppressive therapies these individuals may be receiving are important contributors to the variable immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination. For example, regardless of underlying diagnosis, the risk for infection and hospitalization with COVID-19 in vaccinated individuals was increased when taking immunosuppressants. Moreover, individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapies had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with immunocompetent individuals irrespective of vaccination status (fully vaccinated, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.17 [95% CI, 1.69–2.79]; unvaccinated, aHR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.07–1.83]). Among fully vaccinated groups, the risk of hospitalization with COVID-19 was higher for those receiving immunosuppressants than those who did not (aHR, 4.86 [95% CI, 2.24–10.56]).

The type of immunosuppressive therapy received can also greatly affect immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines. Known predictors of lower responses include the use of B-cell–depleting therapies; treatment with antimetabolites, abatacept, or Janus kinase inhibitors; and the long-term use of glucocorticoids at high doses. The impact of other therapies is less clear, but anti–tumor necrosis factor therapies, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate can also lead to lower seroconversion rates and lower SARS-CoV-2 anti–receptor-binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers. B-cell–depleting therapies, in particular, can pose a major challenge for COVID-19 vaccination, as a reduction in peripheral B lymphocytes is associated with failure to seroconvert. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 B-cell–depleting therapy, has a known history of impairing immunogenicity of vaccines and has also been shown to diminish immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines. In a prospective cohort study, only 19 of 87 individuals (21.8%) with rheumatoid arthritis receiving rituximab compared with 1096 of 1114 immunocompetent individuals (98.4%) had a serological response to SARS-CoV-2 RBD following 2 doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (P < .0001). Importantly, although B-cell–depleting therapies can be problematic for vaccination, additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines can increase both humoral and cellular responses, as described in the next section.

Treatment

The patient received 60 mg of oral prednisolone following the results of the biopsy. After 28 days, prednisolone was weaned down and eventually stopped 4 months postdiagnosis. The patient was given patient education on her condition prior to discharge. She was advised to monitor her blood sugars closely due to the side effects of glucocorticoids.

The patient's renal function had continued to improve despite weaning off steroids, coupled with the fact that she had also not been started on any steroid-sparing agents suggesting that seronegative autoimmune diseases were unlikely.

Efficacy of Vaccination in the Setting of Systemic Steroid Use

The primary concern regarding COVID-19 vaccines in the setting of steroid use is efficacy given the immunosuppressive hallmarks of corticosteroids. These include direct effects on critical components of vaccine-based immunity, such as antigen presentation, T/B cell function and antibody generation. Almost 50 years ago, some of the first observations of steroids on the adaptive B cell responses, the primary mechanism of vaccine protection, were described by Dr. Anthony Fauci and colleagues. These included transient declines in lymphocyte populations with supraphysiologic dosing, lymphocytic apoptosis, predominantly T cell, and altered immunoglobulin secretion, and either suppression or stimulation. There exists considerable evidence in animal models that corticosteroids can influence both B cell development and function once in the periphery, although the implications of such on vaccine responses are not clear.

While our understanding of how steroids affect T and B cells continues to evolve, there are currently more data on functional vaccine outcomes in the setting of chronic steroid use. Decreased serologic responsiveness and disease protection have been demonstrated in pneumococcal vaccines at doses of 20 mg of prednisone or greater per day. There has also been evidence of delayed responsiveness to Hepatitis B vaccinationin children on high dose steroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome and in influenza vaccination among cancer patients on systemic steroids. While these findings suggest that chronic high dose steroids may impair vaccine-based immunity, the effect on efficacy in these studies was small. Further, short-term systemic bolus steroids have not been demonstrated to impact vaccine responsiveness. This has been the case for tetanusand influenza. Further, inhaled steroids do not appear to affect serologic responsiveness to Hepatitis B vaccination.

Follow up before and during treatment

Patients under conventional or budesonide/azathioprine schedules should be followed with baseline and weekly tests for transaminases, albumin, prothrombin time, fasting glucose and full blood count during the first month. In patients under prednisolone/MMF, the above data could be obtained at 2–3–month intervals, along with IgG determination. After corticosteroid tapering, monitoring intervals can be every 3 months and every 3–6 months during maintenance therapy.

STATEMENT 10

Only a very small proportion of patients stay in remission without maintenance therapy with the conventional treatment regimens (II-2)

RECOMMENDATIONS 37–38

In AIH patients who have been in persistent complete biochemical remission for at least the last 2 years of immunosuppression, a liver biopsy should be recommended before treatment discontinuation (II-2)
The decision about treatment withdrawal should be based on direct collaboration between patients and doctors (II-2)

Baseline hepatitis B (HBV) and A serology is recommended before treatment, along with the respective vaccination for those not indicating previous vaccination or virus exposure. For HBV surface antigen-positive (HBsAg) patients, preemptive therapy with either entecavir or tenofovir is strongly recommended according to the EASL and the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP) CPG. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, along with yearly influenza vaccination, should also be given to all patients.

Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning assessment before treatment initiation and at 1-5-years intervals seems rational, but there are no specific data to support this assertion. Likewise, though no specific data exist concerning the use of calcium and vitamin D in patients under immunosuppression, such treatment seems reasonable, as in other diseases under corticosteroids.

Specific conditions and difficult-to-treat patients

Non-responders

Non-response includes a partial or incomplete response and treatment failure (null response), associated or not with an acute/severe form of the disease.

Inflammatory bowel disease — influenza and other seasonal vaccinations (Best Practice Advice 8) advises that all adult patients with IBD should receive an annual inactivated influenza vaccine; patients receiving anti-TNF monotherapy or who have undergone a solid organ transplant recipients can benefit from an HD influenza vaccine; adults 65 years of age and older should receive an HD, recombinant, or adjuvanted influenza vaccine; and live attenuated intranasal vaccines should be avoided. In addition, annual seasonal vaccinations such as influenza or COVID-19 boosters should be offered to patients regardless of their treatment regimen, even if they are receiving high doses (HDs) of corticosteroids, and vaccines should be provided irrespective of the biologic dosing schedule.

Autologous and allogeneic transplantation

Antibodies for various pathogens including pneumococci, haemophilus, and measles are significantly reduced after autologous and more so after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Transplanted patients have a higher risk for virus reactivation and develop a more severe course of viral infections. These and other findings prompted the IDSA to consider recipients of allotransplantation as never vaccinated, highlighting the need for a full vaccination program. Several recommendations have been published by international and national societies for patients after stem cell transplantation. The NCCN ® Guidelines for patients after autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation are shown in Table 3. Patients should be vaccinated with vaccines administered during early childhood, and pneumococci, haemophilus influenzae and meningococci, influenza and recombinant VZV vaccine. Due to the poor immune response after allogeneic transplantation, vaccination should be repeated in short intervals (4-week intervals) for most pathogens. The CDC recommends vaccination with MMR in patients 24 months after allogeneic transplantation and without signs of graft versus host disease. There is some inconsistency regarding the appropriate timing of the vaccinations. As patients are prone to increased infection risk shortly after transplantation, some experts recommend to administer seasonal influenza vaccine already a few months after ASCT. A second vaccination should be considered to increase antibody response. Timing vaccination relatively early after transplantation is supported by data showing comparable response rates to PCV vaccination in patients who were vaccinated 3 or 9 months after the transplant. Hence, there are relevant arguments for starting some vaccinations, like influenza and PCV13, already about 3 months after autologous transplantation, but it should be kept in mind that official organizations take a more conservative approach favoring a longer interval between autologous transplantation and vaccination as shown in Table 3.

### Pneumococcal vaccination in autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^116CrK47]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

These recommendations can now be summarised and applied as the currently licensed PCV-13 vaccine has been available for immunocompromised patients and appropriate advice for sequential vaccination with PPV-23 has been developed. Both types of pneumococcal vaccines (PPV and PCV) are inactivated vaccines, so there is no risk of bacterial reactivation after vaccination. Before administration of the pneumococcal vaccine to a patient with AIRD, one should determine the optimal timing of vaccination, the type of vaccine (PCV-13, PPV-23) to be used and the strategy of vaccination (eg, sequential application).

In 2011, EULAR developed the first evidence-based recommendations for vaccination in patients with AIRD. The committee included experts representing 11 European countries. In 2014, the IDSA published the special vaccine recommendations for immunocompromised patients. In the recommendation, the definitions of high-level versus low-level immunosuppression were established (table 3). High-level immunosuppression includes more than 20 mg daily use of corticosteroids for more than 14 days; more than 3.0 mg/kg daily use of azathioprine; more than 0.4 mg/kg weekly use of MTX; more than 1.5 mg/kg daily use of 6-mercaptopurine and any dose of TNF-α inhibitors and rituximab. These categories may determine the protocol of vaccination; however, vaccination is always recommended in these patients. ACIP recommended to administer pneumococcal vaccinations to adults with planned initiation of immunosuppressive therapy or in the status of low-level immunosuppression.

Vaccination (2017)

The use of live vaccines is discouraged during immunosuppressive therapy (Table 3). 24 Exceptions can be made in specific circumstances (e.g. for mumps, measles, rubella and varicella in specific cases), in consultation with a vaccine specialist. In patients with immunosuppressive therapy, it is recommended that (live) vaccines, except for the yearly influenza vaccine, be given in consultation with a specialist in the field of vaccinations/immunology/travel diseases; additional measures may be necessary (e.g. titre control in common vaccines, live vaccine measures). Vaccines should preferably be administered before starting immunosuppressants.

Table 3
Advice on duration between stopping immunosuppressant and administration of live vaccine in adult patients

It is advised to wait for at least 4 weeks after a live vaccine to (re)start immunosuppressive medication. 3, 24, 25, 26 Beware of live vaccinations in newborns of mothers treated with immunosuppressive therapy, as it might be necessary to postpone live vaccines.

Pregnancy (2017)

The time a woman should wait to conceive after stopping biological therapy depends on the half‐life of the drug.

Recommendations Our recommendations are summarized in Table 4. We suggest starting or continuing biological therapy in pregnant women and women planning a pregnancy only if the benefits outweigh the risks of treatment. In such cases there is a slight preference for etanercept given the short half‐life and the relatively low transplacental transfer to the fetus. It is recommended that biologics be stopped, especially the IgG immunoglobulins such as infliximab and adalimumab, before the end of the second trimester to minimize the risk of neonatal immunosuppression.

Table 4
Advice on contraception a

Pregnancy in a woman treated with a biologic requires a multidisciplinary approach, therefore counselling by a gynaecologist is recommended. It might be necessary to postpone administration of live vaccinations and bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccinations in neonates exposed to biologics in utero, especially in the third trimester. Pregnant patients treated with biologics should preferably be treated in an academic hospital. Data on pregnancy should preferably be kept in a registry.
