## Question

When do you start a patient on a statin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to start a patient on a statin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about stratifying secondary versus primary prevention. Then, I should verify age-based eligibility windows. Next, I will check diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia as statin benefit groups. After that, I need to calculate 10-year risk and consider risk enhancers. I should confirm contraindications and baseline labs, select statin intensity, engage in shared decision-making, and plan monitoring and escalation. Finally, I will examine special populations and safety considerations to ensure the approach is comprehensive and consistent with major guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the highest-yield fork in the road: if the patient is in secondary prevention with clinical ASCVD (prior MI, stroke/TIA, PAD, or prior coronary revascularization), I should not hesitate — initiate or continue high-intensity statin as early as possible unless contraindicated, and in ACS specifically, start immediately regardless of baseline LDL-C, because rapid initiation improves outcomes, then reassess for add-on therapy if needed [^1138QxsW] [^115iS1La].

> I need to verify age eligibility for primary prevention, because thresholds differ by guideline and affect certainty of benefit; for adults 40–75 years, both ACC/AHA 2018 and USPSTF 2022 find at least a moderate net benefit when risk is sufficiently high, whereas evidence becomes insufficient beyond age 75 in USPSTF statements, prompting individualized decisions, while ESC/EAS considers initiation up to 75 routinely and beyond 75 selectively based on risk, comorbidity, and frailty [^1153pqA3] [^115dRRXQ] [^111ZPERD] [^1146NCUt].

> Next, I should review the diabetes group because it often overrides risk scoring; for ages 40–75 with diabetes, at least moderate-intensity statin is indicated, with high-intensity considered when additional risk enhancers are present, and for type 1 diabetes, endocrine guidance supports statins if age is ≥ 40 years, duration > 20 years, or microvascular disease exists, including CKD stages 1–4, obesity, high TG, or low HDL [^1138QxsW] [^117C4aVr] [^111CtrVM] [^1139jq67] [^114Htzpm] [^1143Mdhd].

> Hold on, I should verify severe hypercholesterolemia criteria because they immediately shift intensity; adults with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL warrant high-intensity statin regardless of calculated risk, and in familial hypercholesterolemia with persistent severe LDL elevation, pediatric initiation is typically considered between ages 8–10 if thresholds remain high or there is a strong family history of premature ASCVD [^1138QxsW] [^115KdVGE].

> For all other primary prevention adults without diabetes or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, I will now examine formal 10-year ASCVD risk; ACC/AHA 2018 supports initiating statins in intermediate/high risk after patient-clinician discussion, while USPSTF recommends starting at ≥ 10% 10-year risk and selectively considering at 7.5–10%, and ESC/EAS uses SCORE2 thresholds with greater emphasis on absolute risk category and lifetime risk in younger patients [^1138QxsW] [^1153pqA3] [^111KfXap].

> But wait, I need to ensure I incorporate risk enhancers that lower the treatment threshold in borderline or intermediate-risk patients; family history of premature ASCVD, persistently elevated LDL-C 160–189 mg/dL, high TG, low HDL-C, metabolic syndrome, chronic inflammatory conditions, CKD, and CAC ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile can tip the balance toward initiation when the 10-year risk alone is borderline [^1138QxsW].

> Before prescribing, I should double-check contraindications and plan baseline labs; pregnancy and active liver disease are absolute contraindications, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors necessitate careful statin selection, while it is prudent to obtain a baseline lipid panel and ALT; wait, I initially thought I must get a baseline CK in everyone, but I should correct that — routine CK testing is not necessary unless there are predisposing factors or symptoms, and repeat LFTs or CK should be driven by clinical indications rather than routine schedules [^115MujGV] [^114Be4jV] [^1138QxsW].

> Now I will select intensity aligned with risk; high-intensity statins such as atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg are indicated for secondary prevention, LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or diabetes with additional risk, while moderate intensity fits lower-risk diabetes or borderline risk primary prevention, and I should start lower and titrate in older adults with renal impairment or polypharmacy to minimize interactions and adverse effects while still targeting adequate LDL-C reduction [^115e1AQY] [^113rBLp6] [^1138QxsW].

> Next, I should review shared decision-making for borderline or intermediate risk; I need to clearly present absolute risk, expected absolute risk reduction, and potential adverse effects, acknowledging that USPSTF judges net benefit as moderate at ≥ 10% and small at 7.5–10%, and ACC/AHA emphasizes a clinician-patient discussion before initiation in primary prevention, especially when uncertainty or preferences weigh heavily [^115HRh7E] [^1138QxsW].

> For monitoring, let me think about timing and targets; check adherence and a fasting or nonfasting lipid panel about 8–12 weeks after starting or changing dose to confirm expected percentage LDL-C reduction, then every 3–12 months depending on risk and stability; hold on, I almost said we should not target LDL-C goals at all, which aligns with the 2013 US shift to intensity-based treatment, but I should correct and nuance this — ESC/EAS sets explicit LDL-C goals by risk category and the European post-ACS strategy uses both percentage reduction and absolute goals with stepwise addition of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors if thresholds are not met, while ACC/AHA 2018 allows nonstatin add-ons in very high-risk ASCVD when LDL-C remains above thresholds on maximally tolerated statins [^114r5oB3] [^115e1AQY] [^117GSdEj] [^117T55DC] [^1138QxsW].

> If the response is suboptimal or risk remains very high, I should confirm adherence and secondary causes, then intensify therapy; in very high-risk ASCVD or post-ACS, add ezetimibe if LDL-C remains above threshold on maximal statin and consider early addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor if still not at the European goal or US threshold, balancing cost, access, and expected absolute risk reduction [^1138QxsW] [^117T55DC].

> Special populations need tailored attention; in ACS, initiate high-intensity statin immediately on presentation irrespective of LDL-C and recheck lipids in 4–6 weeks to drive add-on therapy decisions, in hypertriglyceridemia > 200 mg/dL with high overall risk, statins remain first-line, and in older adults > 75 years or those with significant frailty, I should individualize and start low with careful titration; for statin intolerance, pause, evaluate, rechallenge at lower or alternate dosing, switch agents, or consider intermittently dosed long half-life statins before moving to nonstatin combinations [^115iS1La] [^112Z18YD] [^1146NCUt] [^113Apwef] [^111Rja8b].

> I should confirm the safety signal profile to counsel accurately; large individual participant data show only a small excess of generally mild muscle symptoms, mostly confined to the first year and outweighed by substantial cardiovascular event reductions accumulating over subsequent years, which supports persistence with therapy when tolerated and careful evaluation of alternative causes when symptoms arise [^117ATCuN].

> Finally, I need to ensure implementation closes the gap between guidelines and practice; contemporary data show underuse of indicated statins and suboptimal intensification after major events, so adherence support, proactive follow-up, and system prompts to escalate when thresholds are not met can meaningfully improve outcomes across the risk continuum [^112uARWX] [^115e1AQY] [^111P7FJK].

Start a statin when a patient has **clinical ASCVD** [^1138QxsW] or **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL** [^115e1AQY]. For primary prevention, initiate in **adults 40–75 years** [^115HRh7E] with diabetes [^1138QxsW] or with ≥ 1 CVD risk factor and a **10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10%** [^1153pqA3]. Consider statins at **7.5–10%** risk [^111KfXap] after shared decision-making [^117DtuU5]. In **adults ≥ 76 years** [^115dRRXQ], use individualized assessment due to limited evidence [^113gLXTS]. For acute coronary syndromes [^115iS1La], start **high-intensity statins** as early as possible, regardless of baseline LDL-C [^117T55DC].

---

## Secondary prevention

Statin therapy is strongly recommended for patients with established ASCVD [^1138QxsW]; **clinical ASCVD** includes coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease. For **acute coronary syndromes (ACS)**, initiate high-intensity statin therapy as early as possible, regardless of baseline LDL-C [^115iS1La].

---

## Primary prevention

Statin therapy is recommended for **primary prevention** based on specific risk factors and calculated cardiovascular risk [^115HRh7E].

---

### LDL-C levels

**LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL** [^1138QxsW] warrants statin initiation regardless of other risk factors [^115e1AQY].

---

### Diabetes mellitus

**Adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes** [^1138QxsW] should initiate statin therapy regardless of calculated cardiovascular risk [^115e1AQY].

---

### Calculated cardiovascular risk

**Adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes** should initiate statin therapy if they have one or more cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking) and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% [^1153pqA3] [^114JwGPU]. For **intermediate risk (7.5–10%)**, consider statin therapy after shared decision-making that incorporates patient preferences and potential benefits [^111KfXap] [^117DtuU5].

---

## Special populations

---

### Elderly patients

Evidence is insufficient to support routine statin initiation in **adults aged ≥ 76 years** [^115dRRXQ]; decisions should be individualized based on patient preferences, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^113gLXTS].

---

### Patients with hypertriglyceridemia

In hypertriglyceridemia, **triglycerides > 200 mg/dL** [^112Z18YD] warrant statins as first-line therapy for high-risk patients to reduce cardiovascular risk [^1178237d].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Lipid levels**: Reassess 4–12 weeks [^1138QxsW] after initiation or dose adjustment, then every 3–12 months as needed [^114r5oB3].

- **Liver enzymes**: Obtain baseline hepatic transaminase levels [^114Be4jV] before initiating statin therapy.

- **Muscle symptoms**: Monitor for statin-associated muscle symptoms [^113Apwef] and adjust therapy if necessary [^117ATCuN].

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: Synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety Cholesterol Guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management, accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

- **Methods**: A panel of experts, free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts, was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy, compared with receiving statin therapy alone, in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce the lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into four risk categories. Those at intermediate risk require a focused clinician-patient discussion before the initiation of statin therapy.

### Shared decisions: A qualitative study on clinician and patient perspectives on statin therapy and statin-associated side effects [^117HGcEt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Clinicians and patients agreed that a decision support tool summarizing recent guidelines, being simple and algorithmic, and including resources and visuals to improve communication is needed.

A patient stated: "Because if you do see a picture like that, I know me, a lot of times a picture is worth a thousand words".

Another patient mentioned the utility of videos explaining risks and benefits of statin therapy:

"You know, with all the technology now and everything, in fact, your team could probably come up with something… post a video you can click on, you know, make it required if you're taking, or prescribed statins that it is a requirement that you watch this… that's very inexpensive and that's very easy, everybody's got a smartphone now, they can click on it and watch it for 5 minutes. Five minutes should be plenty, I mean if it is kind of laid out".

Clinicians expressed how a decision aid could facilitate their statin decision-making and adverse effect management. The clinical decision support tool should be simple and in the form of an algorithm or a decision tree that is colorful with few branches, circles, arrows, or boxes to minimize confusion. This decision aid should summarize recent guidelines on statin use, and include statin starting dosages, options for various statins, safety profiles, strategies to manage SASEs (e.g. nonstatin alternatives, ruling out secondary causes of SASEs, and statin titration), and strategies to rechallenge statin-intolerant patients.

### Lipid testing and statin dosing after acute myocardial infarction [^114vDKLP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statins for patients after myocardial infarction (MI) rather than treating to a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal, as the previous ATP III (Adult Treatment Panel third report) guidelines had advised.

- **Methods and results**: To evaluate the frequency of post-discharge lipid testing and high-intensity statin use among MI patients discharged on a statin during the ATP III guidelines era, we linked ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) Registry data to Medicare claims for 11,046 MI patients aged ≥ 65 years who were discharged alive on a statin from 347 hospitals (2007–2009). Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the association between lipid testing and 1-year high-intensity statin use. Only 21% of MI patients were discharged on a high-intensity statin. By 90 days after MI, 44% of patients discharged on a statin underwent lipid testing. Of these, 43% were on low- or moderate-intensity statins and 49% on high-intensity statins (P = 0.001). Follow-up lipid testing rates were 47% among patients with in-hospital low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dL and 47% among newly prescribed statin recipients. By 1 year, only 14% of patients were on high-intensity statins. Only 4% of patients discharged on low- or moderate-dose statin were uptitrated to high intensity. Post-discharge lipid testing was associated with a slightly higher likelihood of high-intensity statin use by 1 year (5.4% versus 2.9%, adjusted odds ratio: 1.92; 95% confidence interval).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend deciding on the choice of the appropriate statin and dose based on patient characteristics, level of ASCVD risk, and potential for adverse effects, in order to maximize the safety of statins. Offer moderate-intensity statin therapy in patients otherwise requiring high-intensity statin therapy in the presence of characteristics predisposing them to statin-associated adverse effects. Recognize that characteristics predisposing patients to statin adverse effects include, but are not limited to:

- **Multiple or serious comorbidities**: including impaired renal or hepatic function.
- **History of previous statin intolerance or muscle disorders**.
- **Unexplained ALT elevations**: ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).
- **Patient characteristics or concomitant use of drugs affecting statin metabolism**.
- **Age**: > 75 years.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111jo1uN]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically in the context of primary prevention and lipid-lowering therapy, the USPSTF 2022 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events and mortality in adults aged 76 years and older.

---

### Statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113puV6h]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines [^113Apwef]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for statin-induced myopathy, and specifically with respect to treatment modifications, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend managing muscle symptoms — including pain, tenderness, stiffness, cramping, weakness, or fatigue — in statin-treated patients according to the following strategy:

- **Severe symptoms**: Discontinue statins promptly in patients developing unexplained severe muscle symptoms or fatigue, and obtain an evaluation for rhabdomyolysis.

- **Resolving mild-to-moderate symptoms**:
	- Discontinue statins until the symptoms can be evaluated in patients developing mild-to-moderate muscle symptoms.
	- Resume the original or a lower dose of the same statin, if not contraindicated, to establish a causal relationship between muscle symptoms and statin therapy if mild-to-moderate symptoms resolve after statin discontinuation.
	- Discontinue the original statin if a causal relationship exists.
	- Switch to a low dose of a different statin once muscle symptoms resolve.
	- Increase the dose gradually as tolerated once the low-dose statin is tolerated.

- **Non-resolving mild-to-moderate symptoms**: Consider evaluating for other causes of muscle symptoms if muscle symptoms or elevated CK levels do not resolve completely after two months without statin treatment.

- **Non-statin causes**: Resume statin therapy at the original dose if persistent muscle symptoms are determined to arise from a condition unrelated to statin therapy or if the predisposing condition has been treated.

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1135PJdz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. National guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. The lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease.

On review of the literature, we conclude that data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112rA5Hz]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically in the context of primary prevention, lipid-lowering therapy is recommended. According to the USPSTF 2022 guidelines, statins should be initiated for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have one or more cardiovascular disease risk factors — such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking — and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 10% or greater.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend eliciting a history of prior or muscle symptoms to establish a baseline before initiating statin therapy.

### Adherence to blood cholesterol treatment guidelines among physicians managing patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^114EAtB1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The ACC/AHA blood cholesterol treatment guidelines recommend statin therapy for all patients after experiencing an acute cardiovascular event. Previous analyses have shown that physicians have been slow to adopt these guidelines, and many patients remain untreated or undertreated with statins following a cardiovascular event; however, reasons for this remain unknown. This analysis used electronic medical records and patient chart data from Reliant Medical Group in Worcester, Massachusetts, to evaluate physician adherence to the 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines when treating patients with evidence of acute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and to explore the reasons for the observed treatment decisions.

Less than 50% of acute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients were treated according to the ACC/AHA guidelines. Nearly 42% of patients not treated according to guidelines received a lower statin intensity than recommended. The most common reason cited by 41.8% of physicians for treating with a statin intensity below the recommended intensity was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol stable or at goal, despite ACC/AHA guidelines recommending specific statin intensities rather than specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

In conclusion, physician and patient education on the importance of maximizing lipid-lowering therapy in this high-risk patient population should be emphasized.

### Statins in acute coronary syndromes: Do the guideline recommendations match the evidence [^1171vKTk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

On the basis of the evidence obtained from observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and their meta-analyses, guidelines recommend initiating high-dose statin therapy pre-discharge regardless of the baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Careful review of the evidence indicates that early initiation of high-dose statin therapy reduces re-ischemia and may reduce revascularization but does not confer benefit in terms of hard clinical outcomes such as death or myocardial infarction in any of the randomized controlled trials. It may be associated with increased liver and muscle-related adverse outcomes leading to increased withdrawal and suboptimal long-term adherence. A mortality benefit is apparent in pooled analyses of randomized controlled trials only at long-term (24-month) but not short-term (4-month) follow-up.

The critical role of the timing of initiation of therapy (early vs. late) on the benefit-risk profile of statin treatment has not been systematically assessed. It is unclear whether the clinical benefits are attributable to lipid-lowering or lipid-lowering-independent effects. Finally, an optimal LDL threshold for initiating treatment or target LDL level for treatment in ACS remains yet to be defined. On the basis of these observations, and despite a compelling pathophysiologic rationale, the justification for Class I, Level of Evidence: A recommendation for statin therapy in patients with ACS remains open to question.

### Effect of individualizing starting doses of a statin according to baseline LDL-cholesterol levels on achieving cholesterol targets: The achieve cholesterol targets fast with atorvastatin stratified titration (ACTFAST) study [^115UtQ6Q]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate whether selecting the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels could help achieve cholesterol targets. Participants with LDL-C of 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) but ≤ 5.7 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) were assigned a starting dose of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/day) based on their LDL-C levels and statin use status at baseline, with a potential uptitration at 6 weeks if required. There was no washout period for the ST subjects.

By the study's end, 80% of SF subjects (82%, 82%, 83%, and 72% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg doses, respectively) and 59% of ST subjects (60%, 61%, and 51% for 20, 40, and 80 mg doses, respectively) reached the LDL-C target. In the ST group, an additional 21–41% reduction in LDL-C was observed over the baseline statin used. Atorvastatin was well tolerated.

This study confirms that individualizing the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target LDL-C values, considering the required LDL-C reduction, allows a large majority of high-risk subjects to achieve their target safely within 12 weeks, either with the initial dose or with a single titration.

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^115fKKmp]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

To assess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response in patients after initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a prospective cohort study was conducted. This study included 165,411 primary care patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Participants were free of CVD before statin initiation and had at least one pre-treatment LDL-C measurement within 12 months before, and one post-treatment LDL-C measurement within 24 months after, statin initiation. According to national guidelines, a less than 40% reduction in baseline LDL-C within 24 months was classified as a sub-optimal statin response. Cox proportional regression and competing-risks survival regression models were used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and sub-HRs for incident CVD outcomes based on LDL-C response to statins.

In the results, it was found that 84,609 (51.2%) patients had a sub-optimal LDL-C response to initiated statin therapy within 24 months. During 1,077,299 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up of 6.2 years), there were 22,798 CVD events (12,142 in sub-optimal responders and 10,656 in optimal responders). In sub-optimal responders, compared with optimal responders, the HR for incident CVD was 1.17 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.20) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.25) after adjusting for age and baseline untreated LDL-C. Considering competing risks resulted in lower but similar sub-HRs for both unadjusted (1.13, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.16) and adjusted (1.19, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.23) cumulative incidence function of CVD.

In conclusion, optimal lowering of LDL-C is not achieved within 2 years in over half of the patients in the general population.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro/con debate [^113tJw6v]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The other "big" safety issue is the increased rate of diabetes by an absolute risk of 0.5% (95% CI 0.1–1%, P = 0.012). However, outcomes for those who progressed from an HbA1c below to above the diagnostic threshold to define new onset diabetes were the same as those not developing new onset diabetes in the trials. We know that patients with established diabetes get even bigger risk reductions from statins in placebo-controlled trials. This is not a reason to be concerned over statins in "eligible for treatment" populations.

We are unlikely to quantify adverse events much further, as there is inevitable subjective weighting and interpretation of the data. This will always attract those who want to argue from one standpoint or another. There is probably too much sediment to ever clear now.

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^1162HYKj]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response in patients following the initiation of statin therapy and determine the future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort study was conducted involving 165,411 primary care patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. These individuals were free of CVD before the initiation of statin therapy and had at least one pre-treatment LDL-C measurement within 12 months prior, and one post-treatment LDL-C measurement within 24 months post initiation. According to national guidelines, a reduction of less than 40% from baseline LDL-C within 24 months was classified as a sub-optimal statin response. Cox proportional regression and competing-risks survival regression models were employed to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and sub-HRs for incident CVD outcomes in relation to LDL-C response to statins.

- **Results**: Of the patients studied, 84,609 (51.2%) exhibited a sub-optimal LDL-C response to initiated statin therapy within 24 months. During 1,077,299 person-years of follow-up, with a median follow-up of 6.2 years, there were 22,798 CVD events recorded — 12,142 in sub-optimal responders and 10,656 in optimal responders. Among sub-optimal responders, when compared to optimal responders, the HR for incident CVD was 1.17 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.20) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.25) after adjusting for age and baseline untreated LDL-C. Considering competing risks, the sub-HRs for cumulative incidence function of CVD were slightly lower but similar: unadjusted sub-HR was 1.13 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.16), and adjusted sub-HR was 1.19 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.23).

- **Conclusions**: Optimal lowering of LDL-C is not achieved within two years in over half of the patients in the general population initiating statin therapy.

### Safety and efficacy of statin therapy [^116NaGWq]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on blood cholesterol management marked a significant shift in identifying the main patient groups that could benefit from statin therapy, emphasizing the need for higher-intensity statin therapies. In 2016, an expert consensus panel from the ACC recommended incorporating nonstatin therapies, such as ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors, alongside maximally tolerated statin therapy for individuals whose LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remained above specific thresholds after statin treatment. Given the substantial benefits of statin therapies in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, concerns have emerged regarding their long-term safety.

Potential harmful effects of statin therapy on muscle and liver have been known for some time; however, new concerns have arisen about the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment, and hemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of statins, as well as the risks of achieving very low levels of LDL cholesterol. Increased media attention on the adverse events associated with statins has unfortunately led to the discontinuation of statin therapy, nonadherence to therapy, or concerns about initiating statin therapy.

In this review, we explore the safety of statin therapy in light of the latest evidence and provide clinicians with reassurance about the safety of statins. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh any real or perceived risks.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114QX3as]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD, is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011), and in light of new data, an update of this review is required.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

- **Search methods**: To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4, 2011), and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with a minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months in adults, with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL), or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD, and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD, and stroke events).

### A point-by-point response to recent arguments against the use of statins in primary prevention: This statement is endorsed by the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112yqeQY]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, a debate over the merits of statin therapy in primary prevention was published in the Wall Street Journal. The statin opponent claimed that statins should only be used in secondary prevention and never in any primary-prevention patients at risk for cardiovascular events. In this evidence-based rebuttal to those claims, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention. Cardiovascular risk is a continuum in which those at an elevated risk of events stand to benefit from early initiation of therapy. Statins should not be reserved until following a patient suffers the catastrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the assertions of the statin opponent, this principle has been demonstrated through reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and mortality in numerous randomized controlled primary-prevention statin trials.

Furthermore, data show that once a patient tolerates the initial treatment period, the few side effects that subsequently emerge are largely reversible. Accordingly, every major guidelines committee endorses statin use in secondary prevention and selectively in primary prevention for those with risk factors. The foundation for prevention remains increased physical activity, better dietary habits, and smoking cessation. However, prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease does not have to be all or none — all statin or all lifestyle. In selected at-risk individuals, the combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes is more effective than either alone.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^114r5oB3]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on the best approach to monitor lipid profiles in patients before and during treatment. Generally, lipids should be assessed at least twice before starting drug therapy, and then repeated 8–12 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment. For individuals being treated for secondary prevention of ASCVD or higher-risk primary prevention with LDL-C below treatment intensification thresholds, monitoring annually is reasonable. For low-risk primary ASCVD prevention individuals with LDL-C levels below treatment intensification thresholds, less frequent monitoring (i.e. every 5 years) may be appropriate.

- **Biochemical monitoring**: For adverse effects of statins, we advocate that ALT and creatine kinase (CK) should be measured before starting treatment to obtain a baseline as a point of reference should future concerns arise; however, routine monitoring is generally unnecessary. Several studies have concluded that the rates of statin-induced elevations of aminotransferase levels are rare and may not be significantly different than in the general population. Statins are not contraindicated in individuals with mild baseline elevation in transaminases (< 3× upper limit of normal [ULN]) or in those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and these individuals do not seem to be at increased risk for statin hepatotoxicity. Statins are, however, contraindicated in those with decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure.

### Present status of statin therapy [^113CCdo8]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are cardioprotective agents that reduce the adverse effects of increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. For significantly dyslipidemic individuals, who are at higher cardiovascular risk, combined statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk. This combination, along with lifestyle changes, may be an ideal approach for risk reduction. Decisions regarding the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention, where the absolute risk reduction is much less, are more complex. These decisions involve considering LDL-C levels and higher C-reactive protein levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, combined intense exercise and statin therapy substantially reduce the mortality risk, enhancing the potential for effective risk reduction.

### Uptake of statin guidelines to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease [^116Xz77D]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In December 2013, cholesterol treatment guidelines changed the approach to statin therapy by recommending fixed doses of low-, medium-, or high-intensity statins based on cardiovascular risk. We sought to evaluate the guideline's adoption in a diverse group of practices.

- **Methods**: Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed electronic health record data from the year before and two years following guideline publication in 45 practices across 8 states. We examined associations based on patient, clinician, and practice characteristics and interviewed 24 clinicians and practice leaders to inform findings.

- **Results**: The proportion of patients adherent to all recommendations two years after the guideline increased only from 18.5% to 20.3%. There were clinically insignificant increases in statin use across risk strata (1.7% to 3.5%) and small increases in high-intensity statin use (2.6% to 4.6%). Only half of patients with cardiovascular disease (52.9%) were on any statin, not much different from patients at moderate (49.6% to 50.9%) or low (41.6% to 48.7%) risk. Multiple patient (risk, use of health care), clinician (age), and practice (type, rurality) factors were associated with statin use. Clinicians reported patient resistance to statins but appreciated having a risk calculator to guide discussions.

- **Conclusion**: Despite general agreement on the benefit of statins, the guideline was poorly implemented. Marginal differences in statin use between the highest and lower risk strata of patients are concerning. Rather than intensifying statin potency and recommending more patient usage, the guideline's effectiveness remains limited.

### Primary prevention statins in older adults: Personalized care for a heterogeneous population [^115ijWzk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Low credibility.

The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of cholesterol acknowledge a lack of robust randomized clinical trial data to support routine use of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults older than 75 years. Shared decision-making is emphasized because potential recommendations should reflect limitations of the data, as well as heterogeneity of the older adult population, spanning the robust to the most frail.

Although the National Institute on Aging recently funded PRagmatic EValuation of EvENTs And Benefits of Lipid-Lowering in OldEr Adults (PREVENTABLE), a trial to study benefits of statins in very old adults, data are not anticipated for five years. Thus, interim guidance is essential. Furthermore, even when PREVENTABLE is completed, individual idiosyncrasies among older adults suggest that decisions for each patient will still need to be personalized, relative to their unique clinical situation.

In this article, we present three case studies to highlight dynamics that commonly impact choices regarding statins in older adults. Details underlying shared decision-making are also described, including the evolving application of coronary artery calcium to inform this practice.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^117ATCuN]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

In these trials, statin therapy caused approximately 11 additional reports of any muscle pain or weakness per 1,000 patients during the first year, but little excess thereafter, although there was some evidence that a risk persisted beyond the first year for more intensive regimens. This finding is in contrast with the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy, which are observed in year one but are then twice as high during each subsequent year that treatment continues, as previously reported (9% [99% CI 3–15%] in year one vs. 24% [95% CI 21–26%] in years one to ≥ five). Consequently, provided that statin therapy is taken for some years, the absolute reductions in major vascular events will greatly exceed any small excess of muscle symptoms that occur soon after treatment initiation.

For example, for every 1,000 people in whom LDL cholesterol is lowered by approximately 1 mmol/L for five years (an effect easily achievable in almost all patients with a moderate-intensity statin), statins might cause 11 (generally mild) episodes of muscle pain or weakness but prevent 50 major vascular events in those with pre-existing vascular disease (secondary prevention) and 25 major vascular events in those without pre-existing vascular disease (primary prevention). Moreover, a high-intensity regimen that can reduce LDL cholesterol by 50% would, on average, produce at least a 2 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in people with an LDL cholesterol of 4 mmol/L or more (which was the measured concentration in approximately a third of people not taking a statin in the UK Biobank).

### Individualized statin benefit for determining statin eligibility in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116sv9By]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease on the basis of predicted cardiovascular risk without directly considering the expected benefits of statin therapy based on the available randomized, controlled trial evidence.

- **Methods and results**: We included 2134 participants representing 71.8 million American residents potentially eligible for statins in primary prevention from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the years 2005 to 2010. We compared statin eligibilities using two separate approaches: a 10-year risk-based approach (≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) and an individualized benefit approach (i.e. based on predicted absolute risk reduction over 10 years [ARR10] ≥ 2.3% from randomized, controlled trial data). A risk-based approach led to the eligibility of 15.0 million (95% confidence interval, 12.7–17.3 million) Americans, whereas a benefit-based approach identified 24.6 million (95% confidence interval, 21.0–28.1 million). The corresponding numbers needed to treat over 10 years were 21 (range, 9–44) and 25 (range, 9–44). The benefit-based approach identified 9.5 million lower-risk (< 7.5% 10-year risk) Americans not currently eligible for statin treatment who had the same or greater expected benefit from statins (≥ 2.3% ARR10) compared with higher-risk individuals. This lower-risk/acceptable-benefit group includes younger individuals (mean age, 55.2 versus 62.5 years; P < 0.001 for benefit-based versus risk-based) with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (140 versus 133 mg/dL; P = 0.01).

### Heterogeneity in statin indications within the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [^114DriJC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

A standard ("core") implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2013 lipid guidelines, based on a 10-year risk, dramatically increases the statin-eligible population in older Americans, raising controversy in the cardiovascular community. The guidelines also endorse a more "comprehensive" risk approach based in part on lifetime risk; however, the impact of this broader approach on statin eligibility remains unclear. We studied the impact of two different implementations of the new guidelines ("core" and "comprehensive") using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Although the "core" guidelines led to 72.0 million subjects qualifying for statin therapy, the broader "comprehensive" application led to nearly a twofold greater estimate for statin-eligible subjects (121.2 million), with the greatest impact among those aged 21 to 45 years. Subjects indicated for statin therapy under comprehensive guidelines had a greater burden of cardiovascular risk factors and a higher lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease than those not indicated for statins. In particular, men aged 21 to 45 years had a 3.13-fold increased odds of being eligible for statin therapy only under the "comprehensive" guidelines (vs. standard "core" guidelines; 95% confidence interval 2.82 to 3.47, p < 0.0001). There were no racial differences.

In conclusion, the "comprehensive" approach to statin eligibility espoused by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2013 guidelines would increase the statin-eligible population to over 120 million Americans, particularly among younger adults.

### Cholesterol, not just cardiovascular risk, is important in deciding who should receive statin treatment [^114NHQMZ]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with statins, including the most recent, fail to make the best use of the evidence from clinical trials by concentrating on absolute CVD risk as a statin indication. They do not consider that a major determinant of therapeutic benefit is the magnitude of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (or non-HDL) cholesterol reduction achieved. This decrease is proportional to the pretreatment concentration. We set out to apply this knowledge to the calculation of the number needed to treat to prevent one event (NNT) and to assess critically how guidelines performed at different degrees of CVD risk across a range of LDL (or non-HDL) cholesterol concentrations.

- **Methods and results**: Number needed to treat to prevent one event revealed exclusion from treatment of some people with higher cholesterol levels, who may benefit more than others needlessly exposed to statins with no realistic prospect of benefit. Furthermore, abandonment of cholesterol therapeutic goals disadvantaged people with higher levels.

- **Conclusion**: These problems can be overcome by basing the decision to treat on the NNT calculated both from absolute CVD risk and also on the LDL (or non-HDL) cholesterol reduction achievable with statin treatment. This need not add an additional layer of complexity for the clinician, because computer programs already used to estimate CVD risk could be easily amended, thus permitting more effective deployment of statins in the population.

### A long-term benefit approach vs standard risk-based approaches for statin eligibility in primary prevention [^1175ya2m]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The importance of a 10-year benefit-based approach to statin therapy in primary prevention is notable as it includes younger individuals with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and prevents more cardiovascular events than a risk-based approach. However, a 10-year treatment duration likely underestimates the expected benefits of statins.

The objective of this study is to model the impact of a 30-year benefit approach to select individuals for statin therapy.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) data set included samples of the US population from the 2009–2010, 2011–2012, and 2013–2014 data collection cycles. Individuals between 40 to 60 years old who did not have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or LDL-C levels greater than 190 mg/dL and who were not taking statins were included. Data analysis took place from November 2017 to August 2018.

- **Exposures**: We calculated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 10-year and 30-year absolute risk reduction (ARR) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for each individual.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The number of individuals meeting eligibility for statins based on 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, 10-year ARR, or 30-year ARR.

- **Results**: A total of 1,688 individuals were included, representing 56.6 million US individuals. Statin eligibility based on 7.5% cardiovascular risk over 10 years was 9.5%; based on 2.3% for 10-year ARR, 13.0%; and based on 15% for 30-year ARR, 17.5%.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: Key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^117T55DC]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

**European perspectives**: In patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the guideline recommends starting high‐intensity statin or the maximum tolerated dose as early as possible and regardless of initial LDL‐C values, to reach the goals for the very high‐risk group of ≥ 50% reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (class I, level A). Lipid levels should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after ACS to determine whether a reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL have been achieved. If the goal of < 55 mg/dL is not achieved with the maximum tolerated dose of statin, combination with ezetimibe is recommended (class I, level B). If the goal < 55 mg/dL is still not achieved on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and ezetimibe after 4 to 6 weeks, a combination with a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended (class I, level A). For patients who present with an ACS and whose LDL‐C levels are not at goal, despite already taking a maximally tolerated statin dose and ezetimibe, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor early after the event (including prior to discharge) should be considered (class II, level C).

### Cardiovascular risk estimation and eligibility for statins in primary prevention comparing different strategies [^117NCuPG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Recommendations for statin use for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) are based on the estimation of the 10-year CHD risk. It is unclear which risk algorithm and guidelines should be used in European populations. Using data from a population-based study in Switzerland, we first assessed 10-year CHD risk and eligibility for statins in 5,683 women and men aged 35 to 75 years without cardiovascular disease by comparing recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology without and with extrapolation of risk to age 60 years, the International Atherosclerosis Society, and the US Adult Treatment Panel III.

The proportions of participants classified as high-risk for CHD were 12.5% (15.4% with extrapolation), 3.0%, and 5.8%, respectively. Proportions of participants eligible for statins were 9.2% (11.6% with extrapolation), 13.7%, and 16.7%, respectively. Assuming full compliance with each guideline, expected relative decreases in CHD deaths in Switzerland over a 10-year period would be 16.4% (17.5% with extrapolation), 18.7%, and 19.3%, respectively. The corresponding numbers needed to treat to prevent one CHD death would be 285 (340 with extrapolation), 380, and 440, respectively.

In conclusion, the proportion of subjects classified as high risk for CHD varied over a fivefold range across recommendations. Following the International Atherosclerosis Society and the Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations might prevent more CHD deaths at the cost of higher numbers needed to treat compared with European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: Impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^117G7e77]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Lowering LDL-C with statin therapy reduces CVD risk by up to 40% in a wide range of patients. Given that the main reason for statin non-adherence or discontinuation relates to the onset of perceived side effects, it follows that the high prevalence of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) reported from observational studies likely adversely affects the CVD benefits of statins. Strategies to prevent the loss of effective statin therapy because of SAMS are still lacking. In the absence of a gold standard definition, this EAS Consensus Panel proposes to base the probability of SAMS being caused by statins on the nature of symptoms and their temporal relationship with statin initiation, statin discontinuation (or dechallenge), and repetitive re-challenge. Optimal therapy should combine a maximally tolerated or even non-daily statin dose, together with non-statin-based lipid-lowering therapies, to achieve LDL-C targets.

This Consensus Panel also highlights the need for further research into the pathophysiology of SAMS. Accumulating preclinical data show that statins decrease mitochondrial function and alter muscle protein degradation, providing a possible pathophysiological link between statins and muscle symptoms. Studies in the clinical setting are a priority to further understanding of these mechanisms and may offer therapeutic potential. In the absence of therapies to prevent these symptoms, this Consensus Panel recommends that the response of patients with SAMS to three or more statins should be considered for referral to specialized settings.

### Statins for all [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals.

Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of the expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended.

Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on the presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain these goals.

### The effect of statin therapy on heart failure events: A collaborative meta-analysis of unpublished data from major randomized trials [^112SypQG]. European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

The effect of statins on the risk of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and HF death remains uncertain. We aimed to establish whether statins reduce major HF events.

- **Methods and results**: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled endpoint statin trials from 1994 to 2014. Collaborating trialists provided unpublished data from adverse event reports. We included primary- and secondary-prevention statin trials with more than 1000 participants followed for over 1 year. Outcomes consisted of first non-fatal HF hospitalization, HF death, and a composite of first non-fatal HF hospitalization or HF death. HF events occurring within 30 days after an in-trial myocardial infarction (MI) were excluded. We calculated risk ratios (RR) using fixed-effects meta-analyses. In up to 17 trials with 132,538 participants conducted over 4.3 years [weighted standard deviation (SD) 1.4], statin therapy reduced LDL-cholesterol by 0.97 mmol/L (weighted SD 0.38 mmol/L). Statins reduced the number of patients experiencing non-fatal HF hospitalization (1344/66,238 vs. 1498/66,330; RR 0.90, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.84–0.97) and the composite HF outcome (1234/57,734 vs. 1344/57,836; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–0.99) but did not decrease HF death (213/57,734 vs. 220/57,836; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.17). The effect of statins on first non-fatal HF hospitalization was similar, regardless of whether this was preceded by MI (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68–1.11) or not (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84–0.98).

- **Conclusion**: In primary- and secondary-prevention trials, statins modestly reduced the risks of non-fatal HF hospitalization.

### Adoption of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with atherosclerotic disease [^111uxg9M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In a sample of 126,419 privately insured patients with a history of ASCVD and on statin therapy, less than 1% of patients were started on a PCSK9 inhibitor in the four years following the introduction of the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved agents in this therapeutic class. During this period, the proportion of potentially eligible patients with ASCVD on statin therapy who were initiated on a PCSK9 inhibitor modestly increased. Before 2018, approximately 1% of these patients started on a PCSK9 inhibitor, and from 2018 through mid-2019, approximately 2% of patients began PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. This occurred despite clinical trials demonstrating improved cardiovascular outcomes, guidelines recommending PCSK9 inhibitors for patients with ASCVD at high cardiovascular risk, and price reductions for these drugs over this period.

The low usage of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with ASCVD showed no substantial difference across different ASCVD patient groups identified over the study period. Both the most inclusive group (patients with ASCVD on a statin) and the most stringent group (patients with ASCVD who were highly adherent to a high-intensity statin for a year with suboptimal LDL-C levels) had less than 1% PCSK9 inhibitor initiation. Furthermore, after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics, it was found that patients with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in the past year were less likely to be initiated on a PCSK9 inhibitor, indicating that the highest-risk patients might not be receiving PCSK9 inhibitor therapy.

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^1127upoK]. Heart (2019). High credibility.

Clinical implications

Statins rank among the most commonly prescribed drug classes. Recent revisions of clinical guidelines for CVD risk reduction have significantly expanded the population of patients deemed eligible for statin therapy. As the high levels of statin prescribing in the UK are similar to those in the United States and many other countries, the findings should translate well, particularly to other similar Western populations. There was a substantial duration of follow-up for outcomes, and a wide range of potential confounders were also evaluated and adjusted for in the analyses.

Based on evidence from clinical trial settings, the response of patients to statins varies widely, with reductions in LDL-C values following the administration of statins ranging from 5–70%. In our study using a large general population reflecting routine practice, over half of the patients had a sub-optimal LDL-C response.

Currently, there is no management strategy in clinical practice which takes into account patient variations in LDL-C response, and no guidelines for predictive screening before commencement of statin therapy. Validated clinical decision tools which can predict cholesterol response to statins, or to non-statin drugs, with interventions to help clinicians to tailor and optimise statin treatments for individual patients are needed.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects.

Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in aging populations.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly concerning patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, the CCS 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of statin therapy typically between 8–10 years of age if LDL-C remains ≥ 4.9 mmol/L, or ≥ 4.1 mmol/L with a family history of premature ASCVD or other cardiovascular risk factors or risk conditions.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. Long-term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid-lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events. However, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high-risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL-C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines, commonly referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines", LDL-C goals were as follows: < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with two or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent.

The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL-C and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk.

- **Statin benefit groups**: The four statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are: (1) patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), (2) adult patients with LDL-C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL-C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention).

With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk and engage in patient-clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action.

In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL-C to assess the achievement of a particular LDL-C level.

### Statin eligibility in primary prevention: From a risk-based strategy to a personalized approach based on the predicted benefit [^117PxV5a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines have recommended statin initiation based on the absolute cardiovascular risk. We tested the hypothesis that a strategy based on the predicted cardiovascular benefit, compared with the risk-based approach, modifies statin eligibility and the estimated benefit in a population in primary cardiovascular prevention. The study included 16,008 subjects (48 ± 6 years, 73% men) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 70 to < 190 mg/dl, not on lipid-lowering drugs, who underwent a routine health screening in a single center. For the risk-based strategy, the criterion for statin eligibility was defined as a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of ≥ 7.5%. In the benefit-based strategy, subjects were considered for statin according to the predicted absolute cardiovascular risk reduction, so that the number of statin candidates would be the same as in the risk-based strategy.

The benefit-based strategy would replace 11% of statin candidates allocated in the risk-based approach with younger, lower risk subjects with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Using the benefit-based strategy, 13% of subjects with 5.0% to < 7.5% ASCVD risk would shift from a statin-ineligible to a statin-eligible status, whereas 24% of those with 7.5% to < 10.0% ASCVD risk would become statin ineligible. These effects would transfer the benefit from higher to lower risk subjects. In the entire population, no clinically meaningful change in the benefit would be expected.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111LRNyB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Evidence for the underuse of lipid‐lowering therapies in clinical practice suggests a gap between guidelines and actual implementation. Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy aimed at LDL‐C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not reaching guideline‐recommended LDL‐C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of over 600,000 US patients with established ASCVD; during the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

Among patients who receive lipid‐lowering therapies, evidence suggests that the management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving the appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL‐C goals. A retrospective cohort study of approximately 1.5 million patients with a history of at least one major ASCVD event reported that more than 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high‐risk criteria had LDL‐C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a two‐year period, two‐thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL‐C levels > 70 mg/dL and only 17% received tr.

### Earlier intervention in the management of hypercholesterolemia: What are we waiting for [^115YnKKk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The thesis advanced here is that we are initiating treatment of hypercholesterolemia (and other risk factors) too late in life. Initiating treatment at, for example, age 30 years instead of age 60 years might very well prevent not just 30% of events, as in the 5-year statin trials, but perhaps as many as 60%.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115HRh7E]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and death in the US, accounting for more than 1 in every 4 deaths. Coronary heart disease is the single leading cause of death, responsible for 43% of deaths attributable to CVD in the US. In 2019, approximately 558,000 deaths were caused by coronary heart disease and 109,000 deaths by ischemic stroke.

The objective of this statement is to update the 2016 recommendation. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of statins for reducing CVD-related morbidity or mortality, or all-cause mortality. This recommendation applies to adults 40 years or older who do not have a history, signs, or symptoms of CVD.

The evidence assessment concludes with moderate certainty that statin use offers at least a moderate net benefit for preventing CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD who have one or more CVD risk factors (such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF also concludes with moderate certainty that statin use offers at least a small net benefit in adults with one or more CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to less than 10%. However, the evidence is insufficient to ascertain the balance of benefits and harms for primary prevention in other populations.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly in elderly patients, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend starting statins at a low dose in patients over 65 years old if there is significant renal impairment and/or the potential for drug interactions.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: Impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^111Rja8b]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Statin-based therapies for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms involve several approaches. If symptoms or CK abnormalities resolve after discontinuation of the statin, either treatment with the same statin at a lower dose or switching to an alternative statin should be considered. If tolerated, doses can be up-titrated to achieve the LDL-C goal, or as much LDL-C reduction that can be achieved with minimal muscle complaints. If these strategies are not tolerated, alternate day or twice-weekly dosing can be considered to achieve the LDL-C goal.

Despite methodological limitations, such as small size, retrospective, open-label, or non-randomized design, studies have shown that either alternate day or twice-weekly dosing strategies can reduce LDL-C by 12–38% and, importantly, are tolerated by approximately 70% of previously intolerant patients. Generally, lower doses of a high-intensity statin with a long half-life (e.g. atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin) are more appropriate.

### Initiation patterns of statins in the 2 years after release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline in a large US health plan [^111P7FJK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline suggests several significant changes to the former treatment paradigm for lipid therapy. One of the most controversial aspects of the guideline is the movement away from a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target attainment approach to a statin initiation strategy that selects statin intensity based on clinical trial evidence of reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by use of statins in specific populations.

The ACC/AHA guideline recommendations result from an analysis of pooled evidence from randomized clinical trials. The guideline recommends evaluating a patient's future risk for ASCVD events; for those individuals in whom the benefit of statin treatment was likely to be greater than the risk of adverse events, statin therapy was recommended. With this approach, individuals should be placed on the evidence-based, preferred intensity of statin, with adjustments made if necessary to accommodate any tolerability issues for that individual. Monitoring LDL-C levels would then be performed to assess appropriate response to a specific intensity of statin therapy and adherence to therapy. In following this evidence-based approach, the recommendation for many of these patients is a high-intensity statin.

### Statin use prior to first myocardial infarction in contemporary patients: Inefficient and not gender equitable [^1155vWus]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend initiating primary prevention with statins for those at highest cardiovascular risk. This study assessed the gender-specific implementation and effectiveness of this risk-guided approach.

We identified 1,399 consecutive patients without known cardiovascular disease or diabetes who were hospitalized with a first myocardial infarction (MI) in Denmark. Statin use before MI was assessed, and cardiovascular risk was calculated using the SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation) model.

Among patients with a first MI, 36% were women. Compared with men, women were older (mean age 72 vs. 65 years) but had a lower estimated risk (median 3.4% vs. 6.7%, SCORE high-risk model in the statin-naïve patients). Statin therapy had been initiated in 12% of women and 10% of men prior to MI. After adjusting the total cholesterol concentration with an addition of 1.5 mmol/L for those already on statins, the estimated pre-treatment risk was much lower in women than in men (median 3.8% vs. 9.2%, SCORE high-risk model). Only 29% of women would have met the risk-based treatment threshold defined by the European guidelines (SCORE ≥ 5%). Estimated risk and statin use were directly correlated in men, but not in women. Only approximately 5% of first MIs are prevented by the use of statins in people without diabetes.

In conclusion, in individuals destined for a first MI, statin therapy is uncommon and prevents few events. Lower-risk women receive as much statins as higher-risk men, highlighting a gender disparity and inefficient targeting of statins to those at highest risk. This indicates that risk scoring is not widely utilized in routine clinical practice.

### The benefits of statin therapy — what questions remain [^114mdTm9]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Early hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) trials provided the first evidence of the benefits of statin therapy in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Outcomes data from more recent trials involving atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin have since expanded the patient population shown to benefit from statin therapy. Studies are evaluating the benefits of lowering lipid levels with statins to below goals, as well as examining benefits in special patient populations and evaluating the value of surrogate markers of CHD. Early trials provided a solid foundation of knowledge on the efficacy and safety of statins. Recent and ongoing trials generate new data to resolve remaining questions in the fields of CHD prevention and lipidology.
