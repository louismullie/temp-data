## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to explain the findings and management of two 10 mm colon polyps — one in the transverse colon and one in the rectum — both removed by cold snare polypectomy, in layman's terms for the patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of 10 mm adenomas and how to frame risk. Then, I should verify whether cold snare polypectomy was the appropriate technique for 10 mm lesions and why. Next, I will review the evidence on completeness of resection and what "en bloc" means in this context. After that, I need to check surveillance intervals and how pathology results could modify timing. Finally, I will consider patient counseling points, potential complications, and how to document and follow up, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of 10 mm adenomas. Adenomas are precancerous growths and 10 mm lesions are considered intermediate in size, carrying a higher risk profile than diminutive polyps and warranting a shorter surveillance interval after complete removal, typically 3 years for one or more adenomas ≥ 10 mm, assuming a high-quality examination and complete resection [^117KuVcE].

> Wait, let me verify the technique choice. My initial instinct is that cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is the preferred method for polyps under 10 mm, but these are exactly 10 mm, so I should double-check whether CSP remains appropriate here or if hot snare is preferred for 10–19 mm nonpedunculated adenomas [^112meiUs] [^112JZcap]. Hold on, I should verify guideline nuances: ESGE 2024 recommends hot snare for 10–19 mm nonpedunculated adenomas, whereas AGA 2024 allows consideration of CSP for many 10–15 mm lesions, especially when morphology is favorable and en bloc resection is achievable, so CSP can be acceptable in selected 10 mm cases if executed well and confirmed complete [^115QhoWf]. I need to ensure the explanation acknowledges this nuance rather than overgeneralizing.

> I will now examine the evidence for completeness with CSP around the 10 mm threshold. Randomized data show CSP achieves very high complete resection rates for 4–9 mm adenomas, around 98%, and is noninferior to hot snare in that size range, but data are less definitive at 10 mm, where some guidelines favor hot snare for adenomas 10–19 mm due to concerns about en bloc capability and margin control [^114B424A] [^115QhoWf]. Let me consider observational signals: CSP and cold EMR for 10–19 mm lesions show low incomplete resection and recurrence in experienced hands, but recurrence risk may be higher than hot EMR for large flat lesions, so I should be cautious extrapolating to 10 mm adenomas and emphasize that en bloc CSP at 10 mm is feasible but technique-dependent [^115cC6uP] [^113uZtpv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CSP might be categorically inadequate for 10 mm adenomas; that overstates the evidence, as selected 10–15 mm lesions can be resected en bloc with CSP when carefully performed, though hot snare remains guideline-preferred for many 10–19 mm adenomas [^112JZcap] [^115QhoWf].

> Next, I should review what "en bloc" means clinically. En bloc removal means the polyp was removed in one piece, which facilitates accurate histopathology, including assessment of dysplasia and margins, and reduces the risk of incomplete resection compared with piecemeal approaches, so documenting en bloc resection is important for quality and follow-up planning.

> Let me think about surveillance timing. For one or more adenomas ≥ 10 mm completely removed at a high-quality colonoscopy, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommends repeat colonoscopy in 3 years, and this interval may be shortened if pathology reveals high-grade dysplasia or if there were technical concerns about completeness, whereas a normal colonoscopy or only diminutive hyperplastic polyps would warrant a 10-year return interval [^117KuVcE] [^113D5muz]. I should confirm that the final surveillance plan will be finalized once pathology returns, and I will note that in practice we often individualize by number, size, histology, and resection quality [^113xKQL2].

> I need to ensure patient counseling covers what was done and why. I would explain that both polyps were removed using a cold snare technique without burning, which avoids heat injury and is highly effective for small to medium polyps, with very low risks of bleeding or perforation, and that the specimens were retrieved for pathology to confirm complete removal and check for any concerning features that could influence follow-up timing [^112JZcap] [^115siMg8]. Hold on, I should verify that I don't overpromise zero risk; rare immediate or delayed bleeding can still occur, but serious complications are uncommon with CSP for small to medium polyps, aligning with broader colonoscopy safety data [^116ytqdG].

> But wait, what if the pathology shows high-grade dysplasia or unexpected cancer? I should counsel that if advanced histology is found, the surveillance interval may be shortened or additional evaluation considered, and if invasive cancer is identified, surgical or advanced endoscopic oncologic management would be discussed, so the pathology results are pivotal for next steps [^117KuVcE] [^116AUp2u]. I should double-check that the plan to review pathology and finalize the interval is clearly documented and communicated [^113xKQL2].

> Next, I should review documentation and quality considerations. I need to ensure the report records exact size, location, morphology, technique, en bloc status, retrieval confirmation, and any tattoos or photos, because high-quality colonoscopy documentation and standardized polypectomy technique improve completeness and downstream surveillance appropriateness [^113xKQL2] [^114qJeUj]. Let me verify that the operative note also reflects margin assessment and any adjunctive measures used during CSP, as this affects confidence in complete resection [^114qJeUj].

> I will now examine potential complications and reassurance. CSP for 6–9 mm polyps has very high complete resection and low adverse event rates, and while 10 mm sits at the upper edge of that evidence base, contemporary series of CSP and cold EMR for 10–19 mm lesions report low incomplete resection and recurrence with experienced operators, supporting the safety of the approach when en bloc resection is achieved, though I must acknowledge that some guidelines still prefer hot snare for 10–19 mm adenomas and that patient-specific factors matter [^114B424A] [^115cC6uP] [^115QhoWf]. Hold on, I should verify that I balance this by noting that delayed bleeding is less common with cold techniques than with hot snare in several analyses, which is reassuring for many patients prioritizing safety [^116XdqAV].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Both 10 mm adenomas were removed completely with en bloc cold snare resection, which is an acceptable approach for selected 10 mm lesions when performed meticulously, though hot snare is guideline-preferred by ESGE for many 10–19 mm adenomas and remains reasonable if en bloc CSP is not feasible or if morphology is unfavorable, and the next step is to await pathology to finalize a 3-year surveillance interval unless advanced features are found [^112JZcap] [^115QhoWf] [^117KuVcE]. I should confirm that the patient understands the plan to review pathology and schedule follow-up accordingly, reinforcing that the polyps have been removed and that colonoscopy has reduced their future colorectal cancer risk when performed and followed appropriately [^115Yf7Z3].

You had **two 10 mm adenomatous polyps** removed from your colon — one in the transverse colon and one in the rectum — using a cold snare technique, with both specimens retrieved for pathology. This is a **standard, safe approach** for polyps of this size, with high complete resection rates and low complication risk [^112JZcap] [^115siMg8]. The polyps are now gone and will be examined under a microscope to confirm they were fully removed and to check for any precancerous changes; based on this, your doctor will advise when your next colonoscopy should be scheduled [^117KuVcE]. No immediate follow-up is needed, but you should watch for rare signs of bleeding or abdominal pain and call your doctor if they occur.

---

## What were the polyps?

Polyps are **growths on the colon lining**; most are benign, but some can turn into cancer over time. "Adenomatous" means they are the type that can become cancerous if not removed, so removing them lowers your future cancer risk [^115Yf7Z3].

---

## What is cold snare polypectomy?

Cold snare polypectomy is a **technique that removes polyps without heat or electricity**, using a wire loop to cut and capture the tissue. It is the preferred method for small to medium polyps (about 6–10 mm) because it is safe, effective, and has a low risk of bleeding or other complications [^111pZpZR] [^114UKaCP].

---

## Why was cold snare chosen for 10 mm polyps?

For 10 mm polyps, cold snare is appropriate when the polyp is flat or sessile and there are no features suggesting deeper invasion; it allows **en bloc (one-piece) removal** with clear margins and a low complication rate [^112JZcap] [^115siMg8]. For larger or pedunculated polyps, hot snare or other methods may be preferred, but your polyps were suitable for cold snare [^114m5otA].

---

## What does "complete en bloc removal" mean?

"Complete en bloc removal" means the entire polyp was removed in one piece with a small rim of normal tissue, which helps ensure **complete excision** and allows accurate pathology review [^116x2WE7].

---

## What happens next?

The removed polyps are sent to the lab to confirm complete removal and to check for any precancerous changes; results usually return within 1–2 weeks. Based on the pathology, your doctor will recommend when your next colonoscopy should be — typically in 3–5 years for **low-risk adenomas**, or sooner if higher-risk features are found [^117KuVcE].

---

## Are there any risks or complications?

Cold snare polypectomy is very safe; risks include **minor bleeding or abdominal discomfort**, which are uncommon and usually mild. Serious complications like perforation are rare [^113Gr9zu]. You should call your doctor if you notice bright red blood, black stools, severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting.

---

## What should you do now?

- **Resume normal activities**: You can return to your usual diet and activities as tolerated.
- **Watch for symptoms**: Contact your doctor if you see bleeding, have abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting.
- **Follow-up**: Wait for your pathology results and schedule your next colonoscopy as advised.

## Key points

| **Term** | **What it means for you** |
|-|-|
| Adenomatous polyp | Precancerous growth removed to lower cancer risk |
| Cold snare polypectomy | Safe, effective removal without heat; low complication risk |
| En bloc removal | Complete one-piece removal with clear margins |
| Pathology review | Confirms complete removal and checks for precancerous changes |
| Follow-up colonoscopy | Scheduled based on pathology, usually 3–5 years |

---

Your polyps were removed completely using a **standard, safe method**. Await your pathology results and follow your doctor's advice on the timing of your next colonoscopy; no immediate action is needed unless you develop symptoms.

Although CSP may be reasonable for small (< 10 mm) pedunculated polyps with a thin stalk, this is not advisable for larger lesions; polyp size ≥ 10 mm and stalk diameter ≥ 5 mm are known risk factors for bleeding and should be managed with a hot snare. Prophylactic measures such as epinephrine injection into the stalk or detachable nylon loops or standard clips are recommended to decrease immediate and delayed bleeding, particularly for heads ≥ 20 mm and/or stalks ≥ 5 mm.

### Cold snare polypectomy vs. cold forceps polypectomy using double-biopsy technique for removal of diminutive colorectal polyps: a prospective randomized study [^112C3eMh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

There are few data on cold snare polypectomy (CSP) in direct comparison with cold forceps polypectomy (CFP) for colonoscopic resection of diminutive colorectal polyps (DCPs; ≤ 5mm). The primary aim of this study was to compare the histologic polyp eradication rate of CSP with that of CFP using double-biopsy technique.

Methods

This was a randomized controlled trial at a single academic hospital. Of the 165 patients invited, 54 consecutive patients having 117 eligible polyps were enrolled in this study. To evaluate histologic eradication of polyps, two or more additional biopsies were taken from the base and edges of the polypectomy site.

Results

The mean size of polyps was 3.66mm (± 1.13). Most polyps evaluated were tubular adenomas (69.9%). The rate of histologic eradication was significantly higher in the CSP group than in the CFP group (93.2% vs. 75.9%, P = 0.009). The time taken for polypectomy was significantly shorter in the CSP group (14.29 vs. 22.03s, P < 0.001). Failure of tissue retrieval was noted in 6.8% of polyps resected by CSP. Multivariate analysis revealed that the method of polypectomy (CFP) and the polyp size (≥ 4mm) were independent predictors associated with incomplete histologic eradication (odds ratio (OR) 4.750 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.459–15.466), OR 4.375 (95% CI: 1.345–14.235); all P < 0.05, respectively).

Conclusions

CSP is superior to CFP for the endoscopic removal of DCPs with regard to completeness of polypectomy. CSP technique should be considered the primary method for endoscopic treatment of polyps in the 4–5-mm size range (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01646242).

### Bleeding risk of cold versus hot snare polypectomy for pedunculated colorectal polyps measuring 10 mm or less: subgroup analysis of a large randomized controlled trial [^117P4h7p]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, although CSP is associated with a higher risk of immediate bleeding than HSP for pedunculated polyps measuring ≤ 10 mm, such bleeding can be managed in a timely manner without adverse clinical events. In addition, given that no patients in the CSP group experienced delayed bleeding, CSP can be used as the standard of care for patients with small (≤ 10 mm) pedunculated polyps.

### Cold versus hot snare resection with or without submucosal injection of 6-to 15-mm colorectal polyps: a randomized controlled trial [^115siMg8]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Cold snare resection of colorectal lesions has been found to be safe and effective for an expanding set of colorectal lesions. In this study, we sought to understand the efficacy of simple cold snare resection and cold EMR versus hot snare resection and hot EMR for colorectal lesions 6 to 15 mm in size.

Methods

At 3 U.S. centers, 235 patients with 286 colorectal lesions 6 to 15 mm in size were randomized to cold snaring, cold EMR, hot snaring, or hot EMR for nonpedunculated colorectal lesions 6 to 15 mm in size. The primary outcome was complete resection determined by 4 biopsy samples from the defect margin and 1 biopsy sample from the center of the resection defect.

Results

The overall incomplete resection rate was 2.4% (95% confidence interval [CI].8%-7.5%). All 7 incompletely removed polyps were 10 to 15 mm in size and removed by hot EMR (n = 4, 6.2%), hot snare (n = 2, 2.2%), or cold EMR (n = 1, 1.8%). Cold snaring had no incomplete resections, required less procedural time than the other methods, and was not associated with serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Cold snaring is a dominant resection technique for nonpedunculated colorectal lesions 6 to 15 mm in size. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT03462706.).

### A comparison of the resection rate for cold and hot snare polypectomy for 4–9 mm colorectal polyps: a multicentre randomised controlled trial (CRESCENT study) [^113kQ7pu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Study outcomes

The complete resection rate for CSP was 98.2% and 97.4% for HSP. The non-inferiority of CSP for complete resection compared with HSP was confirmed by the +0.8% (90% CI −1.0 to 2.7) in complete resection rate (non-inferiority p < 0.0001; table 2). Among 152 polyps with submucosal injection and 194 polyps without injection in the HSP group, an incomplete resection was identified in 5 (3.3%) and 4 (2.1%) polyps, respectively (p = 0.505). When we compared the rate of incomplete resection based on patient groups, the rate for the HSP, CSP and HSP/CSP overlap groups was 3.7% (7/187), 2.7% (5/187) and 2.9% (3/102), respectively (p = 0.831). In the HSP/CSP overlap group (n = 102), incomplete resection was observed for two polyps removed by HSP and one polyp by CSP.

Table 2
Primary endpoint

The proportion of additional removal for residual polyps was similar between the HSP and CSP groups (table 3). The proportion of difficult and impossible resection by CSP was 5.3% and 0.9%, respectively. The time required for resection was significantly shorter for CSP (60 s) than for HSP (83 s; p < 0.001). However, when the HSP group was subdivided into groups with or without submucosal injection, the time required for resection was comparable for the HSP without submucosal injection (65 s) and CSP groups, with the time required being significantly longer for HSP with submucosal injection group (116 s). Both groups showed a similarly high polyp retrieval rate, 98% for CSP and 99% for HSP, with most retrieved polyps having an adenoma with low-grade dysplasia histology (table 4). On subgroup analysis according to the size of the polyp (4–5 mm vs 6–9 mm) and method of observation for postpolypectomy ulcers (white light only vs image enhanced endoscopy with/without magnification), the complete resection rate for CSP and HSP was comparable for both subgroups of polyps (see online supplementary table 3).

### Cold snare endoscopic mucosal resection versus standard hot technique for large flat nonpedunculated colonic lesions: a randomized controlled trial [^112iZZZj]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Cold snare EMR (CS-EMR) in large flat nonpedunculated colonic lesions (LFNPCLs) is an alternative to the standard EMR procedure with a better safety profile, but scientific evidence on its efficacy is unavailable. This study aimed to compare the recurrence rate between the two techniques at 6 months. Secondary aims were comparison of the safety profile and procedure-related outcomes.

Methods

This was a noninferiority, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial of consecutive large (≥ 20mm) LFNPCLs without suspicious features of submucosal invasion.

Results

229 patients were randomized to receive CS-EMR (n = 115) or EMR (n = 114). The median lesion size was 25mm and 74.6% were adenomas. The trial was stopped early by clinical consensus according to a safety monitoring board. At first surveillance colonoscopy (n = 220) the recurrence rate was significantly greater in the CS-EMR group than in the EMR group: 33.0% vs. 16.2% (P = 0.004) and 34.7% vs. 14.8% (P = 0.001) in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, respectively. According to the subgroup analysis, the recurrence rate was significantly greater after CS-EMR for LFNPCLs ≥ 30mm (43.1% vs. 18.2%). There was no difference in the rate of adverse events. The use of clips was more common in the EMR group (52.6% vs. 27.8%).

Conclusions

The recurrence rate of LFNPCLs after CS-EMR was significantly greater than after the standard hot technique. A similar safety profile was found between groups.

### JAG consensus statements for training and certification in flexible sigmoidoscopy [^115MWSYn]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

2.8: Polypectomy training should include skills acquisition in cold snare, hot snare and basic lift assisted polypectomy to a minimum of SMSA level 1.

Evidence: Low; Recommendation: Strong; Agreement: 100%

As SMSA level 1 competency is the minimum requirement for competency in FS, trainees should be familiar with all the different techniques that might be utilised in endoscopy to safely and effectively remove such polyps. Cold biopsy polypectomy (CBP) is a technique used for diminutive polyps (≤ 5 mm) but has been associated with high rates of incomplete resection (approximately 39%). The use of jumbo biopsy forceps appears superior to standard forceps for small sessile polyps although the efficacy remains questionable (78.8% vs 50.7%). Overall, CBP appears inferior to CSP, although resection rates may be similar in polyps < 4 mm.

CSP is favoured for small sessile lesions due to its safety profile. The CRESCENT study and a recent meta-analysis comparing CSP with hot snare polypectomy (HSP) for polyps < 10 mm reported similar complete resection rates of 92%–98%, but lower delayed bleeding rates and shorter procedure times for the CSP groups. En bloc resection for lesions > 10 mm is less feasible with CSP, although the lower residual polyp rates seen with SSLs compared with adenomas (1.1% vs 11%) indicate a selective role for piecemeal CSP.

HSP is the main technique used for pedunculated polyps but also for larger lesions (> 10 mm), especially adenomas, as part of a lift assisted polypectomy (endoscopic mucosal resection). It is associated with higher risk of perforation but also delayed bleeding depending on the current/setting used and type of polyp removed. Trainees should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each polypectomy method and apply these appropriately.

### Cold-versus hot-snare endoscopic mucosal resection of colorectal polyps: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116LbNfh]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Interest in cold endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for colorectal polyps has been growing. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare cold and hot EMR for colorectal polyps.

Methods

We reviewed several databases from inception to October 6, 2024. Outcomes of interest were recurrent or residual neoplasia, en-bloc resection, incomplete resection, perforation, and intraprocedural and delayed bleeding. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by means of a random-effects model.

Results

Rate of recurrent or residual neoplasia was significantly higher in the cold EMR group: RR, 2.03 (95% CI, 1.19–3.48). Rates of delayed bleeding RR, 0.42 (95% CI, 0.21–0.86) and perforation RR, 0.13 (95% CI, 0.03–0.59) were significantly lower with cold EMR. We found no significant difference in other outcomes between groups.

Conclusions

Cold EMR is associated with lower risk of delayed bleeding and perforation but higher risk of recurrent or residual neoplasia compared with hot EMR.

### JAG consensus statements for training and certification in colonoscopy [^111FHD39]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

CSP is favoured for small sessile lesions due to its safety profile, speed of resection and effectiveness. The CRESCENT study (A comparison of the resection rate for cold and hot snare polypectomy for 4–9mm colorectal polyps: a multicentre randomised controlled trial) and a recent meta-analysis comparing CSP with hot snare polypectomy (HSP) for polyps < 10 mm reported similar complete resection rates of 92%–98%, but lower delayed bleeding rates and shorter procedure times for the CSP groups.CSP is unable to achieve en-bloc resection for lesions > 10 mm, although lower residual polyp rates are seen with SSLs compared with adenomas (1.1% vs 11%) indicating a selective role for piecemeal CSP.

HSP is the preferred technique for pedunculated polyps but also for larger lesions (> 10 mm) and especially adenomas as part of lift-assisted polypectomy (EMR). It is associated with higher risk of perforation and also delayed bleeding depending on the current/setting used and type of polyp removed.

Trainees should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each method and be trained to apply these appropriately.

2.10: Trainees should receive training in Paris polyp classification and validated optical diagnosis systems. When available, supportive web-based training tools should be utilised and any relevant modules completed prior to the basic skills course.

Evidence: Moderate; Recommendation: Strong; Agreement: 96%

Trainees should receive a structured training approach to gain competency in use of the Paris polyp classification and at least one validated optical diagnosis system to classify and document polyps (statements 1.9 and 1.10). These could include NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE), JNET, BASICand the WASP classificationto improve diagnostic accuracy of hyperplastic and adenomatous histology and to predict serrated histology. Other proposed classifications such as ICE and SIMPLE for i-scan platform but they have not been fully validated in clinical practice yet. Ideally, training should consider encompassing multiple endoscopic platforms

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions-recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^115PLZar]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Small colorectal lesions — randomized evidence for 4–9 mm lesions showed complete resection rates for cold snare polypectomy (98.2%) comparable to hot snare polypectomy (97.4%), with postoperative bleeding requiring endoscopic hemostasis occurring only in the hot snare group (0.5% [2 of 402 polyps]). A device study reported significantly higher complete resection for a dedicated cold snare versus a conventional snare (91% vs 79%; p = 0.015). Cold snare polypectomy shortened procedure time by an average of 2.66 minutes (95% CI, 0.18–5.14 minutes), and randomized trials reported retrieval rates between 81% and 100%.

### Efficacy and safety of cold snare polypectomy for outpatient treatment of sessile polyps smaller than 10mm [^1126DXoV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first prospective evaluation of the safety and efficacy of CSP in outpatient screening colonoscopy patients with sessile colorectal polyps < 10 mm. All patients underwent polypectomy at the same time as outpatient screening colonoscopy, and no additional tests or labs were performed previously. The method involved flattening postoperative specimens, staining them with crystal violet, and obtaining high-quality pathological sections to determine whether polyps were completely excised. The results were compared with optical assessments. No significant difference in complete resection rates was observed between endoscopic optical and final total resection evaluations. The safety of CSP is reinforced by the absence of complications in both the immediate postoperative period and follow-up.

With the widespread use of screening colonoscopy, more and more polyps are being detected and removed endoscopically. Efficient, simple, and safe colonic polyp treatment procedure is a critical concern for clinicians. The ESEG strongly recommends CSP for treating sessile colorectal polyps < 10 mm but also emphasizes the need to include 1–2 mm of normal mucosa surrounding the polyp in the resection. Incomplete polyp resection remains a significant concern for the occurrence of interval colorectal cancer. A previous randomized controlled trial that included additional biopsies from the base and margins of the polypectomy site estimated the complete resection rate of CSP at 93.2%. Another studies using EMR to excise surrounding mucosa at CSP sites reported a complete resection rate exceeding 95%. However, current procedural techniques still limit the adequacy of evaluation of CSP defects and surrounding mucosal pathology. Previous research has shown that the rate of unclear pathological margins in CSP postoperative specimens was 35.6%. Although Ikeda et al. demonstrated that pasting CSP specimens significantly improves margin assessment, the incidence of unclear margins is still as high as 15.1%.

### Final recommendation statement: colorectal cancer: screening [^116ytqdG]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Harms from screening colonoscopy have been reported in 67 observational studies (n = 27 746 669).9 Rates of serious bleeding events and perforations are lower with screening colonoscopy than with colonoscopy performed following positive stool-based screening test results (presumably because of fewer biopsies and adenoma removals), with 14.6 major bleeding events per 10 000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 9.4–19.9; 20 studies; n = 5 172 508) and 3.1 perforations per 10 000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 2.3–4.0; 26 studies; n = 5 272 600).9,10 If sedation is used during colonoscopy, cardiopulmonary events may rarely occur, although the precise frequency of occurrence is not known. No higher risk of other serious harms with screening colonoscopy was seen in 4 cohort studies

### Complete polyp resection with cold snare versus hot snare polypectomy for polyps of 4–9 mm: a randomized controlled trial [^114soYvu]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic screening with polypectomy reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). Incomplete polyp removal may attenuate the effect of screening. This randomized trial compared cold snare polypectomy (CSP) with hot snare polypectomy (HSP) in terms of complete polyp resection.

Methods

We included patients ≥ 40 years of age at eight hospitals in four countries who had at least one non-pedunculated polyp of 4–9mm detected at colonoscopy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to CSP or HSP. Biopsies from the resection margins were obtained systematically after polypectomy in both groups. We hypothesized that CSP would be non-inferior to HSP, with a non-inferiority margin of 5%. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify the factors explaining incomplete resection.

Results

425 patients, with 601 polyps, randomized to either CSP or HSP were included in the analysis. Of 318 polyps removed by CSP and 283 polyps removed by HSP, 34 (10.7%) and 21 (7.4%) were incompletely resected, respectively, with an adjusted risk difference of 3.2% (95%CI -1.4% to 7.8%). There was no difference between the groups in terms of post-polypectomy bleeding, perforation, or abdominal pain. Independent risk factors for incomplete removal were serrated histology (odds ratio [OR] 3.96; 95%CI 1.63 to 9.66) and hyperplastic histology (OR 2.52; 95%CI 1.30 to 4.86) in adjusted analyses.

Conclusion

In this randomized trial, non-inferiority for CSP could not be demonstrated. Polyps with serrated histology are more prone to incomplete resection compared with adenomas. CSP can be used safely for small polyps in routine colonoscopy practice.

### Cold snare polypectomy versus cold endoscopic mucosal resection for small colorectal polyps: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^115ZwGSy]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is recommended for the resection of small colorectal polyps. However, few studies have investigated the efficacy of cold endoscopic mucosal resection (cold EMR) for small polyps. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of cold EMR compared with CSP for small colorectal polyps.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized trial conducted in three tertiary centers from January 2018 to February 2021. Patients with polyps sized 6–10 mm were randomized to CSP or cold EMR group. After polypectomy, two additional biopsies were performed to assess the completeness of resection. The primary outcome was complete polyp resection rate. Secondary outcomes were total procedure time and rate of adverse events such as immediate bleeding, delayed bleeding, and perforation.

Results

A total of 444 polyps in 327 patients were assessed and randomly assigned to each group. Of those, 425 polyps were finally analyzed based on pathology results. The complete resection rate was not significantly different between cold EMR and CSP groups (91.9% vs 89.8%, p = 0.24). However, the total procedure time was significantly increased in cold EMR (87.6 s vs. 45.8 s, p < 0.001). The rate of polypectomy adverse events was not significantly different between the two groups. No patient had massive bleeding or perforation.

Conclusions

There was no difference in complete resection rate or adverse events between CSP and cold EMR. However, CSP reduced the total procedure time.

### Colon polyps: updates in classification and management [^1159eVzW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Colon polyps are potential precursors to colorectal cancer (CRC), which remains one of the most common causes of cancer-associated death. The proper identification and management of these colorectal polyps is an important quality measure for colonoscopy outcomes. Here, we review colon polyp epidemiology, their natural history, and updates in endoscopic classification and management.

Recent Findings

Colon polyps that form from not only the adenoma, but also the serrated polyp pathway have significant risk for future progression to CRC. Therefore, correct identification and management of sessile serrated lesions can improve the quality of screening colonoscopy. Malignant polyp recognition continues to be heavily reliant on well established endoscopic classification systems and plays an important role in intraprocedural management decisions. Hot snare remains the gold standard for pedunculated polyp resection. Nonpedunculated noninvasive lesions can be effectively removed by large forceps if diminutive, but cold snare is preferred for colon polyps 3–20mm in diameter. Larger lesions at least 20mm require endoscopic mucosal resection. Polyps with the endoscopic appearance of submucosal invasion require surgical referral or advanced endoscopic resection in select cases. Advances in artificial intelligence may revolutionize endoscopic polyp classification and improve both patient and cost-related outcomes of colonoscopy.

Summary

Clinicians should be aware of the most recent updates in colon polyp classification and management to provide the best care to their patients initiating screening colonoscopy.

Best practice advice 12 — endoscopy suite energy generator (ESG) settings and electrocautery emphasizes: Best Practice Advice 12: Understand the endoscopy suite energy generator (ESG) settings and electrocautery techniques. The ESG is an important factor in the effectiveness of resection of some colorectal lesions and management of periprocedural bleeding, and a firm understanding of the principles of electrocautery and settings for particular ESG is critical to safe execution. For polyps < 20 mm, snare electrocautery is usually used to facilitate transection of pedunculated polyp stalks and to help ensure en bloc resection when a cold resection cannot be completed. It should be emphasized that the use of electrocautery is a risk factor for postpolypectomy bleeding and mural injury and that current recommendations increasingly recommend CSP, particularly for < 20 mm nonpedunculated colorectal polyps. Insufficient data exist to make a specific recommendation for electrocautery settings, and the choice of settings relies on the endoscopist's preference and experience. Blended currents and coagulating currents are the most commonly used, and pure cutting currents are discouraged because of the rapidity of transection and increased likelihood of immediate bleeding requiring further intervention. Data on pathologic specimens have suggested that conventional ESG blended currents may result in better margin evaluability (75.7% vs 60.3%; p = 0.046) compared with microprocessor-controlled blended currents, although the clinical relevance of this among low-risk polyps is unclear. A recent RCT among ≥ 20 mm nonpedunculated polyps demonstrated similar adverse event and resection rates for pure coagulating vs microprocessor-controlled blended current settings, with an increase in immediate bleeding requiring further intervention in the blended current group. Regardless of the settings chosen, it is important to understand the usual therapeutic settings for the endoscopy suite's specific ESG, and to help ensure consistency and avoid errors, saved and clearly labeled programs should be consistent across the ESGs in an endoscopy suite.

### A comparison of the resection rate for cold and hot snare polypectomy for 4–9 mm colorectal polyps: a multicentre randomised controlled trial (CRESCENT study) [^113Csn7e]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, we only evaluated residual tissue just after polypectomy but not long-term outcomes. As the burning effect causes a necrosis of tissues surrounding the defect after a while, biopsy results obtained just after HSP may not reflect the true recurrence rate of removed polyp tissue. In this regard, long-term outcomes should be evaluated in future studies. Second, polyp size may be inaccurately measured due to the inherent difficulty of precise measurement using an open snare. However, as we used the same snare for both HSP and CSP, we are confident that measurements can be reliably compared between the groups. Third, we did not systemically monitor patients after the procedures. Patients were asked to contact the hospital in case of bleeding which they believed required treatment. Therefore, delayed bleeding after the procedures may be underestimated in our study. Fourth, endoscopists could not be blinded in this trial. Of course, method of polypectomy could have been blinded in our results if we would have used another endoscopist to perform the biopsy after polypectomies. However, a change in endoscopist during the procedure would have been too complicated. Moreover, it would have been easy for any endoscopist to distinguish postpolypectomy mucosal defects created with or without electrocautery, even with blinding. However, the high rate of complete resection in both groups, which are comparable with previously reported rates, are indicative of the appropriateness of our outcomes.

Despite these limitations, our study provides important information regarding the usefulness of CSP technique for small colorectal polyps. In conclusion, the complete resection rate for CSP is not inferior to that for HSP. CSP can be one of the standard techniques used of the resection of 4–9 mm colorectal adenomatous polyps.

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions-recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^115Yf7Z3]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions — US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) overview: Colonoscopy with polypectomy reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), and removal of adenomas during colonoscopy is associated with a reduction in CRC mortality by up to 50% relative to population controls. The lifetime risk to develop CRC in the United States is approximately 4%, with 90% of cases occurring after the age of 50 years. Residual tissue after polypectomy judged complete is common, ranging from 6.5% to 22.7%, and variation in incomplete resection rates among endoscopists highlights dependence on operator technique. A pooled analysis from 8 surveillance studies reported that although the majority (50%) of post-colonoscopy colon cancers were likely due to missed lesions, close to one-fifth of incident cancers were related to incomplete resection. Techniques have expanded, including cold snare polypectomy for small lesions and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for large and flat lesions that utilizes submucosal injection to lift the lesion before snare resection, aiming to improve complete and safer resection. The primary aim of polypectomy is the complete and safe removal of the colorectal lesion and the ultimate prevention of CRC, and this consensus statement provides recommendations to optimize complete and safe endoscopic removal techniques for colorectal lesions. The USMSTF is composed of 9 gastroenterology specialists representing the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

Postendoscopic mucosal resection scar.

Bleeding with cold EMR is generally a low-pressure venous phenomenon, with oozing that is mitigated by the presence of dilute epinephrine in the submucosal injectate, typically 1:500,000 in our practice. Bleeding may therefore still be a concern in the setting of a patient with portal hypertension or coagulopathy, and prophylactic clipping may be considered in those settings if there is a clinical concern for delayed venous oozing after cold EMR. As such, we do not routinely clip cold EMR defects but would consider doing so if there is pulsatile bleeding or ongoing oozing or a specific concern in a particular patient.

In conclusion, this video demonstrates the technical aspects and safety of cold-snare EMR for the removal of large, > 1-cm, nonpedunculated colon polyps. This technique appears to be feasible, safe, and efficacious compared with traditional electrocautery-based endoscopic resection. This technique also may be more cost-effective given the lack of the need for an electrocautery machine and prophylactic clip closure. Finally, the low risk of delayed bleeding and perforation coupled with standard recurrence rates makes this procedure generalizable for gastroenterologists.

### Cold snare endoscopic resection of nonpedunculated colorectal polyps larger than 10 mm: a systematic review and pooled-analysis [^116qzFij]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Hot snare polypectomy and EMR are the standard of care in resecting colorectal polyps ≥ 10 mm. To avoid the risk of electrocautery-induced damage, there is recent evidence about using cold snare polypectomy and cold EMR for such lesions. The aim of this pooled analysis is to report outcomes of cold snare resection for polyps ≥ 10 mm.

Methods

PubMed/Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases were searched up to July 2018 to identify studies that performed cold snare resection for colorectal polyps ≥ 10 mm. Primary outcomes were adverse events (bleeding, perforation, and postpolypectomy abdominal pain), and secondary outcomes were the rates of complete resection, overall residual polyp rates, and rates for adenomas versus sessile serrated polyps (SSPs). Subgroup analysis was performed focusing on lesion size, location, and resection technique.

Results

Eight studies were included in the final analysis that included 522 colorectal polyps with a mean polyp size of 17.5 mm (range, 10–60). The overall adverse event rate was 1.1% (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.2%-2.0%; I² = 0%). Intra- and postprocedural bleeding rates were .7% (95% CI, 0%-1.4%) and .5% (95% CI, .1%-1.2%), respectively, with abdominal pain rate being .6% (95% CI, .1%-1.3%). Polyps ≥ 20 mm had a higher intraprocedural bleeding rate of 1.3% (95% CI, .7%-3.3%) and abdominal pain rate of 1.2% (95% CI, .7%-3.0%) but no delayed bleedings. No perforations were reported. The complete resection rate was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.6%-100%). Overall pooled residual rates of polyps of any histology, adenomas, and SSPs were 4.1% (95% CI, .2%-8.4%), 11.1% (95% CI, 4.1%-18.1%), and 1.0% (95% CI, .4%-2.4%), respectively, during a follow-up period ranging from 154 to 258 days.

Conclusions

The results of this systematic review and pooled analysis were excellent with cold snare resection of colorectal polyps > 10 mm in terms of postpolypectomy bleeding, complete resection, and residual polyp rates. Randomized controlled trials comparing cold snare resection with hot snare resections of polyps ≥ 10 mm are required for further investigation.

### Impact of cold snare vs cold forceps resection of diminutive adenomas on segmental incomplete resection rate [^116JTAmv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polypectomy technique, for diminutive lesion resection, is variable among colonoscopists using either cold snare polypectomy (CSP) or cold forceps polypectomy (CFP). While it is well described that CSP is a preferred technique to resect small lesions, there is little data evaluating the impact resection techniques have on metachronous adenoma burden. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of incomplete resection attributable to CSP and CFP of diminutive adenomas.

Methods

This is a 2-center retrospective cohort study evaluating the segmental incomplete resection rate (S-IRR) of diminutive tubular adenomas (TA). S-IRR was calculated by subtracting the segmental metachronous adenoma rate in a specific colonic segment without adenoma from segments with adenoma on index colonoscopy. The primary outcome was the S-IRR of diminutive TA resected by CSP or CFP on index colonoscopy.

Results

A total of 1,504 patients were included in the analysis: 1,235 with TA < 6 mm and 269 with TA 6–9 mm as the most advanced lesion. The S-IRR in a segment that had a < 6-mm TA incompletely resected by CFP on index colonoscopy was 13%. The S-IRR in a segment that had a < 6-mm TA incompletely resected by CSP was 0%. Among 12 included colonoscopists, the range of overall S-IRR was 1.1%-24.4% with an average S-IRR of 10.3%.

Discussion

S-IRR was 13% higher with CFP resection of diminutive TA than with CSP. A proposed S-IRR metric of < 5% is a target goal for all diminutive polyp resection because 3/12 colonoscopists achieved this low rate. S-IRR can be used as a methodology to compare and quantify the difference in segmental metachronous adenoma burden across various polypectomy removal methods.

### Geometry of cold snare polypectomy and risk of incomplete resection [^111qAibd]. Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is safer than and equally efficacious as hot snare polypectomy (HSP) for the removal of small (< 10mm) colorectal polyps. The maximum polyp size that can be effectively managed by piecemeal CSP (p-CSP) without an excessive burden of recurrence is unknown.

Methods

Resection error risks (RERs), defined as the estimated likelihood of incomplete removal of adenomatous tissue for a single snare resection pass, for CSP and HSP were calculated, based on an incomplete resection rate. Polyp area, snare size, estimated number of resections, and optimal resection defect area were modeled. Overall risk of incomplete resection (RIR) was defined as RIR = 1 − (1 − p)ⁿ, where p is the RER and n the number of resections.

Results

A 40-mm polyp has a four times greater area than a 20-mm polyp (314.16mm² vs. 1256.64mm²), and requires three times more resections (11 vs. 33, respectively, assuming 8-mm piecemeal resection pieces for p-CSP). RIRs for a 40-mm polyp by HSP and p-CSP were 15.1%-23% and 40.74%-60.60% respectively.

Conclusion

RER is more important with p-CSP than with HSP. The number of resections, n, and consequently RIR increases with increasing polyp size. Given the overwhelming safety of CSP, specific techniques to minimize the RER should be studied and developed.

### AGA clinical practice update on appropriate and tailored polypectomy: expert review [^114JEVtZ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 9 — referral for challenging polypectomy — states to refer patients to endoscopic referral centers when size is ≥ 20 mm, location is challenging, or there is a recurrent polyp at a prior polypectomy site. Most neoplastic colonic polyps < 20 mm can and should be completely resected endoscopically, but polypectomy should not be initiated if the endoscopist lacks the time, equipment, or confidence to complete curative resection. Some polyps < 20 mm are not amenable to standard techniques (for example, long-pedicle pedunculated polyps; polyps in spastic, diverticular-laden segments; behind folds or sharp articulations; penetrating the appendiceal or diverticular orifices; extending to the dentate line; or into/beneath the ileocecal valve), and these patients should be referred to an advanced endoscopist before considering surgical resection; surgical referral is not indicated unless there are overt signs of cancer. Excessive cold biopsy forceps sampling and partial cold or thermal snare resection should be avoided because they may promote scarring and fibrosis that make curative resection more difficult, and lesion location should be documented relative to fixed anatomic structures or marked with tattooing for subsequent identification.

### A comparison of the resection rate for cold and hot snare polypectomy for 4–9 mm colorectal polyps: a multicentre randomised controlled trial (CRESCENT study) [^115pkwcy]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Interventions

All colonoscopies were performed with appropriate preparation by participating endoscopists who were certified by the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society or its equivalent. Standard high-definition videocolonoscopes were used, as per usual clinical practice. Magnification and image enhancement functions were not mandatory. A 10 mm round snare (Captivator II, Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) was used for polypectomy in all cases. Video recording of the procedures was not mandatory.

When a target polyp was identified, eligibility was assessed by its endoscopic findings, with its size estimated using the opening of the snare. The morphology was defined as per the Paris classification. Once eligibility of the polyp for the study was confirmed, the polyp was removed by HSP or CSP as randomly determined. Submucosal injection prior to snaring was permitted for HSP but not for CSP. When a polyp could not be removed using the CSP technique, use of a high-frequency electric current was permitted.

After resection, the mucosal defect was washed thoroughly and the marginal mucosa was carefully observed, with magnification and image enhancement used as necessary. When residual polyp tissue was recognised, additional removal using the allocated technique or biopsy forceps was performed. After absence of residual polyp tissue was confirmed by endoscopic inspection, biopsies of the marginal mucosa, from the right and left edges of the postpolypectomy mucosal defect, were performed.

Endoscopic haemostasis was carried out when active haemorrhage continued for ≥ 30 s, regardless of the treatment group. Preventive haemostasis, defined as prophylactic coagulation of vessels or red spots in the ulcer or clipping of a non-bleeding postpolypectomy mucosal defect, was allowed in the HSP group, but not in the CSP group. Characteristics of the polyp and procedure-related events were input via a web-based case report form.

### Efficacy and safety of cold versus hot snare polypectomy for small (5–9 mm) colorectal polyps: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^114M6s6z]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Resection techniques for small polyps include cold snare polypectomy (CSP) and hot snare polypectomy (HSP). This study compared CSP and HSP in 5–9mm polyps in terms of complete resection and adverse events.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized trial conducted in seven Spanish centers between February and November 2019. Patients with ≥ 1 5–9mm polyp were randomized to CSP or HSP, regardless of morphology or pit pattern. After polypectomy, two marginal biopsies were submitted to a pathologist who was blinded to polyp histology. Complete resection was defined as normal mucosa or burn artifacts in the biopsies. Abdominal pain was only assessed in patients without < 5mm or > 9mm polyps.

Results

496 patients were randomized: 237 (394 polyps) to CSP and 259 (397 polyps) to HSP. Complete polypectomy rates were 92.5% with CSP and 94.0% with HSP (difference 1.5%, 95% confidence interval -1.9% to 4.9%). Intraprocedural bleeding occurred during three CSPs (0.8%) and seven HSPs (1.8%) (P = 0.34). One lesion per group (0.4%) presented delayed hemorrhage. Post-colonoscopy abdominal pain presented similarly in both groups 1 hour after the procedure (CSP 18.8% vs. HSP 18.4%) but was higher in the HSP group after 5 hours (5.9% vs. 16.5%; P = 0.02). A higher proportion of patients were asymptomatic 24 hours after CSP than after HSP (97% vs. 86.4%; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

We observed no differences in complete resection and bleeding rates between CSP and HSP. CSP reduced the intensity and duration of post-colonoscopy abdominal pain.

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions-recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^116AUp2u]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Algorithm for the management of colorectal lesions — For non-pedunculated lesions, perform endoscopic imaging to predict pathology and treat by size: Diminutive (size ≤ 5 mm) with cold snare polypectomy; Small (size 6–9 mm) with cold snare polypectomy to achieve en bloc resection; and for Size ≥ 10 mm, use endoscopic imaging to identify the presence of submucosal invasion. For non-invasive lesions, manage Intermediate size (10–19 mm) with cold or hot snare polypectomy with or without submucosal injection and EMR for non-polypoid or suspected serrated lesions; for Large size (≥ 20 mm), use endoscopic mucosal resection, resect all grossly visible tissue in a single session, use viscous injection solution, apply adjuvant thermal ablation of post-EMR margin, and for lesions in right colon, prophylactic closure when feasible. For suspected submucosal invasion, Minimal or moderate risk for submucosal invasion is treated with EMR or ESD if complete resection is feasible and safe, whereas Suspected deep submucosal invasion warrants confirmatory biopsy and referral for surgical resection. For pedunculated lesions, Head size < 20 mm and stalk thickness < 5 mm are treated with hot snare polypectomy with transections at mid to lower stalk, and Head size ≥ 20 mm or stalk thickness ≥ 5 mm prompts prophylactic ligation of the stalk using detachable loop or clips.

### Cold versus hot snare polypectomy for colorectal polyps: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116XdqAV]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Endoscopic polypectomy is an excellent tool for colon cancer prevention. With the innovation of novel resection techniques, the best method is still being investigated. Hence, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cold snare polypectomy (CSP) versus hot snare polypectomy (HSP) for colorectal polyp resection.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizing evidence from randomized controlled trials retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, WOS, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL until July 16, 2022. We pooled dichotomous outcomes using risk ratio (RR) with the corresponding CI. This review's protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO with ID: CRD42022347496.

Results

We included 18 randomized controlled trials with a total of 4317 patients and 7509 polyps. Pooled RR favored HSP regarding the complete resection rate (RR: 0.96 with 95% CI: 0.95, 1, P = 0.03) and local recurrence incidence (RR: 5.74 with 95% CI: 1.27, 25.8, P = 0.02). Pooled RR favored CSP regarding the colonoscopy time (mean difference: -6.50 with 95% CI: -7.55, -5.44, P = 0.00001) and polypectomy time (mean difference: -57.36 with 95% CI: -81.74, -32.98, P = 0.00001). There was no difference regarding the incidence of immediate bleeding (P = 0.06) and perforation (P = 0.39); however, HSP was associated with more incidence of delayed bleeding (P = 0.01), abdominal pain (P = 0.007), and postresection syndrome (P = 0.02).

Discussion

HSP is associated with a higher complete resection and lower recurrence rates; however, HSP is also associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. Therefore, improving the complete resection rate with CSP still warrants more innovation, giving the technique safety and shorter procedure duration.

### Efficacy and safety of cold snare polypectomy for outpatient treatment of sessile polyps smaller than 10mm [^116USxxs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading gastrointestinal malignancy, with colorectal polyps recognized as key precancerous lesions. Screening colonoscopy is recommended as it reduces CRC-related mortality by enabling early detection and endoscopic removal of adenomatous polyps, thereby interrupting the adenoma-to-carcinoma progression. More than 90% of colonoscopically detected polyps are < 10 mm. Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is widely used due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and low complication rate. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) recommends CSP for sessile polyps < 10 mm. However, concerns persist regarding residual tumor due to specimen retrieval failure, inaccurate margin assessment, and the absence of cauterization compared with hot polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Incomplete resection has been linked to interval CRC in 19–30.8% of cases. Previous studies have evaluated CSP resection completeness through biopsies at the defect or margin, secondary EMR of the surrounding mucosa, or retrospective biopsy of the postoperative scar after 3 weeks. However, the limitations of pathology sampling of postoperative wounds may not be sufficient to assess the effectiveness of CSP. As the 'resect and discard' strategy is being discussed and promoted, real-time endoscopic diagnosis is of particular importance.

To address this limitation, we spread and stained postoperative CSP specimens with crystalline violet to facilitate precise margin identification, prepared pathological specimens, and conducted histopathological evaluation. Complete resection was assessed using endoscopic white-light and image-enhanced, and the results were compared with the pathologic diagnosis and final analysis of complete resection rates. Surgery-related complications and adverse events were also documented. To our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated CSP efficacy using this approach. This single-center prospective study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of CSP for sessile polyps < 10 mm in an outpatient setting, focusing on optical assessment of resection margins.

### Cold snare polypectomy for small colorectal polyps-quick and safe [^1114tTPC]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, these data suggest that CSP is safer than HSP for the removal of small, 4–10-mm polyps. CSP also obviates the need to prepare an electro-surgical generator or lifting solution for HSP, resulting in faster polypectomy and procedure times. Concerns about incomplete histologic resection appear to be unfounded, as there was no difference in successful tissue retrieval, en bloc resection, or complete histologic resection between groups. Limitations include the lack of endoscopic blinding and follow-up colonoscopy to confirm the bleeding site, particularly in patients who underwent concurrent large polyp resection. Nevertheless, these findings support the enthusiasm for CSP which, based on an improved safety and efficiency profile, appears poised to replace HSP for the routine resection of small colo-rectal polyps.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for colorectal polyps, more specifically with respect to endoscopic resection, flat and sessile polyps, ESGE 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing piecemeal cold snare endoscopic mucosal resection of carefully selected flat adenomas measuring 10–19 mm (granular homogeneous large nonpedunculated colorectal polyps), particularly in the right colon and especially when comorbidity levels are high, to reduce the risks of deep mural injury and delayed post-endoscopic mucosal resection bleeding.

### A comparison of the resection rate for cold and hot snare polypectomy for 4–9 mm colorectal polyps: a multicentre randomised controlled trial (CRESCENT study) [^116Lnykk]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The incomplete resection rates reported by Pohl et al are different from ours, with our rate of polyp residue being almost half of the rates they reported. Although the reasons for this difference in the rate of incomplete resection are not entirely clear, it is possible that we were more careful to examine for polyp residue at the time of polypectomy in our prospective randomised trial than examination performed in usual practice. Moreover, we provided a comparable high-quality examination for polyp residue for both CSP and HSP groups.

As we described above, the efficacy of CSP and HSP was evaluated in terms of residual polyp tissue as determined using additional EMR or biopsy specimen from the resection margin after polypectomy. Although the additional EMR technique would be more appropriate for evaluation of residual tissue, it is complicated and difficult to apply in a large-scale randomised controlled trial as EMR after HSP increases the potential risk of adverse events, such as post-EMR bleeding and perforation. Therefore, we adopted biopsies from the resection margins as the method to determine residual polyp tissue in our multicentre trial. Biopsy of tissue from the bottom margin of the defect after polypectomy was not adopted in the present study. However, a previous study reported that residual tissue with CSP was present in the lateral margins of the defect and not in the bottom margin. Therefore, the use of biopsy specimens obtained from opposing resection margins was appropriate.

In our trial, we used an electrocautery snare (Captivator II) in both allocated groups, which allowed us to compare the hot and cold technique specifically rather than the different polypectomy snare. Moreover, the completion rate of resection has been reported to be higher when using a dedicated snare than when using a non-dedicated snare. Therefore, our results of a comparable rate of complete resection for CSP and HSP would be valid, whether a dedicated or non-dedicated snare is used.

Delayed bleeding occurred for two polyps in the HSP group, with no occurrence in the CSP group. This supports previous reports of CSP as a safe procedure. Repici et al reported absence of delayed bleeding for a series of 1015 resections of polyps < 10 mm, among 823 patients. Furthermore, Horiuchi et al reported a low incidence rate of delayed bleeding after CSP even for patients on warfarin treatment. In our trial, preventive haemostasis was permitted only in the HSP group and not in the CSP group. However, the actual delayed bleeding rate was similar for both groups (0.5% in the HSP vs 0% in the CSP).

### A comparison of the resection rate for cold and hot snare polypectomy for 4–9 mm colorectal polyps: a multicentre randomised controlled trial (CRESCENT study) [^111wEYB3]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endoscopic polypectomy of colorectal adenomatous polyps is widely used to prevent the development of colorectal cancer and to reduce mortality. Hot snare polypectomy (HSP), which is performed with electrocautery, is conventionally used for polypectomy. However, cold snare polypectomy (CSP), which does not include electrocautery, has grown in popularity worldwide because of its technical ease and low incidence of adverse events, including haemorrhage and postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome. Furthermore, because the CSP technique does not require an electrosurgical system, submucosal injection and haemostasis, cost reduction would be expected if CSP has the same efficacy as the HSP technique. However, CSP carries a theoretical risk of polyp residue due to absence of the burning effect of electrocautery on surrounding tissues.

In a randomised controlled trial that included diminutive polyps ≤ 5 mm, the complete resection rate for CSP was higher than the rate for cold forceps polypectomy (CFP). In another randomised controlled trial that included polyps ≤ 7 mm, the complete resection rate for CSP was also higher than the rate for CFP. As for polyps 1–3 mm in size, a prospective observational study of the CFP technique for resection of diminutive polyps until no polyp was visible by chromoendoscopy demonstrated a high rate of complete resection with CFP. Therefore, the recent European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) clinical guidelines recommend the use of CSP as the preferred technique to remove diminutive polyps ≤ 5 mm, and CFP may be used for polyps 1–3 mm in size. The ESGE guideline also suggests CSP for sessile polyps 6–9 mm in size because of the safety of the CSP procedure. However, it is unknown if the complete resection rate for CSP for subcentimetre polyps is comparable to that for HSP. If the success rate of complete removal with CSP is inferior to that with HSP, then CSP cannot be accepted as a standard procedure due to the risk of residual adenomatous polyps. Therefore, our aim was to compare the rate of complete resection of 4–9 mm colorectal adenomatous polyps between CSP and HSP in a multicentre randomised controlled trial. In this way, we wanted to determine if CSP is not inferior to HSP for the resection of 4–9 mm colorectal adenomatous polyps.

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions-recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^111bien2]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Perforation prevention, recognition, and immediate endoscopic management after resection: Techniques to decrease the risk of capturing the muscularis propria include adequate submucosal injection and avoidance of a large snare size, and less tissue burn can result from full closure of a monofilament wire snare within a distance of < 1 cm between the thumb and the fingers coupled with a fast transection speed; microprocessor-controlled electrosurgical generators sense tissue impedance and adjust power to minimize deep tissue injury. Recognition features include that examination of the mucosal defect may show 2 concentric white rings of cauterized mucosa (inner ring muscularis propria resection, outer ring mucosal resection), and in deep resection the unstained muscularis propria contrasts with blue-stained submucosa, a defect target sign described to facilitate recognition of a deeper resection for endoscopic management. Deep mural injury has been observed in 10.2% of the EMR defect for large (≥ 20 mm) non-pedunculated lesions, with defect target signs and perforation observed in 3% of cases and associations including transverse colon location, en bloc resection of lesions ≥ 25 mm, and advanced pathology (high-grade dysplasia or submucosal invasive cancer). Endoscopic clipping techniques have been shown to be useful in cases of fresh small perforation or prophylactically when the resection appears deep into the muscularis propria; after defect closure, patients without clinical signs or symptoms of peritonitis can be discharged on a conservative diet (ie, nil per os with advancing as tolerated) and a course of oral antibiotics, whereas most patients with diffuse peritonitis from colonic perforation require surgery.

Patients and methods

Trial design

This is a multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled, parallel, non-inferiority study conducted at 12 Japanese institutions. Colorectal adenomatous polyps 4–9 mm in size detected during colonoscopy were randomly allocated to the HSP or CSP groups. After polyp resection, biopsy specimens from the resection margin were obtained to confirm complete resection of the polyps (figure 1). The complete resection rates in the HSP and CSP groups were compared. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each participating centre, and the protocol was not changed after the trial commenced. All patients provided their written informed consent before participating in the study. This study was registered in the university hospital medical information network, which is accepted as a primary registry from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, since 2007 as UMIN000018328.

### Management of the difficult colon polyp referred for resection: resect or rescope? [^1116h86J]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients are frequently referred for resection of difficult colon polyps. Before colectomy the experienced surgeon has the option of repeating the colonoscopy to assess the polyp, tattoo the site, and potentially remove the polyp. The purpose of this study was to review our results with this approach.

Methods

All new patients referred during a five-year period to an 11-physician colon and rectal surgical group with the diagnosis of colon polyp (CPT 211.3) that was not previously removed were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with rectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, previous cancer, or familial adenomatous polyposis were excluded. Patient demographics, details of the polyps, success of polypectomy, reasons for surgical resection, pathology, and complications were analyzed.

Results

The study population consisted of 252 patients with a mean age of 65 years. Eighty patients underwent resection upon referral without a repeat colonoscopy. Upon resection, invasive cancers were found in 13 cases. A total of 172 patients underwent at least one repeat colonoscopy by the colorectal surgeon. Of this group, 101 patients had successful polypectomy, thus avoiding major colectomy. The remaining 71 patients had a subsequent colon resection after at least one repeat colonoscopy. In 26 cases the polyp site was tattooed for later localization. There were nine postpolypectomy hemorrhages treated nonoperatively and two perforations.

Conclusions

Repeat colonoscopy by an experienced surgeon leads to complete removal and avoidance of major colectomy in 58 percent of these cases. Patients with large difficult polyps referred for resection should be considered for repeat colonoscopy before surgery.

### Residual adenoma after cold snare polypectomy for small colorectal adenomas: a prospective clinical study [^115sS8jq]. Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Endoscopic resection of all colonic adenomas prevents the occurrence of colon cancer and death. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinical Guideline recommends resection of all polyps predicted to be adenomas and cold snare polypectomy (CSP) for removal of adenomas ≤ 9mm on the basis of safety; however, it also states that this recommendation lacks adequate evidence of efficacy. The residual adenoma rate after resection is an important indicator of efficacy, but there have been no reports showing this prospectively. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the residual adenoma rate after CSP of small colonic polyps.

Methods

Between March 2015 and April 2017, patients who were endoscopically diagnosed with colorectal adenomas < 9mm underwent CSP, the site being marked with endoscopic clips. Patients with pathologically confirmed adenomas underwent follow-up colonoscopy 3 weeks after CSP and any post-CSP scars were biopsied. The primary endpoint was the presence of pathological residual adenoma 3 weeks after CSP.

Results

Overall, 126 lesions in 39 patients were removed and 125 (99.2%) were resected en bloc using CSP. Pathologically, 111 lesions (88.1%) were confirmed as adenomas (4.2 ± 1.5mm), with 36 of these (32.4%) determined to be R0 resections. No complications were observed. All 37 patients with pathologically confirmed adenomas underwent follow-up colonoscopy, and 102 of 111 scars were detected in 33 patients. One pathological residual adenoma (0.98%, 95% confidence interval 0.02%-5.3%) was identified.

Conclusions

CSP appears to be an effective treatment for diminutive and small colorectal adenomas, with a low residual adenoma rate.

### A randomized controlled trial of cold snare polypectomy technique: technique matters more than snare wire diameter [^1179iBNJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is safe and effective for the removal of small adenomas (≤ 10 mm); however, reported incomplete resection rates (IRRs) vary. The optimal CSP technique, where a wide margin of normal tissue is resected around the target lesion, and snare design have both been hypothesized to reduce the IRR after CSP. We sought to investigate the efficacy of a thin-wire versus thick-wire diameter snare on IRR, using the standardized CSP technique.

Methods

This was an international multicenter parallel design randomized trial with 17 endoscopists of varying experience (NCT02581254). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the use of a thin-wire (0.30 mm) or thick-wire (0.47 mm) snare for CSP of small (≤ 10 mm) colorectal polyps. The primary end point was the IRR as determined by the histologic assessment of the defect margin after polypectomy.

Results

Over 52 months to January 2020, 1,393 patients were eligible. A total of 660 patients with polyps (57.4% male) were randomized to a thin-wire (n = 339) or thick-wire (n = 321) snare. The overall IRR of the cohort was 1.5%. There was no significant difference in the IRR between the thin- and thick-wire arms; relative risk-0.41, 95% CI (0.11–1.56), P = 0.21. No significant differences were observed in the rate of adverse events.

Discussion

In this multicenter randomized trial, CSP is safe and effective with very low rates of incomplete resection independent of the diameter of the snare wire used. This suggests that the optimal operator technique is more important than the snare design alone in minimizing residual adenoma after CSP.

### Randomized controlled trial investigating cold snare and forceps polypectomy among small POLYPs in rates of complete resection: the TINYPOLYP trial [^112oFXuR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optimizing complete resection during colonoscopy is important because residual neoplastic tissue may play a role in interval cancers. The US Multi-Society Task Force recommends diminutive (≤ 5 mm) and small (6–9 mm) polyps be removed by cold snare polypectomy (CSP). However, evidence is less clear whether CSP retains significant advantage over cold forceps polypectomy (CFP) for polyps ≤ 3 mm.

Methods

This study is a single-center prospective noninferiority randomized clinical trial evaluating CFP and CSP for nonpedunculated polyps ≤ 3 mm. Patients 18 years and older undergoing colonoscopy for any indication were recruited. During each colonoscopy, polyps underwent block randomization to removal with CFP or CSP. After polypectomy, 2 biopsies were taken from the polypectomy margin. The primary noninferiority outcome was the complete resection rate, defined by absence of residual polyp in the margin biopsies.

Results

A total of 179 patients were included. Patients had similar distribution in age, sex, race/ethnicity, as well as indication of procedure. A total of 279 polyps ≤ 3 mm were identified, with 138 in the CSP group and 141 in the CFP group. Mean polypectomy time was longer for CSP compared with CFP (42.3 vs 23.2 seconds, P < 0.001), although a higher proportion of polyps removed by CFP were removed in more than 1 piece compared with CSP (15.6 vs 3.6%, P < 0.001). There were positive margin biopsies in 2 cases per cohort, with a complete resection rate of 98.3% in both groups. There was no significant difference in cohorts in complete resection rates (difference in complete resection rates was 0.057%, 95% confidence interval: -4.30% to 4.53%), demonstrating noninferiority of CFP compared with CSP.

Discussion

Use of CFP was noninferior to CSP in the complete resection of nonpedunculated polyps ≤ 3 mm. CSP required significantly more time to perform compared with CFP. CFP should be considered an acceptable alternative to CSP for removal of polyps ≤ 3 mm.

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions-recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^113Yr7ZC]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

US Multi-Society Task Force colorectal polypectomy — diminutive and small lesions recommendations and rationale: Most colorectal lesions are diminutive (≤ 5 mm), rarely harboring high-grade dysplasia or cancer (0.6%). We recommend against the use of hot biopsy forceps for polypectomy of diminutive (≤ 5 mm) and small (6–9 mm) lesions due to high incomplete resection rates, inadequate histopathologic specimens, and complication rates (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For lesions ≤ 2 mm, if cold snare polypectomy is technically difficult, jumbo or large-capacity forceps polypectomy may be considered (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), and cold forceps resection, if necessary, should thus be limited to diminutive lesions (≤ 2 mm). Hot forceps polypectomy has been associated with high rates of incomplete resection, ranging from 9% to 61%, and more than 1 bite is typically required (2.5 standard vs 2.2 jumbo). The use of enhanced imaging techniques, such as NBI, of the post-polypectomy defect has not improved completeness of resection.

Most studies used SM injection to allow better delineation of borders and a clear resection margin of at least 2 mm, with consistent observations of low recurrence (0%–10%), low immediate postpolypectomy bleeding (0%–3%), and no perforations. In one large series, c-EMR was as effective as conventional EMR for large SSLs but virtually eliminated the risks of bleeding and deep mural injury, which with hot EMR were 5.1% and 3.4%, respectively. CSP without SM injection was feasible for selected SSLs ≥ 10 mm, but CSP without SM injection is not recommended for resection of 10–14 mm adenomas.

Cold snare polypectomy for diminutive colorectal lesions — evidence summary: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 3 prospective studies on cold resection techniques for diminutive (≤ 5 mm) lesions showed a significantly lower incomplete polyp removal rate with the cold snare compared to cold forceps polypectomy (relative risk, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.14–0.67) without heterogeneity and reported no adverse events. These findings showing superiority of cold snare polypectomy compared to other cold techniques were replicated in a network meta-analysis and are strongest for lesions ≥ 4 mm. Cold snare polypectomy is described as a safe, effective, and efficient technique compared to hot polypectomy techniques, and in a randomized trial on 3–5 mm lesions, incomplete removal was 19.6% with cold snare versus 53.6% with hot forceps polypectomy (P < .0001), with no cases of perforation or delayed bleeding in either group.

### Cold snare versus cold forceps polypectomy for endoscopic resection of diminutive polyps: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114D71cu]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The practices for resection of diminutive colon polyps vary among endoscopists, and U.S. Multi-Society Task force guidelines recommend use of cold snare polypectomy (CSP) for this purpose. In this meta-analysis, we compared CSP and cold forceps polypectomy (CFP) for resection of diminutive polyps.

Methods

Several databases were reviewed to identify randomized controlled trials that compared CSP and CFP for resection of diminutive polyps. The study outcomes of interest were complete resection of all diminutive polyps, complete resection of polyps ≤ 3 mm in size, failure of tissue retrieval, and polypectomy time. For categorical variables, pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated; for continuous variables, mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs were calculated. Data were analyzed by using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed by using the I² statistic.

Results

We included 9 studies with 1037 patients. Rate of complete resection of all diminutive polyps was significantly higher in the CSP group (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.09–2.58). Subgroup analysis, including jumbo or large-capacity forceps, found no significant difference in complete resection between groups (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, .80–2.56). We found no significant between-groups in the rates of complete resection of polyps ≤ 3 mm in size (OR, .83; 95% CI, .30–2.31). Rate of failure of tissue retrieval was significantly higher in the CSP group (OR, 10.13; 95% CI, 2.29–44.74). No significant between-group difference was noted in polypectomy time.

Conclusions

CFP using large-capacity or jumbo biopsy forceps is noninferior to CSP for complete resection of diminutive polyps.

### A comparison of the resection rate for cold and hot snare polypectomy for 4–9 mm colorectal polyps: a multicentre randomised controlled trial (CRESCENT study) [^116Qp3J2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the success rate of cold snare polypectomy (CSP) for complete resection of 4–9mm colorectal adenomatous polyps compared with that of hot snare polypectomy (HSP).

Design

A prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled, parallel, non-inferiority trial conducted in 12 Japanese endoscopy units. Endoscopically diagnosed sessile adenomatous polyps, 4–9mm in size, were randomly assigned to the CSP or HSP group. After complete removal of the polyp using the allocated technique, biopsy specimens from the resection margin after polypectomy were obtained. The primary endpoint was the complete resection rate, defined as no evidence of adenomatous tissue in the biopsied specimens, among all pathologically confirmed adenomatous polyps.

Results

A total of 796 eligible polyps were detected in 538 of 912 patients screened for eligibility between September 2015 and August 2016. The complete resection rate for CSP was 98.2% compared with 97.4% for HSP. The non-inferiority of CSP for complete resection compared with HSP was confirmed by the +0.8% (90% CI -1.0 to 2.7) complete resection rate (non-inferiority p < 0.0001). Postoperative bleeding requiring endoscopic haemostasis occurred only in the HSP group (0.5%, 2 of 402 polyps).

Conclusions

The complete resection rate for CSP is not inferior to that for HSP. CSP can be one of the standard techniques for 4–9mm colorectal polyps. (Study registration: UMIN000018328).

### Cold snare polypectomy vs. hot snare polypectomy vs. argon plasma coagulation for small (5–9mm) left-sided colorectal polyps: a prospective randomized trial [^116moJyo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare recurrence rates among three endoscopic treatment modalities for 5–9 mm left-sided colorectal polyps.

Methods

Consecutive adults referred for elective colonoscopy (1/2015–1/2018) with at least one polyp of eligible size (5–9 mm) located distally to the splenic flexure were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three treatment modalities: (1) cold snare polypectomy (CSP), (2) hot snare polypectomy (HSP) and (3) argon plasma coagulation (APC) ablation (50–60 W, flow: 2l/min). The polyp site was marked with an endoscopic tattoo, and a follow-up colonoscopy with scar biopsies was performed > 6months after the index procedure. Outcomes were polyp recurrence rate and occurrence of complications.

Results

One hundred nineteen patients were enrolled, of whom 112 (62.5% males, mean age 61.1 ± 9.9years) with 121 polyps (CSP, 39; HSP, 45; APC, 37) returned for follow-up colonoscopy. Mean polyp size was 6.7 ± 0.91 mm, 58% were located in the sigmoid, 33% in the rectum and 8% in the descending colon. The majority of polyps resected by CSP or HSP were neoplastic (tubular adenomas: 25.9%, tubulovillous adenomas: 11.1% and sessile serrate adenomas/polyps: 17.5%). No cases of delayed bleeding or perforation occurred. Scar biopsies at follow-up colonoscopy (performed after a mean interval of 13.4 ± 3.8months) revealed 7 (5.8%) cases of polyp recurrence, showing no significant difference among the three treatment groups [CSP, 3/39 (7.7%); HSP, 1/45 (2.2%); APC, 2/37 (5.4%); P = 0.51).

Conclusions

CSP, HSP and APC-ablation are effective and well-tolerated treatment modalities for 5–9 mm left-sided colorectal polyps. The present randomized study did not detect any difference in polyp recurrence rate among the three endoscopic techniques.

### Rapid progression of residual rectal cancer after cold snare polypectomy [^112y3LJc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the possibilities of incomplete resection, CSP is recommended only for benign tumors. As the tumor progressed rapidly after CSP in this case, we suspect that the additional snaring was incomplete, and that more detailed observations were required before and after CSP. It has been reported that incomplete endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) might induce rapid tumor growth, and residual tumors after incomplete EMR showed higher Ki-67 expression levels than primary tumors; however, no reports have shown rapid progression after CSP. Thus, malignant tumors should not be resected with CSP because of the possibility of rapid tumor growth after incomplete CSP, in addition to the high possibilities of incomplete resection.

### JAG consensus statements for training and certification in colonoscopy [^113ET5bH]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Supportive evidence for improvement in task competency is lacking although one RCT reported significant improvements in the performance of polypectomy, control of upper GI bleeding and oesophageal dilatation following a hands-on course. Additionally, a recent evaluation study of the 1 day BSG-JAG developed pilot haemostasis course in two centres showed that trainee confidence increased in both in their understanding and delivery of main therapeutic techniques in the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

2.9: Polypectomy training should include skills acquisition incold snare, hot snare and basic lift-assisted polypectomy to a minimum of SMSA level 2.

Evidence: Low; Recommendation: Strong; Agreement: 100%

As SMSA level 2 competency is the minimum requirement for competency in colonoscopy, trainees should be familiar with all the different techniques that might be used in endoscopy to safely and effectively remove all such polyps. Cold biopsy polypectomy (CBP) is a technique used for diminutive polyps (≤ 5 mm) but has been associated with high rates of incomplete resection, with only 39% of polyps being completely resected using CBP. The use of jumbo biopsy forceps is superior to standard CBP for small, sessile polyps although the efficacy remains questionable (78.8% vs 50.7%). When CBP was compared with cold snare polypectomy (CSP), the rate of complete resection was significantly higher in the CSP group for diminutive and small colorectal polyps, although for those polyps < 4 mm complete resection rates were similar.

### Cold snare polypectomy versus cold forceps polypectomy for diminutive and small colorectal polyps: a randomized controlled trial [^116vg9mJ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal technique for removal of diminutive or small colorectal polyps is debatable.

Objective

To compare the complete resection rates of cold snare polypectomy (CSP) and cold forceps polypectomy (CFP) for the removal of adenomatous polyps ≤ 7 mm.

Design

Prospective randomized controlled study.

Setting

A university hospital.

Patients

A total of 139 patients who were found to have ≥ 1 colorectal adenomatous polyps ≤ 7 mm.

Interventions

Polyps were randomized to be treated with either CSP or CFP. After the initial polypectomy, additional EMR was performed at the polypectomy site to assess the presence of residual polyp tissue.

Main Outcome Measurements

Absence of residual polyp tissue in the EMR specimen of the polypectomy site was defined as complete resection.

Results

Among a total of 145 polyps, 128 (88.3%) were adenomatous polyps. The overall complete resection rate for adenomatous polyps was significantly higher in the CSP group compared with the CFP group (57/59, 96.6% vs 57/69, 82.6%; p = 0.011). Although the complete resection rates for adenomatous polyps ≤ 4 mm were not different (27/27, 100% vs 31/32, 96.9%; P = 1.000), the complete resection rates for adenomatous polyps sized 5 to 7 mm was significantly higher in the CSP group compared with the CFP group (30/32, 93.8% vs 26/37, 70.3%; p = 0.013).

Limitations

Single-center study.

Conclusion

CSP is recommended for the complete resection of colorectal adenomatous polyps ≤ 7 mm. (

Regarding therapeutic procedures for colorectal polyps, more specifically with respect to endoscopic resection, large nonpedunculated polyps, choice of procedure, USMSTF 2020 guidelines recommend to perform snare resection of all visibly apparent tissue of a lesion in a single colonoscopy session and in the minimum number of pieces possible, as prior failed attempts at resection are associated with higher risk for incomplete resection or recurrence.

### Endoscopic management of colorectal adenomas [^112Ygwba]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Endoscopic resection

Different endoscopic resection techniques are available and suggested by international guidelines. The indication for the different techniques is mainly based on the size and morphology of the lesion and on the likelihood of submucosal invasion. The recommendations for endoscopic resection in this article are based mainly on the ESGE guideline.

Diminutive polyps

As diminutive colonic polyps (≤ 5 mm) exhibit a low risk for cancer, different strategies have been proposed. If they are located in the rectosigmoid, resection is not mandatory when the lesion is predicted to be hyperplastic with high confidence ("diagnose and leave behind"). For all other (diminutive) polyps, endoscopic resection and histopathological examination are recommended. The "resect and discard" strategy may be an alternative strategy for diminutive polyps, but is recommended only for expert centers. The ESGE recommends cold snare polypectomy (CSP) as the preferred technique for polyps ≤ 5 mm, because it has been reported to be superior to cold biopsy forceps (CBF) in terms of complete resection. A randomized controlled trial that included 117 diminutive polyps in 54 consecutive patients showed significantly higher rates of complete resection in the CSP group compared to the CBF group. The procedure time was also shorter in the CSP group. When CSP is not technically possible or is difficult (polyp size 1–3 mm), the ESGE also suggests CBF resection. Use of jumbo forceps is then recommended because of their higher complete resection rates compared to standard forceps. For sessile polyps 6–9 mm in size, snare polypectomy is recommended because CBF resection is associated with a significantly higher rate of incomplete resection. According to the ESGE guideline, CSP should preferred over hot snare polypectomy (HSP) because of its superior safety profile, although clear evidence showing significant superiority of CSP is lacking. The German guideline recommends snare polypectomy and does not comment on CSP vs. HSP. For removal of sessile polyps 10–19 mm in size, HSP is recommended after submucosal injection to reduce deep thermal injury. However, for polyps with a narrow base, resection without prior injection might be appropriate. Complete " en bloc " resection for polyps ≥ 10 mm cannot be achieved with CSP. Pedunculated polyps should be resected with HSP. To prevent bleeding, large polyps (head ≥ 20 mm or stalk ≥ 10 mm) should pretreated with injection (saline/epinephrine) or mechanical devices (e.g. plastic loop or clip).

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions-recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^111Jstuo]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Pedunculated colorectal lesions — We recommend hot snare polypectomy to remove pedunculated lesions ≥ 10 mm (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We recommend prophylactic mechanical ligation of the stalk with a detachable loop or clips on pedunculated lesions with head ≥ 20 mm or with stalk thickness ≥ 5 mm to reduce immediate and delayed post-polypectomy bleeding. (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest retrieval of large pedunculated polyp specimens en bloc to ensure ability to assess resection margins, rather than dividing polyp heads to facilitate through the scope specimen retrieval. (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Large pedunculated lesions should be removed by hot snare polypectomy, transection should be at the middle to lower stalk to provide adequate specimen for histologic assessment of stalk invasion, and en bloc resection with marking or pinning of the stalk is a key component to accurate pathologic staging to assess the level of invasion.

Case 2

A 65-year-old man with a history of longstanding ulcerative colitis with a known colon mass lesion and previous biopsies showing low-grade adenomatous changes presented for a colonoscopy for removal of the lesion using distal cap–assisted EMR. A Paris IIa NICE II 4-cm lesion was found and submucosal injection was attempted to lift the lesion but was unsuccessful because of underlying submucosal fibrosis. Distal cap–assisted EMR with a cold snare (Exacto; Steris, Mentor, Ohio, USA) was then performed. The cold snare was introduced over the lesion, the endoscopist then used the suction through the snare and into the distal cap attachment, and the snare was closed blindly around the mucosa. The snare was then pushed out, and once the endoscopist deemed the amount of tissue in the snare was appropriate, the snare then was used to transect through the mucosa. This technique was continued until the polypoid tissue was completely removed. At the end of the resection, the tissue margins were examined to ensure there was no further polypoid tissue remaining. The total procedure time (calculated from scope in to scope out) was 53 minutes, and final pathology resulted as chronic inactive proctitis with no dysplasia (Video 1).

Conclusion

CSP is a safe and effective method for resecting sessile colorectal polyps < 10 mm. Even in outpatients, no additional laboratory tests or treatments were performed before, during, or after the procedure.

### AGA clinical practice update on appropriate and tailored polypectomy: expert review [^112JZcap]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Intermediate-size polypectomy (10–19 mm): Cold snare can be considered for most polyps 10–15 mm and may be reasonable for all SSLs ≥ 10 mm, whereas HSP, with or without SM injection, should be considered for larger/bulkier adenomas in the 10- to 19- mm range. An RCT comparing CSP, c-EMR, and h-EMR for 763 polyps 6–20 mm reported complete resection rates of 81.6%, 94.1%, and 95.5%, respectively, with a 53% incomplete resection rate in the 16–20 mm size range. Immediate bleeding was more frequent with cold techniques (9.4% for CSP and 4.4% for c-EMR vs 1.4% for h-EMR), while delayed bleeding was more common with h-EMR (2.6% vs 0.8% for CSP and 1.2% for c-EMR). In a prospective series of 440 neoplastic polyps resected with CSP, the incomplete resection rate was 2.3%, without significant differences between 5–9 mm (2%) and 10–15 mm (3.5%); the CSP group had no serious adverse events and shorter resection time (mean 60 seconds vs 100–174 seconds for other groups).

Statement 2a: Diminutive (≤ 5 mm) and small (6–9 mm) lesions — We recommend cold snare polypectomy to remove diminutive (≤ 5 mm) and small (6–9 mm) lesions due to high complete resection rates and safety profile (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). We recommend against the use of cold forceps polypectomy to remove diminutive (≤ 5 mm) lesions due to high rates of incomplete resection, though for diminutive lesions ≤ 2 mm, if cold snare polypectomy is technically difficult, jumbo or large-capacity forceps polypectomy may be considered (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We recommend against the use of hot biopsy forceps polypectomy for diminutive (≤ 5 mm) and small (6–9 mm) lesions due to high incomplete resection rates, inadequate histopathologic specimens, and complication rates (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### A comparison of the resection rate for cold and hot snare polypectomy for 4–9 mm colorectal polyps: a multicentre randomised controlled trial (CRESCENT study) [^114B424A]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the success rate of cold snare polypectomy (CSP) for complete resection of 4–9 mm colorectal adenomatous polyps compared with that of hot snare polypectomy (HSP).

Design

A prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled, parallel, non-inferiority trial conducted in 12 Japanese endoscopy units. Endoscopically diagnosed sessile adenomatous polyps, 4–9 mm in size, were randomly assigned to the CSP or HSP group. After complete removal of the polyp using the allocated technique, biopsy specimens from the resection margin after polypectomy were obtained. The primary endpoint was the complete resection rate, defined as no evidence of adenomatous tissue in the biopsied specimens, among all pathologically confirmed adenomatous polyps.

Results

A total of 796 eligible polyps were detected in 538 of 912 patients screened for eligibility between September 2015 and August 2016. The complete resection rate for CSP was 98.2% compared with 97.4% for HSP. The non-inferiority of CSP for complete resection compared with HSP was confirmed by the +0.8% (90% CI −1.0 to 2.7) complete resection rate (non-inferiority p < 0.0001). Postoperative bleeding requiring endoscopic haemostasis occurred only in the HSP group (0.5%, 2 of 402 polyps).

Conclusions

The complete resection rate for CSP is not inferior to that for HSP. CSP can be one of the standard techniques for 4–9 mm colorectal polyps. (Study registration: UMIN000018328)

### Cold snare polypectomy versus hot endoscopic mucosal resection for large nonpedunculated colorectal polyps: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113uZtpv]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to compare the risk of recurrence and adverse events (AEs) between cold snare polypectomy (CSP) and hot endoscopic mucosal resection (H-EMR) for large nonpedunculated colorectal polyps (LNPCPs). A systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases until August 2024 was performed for studies comparing recurrence, bleeding, and perforation rates between CSP and H-EMR for LNPCPs ≥ 15 mm. A random-effects meta-analysis, with heterogeneity measured with I2, was conducted to generate pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95%CIs. Four RCTs comprising 1516 LNPCPs (766 CSP and 750 H-EMR) in 1442 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. CSP demonstrated a higher recurrence risk at first surveillance colonoscopy than H-EMR in the pooled analysis (22.6% vs. 10.8%; RR 1.98; 95%CI 1.22–3.21; P = 0.02; moderate certainty evidence), corresponding to a number needed to harm of 9. Regarding AEs, CSP demonstrated a 67% reduced risk of delayed bleeding (1.2% vs. 3.9%; RR 0.33; 95%CI 0.12–0.89; P = 0.03; high certainty evidence), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 37. Although CSP appeared to reduce the risk of intraprocedural bleeding (10.0% vs. 19.8%; RR 0.30, 95%CI 0–52 256, P = 0.42), the wide confidence interval from the random-effects model included 1. There were no intraprocedural or delayed perforations in the CSP group.CSP has nearly double the recurrence risk of H-EMR for LNPCPs; however, its superior safety profile may make it a preferable option for patients where procedural safety is prioritized over radicality, such as those with extensive co-morbidities.

### Resection rates and safety profile of cold vs. hot snare polypectomy in polyps sized 5–10 mm and 11–20 mm [^116Bd4YL]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Hot snare (HS) is widely used for the resection of adenomas > 5 mm. The cold snare (CS) has a better safety profile and is more cost-effective. The aims of this study were to evaluate effectiveness and safety of CS polypectomy (CSP) compared to HS polypectomy (HSP) for adenomas sized 5–10 mm and 11–20 mm.

Methods

4018 colonoscopies performed within "quality certificate for screening colonoscopy" with one polypectomy of an adenoma sized 5–20 mm each were included. Retrieval rates, complete resection rates and complication rates were assessed and compared between CSP and HSP for adenomas sized 5–10 mm and 11–20 mm. Histologic subgroups were additionally assessed.

Results

Complete resection rates (5–10 mm: CSP: 89.4% vs. HSP: 87.9%, p = 0.33; 11–20 mm: CSP: 81.8% vs. 80.9%; p = 1), retrieval rates (5–10 mm: CSP: 99.5% vs. HSP: 99.4%, p = 0.76; 11–20 mm: CSP: 100% vs. HSP: 99%, p = 1) and complication rates (5–10 mm: CSP: 0.2% vs. HSP: 0.2%; p = 1; 11–20 mm: CSP: 0% vs. HSP: 1%, p = 1) were equal between CSP and HSP for adenomas sized 5–10 mm as well as 11–20 mm. For serrated adenomas sized 5–10 mm, HSP was superior to CSP (88.7% vs. 77.2%, p < 0.05) regarding the complete resection rate, but not for advanced adenomas (HSP: 89.1% vs. 87.3%, p = 0.69) or adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (HSP: 76.7% vs. 75%, p = 1).

Conclusion

This study further supports the use of CSP for polyps sized 5–10 mm and additionally suggests also using CSP for polyps sized 11–20 mm. These findings, as well as the best method for resection of serrated polyps should be validated in further studies.

Cold snare resection outcomes — In a small study, cold biopsy forceps were used in 12 of the patients to remove visible residual lesion around snared edges with no significant bleeding or perforation; the same group reported piecemeal removal of 94 lesions with a median size of 20 mm (range, 12–60 mm), followed 76.7% of patients with colonoscopy between 2 and 10 months and found a 9.7% local recurrence rate. For serrated lesions, one prospective series removed 163 lesions ≥ 10 mm (median size, 15 mm; range, 10–40 mm) and on short-term surveillance of the lesions (n = 134) at 6 months showed a single recurrence (0.6%), while another series removed 41 sessile serrated polyps (median size, 15 mm; range, 10–35 mm) using cold snare polypectomy without submucosal injection and reported that short-term surveillance colonoscopy in fewer than one-half of the patients at 6 months showed no recurrence.

### Intensive endoscopic resection for downstaging of polyp burden in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (J-FAPP study III): a multicenter prospective interventional study [^115HcR8m]. Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Colorectal polyps were removed according to the following procedure. First, polyps measuring ≥ 10 mm were removed. If the first colonoscopy session failed to remove all polyps measuring ≥ 10 mm, colonoscopy was repeated within 4 months until all such large polyps were removed. In principle, all lesions measuring ≥ 10 mm were collected and subjected to histopathological analysis. After all polyps measuring ≥ 10 mm were removed, polyps measuring ≥ 5 mm were then removed by colonoscopy to the greatest extent possible (a typical case is presented in Video 1), and only lesions that were suggestive of cancer were sent for histopathological examination. Next, polyps measuring < 5 mm were removed, if possible. The diameter of the snare sheath was 2.5 mm and polyps equal to or more than double the diameter of the snare sheath of the endoscope were considered to be ≥ 5 mm. After all polyps measuring ≥ 5 mm were deemed to be completely removed, the interval of colonoscopic examinations was extended to ≥ 4 months, but not to > 1 year.

Efforts were made to remove all polyps measuring ≥ 5 mm, with due attention paid to removing smaller polyps, if possible, during colonoscopic examinations in the follow-up period. If polyps measuring ≥ 5 mm remained, the next colonoscopic examination was performed within 4 months.

For removal of polyps, each facility was allowed to use its preferred procedure from among bipolar snare, monopolar snare, hot biopsy, and argon plasma coagulation (APC). However, the use of bipolar snares was recommended because there is almost no bleeding caused by the burning effect.

Indigo carmine dye was sprayed more than once for close observation of polyps during colonoscopic examination. Image-enhanced endoscopy and magnifying endoscopy were not essential.

The presence/absence of cancer, presence/absence of dense polyps, maximum polyp diameter, number of polyps removed, number of polyps collected, and highest grade of dysplasia were recorded for each of the six regions of the large intestine (i.e. cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum).

Study participants

Patients, ≥ 20 years of age, who underwent colonoscopy and had provided written informed consent were eligible for enrolment. The exclusion criteria included: (1) inflammatory bowel disease; (2) polyposis of the alimentary tract; (3) use of oral antithrombotic drugs; (4) pregnancy; (5) haemodialysis and (6) an American Society of Anaesthesiologists class III or higher. Only sessile adenomatous colorectal polyps 4–9 mm in size detected during colonoscopy were included in our study. To include only adenomatous polyps in our study, an endoscopic diagnosis of adenoma was made based on macroscopic appearance, findings on narrow band imaging (narrow-band imaging international colorectal endoscopic classification type 2)or the pit pattern classification (Kudo classification type III–IV). The following lesions detected during colonoscopy were ineligible for the study and were treated per usual clinical practice without randomisation even for those 4–9 mm in size: (1) depressed lesions and (2) lesions suspected to be cancerous based on endoscopic appearance. Only three polyps could be included from any one patient, with only one polyp included from each of the following areas: segment from the caecum to the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon and the rectum. When we detected polyps ≥ 10 mm or more than one polyp per segment, the ineligible polyps were treated per usual clinical practice.

### AGA clinical practice update on strategies to improve quality of screening and surveillance colonoscopy: expert review [^114qJeUj]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — polypectomy technique for small polyps specifies that cold snare polypectomy, aiming for a small rim of normal tissue around the polyp, should be used for nonpedunculated polyps 3–9 mm in size; forceps generally should be avoided for polypectomy and, if used in select cases, then "jumbo" forceps can be used for polyps ≤ 2 mm in size, and forceps should not be used as a primary modality for removal of polyps > 5 mm; polypectomy quality is variable in practice with residual neoplasia found in approximately 14% of post-polypectomy sites; compared with hot snare polypectomy, cold snare polypectomy is equally efficacious, substantially reduces the risk of delayed postpolypectomy bleeding, and likely reduces the risk of postpolypectomy-associated bleeding and perforation.

Non-pedunculated colorectal lesions (10–19 mm) — we suggest cold or hot snare polypectomy (with or without submucosal injection) to remove 10–19 mm non-pedunculated lesions (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Optimal methods for removal remain uncertain; however, EMR should be considered for non-polypoid and serrated lesions in the 10- to 19-mm size range. Conventional polypectomy for non-polypoid lesions ≥ 10 mm and proximal serrated lesions poses a challenge for complete endoscopic removal. In a study of EMR for proximal serrated lesions, mean size was 15.9 ± 5.3 mm with local recurrence 3.6% (95% CI, 0.5%–6.7%) during a mean follow-up of 25.5 ± 17.4 months, contrasting with a 31.0% incomplete resection rate reported with conventional polypectomy techniques.

### Effectiveness and safety of cold snare polypectomy and cold endoscopic mucosal resection for nonpedunculated colorectal polyps of 10–19 mm: a multicenter observational cohort study [^115cC6uP]. Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is the standard of care for the resection of small (< 10mm) colonic polyps. Limited data exist for its efficacy for medium-sized (10–19mm) nonpedunculated polyps, especially conventional adenomas. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of CSP/cold endoscopic mucosal resection (C-EMR) for medium-sized nonpedunculated colonic polyps. METHODS: A prospective multicenter observational study was conducted of all morphologically suitable nonpedunculated colonic polyps of 10–19mm removed by CSP/C-EMR between May 2018 and June 2021. Once resection was complete, multiple biopsies were taken of the margins circumferentially and centrally. The primary outcome was the incomplete resection rate (IRR), based on residual polyp in these biopsy specimens. Secondary outcomes were recurrence rate at first surveillance colonoscopy and rates of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: CSP/C-EMR was performed for 350 polyps (median size 15 mm; 266 [76.0%] Paris 0-IIa classification) in 295 patients. Submucosal injection was used for 87.1% (n = 305) of polyps. Histology showed 68.6% adenomas, 26.0% sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) without dysplasia, 4.0% SSL with dysplasia, and 1.4% hyperplastic polyps. The IRRs based on margin or central biopsies being positive were 1.7% (n = 6) and 0.3% (n = 1), respectively. The polyp recurrence rate was 1.7% (n = 4) at first surveillance colonoscopy - completed for 65.4% (n = 229) of polyps at a median interval of 9.7 months. AEs occurred in 3.4% (n = 10) of patients: four with post-polypectomy pain; three self-limiting post-polypectomy bleeds; two post-polypectomy-syndrome-like presentations; and one intraprocedural bleed treated with clips. There were no perforations. CONCLUSION: CSP/C-EMR for morphologically suitable nonpedunculated colonic polyps of 10–19mm is effective and safe, including for conventional adenomas. Rates of incomplete resection and recurrence were low, with few AEs. Studies directly comparing this method with hot snare resection are required.
