## Question

HIV 1 vs HIV 2

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 across epidemiology, virology, clinical course, diagnostics, treatment, and public health. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the global distribution and burden. Then, I should verify virologic and pathogenic differences. Next, I will assess clinical progression. After that, I need to check diagnostic algorithms and pitfalls, followed by therapeutic implications and resistance. Finally, I will consider special situations and summarize the practical takeaways.

> Let me first set the analytical frame and weigh the evidence sources carefully. I should prioritize high-credibility systematic reviews, guidelines, and surveillance reports, and use single-center or older studies only to illustrate mechanistic points, noting their limitations to avoid overinterpreting them, especially for HIV-2 where data are sparser [^112sL1CE] [^115d74gi].

> Epidemiology and distribution come first. HIV-1 accounts for roughly 95% of global infections and shows extensive subtype diversity with large regional variation, whereas HIV-2 remains uncommon and largely concentrated in West Africa, with limited spread elsewhere, including rare cases in Europe and the United States linked to migration [^112sL1CE] [^111hnJeg]. I should confirm U.S. data on type distribution and testing practices; indeed, since adoption of type-differentiating algorithms, HIV-2 diagnoses remain exceedingly rare in U.S. surveillance, comprising far less than 1% of reported HIV infections, underscoring the need to consider epidemiologic risk when interpreting tests that cross-react [^111gnVuN].

> Next, virology and pathogenicity. Let me consider viral load and replication first. HIV-2 generally has lower plasma and genital tract viral loads than HIV-1, with lower semen RNA levels by about 1.8 log10 copies/mL, and less frequent high-level shedding in the female genital tract, which plausibly contributes to lower transmissibility and slower spread [^114et8qd] [^117FtRDc]. Hold on, I should verify host–viral burden correlates; lower proviral DNA levels across CD4 strata in HIV-2 compared with HIV-1 support reduced replication dynamics and reservoir size, aligning with attenuated pathogenicity, although these data are from smaller cohorts and should be interpreted cautiously [^111HhCZx] [^116bh2c5]. But wait, what about receptor usage nuances sometimes cited for HIV-2, like CD4-independence in engineered clones; those observations are experimental and do not by themselves define clinical tropism, so I will flag them as mechanistic insights rather than clinical norms [^113SQ4Ld].

> Clinical progression and immunologic impact now. HIV-1 typically progresses more rapidly in untreated infection, while HIV-2 has a slower course with many long-term nonprogressors, although both can cause AIDS; immune activation tends to be lower in HIV-2 at comparable disease stages, with relatively preserved T- and B-cell phenotypes compared with HIV-1, which may help explain delayed immunologic decline [^116bh2c5] [^112srH24]. I should confirm that "slower" does not mean "benign"; HIV-2 can still lead to immunosuppression and opportunistic disease, so clinical vigilance is warranted despite the attenuated trajectory on average [^112sL1CE].

> Dual infection is often debated; let me examine that carefully. At first glance, one cohort suggested that individuals dually infected with HIV-1 and HIV-2 had markedly prolonged survival versus HIV-1 monoinfection, especially when HIV-2 preceded HIV-1, hinting at a protective effect, but I need to be cautious because of potential biases in cohort assembly and timing of diagnosis [^114mkxVc]. Hold on, I should verify with higher-level evidence; a subsequent systematic review and meta-analysis found no survival advantage for dual infection relative to HIV-1 alone and confirmed lower mortality with HIV-2 monoinfection versus HIV-1, which corrects the earlier impression and likely reflects control for confounding and lead-time effects in pooled analyses [^112cRmYz].

> Diagnostics next. I need to ensure we separate screening from differentiation and nucleic acid detection. Fourth-generation Ag/Ab screening assays have excellent sensitivity and specificity for detecting HIV infection and narrow the diagnostic window, but they do not differentiate type, so a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay is required to assign type, per CDC/Association of Public Health Laboratories algorithms and European recommendations; high-performing 4th-gen assays have near-perfect sensitivity across diverse HIV-1 subtypes and detect HIV-2 serologically, but type assignment hinges on the differentiation step [^113CPrZG] [^111gnVuN] [^111M2ozi]. Wait, let me verify practical pitfalls; significant cross-reactivity can misclassify HIV-2 as HIV-1 if reliance is placed on Western blots not designed for type specificity, with documented delays to correct diagnosis, underscoring the need for peptide-based differentiation assays or modern line immunoassays in ambiguous cases [^111Ba3JR] [^111Xs6sP].

> I should confirm nucleic acid testing caveats. HIV-1 viral load assays do not detect HIV-2, so they cannot be used to monitor HIV-2 disease or treatment response; HIV-2–specific RNA assays exist but are not widely standardized, and negative or low-level results should be interpreted alongside CD4 counts and clinical status to avoid missing treatment failure [^111Ba3JR] [^111M2ozi]. Hold on, I should double-check the algorithmic implication; when serology suggests HIV infection but the HIV-1 RNA is undetectable, clinicians must consider HIV-2 and pursue type-differentiating serology and, where available, HIV-2–specific NAT to avoid inappropriate management [^111gnVuN] [^111M2ozi].

> Therapeutic management now. Let me think about drug class activity first. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors lack clinical activity against HIV-2 and should be avoided; instead, first-line regimens for HIV-2 use nucleoside backbones with boosted protease inhibitors or integrase strand transfer inhibitors, chosen with attention to the distinct resistance patterns and limited trial data in HIV-2, per expert-informed guidance and diagnostic algorithm comments [^111QeDJS] [^111M2ozi]. I should confirm baseline resistance testing expectations; while HIV-1 guidelines endorse genotypic resistance testing at diagnosis and failure, HIV-2 resistance testing is less standardized but still important when available, and clinicians should not extrapolate NNRTI-era HIV-1 paradigms to HIV-2 because of intrinsic class insensitivity and differing protease/integrase resistance pathways [^116yeDZC] [^111QeDJS]. Hmm, wait a minute, what about virologic monitoring; again, HIV-1 viral load assays are not suitable for HIV-2, so treatment response assessment requires HIV-2–specific assays plus immunologic and clinical monitoring until broader standardization improves [^111M2ozi].

> Public health implications and surveillance deserve a quick check. Because HIV-2 remains rare outside West Africa, routine algorithms in low-prevalence regions still need to include type differentiation to prevent misclassification, even though the positive predictive value for HIV-2 will be low; programs should maintain capacity to identify HIV-2 where epidemiologic risk is present and to link patients to type-appropriate treatment and monitoring [^111gnVuN] [^112sL1CE]. Let me reconsider prevention angles briefly; the lower transmissibility of HIV-2 is consistent with lower genital tract viral burden, but standard prevention strategies remain indicated, and public health testing guidance continues to emphasize early detection using high-sensitivity assays with prompt linkage to care regardless of type [^117FtRDc] [^115d74gi].

> Special situations: infants and early infection. I should confirm that in perinatal and early-infant diagnosis, point-of-care nucleic acid tests can markedly improve access and timeliness of infant diagnosis in resource-limited settings, with high pooled sensitivity and specificity relative to laboratory NAT, though the evidence base is focused on sub-Saharan Africa and primarily addresses HIV-1 with variable inclusion of HIV-2, so programs must align index tests with local epidemiology and reference standards [^117Kscg9] [^112BW8Ju] [^112Hs5A9]. Hold on, I should verify the adult acute infection window; fourth-generation Ag/Ab assays detect infection within roughly two weeks for HIV-1, but early biomarkers can be altered by PrEP or early ART, complicating interpretation and reinforcing the need for nucleic acid testing in suspected acute infection when serology is discordant, a principle that extends to considering HIV-2 in appropriate risk contexts even though most acute detection data derive from HIV-1 [^113CPrZG] [^117CKHFL].

> Bottom line, to synthesize. HIV-1 is pandemic, more transmissible, and on average more virulent, with higher plasma and genital viral loads and faster progression, while HIV-2 is regionally concentrated, less transmissible, and slower to progress, yet still capable of causing AIDS; diagnostics must include type differentiation and HIV-2–appropriate NAT where indicated because HIV-1 viral load assays miss HIV-2, and therapy must avoid NNRTIs in HIV-2 and use PI- or INSTI-based regimens with awareness of distinct resistance pathways; earlier suggestions that dual infection confers survival benefit are not supported by meta-analysis, so management should be grounded in validated algorithms and type-specific pharmacology [^112sL1CE] [^114et8qd] [^112cRmYz] [^111gnVuN] [^111M2ozi] [^111QeDJS].

---

Regarding **global prevalence** and **clinical management**, HIV-1 is globally predominant [^112sL1CE] and more transmissible, while HIV-2 is concentrated in West Africa with lower transmission and slower progression [^116bh2c5]. HIV-2 is **intrinsically resistant to NNRTIs** and some PIs [^111QeDJS], requiring INSTI- or boosted PI-based regimens [^111M2ozi], and standard HIV-1 viral load assays do not detect HIV-2 [^111Ba3JR], necessitating type-specific testing [^115d74gi]. Accurate differentiation is essential for appropriate treatment and monitoring [^111gnVuN].

---

## Epidemiology and geographic distribution

HIV-1 accounts for **~95% of global infections** and is widespread across all continents [^112sL1CE], whereas **HIV-2** comprises ~3% of infections [^112sL1CE] and is mainly concentrated in West Africa, with limited spread to Europe, India, and the US [^112oSNYv] [^113QG6vT].

---

## Transmission rates and modes

Transmission efficiency is **higher for HIV-1 than HIV-2** across sexual, perinatal [^114mpx9T], and blood routes [^112sL1CE] [^116bh2c5]. Viral load and shedding are **typically lower in HIV-2** (in plasma [^112srH24] and the genital tract), contributing to reduced transmission [^114et8qd] [^117FtRDc].

---

## Clinical progression and disease severity

Progression is **faster in HIV-1**, which advances rapidly to AIDS without treatment [^112sL1CE], whereas HIV-2 progresses more slowly, with many long-term non-progressors [^111QeDJS]. Consequently, **mortality** from AIDS is lower in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 [^112cRmYz].

---

## Diagnostic challenges and methods

Cross-reactivity of antibodies can **complicate differentiation** [^111Xs6sP], and standard HIV-1 viral load assays do not detect HIV-2 [^111Ba3JR]. Therefore, **testing algorithms** should incorporate HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation tests and type-specific NATs for accurate diagnosis [^115d74gi] [^111M2ozi].

---

## Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and resistance

Intrinsic resistance of HIV-2 to **NNRTIs and some PIs** necessitates INSTI- or boosted PI-based regimens [^111QeDJS] [^111M2ozi]. Monitoring requires **type-specific assays** because standard HIV-1 viral load assays are ineffective for HIV-2 [^111Ba3JR] [^1122EWor].

---

## Immune response and pathogenesis

Immune activation is **lower in HIV-2**, with a slower CD4 decline, helping explain slower disease progression [^112srH24] [^116bh2c5]. CTL responses in HIV-2 are often **strong and Gag-specific**, supporting viral control [^113XwhLZ] [^1176iX75].

---

## Public health implications

Surveillance depends on **accurate differentiation** to inform both surveillance and clinical management [^113QG6vT]. Prevention should be **tailored to local epidemiology** and transmission dynamics [^112sL1CE] [^117Mfzum].

---

HIV-1 and HIV-2 differ in prevalence, transmission, progression, diagnostics, treatment, and immune responses; **accurate differentiation is essential** [^115d74gi] for effective management and public health planning.

Human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) is endemic in some countries in West Africa. Due to the lower prevalence in industrialized countries, there is limited experience and knowledge of the management of individuals living with HIV-2 in Europe. Compared to HIV-1, there are differential characteristics of HIV-2 regarding diagnostic procedures, the clinical course, and, most importantly, antiretroviral therapy. We integrated the published literature on HIV-2 (studies and reports on epidemiology, diagnostics, the clinical course, and treatment), as well as expert experience in diagnosing and clinical care to provide recommendations for a present standard of medical care for those living with HIV-2 in Western European countries. This includes an overview of strategies for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment, with suggestions for effective drug combinations for first- and second-line treatments, post-exposure prophylaxis, and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, as well as listings of mutations related to HIV-2 drug resistance and C-C motif chemokine receptor type 5 and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor type 4 coreceptor tropism.

### HIV type 2 in New York City, 2000–2008 [^111Ba3JR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Antibody cross-reactivity complicates differential diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 (HIV-2) using standard serologic screening and confirmatory tests for HIV. HIV type 1 (HIV-1) viral load testing does not detect HIV-2. Although HIV-2 is, in general, less pathogenic than HIV-1, it can lead to immunosuppression and clinical AIDS. Furthermore, there are important differences in the selection of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-2-related immunosuppression that make it imperative to differentiate between the two viruses. The New York City Department of Health seeks to facilitate accurate diagnosis and surveillance of HIV-2 infection in the city.
- **Methods**: We used routine HIV-1–2+O screening and a comprehensive algorithm to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. Additionally, we utilized universal HIV-related laboratory test reporting, population-based surveillance of HIV infection, and active communication with clinicians.
- **Results**: Between 1 June 2000 and 31 December 2008, 62 individuals received a diagnosis of confirmed or probable HIV-2 infection. The majority (60 out of 62 individuals or 96.8%) were foreign-born, with 96.7% born in Africa, and 93.5% identified as black race/ethnicity. At the time of initial diagnosis, 17.7% of patients with HIV-2 infection had AIDS. Forty patients (64.5%) received an initial diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. Among these patients, the median lag between the initial diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and identification of HIV-2 as the infecting organism was 487.5 days.
- **Conclusion**: HIV-2 should be ruled out in persons presenting for HIV testing.

### Geographic and population distributions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 circulating subtypes: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis (2010–2021) [^112sL1CE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Globally, 38.4 million people lived with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 2021. There are two lineages of HIV — namely, HIV-1 and HIV-2 — which originated from zoonotic transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus from nonhuman primates to humans. HIV-1 accounts for 95% of infections globally and is divided into four groups (M, N, O, and P), with group M containing nine distinct subtypes, or clades, the main ones being C, B, and A, which make up around 70% of the global distribution of HIV-1. Compared to HIV-1, HIV-2 is uncommon, slower progressing, and mostly concentrated in West Africa.

In 2021, 1.5 million new HIV infections and 650,000 AIDS-related deaths were reported. Despite a reduction in incidence over the last few decades due to improved treatment and prevention efforts, this decline in infections has slowed over the past five years — especially in key populations: sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWIDs), transgender individuals, and prison inmates. Understanding the prevalent HIV subtypes in these key populations is crucial for designing targeted prevention and intervention strategies. Overall, the diversity of HIV subtypes has important implications for vaccine development, where vaccines must elicit immune responses capable of effectively targeting the various subtypes of the virus.

### Impact of HIV-1 infection on herpes simplex virus type 2 genetic variability among co-infected individuals [^114YX5Nx]. Journal of Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the most common cause of genital ulcer disease worldwide. While the contribution of HSV-2 to the acquisition and course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been well described, less attention has been paid to the impact of HIV infection on the variability and pathophysiology of HSV-2 infection. The goal of the present study was to characterize genotypically and phenotypically the HSV-2 strains isolated from 12 patients infected by HIV-1 and from 12 HIV-negative patients.

Replication capacity analyses were conducted in Vero cells, and full-length nucleotide sequences were determined for glycoproteins B (gB), D (gD), G (gG), thymidine kinase (TK), and DNA polymerase (POL) HSV-2 genes. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were performed. No significant differences were found in terms of replication capacity. The interstrain nucleotide identities of the three glycoprotein genes (gB, gC, and gG) ranged from 99.5% to 100% among the 24 HSV-2 strains. The phylogenetic analysis showed no clustering of HSV-2 strains when correlated to the HIV status of the patients.

A lower variability was observed for the functional proteins TK and DNA polymerase, with 98.9% to 100% identity. Genetic analysis of TK evidenced mutations related to acyclovir resistance in two HSV-2 strains. No specific differences regarding replication capacity and gene sequence were found when comparing HSV-2 strains isolated from patients infected with HIV-1 and HIV-negative patients, suggesting that the virological properties of HSV-2 infection are not influenced by HIV status.

### Update on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-2 infection [^112oSNYv]. Clinical infectious diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) occurs mainly in West Africa, but an increasing number of cases have been recognized in Europe, India, and the United States. In this era of global integration, clinicians must be aware of when to consider the diagnosis of HIV-2 infection and how to test for this virus. Although there is debate regarding when therapy should be initiated and which regimen should be chosen, recent trials have provided important information on treatment options for HIV-2 infection. In this review, we present information on recent clinical advances in our understanding of HIV-2 infection and highlight remaining diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

### Clinical implications of HIV-1 minority variants [^113bo43Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Technological advances in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequencing have revolutionized the study of antiretroviral drug resistance and are increasingly moving from the laboratory to clinical practice. These techniques are able to detect HIV-1 drug resistance mutations present at low frequencies, not detectable by HIV-1 genotyping assays. For a number of commonly used antiretroviral medications, such as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, the detection of these drug-resistant minority variants significantly increases the risk of treatment failure.

The level of evidence, however, is insufficient to determine the impact of HIV-1 minority variants for several other classes of antiretroviral medications. Clinicians should be aware of the novel technologies that are moving into routine clinical use and the clinical implications of HIV-1 minority variants. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal platform for clinical application of these new technologies and to provide guidance to clinicians on the type and frequency of clinically important HIV-1 minority variants.

### Point-of-care tests detecting HIV nucleic acids for diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less [^117Kscg9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

To summarize the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care nucleic acid-based tests in detecting HIV-1/HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less who are exposed to HIV infection, this study was conducted.
- **Secondary objectives**: To investigate sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy estimates including the infant's or child's age, sample type, test type, site of index test evaluation, geographical location, and methodological quality of the included studies.

### An HIV diagnostic testing algorithm using the cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 qualitative assay for HIV type differentiation and confirmation [^111M2ozi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the predominant cause of AIDS worldwide, with approximately 38 million people infected. HIV-2, mainly found in West Africa, can also cause AIDS, with between 1 and 2 million people infected globally. The distinction between HIV-1 and HIV-2 is important for several reasons, including the following:

- **HIV-2 characteristics**: HIV-2 is less virulent than HIV-1, with lower viral loads and slower progression to opportunistic infections.

- **Viral load testing**: Selecting the appropriate type of viral load test to use for treatment monitoring is essential.

- **Antiretroviral treatment**: Some antiretroviral drugs, particularly nonnucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and some protease inhibitors, are not effective against HIV-2; thus, their use should be avoided in persons infected with HIV-2.

Coinfection with both HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses is possible. Approximately 1% of those with HIV-1 infection in West Africa are coinfected with HIV-2. While coinfection has no effect on the rate of progression to AIDS, it does complicate viral load monitoring and antiviral treatment.

As HIV-2 has spread outside West Africa, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) algorithm for HIV diagnosis includes testing for HIV-2 antibodies to enable differentiation from HIV-1 infections. The European guidelines on HIV testing and several European country guidelines also recommend differentiation between HIV-1 and HIV-2.

### Use of next-generation sequencing in a state-wide strategy of HIV-1 surveillance: Impact of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic on HIV-1 diagnosis and transmission [^115M4Y1m]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic posed an unprecedented threat to the management of other pandemics such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in the United States. The full impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the HIV-1 pandemic needs to be evaluated.
- **Methods**: All individuals with newly reported HIV-1 diagnoses from NC State Laboratory of Public Health were enrolled in this prospective observational study from 2018 to 2021. We used a sequencing-based recency assay to identify recent HIV-1 infections and to determine the days post-infection (DPI) for each person at the time of diagnosis.
- **Results**: Sequencing used diagnostic serum samples from 814 individuals with new HIV-1 diagnoses spanning this 4-year period. Characteristics of individuals diagnosed in 2020 differed from those in other years. People of color diagnosed in 2021 were, on average, 6 months delayed in their diagnosis compared to those diagnosed in 2020. There was a trend that genetic networks were more known for individuals diagnosed in 2021. We observed no major integrase resistance mutations over the course of the study.
- **Conclusions**: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may contribute to the spread of HIV-1. Public health resources need to focus on restoring HIV-1 testing and interrupting active, ongoing transmission.

### An HIV diagnostic testing algorithm using the cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 qualitative assay for HIV type differentiation and confirmation [^1122EWor]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

In persons at low or high risk for HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection, for which neither HIV status nor viral load was known prior to study inclusion, the NPA was > 99.7% for both targets, while the PPA was lower (36% to 78%). The primary reason for low PPA was positive serology results but undetectable HIV RNA. The discordant results were all HIV-1 or HIV-2 negative by cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qual and confirmed negative by alternative HIV-1 and HIV-2 NAT testing. Possible explanations for the discordant results include suppression of viral load by undisclosed antiretroviral drug use by the subject, such as antiretroviral therapy (ART) or preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), suppression by the host immune response as seen in elite controllers, or vaccine-induced seropositivity/reactivity since prior participation in an HIV vaccine trial was not known.

Additionally, directly comparing cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qual to an alternative HIV-1 (Aptima Qual) or HIV-2 (UW HIV-2 LDT) NAT in persons with known HIV infection, the PPA and OPA were very high (> 99.5% for both targets) with the one discordant result positive by cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qual and confirmed by alternative NAT testing, indicating a false-negative Aptima Qual result. In subjects at high risk for HIV-1 infection, the PPA, NPA, and OPA were all 100%. The challenges associated with use of NAT to confirm antibody/antigen reactivity after ART or PrEP use have been described in other studies. Consequently, the discordant results between serology and NAT testing identified in the comparison of the CDC and alternative algorithms are significant.

Testing for human immunodeficiency virus resistance in drug-naive individuals and in patients for whom antiretroviral treatment (ART) is failing, along with an appreciation for the role of testing, are crucial to the prevention and management of ART failure.

### Challenges for rapid molecular HIV diagnostics [^1123tbRR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The introduction of serological point-of-care assays 10 years ago dramatically changed how human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was identified and diagnosed. Testing at the point of care has led to a significant increase in the number of individuals who are screened and, most importantly, receive their HIV test result. As the AIDS epidemic continues to mature and scientific advances in prevention and treatment are evaluated and implemented, there is a need to identify acute (viremic preseroconversion) infections and to discriminate "window phase" infections from those that are serologically positive. This is especially crucial in resource-limited settings where the majority of vulnerable populations reside and the incidence of HIV infection is highest.

Rapid testing methods are now at a crossroads. There is an opportunity to implement and evaluate the incremental diagnostic usefulness of new test modalities that are based on sophisticated molecular diagnostic technologies, which can be performed in settings with minimal laboratory infrastructure. The way forward requires sound scientific judgment and the ability to further develop and implement these tests despite various technical, social, and operational hurdles to declare success.

### Geographic and population distributions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 circulating subtypes: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis (2010–2021) [^116SAHVe]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Not all geographic regions and countries were represented equally, with some countries having only one small-sized study or none at all, which may preclude us from drawing regional comparisons. For example, in China alone, we included over 100 papers — significantly more than any other country — making it overrepresentative of the Asia-Pacific region. Another element to consider with global estimates is that most participants included in the review came from China and the United States. To minimize these effects, we weighted the results against UNAIDS estimates of people with HIV at the regional level. Finally, the number of captured papers reporting on subtype prevalence changed over time, with more during the first period (2010–2015) than in the second (2016–2021).

Although we were interested in the circulation of HIV subtypes from 2010 onward, the year of data collection does not always equate to the year of diagnosis, meaning that our results may have included subtypes circulating before this cutoff date.

Despite these limitations, it is noteworthy that the high heterogeneity due to the inclusion of studies from different settings, including family planning clinics, HIV clinics, and community-based settings, has enabled us to capture a more representative HIV-infected population across the world.

### Increased survival among HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual-infected individuals compared to HIV-1 single-infected individuals [^114mkxVc]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this research was to compare survival times of HIV-1 single-infected individuals with those who are dual-infected with HIV-1 and HIV-2.
- **Design**: Prospective open cohort study.
- **Methods**: We analyzed data from 259 HIV-1-seroincident cases, either HIV-1 single-infected or dual-infected with HIV-1 and HIV-2. The cohort had a long follow-up period of approximately 20 years. This study focused on examining the influence of the type of infection and the order of infection on mortality. Variables such as sex and age at the date of HIV-1 infection were controlled in a Cox proportional-hazards model.
- **Results**: Dual-infected individuals had a 42% longer time from HIV-1 infection to death when compared to single-infected individuals. This observation holds true after adjusting for age differences between the groups. Notably, dual-infected individuals who acquired HIV-2 infection prior to HIV-1 infection exhibited more than a two-fold reduction in mortality risk during the follow-up period, compared to those only infected with HIV-1.
- **Conclusion**: The research establishes that survival time is significantly extended and the risk of progression to death is lower among individuals with dual HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections compared to those with a single HIV-1 infection. This natural inhibition has potential implications for the development of future HIV-1 vaccines and therapeutics.

### HIV testing outcomes among blacks or African Americans - 50 local U.S. jurisdictions accounting for the majority of new HIV diagnoses and seven states with disproportionate occurrences of HIV in rural areas, 2017 [^117Mfzum]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

The goal of HIV testing programs is to identify persons with HIV infection who are unaware of their status and to link all persons with HIV-positive test results to services. In 2017, 62.9% of CDC-funded tests and 68.9% of new diagnoses of HIV infection were in Phase-1 jurisdictions, among whom blacks accounted for more than 40% of tests (40.4%) and new diagnoses (47.5%). Blacks also accounted for 58.5% of persons with a previous diagnosis not known to be in care. Compared with whites, a higher percentage of blacks in Phase-1 jurisdictions received a new diagnosis (49.1%) or had previously received a diagnosis and were not known to be in care (58.5%).

This analysis found that HIV testing services supported by CDC funding are an important resource for identifying persons with new and previously diagnosed HIV infection who are not in care, especially in Phase-1 jurisdictions. Testing sites in Phase-1 jurisdictions are especially critical for blacks, who account for the largest numbers of persons tested, new diagnoses of HIV infection, and persons previously diagnosed not known to be in care. Factors such as stigma, comorbidities, and socioeconomic inequalities might increase blacks' risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV and limit access to quality health care, housing, and HIV prevention messaging. Delayed entry into HIV prevention and treatment, especially among blacks, leads to worse HIV care outcomes, such as delayed linkage to care and viral suppression. Although 79.2% of blacks with newly diagnosed HIV infection in Phase-1 jurisdictions were linked to HIV medical care.

### Point-of-care viral load tests to detect high HIV viral load in people living with HIV/AIDS attending health facilities [^111Am2Ug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

We included any primary study that compared the results of the POC VL index test to that of a central laboratory-based reference standard. This includes cross-sectional, prospective, and retrospective study designs or diagnostic accuracy studies performed within randomized trials, providing sufficient data to create the 2 × 2 table to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values. We excluded ecological studies and diagnostic case-control studies in which test performance was compared in participants with the target condition versus healthy controls, as specificity will be overestimated. We also excluded studies without a reference standard, case reports and case-series studies, animal or laboratory studies, reviews, discussion papers, non-research letters, commentaries, or editorials.

Participants included people infected with either HIV-1 or HIV-2, irrespective of age and gender, undergoing HIV/AIDS care or follow-up from any healthcare facility or geographical setting.

### Geographic and population distributions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 circulating subtypes: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis (2010–2021) [^111hnJeg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The three most prevalent HIV subtypes in people living with HIV worldwide are C (23.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 19.5%–26.5%]), followed by subtype A (16.7% [95% CI, 14.3%–19.1%]), then CRF01_AE (9.5% [95% CI, 5.0%–19.9%]). Combined, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) account for 29% of all circulating subtypes. Among CRFs, CRF01_AE makes up 42% of all global CRFs, followed by CRF07_BC (28%).

Of note, the "other/unknown" category also contains many recombinant forms but were not reported as such by the authors and, thus, have not been considered in the CRF/URF combined prevalence estimates. Regionally, CRFs predominate in West and Central Africa (CRF02_AG), the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (other CRFs), and Asia and the Pacific (CRF01_AE). Subtype B was primarily found in Western and Central Europe and North America (WCE/NA) and Latin America and the Caribbean (LATAM). Subtype C was reported primarily in Eastern and Southern Africa, while subtype A was most reported in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Few papers reported on subtypes F, G, H, and J; thus, sample sizes are small, and caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions from these estimates. A final table on unweighted subtypes reported by country can be found in the Supplementary Appendix 3, Table 5.

### Comparing HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection: Lessons for viral immunopathogenesis [^116bh2c5]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 share many similarities, including their basic gene arrangement, modes of transmission, intracellular replication pathways, and clinical consequences; both result in AIDS. However, HIV-2 is characterized by lower transmissibility and a reduced likelihood of progression to AIDS. The underlying mechanistic differences between these two infections illuminate broader issues of retroviral pathogenesis, which remain incompletely understood. Comparisons between these two infections from epidemiological, clinical, virologic, and immunologic viewpoints provide a basis for hypothesis generation and testing in this 'natural experiment' in viral pathogenesis.

In terms of epidemiology, HIV-2 remains largely confined to West Africa, whereas HIV-1 extends worldwide. Clinically, HIV-2 infected individuals seem to dichotomize, with most remaining long-term non-progressors, whereas most HIV-1 infected individuals progress. When clinical progression occurs, both diseases demonstrate very similar pathological processes, although progression in HIV-2 occurs at higher CD4 counts. Plasma viral loads are consistently lower in HIV-2, as are average levels of immune activation.

Significant differences exist between the two infections in all components of the immune system. For example, cellular responses to HIV-2 tend to be more polyfunctional and produce more IL-2. Humoral responses appear broader with lower magnitude intratype neutralization responses. Innate responses appear more robust, possibly through differential effects of tripartite motif protein isoform 5 alpha.

### Viral response to antiretroviral therapy in a patient coinfected with HIV type 1 and type 2 [^117NMkXB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical experience with the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 (HIV-2) infection is limited. Even more scarce is the information on therapy for patients coinfected with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2. Here, we describe the outcome for a coinfected patient in whom infection with both viruses was successfully controlled at the start of antiretroviral therapy. However, HIV-2 infection escaped control following a treatment simplification change, while HIV-1 remained undetectable.

### Point-of-care tests detecting HIV nucleic acids for diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less [^111GzFEZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

We summarized the main findings from the review, reporting the numbers of true-positives, true-negatives, false-positives, and false-negatives per 1000 tested in a summary of findings table. GRADE for Diagnostic Test Accuracy reviews is still under development. Rather than following any formal process for downgrading the evidence, we planned to fully describe the following concepts, which constitute an assessment of the strength of the evidence:

- **Precision of study estimates**: We focused on the accuracy and reliability of the data collected.
- **Heterogeneity in study findings**: Differences in outcomes across various studies were considered to understand variability.
- **Risk of bias**: Potential biases were evaluated to determine their impact on the study results.
- **Concerns about applicability**: We assessed the relevance of the study findings to different settings or populations.
- **Indirect test comparisons**: Comparisons between tests were evaluated for their contributions to the evidence.

These issues cover the key domains of GRADE (except publication bias) and would allow the evidence to be included in a GRADE assessment should a guideline developer wish to do so.

### Antiretroviral resistance testing in HIV-positive people [^1125PnBt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Resistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compromises treatment effectiveness, often leading to virological failure and mortality. Antiretroviral drug resistance tests may be used at the time of initiation of therapy or when treatment failure occurs, to inform the choice of ART regimen. Resistance tests (genotypic or phenotypic) are widely used in high‐income countries, but not in resource‐limited settings. This systematic review summarizes the relative merits of resistance testing in treatment-naive and treatment-exposed people living with HIV.
- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of antiretroviral resistance testing (genotypic or phenotypic) in reducing mortality and morbidity in HIV-positive people.
- **Search methods**: We attempted to identify all relevant studies, regardless of language or publication status, through searches of electronic databases and conference proceedings up to 26 January 2018. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 26 January 2018. We also searched Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and the Web of Science for publications from 1996 to 26 January 2018.

### HIV-1 load comparison using four commercial real-time assays [^1164qSec]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

The HIV-1 RNA viral load is commonly used for monitoring disease progression and the antiretroviral treatment of HIV-1-infected patients. Misestimating values could lead to inappropriate therapeutic management. The comparative performances, especially the ability to span the genetic diversity of HIV-1, of available automated real-time assays need to be evaluated. We conducted a prospective study with 74 consenting patients enrolled between March 2007 and November 2008. A blood sample was obtained at the time of diagnosis of HIV seropositivity and blindly tested for HIV-1 RNA by at least four commercial tests: the Abbott m2000 RealTime HIV-1, bioMérieux NucliSens EasyQ HIV-1, version 1.2 (v1.2), and Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan (CAP/CTM) v1.0 and v2.0 assays.

The means of difference were null between CAP/CTM v2.0 and Abbott for CRF02_AG subtypes but positive in favor of CAP/CTM v2.0 for genotype B and negative in favor of NucliSens for all genotypes. The standard deviation (SD) of difference ranged from 0.3 to 0.59, depending on the considered couples of assays. The reliabilities of these four tests, appreciated by the standard deviation of difference between the measurement and the estimated "true" viral load and by the coefficient of reliability, were significantly different (P < 10⁻⁴) among each other. Significant differences were also observed within each group of HIV-1 genotype. The global disparity was higher for CRF02_AG than for B subtypes. This study indicates a risk of viral load misestimation or discrepancies between techniques, depending on the HIV-1 genotype.

### Sensitivity and specificity of the new Bio-Rad HIV screening test, Access HIV combo V2 [^113CPrZG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 requires a screening test with high sensitivity and specificity, as well as a low detection limit for the HIV-1 p24 antigen to minimize the diagnostic window. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and p24 limit of detection of the Access HIV Combo V2 assay.
- **Sensitivity**: The retrospective part of the sensitivity analysis involved 452 HIV-1 positive samples from 403 chronic cases (including 9 different HIV-1 group M subtypes, 22 different HIV-1 group M CRFs, and 3 HIV-1 group O), 49 primary HIV-1 infections, and 103 HIV-2 positive samples assessed at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. Additionally, 600 untyped HIV-1, 10 subtype-D, and 159 untyped HIV-2 samples were assessed in Bio-Rad Laboratories.
- **Specificity**: The prospective part of the clinical specificity evaluation included all consecutive samples from two blood donor facilities and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (6,570 patients), tested with Access HIV Combo V2, Prism HIV O Plus (Abbott), Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo (Abbott) for Ag/Ab screening, and Procleix Ultrio (Gen Probe) for HIV RNA screening.
- **Limit of detection for p24 antigen**: This was assessed using recombinant virus-like particles (covering 10 HIV-1 group M subtypes/CRFs and HIV-1 group O).

The sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI)] of Access HIV Combo V2 was 100% (99.63–100) for HIV-1 chronic infection, 100% (98.55–100) for HIV-2 chronic infection, and 100% (93.00–100) for HIV-1 primary infection. Specificity (95% CI) was 99.98 (99.91–100). The limit of detection for the p24 antigen was around 0.43 IU/mL [interquartile range (0.38–0.56)], and it remained consistent across the 11 analyzed subtypes/CRFs.

### 25 years of HIV-1 research - progress and perspectives [^111PiahD]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Twenty-five years after the discovery and isolation of the human immunodeficiency virus by French and American scientists, much progress has been made in basic research, clinical treatment, and public health prevention measures for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Here, we summarize in brief the advances that have been achieved and provide some perspectives on future challenges.

### Antiretroviral drug resistance testing in adult HIV-1 infection: 2008 recommendations of an International AIDS Society-USA panel [^1134whCX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Resistance to antiretroviral drugs remains an important limitation to successful human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapy. Resistance testing can improve treatment outcomes for infected individuals. The availability of new drugs from various classes, the standardization of resistance assays, and the development of viral tropism tests necessitate new guidelines for resistance testing. The International AIDS Society-USA convened a panel of physicians and scientists with expertise in drug-resistant HIV-1, drug management, and patient care to review recently published data and presentations at scientific conferences and to provide updated recommendations.

Whenever possible, resistance testing is recommended at the time of HIV infection diagnosis as part of the initial comprehensive patient assessment, as well as in all cases of virologic failure. Tropism testing is recommended whenever the use of chemokine receptor 5 antagonists is contemplated. As the roll-out of antiretroviral therapy continues in developing countries, drug resistance monitoring for both subtype B and non-subtype B strains of HIV will become increasingly important.

### Inferring HIV-1 transmission networks and sources of epidemic spread in Africa with deep-sequence phylogenetic analysis [^112FDPa6]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

In 35 pairs, one individual had a CD4 cell count above 800 cells per mm³ blood, indicative of being close to the time of infection, while their partner was already immuno-compromised with a CD4 cell count below 400 cells per mm³ blood. The phylogenetically inferred source was consistent with clinical evidence in 19 out of 35 pairs, inconsistent in 5 out of 35 pairs, and could not be inferred reliably in 11 out of 35 pairs.

In two of the five inconsistent cases, CD4 data were only weakly indicative of the direction of transmission, and it is possible that we overestimated error rates for these pairs with CD4 data to 20.8% [9.2–40.5%] (Supplementary Note 4).

Amongst all pairs, the false discovery rate was 16.3% [8.8–28.3%]. Error rates varied slightly depending on the exact configuration of parameters in the phyloscanner analyses, though not substantially (Supplementary Tables 5–6). Similar error rates were observed in phylogenetic analysis of 454 deep-sequence data over a 320 bp region of the env gene among 33 couples with known direction of transmission and confirmed linked infection in the HPTN 052 trial.

Our findings are based on deep-sequencing of a population-based sample, thus extending previous results.

### Cross-reactive antibodies with the capacity to mediate HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-targeted antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity identified in HIV-2-infected individuals [^1176iX75]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

We show that robust intratype ADCC can be detected in plasma samples from both HIV-1-infected and HIV-2-infected individuals. ADCC targeted against Env of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 origin was also detected in individuals with dual HIV-1/HIV-2 infection. Moreover, the study reveals that a majority of HIV-2-infected individuals harbor antibodies that can mediate intertype cross-reactive ADCC against targets coated with a specific HIV-1 Env protein. The magnitude of this HIV-1 cross-reactive ADCC activity, identified in plasma samples from HIV-2-infected individuals, was in the range of that previously correlated with protective immunity. In addition, some HIV-2-infected individuals had ADCC-mediating antibodies broadly cross-reactive against HIV-1 Envs representing different subtypes.

In line with the study, the few previous studies that analyzed ADCC in HIV-2 infections also found frequent HIV-2 intratype ADCC activity. However, unlike in our study, intertype cross-reactive ADCC against HIV-1 was not detected. This difference may be due to differences between assays; previous studies were based on chromium 51 release from chronically infected monocytic cells, whereas we assessed %GzB + Env-coated CD4 + T cells. Exposure of Env epitopes may also differ; for example, epitopes in the CD4-bound confirmation have been reported to depend on the level of CD4 modulation by HIV-1 accessory proteins.

Another difference between the study and previous ones might be related to Env antigen variation, because earlier studies on HIV-1 ADCC activity within HIV-2 infections focused on different aspects.

### Current HIV-2 diagnostic strategy overestimates HIV-2 prevalence in China [^111Xs6sP]. Journal of Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

A significant number of HIV-2 infections have been reported in China using Western blot, as per guidelines for HIV-2 diagnosis in China. However, most specimens were also positive on the HIV-1 Western blot, suggesting cross-reactivity and possible overestimation. We carried out the study to evaluate a strategy to diagnose HIV-2 infections in China. A total of 119 specimens received from 16 provinces were likely to be HIV-2 positive when tested according to Chinese guidelines using the Genelabs Western blot (HIV Blot 2.2 WB).

Further testing by HIV-2 WB (Bio-Rad New LAV Blot II or Genelabs HIV Blot 1.2 WB) scored 56 (47.1%) of 119 samples with a banding pattern suggestive of HIV-2 infection, and 63 (52.9%) were HIV-2 indeterminate. A peptide-based HIV-1 and HIV-2 enzyme immunoassay for differential diagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections was validated and used. This in-house EIA demonstrated that only 1 (0.8%) of 119 specimens had HIV-2 specific antibodies, while 2 (1.7%) were dually reactive. These results were highly concordant (> 99%) with those by Inno-LIA HIV-I/II (Innogenetics, Belgium), which also use specific peptides for type-specific diagnosis.

Our data demonstrate that HIV-2 infection is rare in China, and HIV-2 Western blot may overestimate the prevalence of HIV-2 in a population with HIV-1. The HIV-2 diagnostic strategy in China needs to be revised to include more specific peptide-based immunoassays.

### Construction and characterization of CD4-independent infectious recombinant HIV-2 molecular clones [^113SQ4Ld]. Virus Research (2003). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) differ in their pathogenic mechanisms, as evidenced by a lower rate of disease progression, lower transmission rates, and lower viral load in peripheral blood for HIV-2. One of the many factors involved in these characteristics is the interaction between viral glycoproteins and cellular receptors. The study of these interactions in an HIV-2 model could lead to important conclusions regarding the pathogenesis and transmission mechanisms of HIV-2 infection.

Here, we report the design of a method enabling the construction of recombinant proviral HIV-2 DNAs in a moderate copy number plasmid that allows the analysis of env gene structure and functionality. This method constitutes an important tool for the study of HIV-2 env glycoproteins and for the mapping of genetic determinants of HIV-2 coreceptor usage and CD4-independent interaction. Furthermore, this knowledge will help in understanding the different pathogenic mechanisms of HIV-1 and HIV-2.

### Acute HIV-1 infection: What's new? Where are we going [^111kH1kv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

This supplemental issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is devoted to the important topic of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. It was prompted by the planning of the Acute HIV-1 Infection Meeting in Boston in September 2009, at which leading scientists and practitioners gathered to discuss new insights into the early, critical events of HIV-1 infection.

The reviews that follow underline the state of the field with regard to the transmission biology of HIV-1; the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of primary HIV-1 infection; the pathogenesis of primary HIV-1 infection; and innate and adaptive immune responses to the virus. We trust that these findings have the potential to influence the development of effective vaccine strategies.

### Lower levels of HIV RNA in semen in HIV-2 compared with HIV-1 infection: Implications for differences in transmission [^114et8qd]. AIDS (2006). Low credibility.

HIV-2 infection, in comparison with HIV-1, is characterized by lower plasma viral loads, slower CD4 cell count decline, decreased AIDS-related mortality, and lower rates of mother-to-child and sexual transmission. To gain further insight into why HIV-1 is more readily transmitted compared with HIV-2, we analyzed semen and plasma HIV RNA levels in HIV-1 and HIV-2-positive men from Senegal.
- **Design and methods**: Twenty-two HIV-1 and 10 HIV-2-infected subjects from the University of Dakar donated semen and blood samples for this analysis. HIV-1 and HIV-2 viral loads in semen and plasma were quantified using type-specific polymerase chain reaction assays.
- **Results**: The mean age of the subjects was 37 and 40 years; mean CD4 cell count was 222 and 276 cells/microl, and the mean plasma viral load was 4.7 and 3.0 log10 copies/ml for HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively (P = 0.002). HIV RNA was detected in semen in 21 of 22 (95%) of HIV-1 and seven of 10 (70%) of HIV-2-infected subjects (P = 0.07). However, the levels of HIV RNA present in semen were markedly different between those with HIV-1 and HIV-2, with a mean of 4.4 log10 copies/ml among those with HIV-1 and a mean of 2.6 log10 copies/ml among those with HIV-2 (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, plasma viral load and HIV type, but not CD4 cell count, were independently predictive of semen viral load (P = 0.03, 0.05, 0.48, respectively).
- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that differences in semen viral load between HIV-1 and HIV-2 may be in part responsible for the markedly different transmission rates.

### Feasibility of HIV point-of-care tests for resource-limited settings: Challenges and solutions [^116Cz2Dh]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Globally, the number of persons living with HIV increased from 34 million (31.4 to 35.9 million) in 2011 to an estimated 35.3 million (32.2 to 38.8 million) in 2012; approximately 69% of the global HIV burden resides in sub-Saharan Africa. In response to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) programs, a drop in AIDS-related deaths from 2.3 million (2.1 to 2.6 million) in 2005 to 1.6 million (1.4 to 1.9 million) in 2012 has been recorded. To reach the expected 2020 goals, a massive increase in HIV testing capacity will be required.

The expansion of ART programs can only be described as a huge success in low- and middle-income countries. Estimates reached 9.7 million on ART at the end of 2012, representing about 60% of those in need at that time. With the new World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines changing the CD4 test threshold for treatment initiation from mid-2013, the number of individuals infected with HIV potentially requiring access to treatment increased to an estimated 28.6 million. Challenges to continued ART scale-up remain, and include improving access to HIV testing, ensuring universal access to testing, initiating treatment earlier through improved access to HIV testing, ensuring subsequent linkage to care, and finally, long-term retention in care. Each phase of HIV diagnosis and monitoring is supported by a number of tests conducted according to different algorithms in many high-burden countries, each with human and technical resource requirements. HIV rapid tests are used in adults in serial or parallel algorithms.

### Antiretroviral resistance testing in HIV-positive people [^111FgKp8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Resistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compromises treatment effectiveness, often leading to virological failure and mortality. Antiretroviral drug resistance tests may be used at the time of initiation of therapy, or when treatment failure occurs, to inform the choice of ART regimen. Resistance tests (genotypic or phenotypic) are widely used in high-income countries, but not in resource-limited settings. This systematic review summarizes the relative merits of resistance testing in treatment-naive and treatment-exposed people living with HIV.

We excluded 92 articles after critically reading the full texts. Full details of the excluded studies are provided in the characteristics of excluded studies section. In summary, six were duplicates, one was a primary study with an ineligible population (exclusively ART‐naive population retrieved from a household community survey, not from an HIV/AIDS care centre) [Moyo 2016]. Nineteen included ineligible index tests, four studies had ineligible target conditions, and 58 were ineligible study types including reviews, editorials, perspectives, protocols, conference abstracts with incomplete data, and non-accuracy studies. Two studies evaluated the accuracy of the tests at the sample level, and we could not construct 2 × 2 tables for two studies.

### Differences in proviral DNA load between HIV-1- and HIV-2-infected patients [^111HhCZx]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

The lesser pathogenicity of HIV-2 relative to HIV-1 is generally attributed to its slower replication. To compare the amounts of total HIV DNA during human HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection, we developed a quantitative real-time PCR method with a unique external quantification standard based on a single plasmid harboring both the HIV-1 and the HIV-2 LTR.
- **Methods**: Viral DNA load was compared between 40 HIV-1-infected and 42 HIV-2-infected antiretroviral-naive patients.
- **Results**: The difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2 proviral DNA load was highly significant in patients with CD4 cell counts > 500 cells/microl [HIV-1: n = 14; median, 2.5; interquartile range (IQR), 2.1–2.7; HIV-2: n = 22; median, 1.6; IQR, 1.0–2.0] and in patients with CD4 cell counts between 300 cells/microl and 500 cells/microl [HIV-1: n = 12; median, 2.7; IQR, 2.3–2.8; HIV-2: n = 11; median, 2.0; IQR, 1.0–2.4]. Too few HIV-2-infected patients had CD4 cell counts < 300 cells/microl to detect a significant difference, but DNA values were again lower in HIV-2-infected patients [HIV-1: n = 14; median, 2.9; IQR, 2.2–3.2; HIV-2: n = 9; median, 2.7; IQR, 2.2–3.3].
- **Conclusions**: These differences are in line with the natural histories of the two infections and show that HIV-2 infection is a valid model for studying the pathophysiology of HIV infection in general.

### HIV-2 infection surveillance — United States, 1987–2009 [^113QG6vT]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is categorized into two types, HIV-1 and HIV-2. Worldwide, most HIV infections are HIV-1, whereas HIV-2 largely has been confined to persons in or from West Africa. HIV-1 and HIV-2 have the same routes of transmission, and both can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, HIV-2 infections should be differentiated from HIV-1 infections because they are less likely to cause AIDS and their clinical management differs. The CDC's surveillance case definition for HIV infection applies to both variants of HIV but lacks criteria for differentiating between HIV-1 and HIV-2.

To enumerate and describe HIV-2 cases reported in the United States, a working case definition was developed. During 1988 to June 2010, a total of 242 HIV-2 cases were reported to the CDC. Of these, 166 met the working definition. These HIV-2 cases were concentrated in the Northeast (66%, including 46% in New York City) and occurred primarily among persons born in West Africa (81%). Ninety-seven of the HIV-2 cases also had a positive HIV-1 immunoblot antibody test result (e.g. Western blot). Immunoblot antibody tests currently used to confirm HIV reactive screening tests do not contain reagents specific to HIV-2 and thus are not reliable for the identification of HIV-2 infections.

Additional testing specific to HIV-2 should be considered if HIV-1 test results are atypical or inconsistent with clinical findings, especially for persons from West Africa. If an HIV case is reported to the health department but subsequently identified as HIV-2, health-care providers should take necessary steps to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### Trends in HIV-2 diagnoses and use of the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test - United States, 2010–2017 [^111gnVuN]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

Since 2014, the recommended laboratory testing algorithm for diagnosing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has included a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test to confirm the infection type based on the presence of type-specific antibodies. Correctly identifying HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections is vital because their epidemiology and clinical management differ.

To describe the percentage of diagnoses for which an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test result was reported and to categorize HIV type based on laboratory test results, data from CDC's National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) from 2010–2017 were analyzed. During this period, there was a substantial increase in the number of HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test results reported to NHSS, consistent with the implementation of the HIV laboratory-based testing algorithm recommended in 2014. However, more than 99.9% of all HIV infections identified in the United States were categorized as HIV-1, and the number of HIV-2 diagnoses (mono-infection or dual-infection) remained extremely low, accounting for less than 0.03% of all HIV infections. In addition, the overall number of false positive HIV-2 test results produced by the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation increased.

The diagnostic value of a confirmatory antibody differentiation test in a setting with sensitive and specific screening tests and few HIV-2 infections might be limited. Evaluation and consideration of other HIV tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that might increase efficiencies in the CDC and Association of Public Health Laboratories-recommended HIV testing algorithm are warranted.

### Point-of-care tests detecting HIV nucleic acids for diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less [^116WKzD5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The standard method of diagnosing HIV in infants and children less than 18 months is with a nucleic acid amplification test reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test (NAT RT‐PCR) detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). Laboratory testing using the RT‐PCR platform for HIV infection is limited by poor access, logistical support, and delays in relaying test results and initiating therapy in low‐resource settings. The use of rapid diagnostic tests at or near the point‐of‐care (POC) can increase access to early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants and children less than 18 months of age and timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
- **Objectives**: To summarize the diagnostic accuracy of point‐of‐care nucleic acid‐based testing (POC NAT) to detect HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less exposed to HIV infection.
- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (until 2 February 2021), MEDLINE and Embase (until 1 February 2021), and LILACS and Web of Science (until 2 February 2021) with no language or publication status restriction. We also searched conference websites and clinical trial registries, tracked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted experts for potentially eligible studies.
- **Selection criteria**: We defined POC tests as rapid diagnostic tests conducted at or near the patient site. We included any primary study that compared the results of a POC NAT to a reference standard of laboratory NAT RT‐PCR or total nucleic acid.

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV infection in adults: 2018 recommendations of the International Antiviral Society-USA panel [^1168wwq1]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for human immunodeficiency virus infection, particularly concerning baseline laboratory investigations, the IAS 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests prior to initiating ART:

- **HIV RNA level**: Necessary for monitoring viral load.
- **CD4 cell count**: Assesses immune system health.
- **Reverse transcriptase and protease genotype**: Critical for evaluating drug resistance.
- **Complete blood cell count**: Provides overall health indicators.
- **Kidney and liver function tests (LFTs)**: Essential for assessing organ health.
- **Lipid levels, glucose level, and pregnancy status**: Important for detecting metabolic issues and ensuring safe treatment in pregnancy.
- **Screening for**: Hepatitis A, B, and C; tuberculosis; and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

### HIV-1 infection using dried blood spots can be confirmed by Bio-Rad Geenius™ HIV 1/2 confirmatory assay [^1176VZpA]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Confirmatory assays for HIV diagnosis are not well implemented in low-income countries with limited infrastructure. The Geenius™ HIV 1/2 Confirmatory Assay is a single-use immunochromatographic test designed for the confirmation and differentiation of individual HIV-1/2 antibodies validated in venous whole blood, serum, and plasma. However, dried blood specimens (DBS) are easier to collect, store, and transport than plasma/serum in remote settings of limited-resource countries and mobile populations.
- **Objectives**: To evaluate the confirmatory assay Geenius™ HIV 1/2 for HIV diagnosis using DBS specimens.
- **Study design**: We collected DBS from 70 Guinean women previously diagnosed as HIV-1 infected by rapid tests using whole blood samples in Equatorial Guinea, and from 25 HIV-negative Guinean women and HIV-exposed infants diagnosed by molecular testing in Madrid. Geenius™ HIV 1/2 was performed by eluting two drops of dried blood from each patient and following the manufacturer's instructions for the assay, using 40μl of the eluted blood as specimen. The results obtained were confirmed by western blot.
- **Results**: Geenius™ HIV 1/2 successfully confirmed the HIV-1 positive and negative infection in all tested DBS specimens, providing 100% specificity [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 86.2%-100%]. No HIV 1/2 coinfections were found in the study cohort. This is the first report that demonstrates a good performance of Geenius™ HIV 1/2 for the HIV-1 infection confirmation using only two drops of dried blood.

Conclusions

Our results approve the utility of this confirmatory assay using DBS when a

### Human immunodeficiency virus continuum of care in 11 European Union countries at the end of 2016 overall and by key population: Have we made progress [^114ELp9U]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

There were no marked differences across the outcomes of the CoC between women (89% of female PLHIV were diagnosed, 92% of those diagnosed had ever initiated ART, and 89% of those who had ever initiated ART were virally suppressed) and men (87%, 92%, and 92%, respectively).

The proportion diagnosed among estimated PLHIV ranged from 74% in Croatia to 93% in Denmark. Three of the 11 countries had achieved the first 90 target (Austria, Denmark, and the United Kingdom), while the remaining eight countries were below it: Netherlands (89%), Sweden (89%), Italy (88%), Germany (87%), France (86%), Spain (86%), Greece (81%), and Croatia (74%). Of those diagnosed, the proportion ever on ART ranged from 88% in Greece to 97% in the Netherlands. Nine countries (Austria, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) achieved ≥ 90% of those diagnosed ever on ART. The proportions virally suppressed among those who ever initiated ART ranged from 82% in Greece to 96% in Denmark. Eight countries (Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) achieved ≥ 90% of viral suppression. Only Denmark achieved ≥ 90% for each of the three continuum stages. For the substantive target, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom reached ≥ 73% of all PLHIV virally suppressed, while Italy was very close at 71%.

### Antiretroviral drug resistance testing in adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1: 2003 recommendations of an International AIDS Society-USA Panel [^1145H4Tp]. Clinical infectious diseases (2003). Low credibility.

New information about the benefits and limitations of testing for resistance to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) drugs has emerged. The International AIDS Society-USA convened a panel of physicians and scientists with expertise in antiretroviral drug management, HIV-1 drug resistance, and patient care to provide updated recommendations for HIV-1 resistance testing. Published data and presentations at scientific conferences, as well as the strength of the evidence, were considered. Properly used resistance testing can improve virological outcomes among HIV-infected individuals. Resistance testing is recommended in cases of acute or recent HIV infection, for certain patients who have been infected as long as 2 years or more prior to initiating therapy, in cases of antiretroviral failure, and during pregnancy. Limitations of resistance testing remain, and more study is needed to refine optimal use and interpretation.

### Hla-associated polymorphisms in the HIV-2 capsid highlight key differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 immune adaptation [^113XwhLZ]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses are thought to play an important role in HIV-1 control. A hallmark of HIV-1 evolution, however, is the rapid appearance of mutations within CTL epitopes, leading to a loss of CTL recognition and immune control. HIV-2 differs from HIV-1 in that a substantial proportion of infected people maintain undetectable plasma viral loads for decades with no signs of immunodeficiency. Many others have viral loads 30-fold lower than HIV-1 at equivalent disease stages. We have previously demonstrated a strong correlation between the presence of high-frequency HIV-2 Gag-specific CTLs and viral control. As HIV-2 is able to generate resistance mutations akin to HIV-1 under antiretroviral pressure, HIV-2 should also have the capacity to adapt to immune responses similar to HIV-1.

Establishing similarities and differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 immune evasion strategies has the potential to enhance our understanding of HIV pathogenesis. HIV-1 p24 and HIV-2 p26 represent the two major CTL-targeted proteins in these viruses. Here, we provide the first comparison of selective pressure in HIV-1 p24 and HIV-2 p26 capsid sequences from a community cohort in Guinea-Bissau, along with HLA-associated viral polymorphisms in HIV-2, which may represent CTL-driven adaptive changes.

### Sensitivity and specificity of the new Bio-Rad HIV screening test, Access HIV combo V2 [^1164zzFn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

The first target to achieve the 2025 World Health Organization target of ending the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic is that at least 95% of people living with HIV know their status. HIV diagnosis faces three main challenges. Firstly, it must detect antibodies directed toward a remarkable range of diverse antigens from both HIV-1 and HIV-2. Secondly, as a non-negligible part of HIV transmission occurs early after an infection, the diagnostic window should be as reduced as possible. As a consequence, the assay must detect the HIV-1 specific p24 antigen at the lowest limit of detection possible. Lastly, because a false positive HIV diagnosis can have deleterious consequences, high specificity is required.

HIV diagnostic tests have remarkably improved since the beginning of the HIV pandemic. Recommended tests, or fourth-generation assays, are able to detect all circulating variants with high sensitivity and specificity, with a diagnostic window of about two weeks after infection.

The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of Bio-Rad's new fourth-generation HIV test, Access HIV combo V2, in both real-life settings and well-characterized commercial panels. Additionally, we aimed to establish its limit of detection for the p24 antigen using diverse, well-characterized commercial panels.

### Point-of-care tests detecting HIV nucleic acids for diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less [^112Hs5A9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

The findings of our review were applicable to the review question concerning the population included and the reference standard. The included populations largely met our inclusion criterion of ≤ 18 months. The reference standards were primarily tests used with laboratory-based platforms. Additionally, all studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, making the results highly applicable for use in endemic communities where disease control programs are often targeted. There were some concerns regarding applicability for the index test, as one-third of included evaluations were not true point-of-care (POC) tests but were tests with POC platforms evaluated in a laboratory setting. However, there is no universally accepted definition of POC testing; in resource-limited settings, the definition of a true POC test is often indistinct, as tests with POC platforms have been evaluated and implemented across a wide range of healthcare and laboratory facilities.

### Point-of-care tests detecting HIV nucleic acids for diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less [^112BW8Ju]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Data extraction and management: We extracted the following information on study characteristics: study design, demographic and participant characteristics, methods of collecting blood specimens, index test and reference standard characteristics, test cut-off and performance, and accuracy results (true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative) [Appendix 2]. In the case of unclear accuracy data, we contacted primary authors of included studies for clarification.

Two review authors (EO and FG) independently performed data extraction. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion, and all decisions were documented.

Assessment of methodological quality: We used the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool to assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns of the included studies [Whiting 2011]. We tailored the tool in line with the context of our review question [Appendix 3]. Two review authors (EO and FG), using a predesigned and pretested form, independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Performance of serological and molecular tests within acute HIV infection [^112Ki3bT]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of acute HIV infection can be challenging and is critical for early therapeutic decision-making.
- **Objectives**: To evaluate the performance of different HIV tests in detecting early infections.
- **Study design**: A total of 83 leftover specimens from 61 study participants who seroconverted were used in this sub-study. Thirty-five HIV RNA positive but still seronegative specimens (acute infections) were used for analysis of the sensitivity of the different assays in detecting early infections, and 42 HIV RNA and antibody negative specimens were used for specificity analysis.
- **Results**: Four (11%) specimens out of 35 acute infections were reactive with the Enzygnost® Anti-HIV 1/2 Plus and 12/35 (34%) with the Vironostika® HIV Ag/Ab. Sixteen (46%) specimens were confirmed as acute by the INNOTEST® HIV antigen mAb Antigen test. Only three (9%), 10 (29%), and nine (27%) specimens were reactive with the Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo, SD Bioline HIV Ag/Ab Combo test, and the HIV Combo test, respectively. The specificity of the different tests was 100%, 95%, 100%, 93%, 100%, and 93% for Enzygnost® Anti-HIV 1/2 Plus, Vironostika® HIV Ag/Ab, INNO-Test HIV antigen mAb, Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo, SD Bioline HIV Ag/Ab Combo test, and HIV Combo test, respectively.
- **Conclusion**: RNA test, 4th generation ELISA, and Single Ag test are the most sensitive tests for detection of an acute infection. As an alternative, the HIV Combo test is generally slightly more sensitive compared to its previous version, but the SD Bioline HIV Ag/Ab Combo test has the best performance.

### Point-of-care tests detecting HIV nucleic acids for diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less [^116RfAHu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

We investigated the following sources of heterogeneity where there were sufficient data: sample type (DBS versus fresh whole blood sample), infant/child age (at birth, six weeks or less, 12 months or less, and 18 months or less), test type (for each manufacturer), and site of index test evaluation (field versus laboratory settings). Simplified univariable models for sensitivity and specificity were fitted separately using a random‐effects model, as the bivariate models did not converge to give a model estimate. When the univariate method failed because there were zero, one, or two false‐positives, we combined patient test results as if from a single study and computed the proportion and 95% CI using the binomial exact method (Clopper 1934).

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the effect of potentially influential studies and study quality. We performed sensitivity analysis excluding studies based on risk of bias (excluding those with high risk of bias in QUADAS‐2 domains: participant selection, index test, reference standard, flow and timing). We did not restrict analysis to studies conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa as stated a priori, as all studies were conducted in this geographical region. The sensitivity analysis restricted to studies at low concern for applicability corresponded to studies conducted in a field setting, so results from the subgroup analysis of field setting were identical to this planned sensitivity analysis. One study had a low sensitivity of 83% (Opollo 2018), compared to the rest, which had se.

### Point-of-care tests detecting HIV nucleic acids for diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less [^113EEwcB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The pooled sensitivity (95% CI) was 98.4% (94.9 to 99.5) for tests done on fresh whole blood samples and 97.7% (89.4 to 99.5) for tests done on dried whole blood samples. There was no statistically significant difference in sensitivity between sample types: dried minus fresh was 0.7% (−4.8 to 3.4). Specificity results were as follows: fresh whole blood 99.8% (99.7 to 99.8) and dried whole blood spot 99.8% (99.5 to 99.9).
- **Sensitivity analysis**: When studies with high risk of bias in any domain were excluded (Meggi 2017), POC NAT pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were similar to the overall meta-analysis: 98.4% (95.6 to 99.4) and 99.8% (99.7 to 99.9), respectively. When we excluded Opollo 2018 due to outlier results, the pooled sensitivity of POC NAT was 98.9% (95% CI 96.7 to 99.6), and pooled specificity 99.9% (95% CI 99.7 to 99.9) was also similar to the overall meta-analysis. When we excluded Hsiao 2016 due to its inclusion of a population ≤ 24 months, the pooled sensitivity of POC NAT was 98.6% (95% CI 97.7 to 99.2), and pooled specificity 99.9% (95% CI 99.8 to 99.9) was also similar to the overall meta-analysis.
- **Indirect test comparisons**: There were no statistically significant differences between sensitivity or specificity results for different test types. Differences in sensitivity were as follows: Xpert difference in sensitivity 2.6% (−0.3 to 5.5) compared to Alere and 2.0% (−0.1 to 4.9) compared to SAMBA; difference in sensitivity of SAMBA and Alere 0.7% (−2.1 to 3.5).

### Hiv-1/AIDS and maternal and child health in Africa [^114mpx9T]. Lancet (2002).

Every day, 1900 children acquire HIV-1 infection from their mother in Africa. The 25–45% risk of mother-to-child transmission can be reduced in several ways: prevention of sexual transmission for women of child-bearing age, access to HIV-1 testing, reduction of unwanted pregnancies through the education of HIV-1-infected women, and antiretroviral-based prevention. All antiretroviral regimens of proven efficacy can be used in a minimum package of care for HIV-1-infected pregnant women. Currently, programs in 13 countries reach less than 3% of HIV-1-infected African women.

Between 35–59% of African children infected with HIV-1 die by their second birthday. Infectious complications are preventable by primary prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole. A rapid scaling-up and comprehensive continuum of care is needed for all members of affected families, including access to antiretroviral treatment and community-based responses to the increasing number of orphans. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission should become a universal standard of care in Africa, and research should continue to reduce the transmission risk to well below 5%.

### Laboratory diagnosis of HIV in adults: A review of current methods [^1162UAfQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Of the estimated 1.2 million people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States, 20% are unaware of their diagnosis. Improved methods of HIV testing could decrease this number, as well as identify those who have recently acquired HIV infection and are at the most critical stage of infectivity. People with acute HIV infection have demonstrated enhanced transmission of HIV in multiple epidemiologic and pathogenetic studies. More than 50,000 HIV infections occur annually in the United States, and 30%-50% have been attributed to persons with recent infection. The original HIV diagnostic testing algorithm was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1989. Recently proposed alterations to the algorithm would incorporate advancements made in HIV diagnostic testing, thereby increasing sensitivity while reducing turnaround time and cost. Improved diagnosis of acute HIV, and HIV type 2 in particular, would be expected. Knowledge of the available laboratory methods for HIV diagnosis is essential in the fight against the spread of HIV.

### Lower levels of HIV-2 than HIV-1 in the female genital tract: Correlates and longitudinal assessment of viral shedding [^117FtRDc]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

The differing magnitude of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 epidemics is likely a consequence of differing transmission rates between the two viruses. Similar to other sexually transmitted pathogens, the risk of HIV-1 and HIV-2 transmission is likely associated with the presence and amount of HIV in the genital tract. Thus, understanding patterns and risk factors for HIV genital tract shedding is critical to the effective control of HIV transmission.
- **Methods**: We evaluated HIV DNA and RNA detection in cervicovaginal specimens among 168 HIV-1 and 50 HIV-2-infected women in Senegal, West Africa. In a subset of 31 women (20 with HIV-1, 11 with HIV-2), we conducted a prospective study in which cervicovaginal specimens were taken at 3-day intervals over a 6-week period.
- **Results**: We found significantly lower rates and levels of HIV-2 RNA (58% shedding; 13% with > 1000 copies/ml) in the female genital tract than HIV-1 RNA (78% shedding; 40% with > 1000 copies/ml). Shedding correlated with plasma viral load irrespective of virus type (odds ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.3–2.8 for each log10 increase in HIV viral RNA). Plasma viral load, not HIV type, was the strongest predictor of genital viral load. Over 80% of closely monitored women, regardless of HIV type, had at least intermittent HIV RNA detection during every 3-day sampling over a 6-week time period.
- **Conclusion**: These data help in explaining the different transmission rates between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and may provide new insights regarding prevention.

### HIV diagnostics: Current recommendations and opportunities for improvement [^117CKHFL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Profound changes in technology have revolutionized laboratory testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the first laboratory enzyme immunoassays that detected only immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Instrumented fourth-generation random-access chemiluminescent assays are now recommended for initial screening because they become reactive in as little as two weeks after infection. Using HIV-1 RNA viral load assays following a reactive initial test could confirm infection and provide useful clinical information. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and use of preexposure prophylaxis can alter the evolution of biomarkers and assay reactivity, leading to ambiguous test results.

### Fourth-generation HIV rapid tests: Enhanced sensitivity and reduced diagnostic window for HIV-1 primary infection screening [^115cFcwg]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Study overview**: Of note, the results for confirmed non-subtype-B samples were remarkably consistent with overall results. For the pre-seroconversion subgroup, Determine had a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI [47.4, 82.8]) and One-Step a sensitivity of 9.5% (95% CI [2.7, 28.9]). These values increased to 100% (95% CI [90.8, 100]) for Determine and 92.1% (95% CI [79.2, 97.3]) for One-Step in the early seroconversion subgroup, and to 100% (95% CI [90.1, 100]) for Determine and 94.3% (95% CI [81.4, 98.4]) for One-Step in the seroconversion subgroup.
- **Time from infection analysis**: Estimated dates of infection were available for 45 (24%) patients. During the first 2 weeks after infection, no assay was reactive (n = 2). Between 2 and 3 weeks after infection, Determine accurately identified 78% (95% CI [45, 94]) (n = 7/9) of the positive samples, while One-Step identified 56% (95% CI [27, 81]) (n = 5/9). From 3 weeks to 1 month, Determine accurately identified 90% (95% CI [62, 98]) of samples (n = 10/11), whereas One-Step identified only 45% (95% CI [21, 72]) (5/11). Beyond a month, Determine accurately identified all samples (100% sensitivity, 95% CI [86, 100], n = 23/23), while One-Step was nonreactive for two samples with alleged infection dates of about 1 month and 70–90 days, respectively (91% sensitivity, 95% CI [73, 98], n = 21/23). Overall, the last negative sample occurred at 3 weeks for Determine versus 70–90 days for One-Step.

### Mortality rates in people dually infected with HIV-1/2 and those infected with either HIV-1 or HIV-2: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cRmYz]. AIDS (2014). High credibility.

As compared to HIV-1 infection, HIV-2 is less transmissible, disease progression is slower, and the mortality risk is lower. It has been suggested that HIV-2 infection inhibits the progression of HIV-1 in individuals dually infected by HIV-1 and HIV-2 (HIV-D). We examined whether the mortality rates in dually infected individuals differ from those in persons infected with either HIV-1 or HIV-2.

- **Design**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.
- **Methods**: Medline and Embase databases were searched for studies that reported the number of deaths and person-years of observation (PY) for at least two of the three HIV groups (i.e. HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-D). Meta-analyses were then performed with random-effects models, estimating combined mortality rate ratios (MRRs).
- **Results**: Of the 631 identified titles, six articles were included in the meta-analysis of HIV-D-infected individuals versus HIV-mono-infected persons, and seven were included in the analysis of HIV-1-mono-infected versus HIV-2-mono-infected individuals. The overall MRR of those infected with HIV-D versus HIV-1 was 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95–1.30]. The overall MRR of those infected with HIV-D versus HIV-2 was 1.81 (95% CI 1.43–2.30) and the MRR of those infected with HIV-1 versus HIV-2 was 1.86 (95% CI 1.44–2.39).
- **Conclusion**: HIV-2-mono-infected persons have a lower mortality rate than those mono-infected with HIV-1 and those with HIV-D. There is no evidence that HIV-2 delays progression to death in HIV-D-infected individuals.

### T-cell and B-cell perturbations identify distinct differences in HIV-2 compared with HIV-1-induced immunodeficiency [^112srH24]. AIDS (2019). Low credibility.

For unknown reasons, HIV-2 is less pathogenic than HIV-1, and HIV-2-induced immunodeficiency may differ from that caused by HIV-1. Previous immunological studies have suggested possible shifts in both T-cell and B-cell subsets, which we aimed to characterize further.

- **Methods**: From an HIV clinic in Guinea-Bissau, 63 HIV-2, 83 HIV-1, and 26 HIV-negative participants were included. All HIV-infected participants were ART-naive. The following cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry: T cells (maturation and activation), regulatory T cells, and B cells (maturation and activation).

- **Results**: After standardizing for sex, age, and CD4 T-cell count, HIV-2 had 0.938 log10 copies/ml lower HIV RNA levels than the HIV-1-infected patients. Whereas T-cell maturation and regulatory T-cell profiles were similar between patients, HIV-2-infected patients had higher proportions of CD8CD28 and lower proportions of CD8PD-1+ T cells than HIV-1-infected patients; this finding was independent of HIV RNA levels. HIV-2 was also associated with a more preserved proportion of naive B cells.

- **Conclusion**: HIV-2 is characterized by lower viral load and lower T-cell activation, which may account for the slower disease progression.
