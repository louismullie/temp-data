## Question

what is evidence based practice

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what evidence-based practice (EBP) is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and the three pillars. Then, I should verify the standard stepwise process. Next, I will review the hierarchy of evidence and how to appraise it. After that, I need to consider patient-centeredness and shared decision-making. I will then examine implementation and the evidence-to-practice gap. Finally, I should acknowledge limitations, controversies, and evolving frameworks before synthesizing a concise, clinically useful definition.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition. Evidence-based practice is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious integration of the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values and preferences when making decisions about the care of individual patients, which is the classic Sackett formulation adopted across disciplines including psychology and medicine [^2846a414] [^0fa034aa] [^a3c2387a].

> Wait, let me verify the three pillars so I don't omit anything. The best available evidence typically sits atop a hierarchy where systematic reviews and meta-analyses, followed by randomized controlled trials, provide the most reliable estimates of effect, while observational studies and mechanistic or expert evidence are used when higher-level evidence is unavailable or inapplicable, always interpreted in context and with attention to validity and applicability [^7f4623e0] [^6182b3c7] [^66b63d23]. Clinical expertise encompasses the clinician's knowledge, skills, and judgment to diagnose, prognosticate, and tailor interventions to the patient's unique circumstances, including comorbidities, logistics, and local resources [^2846a414] [^8a4131a1]. Patient values and preferences require eliciting goals, trade-offs, and cultural considerations to align choices with what matters most to the patient, often via shared decision-making conversations [^8a4131a1] [^c036f094].

> I need to check the canonical process next. The five-step model is consistently described: ask a focused, answerable question (often PICO), acquire the best available evidence efficiently, appraise the evidence for validity, impact, and applicability, apply the evidence to the individual patient while integrating expertise and preferences, and assess outcomes to close the loop and refine practice, with many sources also emphasizing a sixth implicit step of auditing and adjusting over time [^0f9513a7] [^e2d1c8c4] [^566290f7].

> Hold on, I should verify the hierarchy and appraisal details so I don't overstate RCTs. While RCTs and meta-analyses are at the top for therapeutic questions, evidence quality must be graded using transparent systems like GRADE that consider risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, and observational studies can be upgraded when effects are large and consistent, whereas even high-quality evidence may be downgraded for these reasons, so strength of recommendation is not solely a function of study design [^66b63d23] [^0b4d9c11] [^7cf9dbfa]. I should double-check that guidelines increasingly separate certainty of evidence from strength of recommendation, allowing strong recommendations even when evidence certainty is low in select scenarios, which is a key nuance clinicians must understand [^77d7ba19] [^a202fcc0].

> Next, I should review patient-centeredness and shared decision-making, because EBP without patient input risks misapplication. Optimal EBM requires attention to the biopsychosocial context and informed preferences, with guideline panels ideally including patients to define important outcomes and clinicians translating trade-offs into decisions that respect patient goals, especially when benefits and harms are closely balanced or values vary widely [^8a4131a1] [^c036f094]. Let me consider concrete examples: in frail older adults with mild diabetes, treatment burden and quality of life may outweigh survival gains, whereas in curable-stage cancer, survival may dominate, illustrating how the same evidence leads to different decisions as patient goals differ [^8a4131a1].

> I will now examine implementation and the evidence-to-practice gap, because defining EBP is not enough if it is not used. Multiple reviews and trials show that passive dissemination is ineffective; successful implementation requires multifaceted, context-tailored strategies such as leadership buy-in, barrier identification, education, audit and feedback, and supportive supervision, yet even with these, uptake is variable and often modest, underscoring the need for continuous quality improvement cycles [^8d51d159] [^4b27b859]. But wait, what if we focus on de-implementation of low-value care? That requires deliberate frameworks and sustained efforts to reduce harmful or ineffective practices, which is an essential counterpart to adopting beneficial evidence [^6747a38b].

> Let me think about limitations and controversies so I don't overpromise. Critics argue EBM can be overly rigid, ignore patient context, or be hijacked by industry or guideline conflicts, and there is persistent concern about discordant recommendations where strong guidance rests on low-certainty evidence, which can mislead practice if not transparently justified [^6edfbc4a] [^94110975]. I should confirm that movements toward "evidence-based health" and equity-focused EBP seek to integrate social determinants, community context, and culturally safe methods, including Indigenous-led evidence generation, to address structural barriers that limit the real-world impact of EBM [^ee7cefc4] [^fc622082].

> Hold on, I should verify evolving frameworks that extend beyond classic EBM. Evidence-based quality improvement explicitly marries rigorous evidence synthesis with local process improvement to "do the right things right", while the evidence integration triangle emphasizes practical interventions, pragmatic measurement, and participatory implementation anchored in stakeholder engagement and context [^bf3ad0d1] [^126a1a78]. These models reinforce that EBP is not a one-time appraisal but a dynamic, learning-systems approach that adapts as new evidence and local realities evolve [^c18d846c].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a clinically useful definition. Evidence-based practice is a disciplined, five-step approach to clinical decision-making that integrates the best available research evidence with clinician expertise and patient values and preferences, using transparent appraisal and shared decision-making to individualize care, continuously measuring outcomes, and adapting as evidence and context change, with the ultimate goal of improving patient-centered outcomes and reducing unwarranted variation [^2846a414] [^0f9513a7] [^8a4131a1].

---

Evidence-based practice (EBP) is the **integration of the best available research evidence** with clinical expertise and patient values to guide clinical decision-making [^2846a414] [^0fa034aa]. It is a **five-step process**: ask a focused question, acquire the best evidence, appraise its validity and relevance, apply it to the patient, and assess outcomes [^0f9513a7] [^e2d1c8c4]. EBP emphasizes using higher-quality evidence (systematic reviews, RCTs) when available [^7f4623e0], but also incorporates clinical judgment and patient preferences, especially when evidence is limited or conflicting [^8a4131a1] [^a202fcc0]. The goal is to improve patient outcomes, reduce variability, and ensure care is both effective and aligned with patient goals [^8d51d159] [^c18d846c].

---

## Core principles of evidence-based practice

EBP rests on **three interdependent pillars**:

- **Best available evidence**: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are prioritized for their methodological rigor and reduced bias [^7f4623e0] [^6182b3c7].

- **Clinical expertise**: Clinicians apply their knowledge, experience, and judgment to interpret evidence and tailor decisions to individual patients [^2846a414] [^8a4131a1].

- **Patient values and preferences**: Care is individualized by incorporating patients' goals, beliefs, and circumstances into decisions [^8a4131a1] [^c036f094].

---

## The five-step process of evidence-based practice

EBP is implemented through a **structured, iterative process**:

| **Step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| 1. Ask | Formulate a clear, answerable clinical question (PICO: Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) [^0f9513a7] [^869937eb]. |
| 2. Acquire | Search for the best available evidence using systematic reviews, guidelines, and primary studies [^0f9513a7] [^869937eb]. |
| 3. Appraise | Critically evaluate evidence for validity, reliability, and applicability to the patient [^0f9513a7] [^e2d1c8c4]. |
| 4. Apply | Integrate evidence with clinical expertise and patient preferences to make a decision [^2846a414] [^8a4131a1]. |
| 5. Assess | Evaluate outcomes and adjust practice accordingly [^e2d1c8c4] [^c18d846c]. |

---

## Hierarchy of evidence

Evidence is ranked by **study design and susceptibility to bias**, with higher-quality designs preferred for decision-making:

- **Systematic reviews and meta-analyses**: Highest level, synthesizing multiple studies [^7f4623e0].

- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**: Gold standard for interventions, minimizing bias through randomization and control groups [^7f4623e0].

- **Observational studies**: Useful when RCTs are impractical, but more prone to bias [^6182b3c7].

- **Expert opinion**: Lowest level, used when evidence is sparse or conflicting [^ccb99c2c].

## Benefits and limitations of evidence-based practice

### Benefits

Benefits include **improved patient outcomes** through the use of effective, evidence-supported interventions [^8d51d159] [^c18d846c]. EBP also reduces unwarranted practice variation by standardizing care around best practices [^6df22021] [^e6498189]. Additionally, it enhances accountability and transparency in clinical decision-making [^c036f094] [^77d7ba19].

---

### Limitations

Limitations include the **evidence gap**, where high-quality evidence is often lacking or inaccessible, especially for complex, multimorbid patients [^6edfbc4a] [^aeea2ea1]. Implementation barriers — such as time constraints, limited resources, and resistance to change — also hinder adoption [^4b27b859] [^aeea2ea1]. Overreliance on RCTs may also overlook patient diversity and real-world complexity [^5de8e7f2] [^6edfbc4a].

---

## Evolution and current trends

EBP has evolved from a focus on individual clinicians to **system-level integration**, with emphasis on:

- **Shared decision-making**: Patients are active partners in decisions [^8a4131a1] [^c036f094].

- **Digital health tools**: AI and CDS systems support evidence access and application [^notfound].

- **Equity and context**: Attention to social determinants and culturally sensitive care [^fc622082] [^ee7cefc4].

---

Evidence-based practice is a **dynamic, patient-centered approach** that integrates research, expertise, and values to deliver high-quality, individualized care. It requires continuous learning, adaptation, and collaboration to overcome evidence gaps and implementation challenges [^6edfbc4a] [^8d51d159].

### Moving toward evidence-based practice [^2dc6767e]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

"Evidence-based practice" involves applying the best available evidence to the care of individuals. Explicit, systematic methods have developed for determining what is the best available evidence. However, often even the highest-level evidence is not thoroughly or effectively used in practice, even if it is widely known. We must rigorously and critically analyze study results to understand their strengths, limitations, and generalizability, and bear in mind that our knowledge will evolve and thereby change our practice. The clinical question is not always how to apply the evidence but whether the available evidence applies to a particular patient. We should always ask whether the right provider is doing the right thing for the right patient at the right time in the right setting with the right resources.

### What is evidence-based medicine and why should it be practiced? [^25f39299]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Responding to the limitations of traditional expert recommendations as a guide to clinical practice, evidence-based medicine has presented a paradigm shift in the way clinicians learn and practice medicine. The practice of evidence-based medicine requires careful examination of the evidence, using a set of formal rules applied in an explicit manner. The clinician then judiciously applies the evidence to decision-making, with an understanding of the patient context and values. Using examples pertinent to respiratory therapists, we discuss evidence-based decision-making as a clinical problem-solving strategy, its basis on a hierarchy of evidence, and the interplay of values, preferences, expertise, and circumstances that affect its application. We briefly describe some resources available to obtain evidence reports and to learn to critically appraise and apply them.

### Evidence-based rheumatology practice [^e0d0438e]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review is intended to update readers on recent developments in the evidence-based practice of rheumatology.

Recent Findings

Several new or updated evidence-based practice guidelines have recently emerged. In addition, a large body of evidence upon which to base practice has been addressed in the many systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have been newly published, including nine new or updated Cochrane reviews. Several studies have also investigated adherence to practice guidelines, interventions to improve clinical practice, and quality of care in the field of rheumatology in the past year.

Summary

Evidence-based rheumatology is an ongoing effort, with continuing revision and update of recommendations. It may currently be used to address a wide variety of clinical questions. The initiatives on practice-based research to establish quality indicators and identify areas where rheumatology practice can be enhanced are a welcome addition to health services research in this field.

### What is evidence-based medicine and why should I care? [^0108ec7a]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

The principles of evidence-based medicine provide the tools to incorporate the best evidence into everyday practice. Evidence-based medicine is the integration of individual clinical expertise with the best available research evidence from systematic research and the patient's values and expectations. A hierarchy of evidence can be used to assess the strength of evidence upon which clinical decisions are made, with randomized studies at the top of the hierarchy. The efficient approach to finding the best evidence is to identify a systematic review or evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Calculated metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, receiver-operating-characteristic curves, and likelihood ratios, can be used to examine the evidence for a diagnostic test. High-level studies of a therapy are prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, have a concealed allocation, have a parallel design, and assess patient-important outcomes. Metrics used to assess the evidence for a therapy include event rate, relative risk, relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat, and odds ratio. Although not all tenets of evidence-based medicine are universally accepted, the principles of evidence-based medicine nonetheless provide a valuable approach to respiratory care practice.

### The optimal practice of evidence-based medicine… [^8a4131a1]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Research evidence is necessary but insufficient for making patient care decisions. An effective but toxic chemotherapeutic regimen is the treatment one patient with cancer can and will take, another patient can take but will not, and yet another patient could not take even if wanted. Careful attention to the biopsychosocial context of patients and to their informed preferences when crafting treatments requires expertise and practical wisdom. This represents the optimal practice of evidence-based medicine. Lack of time, resources, and expertise may hinder incorporation of patient preferences or only produce tokenistic patient involvement, false inclusion, and devalued input.
5. These challenges could be considered opportunities to develop new and better methods. This optimism is somewhat tempered by the stubbornly poor quality of contemporary guidelines.

Getting the evidence right — the right options, outcomes, and outcome data — is an obligatory prerequisite for considering informed patient preferences. Moving Forward Guideline panels should perhaps comprise representatives of its target users: frontline patients and clinicians. These user panels could define the issue about which guidance should be provided, iteratively improving on it through consultation with expert clinicians and patients, and invite methodologists to summarize and present the pertinent evidence. Clinical experts could then provide testimony about caveats in the interpretation of this evidence and its application to specific patients and contexts, and about best practices when research evidence is of limited value or scarce. Patient input should drive consideration of the full range of outcomes patients experience and consider critical in deciding what to do, rather than the limited set of outcomes researchers often chose for their studies.

For each question, patient input is key in determining the relative importance of these outcomes. For example, treatment burden may not be a critical outcome in the initial approach to a young person with a lethal cancer in a curable stage — survival is. Whereas, treatment burden, quality of life, and role function are critical outcomes in the management of mild diabetes in a patient who is frail and elderly — survival may not be. Clinicians need guidance and clear guidance helps and supports efficient practices. Yet, panels must be wise in recognizing when this expediency is appropriate for patient care and when it hinders patient-centered care. Clinicians should remember that taking care of patients is supposed to be difficult. Although guidelines may simplify this task, when patient preferences and context matter, guidelines must not replace clinicians' compassionate and mindful engagement of the patient in making decisions together.

This is the optimal practice of evidence-based medicine.

Rationale and Objectives

In this review article, we present the definition and useful concepts of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The principles of EBM are provided and major steps of practicing EBM are described.

Materials and Methods

We emphasize the importance of the Cochrane Collaboration (see http://www.cochrane.org), which initiated the research and practice in this area. Because it can be difficult to systematically access and review individual research studies, it is often useful to focus on a critical overview of clinical trials by conducting a meta-analysis.

Results

Useful literature and resources related to meta-analysis are provided.

Conclusion

Statistical methods for evaluating radiologic diagnostic performances derived from meta-analysis are summarized, with a special focus on summary outcomes measures.

### Key standards and principles for developing evidence-based clinical guidelines: balancing health professional, patient, funder, and government needs [^630dca46]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are critical tools to inform healthcare decision-making, yet development faces significant challenges in ensuring rigorous, reliable, and globally applicable recommendations. This review examines the essential standards and evolving approaches for creating high-quality, evidence-based guidelines that can effectively support clinical practice across diverse healthcare settings. Key standards for high-quality clinical practice guideline development emerge from leading global health organizations, emphasizing several critical components-establishing a multidisciplinary development group, defining a clear and relevant scope, conducting systematic evidence reviews and meta-analyses, and ensuring transparency throughout the development process. Innovative principles address emerging challenges such as research integrity assessment, incorporation of patient-centered methodologies, promotion of global collaborative approaches, and development of strategic implementation strategies. These evolving principles recognize the complex landscape of modern healthcare, where guidelines should adhere to rigorous standards to genuinely improve patient outcomes and encourage best practice care across diverse healthcare settings.

### Making research relevant: if it is an evidence-based practice, where's the practice-based evidence? [^34c96da9]. Family Practice (2008). Low credibility.

The usual search for explanations and solutions for the research-practice gap tends to analyze ways to communicate evidence-based practice guidelines to practitioners more efficiently and effectively from the end of a scientific pipeline. This examination of the pipeline looks upstream for ways in which the research itself is rendered increasingly irrelevant to the circumstances of practice by the process of vetting the research before it can qualify for inclusion in systematic reviews and the practice guidelines derived from them. It suggests a 'fallacy of the pipeline' implicit in one-way conceptualizations of translation, dissemination and delivery of research to practitioners. Secondly, it identifies a 'fallacy of the empty vessel' implicit in the assumptions underlying common characterizations of the practitioner as a recipient of evidence-based guidelines. Remedies are proposed that put emphasis on participatory approaches and more practice-based production of the research and more attention to external validity in the peer review, funding, publication and systematic reviews of research in producing evidence-based guidelines.

### Finding and evaluating the evidence: a critical step in evidence-based medicine [^869937eb]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Practitioners of evidence-based medicine are expected to review the evidence for treatment effectiveness with their patients as part of the shared decision-making process. This requires practitioners to know the evidence or to know how to find and evaluate it. To find the evidence, the practitioner must craft the search question by considering the domains of population, intervention, and outcome as a means to individualize the search for each patient. To evaluate the evidence, the practitioner needs to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various types of scientific evidence. Most practitioners will consult EBP guidelines first. If guidelines do not answer the search question, the practitioner will turn to systematic reviews, ensuring that their methods of selection and evaluation are explicit and appropriate. Searching the scientific literature for single studies is also possible, but evaluating primary sources is more difficult. Given the constraints of time and expertise, the authors anticipate that computerized expert systems, based on current evidence, will become increasingly prominent.

### A primer on selected aspects of evidence-based practice relating to questions of treatment. part 1: asking questions, finding evidence, and determining validity [^0f9513a7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

The process of evidence-based practice (EBP) guides clinicians in the integration of individual clinical expertise, patient values and expectations, and the best available evidence. Becoming proficient with this process takes time and consistent practice, but should ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. The EBP process entails 5 steps: (1) formulating an appropriate question, (2) performing an efficient literature search, (3) critically appraising the best available evidence, (4) applying the best evidence to clinical practice, and (5) assessing outcomes of care. This first commentary in a 2-part series will review principles relating to steps 1, 2, and 3 of this 5-step model. The purpose of this commentary is to provide a perspective to assist clinicians in formulating foreground questions, searching for the best available evidence, and determining validity of results in studies of interventions for orthopaedic and sports physical therapy.

### Crafting practice guidelines in the world of evidence-based medicine [^01792c4b]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In the era of exponential increase in the medical literature, physicians and health policy-makers are relying on well-constructed, evidence-based practice guidelines to help ensure that the care given to patients is based on valid, scientific data. The construction of practice guidelines, however, may not always adhere to accepted research protocol.

Methods

In this article, the authors detail the steps required to produce effective, evidence-based practice guidelines.

Results

The seven essential steps in crafting a practice guideline are presented: (1) defining a topic, (2) selecting a work group, (3) performing a literature review, (4) writing the guideline, (5) peer review, (6) making plans for review and revision, and (7) dissemination.

Conclusion

Given the importance of practice guidelines in supporting everyday practice, this article strives to provide a practical guide in the development of this key component of evidence-based medicine.

### How to practice evidence-based medicine [^2846a414]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is defined as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence, combined with individual clinical expertise and patient preferences and values, in making decisions about the care of individual patients. In an effort to emphasize the importance of evidence-based medicine in plastic surgery, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery have launched an initiative to improve the understanding of evidence-based medicine concepts and provide tools for implementing evidence-based medicine in practice. Through a series of special articles aimed at educating plastic surgeons, the authors' hope is that readers will be compelled to learn more about evidence-based medicine and incorporate its principles into their own practices. As the first of the series, this article provides a brief overview of the evolution, current application, and practice of evidence-based medicine.

### Can evidence-based medicine and clinical quality improvement learn from each other? [^635a8b15]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

The considerable gap between what we know from research and what is done in clinical practice is well known. Proposed responses include the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) and Clinical Quality Improvement. EBM has focused more on 'doing the right things' — based on external research evidence — whereas Quality Improvement (QI) has focused more on 'doing things right' — based on local processes. However, these are complementary and in combination direct us how to 'do the right things right'. This article examines the differences and similarities in the two approaches and proposes that by integrating the bedside application, the methodological development and the training of these complementary disciplines both would gain.

### Evidence-based practice for rehabilitation professionals: concepts and controversies [^1c866921]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

This article describes evidence-based practice (EBP) in the health professions and sciences in general and in the rehabilitation disciplines specifically. It discusses the following: what counts as evidence and how that has changed over the last 4 decades, trends in the short history of evidence-based medicine and EBP, the fallacious nature of most criticisms of EBP, (perceived) shortcomings of clinical research and the resulting evidence in rehabilitation, resources available to clinicians who want their practice to be evidence-based, and the barriers these clinicians face in keeping up with the evidence and applying it in practice. Lastly, it describes how the development of a new art and science, knowledge translation, may play a role in truly making EBP feasible in rehabilitation services.

### How to use a clinical practice guideline [^80866dfa]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Leading organizations increasingly recognize clinical practice guidelines as an important approach in promoting an evidence-based clinical practice of urology. In light of their considerable clinical, economic and medicolegal impact, guideline users should be confident that the guidelines were rigorously developed and address relevant patient questions. In this article we outline a practical approach for critically appraising a clinical practice guideline.

Materials and Methods

We outline a 3-step approach to the assessment of a clinical practice guideline that answers the questions of whether the recommendations are valid, what the recommendations are and whether they will help in the treatment of an individual patient.

Results

To determine the adequacy of a clinical practice guideline, urologists should carefully review the rigor of the development process and its content. Important questions that relate to the validity of a guideline are whether, for specific questions, all important management options and outcomes were considered, and whether there was an explicit and sensible process to identify, select and combine all relevant evidence. Clinical practice guidelines should formally grade the quality of the available evidence for a given clinical question and outline a formal process of how the recommendations were derived. Value judgments made in the guideline development process about the relative importance of the potential benefits and harms of a given health care intervention should be made transparent to the reader. The recommendations made should be practical and should address important clinical issues. Furthermore, their strength should be graded to reflect the underlying uncertainty about the evidence and the values applied in the guideline development process.

Conclusions

The systematic approach presented in this article will allow urologists to critically appraise clinical practice guidelines. Determining the validity of the recommendations, understanding the recommendations and assessing their applicability to patients are 3 fundamental steps toward an evidence-based approach to using clinical practice guidelines.

### Commentary on the role of expert opinion in developing evidence-based guidelines [^ccb99c2c]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) help guide busy practitioners in clinical decision making. CPGs are evidence-based in that recommendations are based on available knowledge derived from published clinical trials. The challenges presented by the tasks of finding, assessing, interpreting, and assembling the information in these reports are herculean. Missing or imperfect evidence may lead to the publication of suboptimal guidelines, even when the other components of the development process have been flawlessly performed. This commentary highlights the requirement that expert opinion must be explicitly recognized by CPG authoring groups when the published evidence is missing or inadequate.

### The development of clinical practice guidelines and guidance statements of the American College of Physicians: summary of methods [^230bd27b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) established its evidence-based clinical practice guidelines program in 1981. The ACP's Guidelines Committee and the staff of the Clinical Programs and Quality of Care Department develop the clinical recommendations. The ACP develops 2 different types of clinical recommendations: clinical practice guidelines and clinical guidance statements. The ACP clinical practice guidelines and guidance statements follow a multistep development process that includes a systematic review of the evidence, deliberation of the evidence by the committee, summary recommendations, and evidence and recommendation grading. All ACP clinical practice guidelines and clinical guidance statements, if not updated, are considered automatically withdrawn or invalid 5 years after publication or once an update has been issued.

### Grading the evidence: levels of evidence and grades of recommendation [^219515b6]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is using the best available evidence in order to make accurate and knowledgeable treatment decisions. It is not the automatic gainsay of "low quality" evidence and acceptance of randomized controlled trials (RCT's). To be able to make a sound recommendation for a therapy based on the best available evidence, it is necessary to follow steps in acquiring literature, appraising it for study design and quality, and to assess its results, as well as look at the net benefits and net harms.

### Evidence based clinical practice: a primer for urologists [^344225df]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Evidence based clinical practice has been defined as the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. It refers to a broad set of principles and methods intended to ensure that medical decisions, guidelines and health policy are based on well designed studies of therapeutic effectiveness and benefit.

Materials and Methods

We review the principles and practice of evidence based clinical practice using examples from the urology literature. We further provide a guide to currently available web based evidence based clinical practice resources and guidelines for urologists.

Results

Evidence based clinical practice integrates a hierarchy of evidence and patient values with practitioner judgment to guide decision making for the individual patient. Important steps in the evidence based clinical practice process include the formulation of an answerable question and a systematic search of the literature. In the absence of pre-appraised evidence or disease specific guidelines, the practice of evidence based clinical practice relies heavily on the evaluation of the primary literature by the individual urologist. Depending on the question domain (therapy/prevention, etiology/cause/harm, diagnosis or prognosis) and study design, a given study is critically appraised for validity, impact and applicability. Evidence is then integrated with clinical judgment, and patient circumstances and preferences. Finally, the practice of evidence based clinical practice includes a self-assessment of provider performance.

Conclusions

Knowledge, practice and documentation of evidence based clinical practice are of increasing importance to every urologist. Urologists should embrace evidence based clinical practice principles by acquiring the necessary skills to critically appraise the literature for the best evidence applicable to patient care.

### Evidence-based quality improvement: a scoping review of the literature [^bf3ad0d1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This scoping review explores the EBQI literature. We document how EBQI is defined in publications and aimed to identify key components that characterize this methodology across studies. The review catalogues definitions and characteristics of EBQI as currently used in practice. Particular emphasis was on the definition, scope, and use of evidence, i.e. the core aspect of EBQI. We also examined evidence of effectiveness of EBQI. The scoping review was guided by these review questions:
Review question 1: How is EBQI defined?
Review question 2: How is evidence used to inform evidence-informed quality improvement initiatives? Review question 2a: How is evidence defined in these initiatives? Review question 2b: What are the components of EBQI?
Review question 3: What is the effectiveness of EBQI to promote uptake of evidence-based practices?

Our objective was to conduct a systematic search to identify the available knowledge, provide a clear description of the methodology, and inform further development of methods for incorporating research evidence into QI initiatives.

Key questions

What is already known about this topic?

Implementation of evidence-based medicine is a challenge across settings and medical specialties worldwide. Health systems often fail to ensure that this evidence is used in routine clinical practice.

What are the new findings?

Our systematic review of cluster randomised trials in facility settings identified nine components consistently common to the implementation of evidence-based practices across all disciplines: leadership, barrier identification, tailoring to the context, patient involvement, communication, education, supportive supervision, provision of resources, and audit and feedback.
The same set of components was used in studies that showed a positive effect or no effect on the study outcomes.

Recommendations for policy

As clinicians, researchers and implementers, we are beholden to ensure the application of research to practice is a focus of health systems if we would like to optimise care and outcomes for all.
Our study identifies the components of implementation used in cluster randomised studies in a way that is common across disciplines and suggests that the impact of different components is not consistent across studies, underlining the importance of better reporting of these implementation components.

### Evidence-based respiratory care [^88c9399a]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is the integration of individual clinical expertise with the best available research and the patient's values and expectations. The efficient approach to finding the best evidence is to identify systematic reviews or evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Respiratory therapies that are supported by evidence include lung-protective ventilation and noninvasive ventilation for individuals with COPD. Evidence does not support postoperative incentive spirometry or intermittent mandatory ventilation. The principles of evidence-based medicine are a valuable approach to respiratory care practice.

### Evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management [^7847e721]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The past decade has been marked by unprecedented interest in evidence-based medicine and various types of avenues that can provide valid and reliable information about healthcare, including clinical practice guidelines. Thus, healthcare decisions are purportedly and increasingly being made on research-based evidence rather than on expert opinion or clinical experience alone. The methods describing evidence synthesis or development of guidelines in interventional pain management are scarce.

Objective

To describe the methods of evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management in practical terms.

Description

This review sought to provide an understanding of evidence-based medicine, the importance and synthesis of clinical practice guidelines, and the variety of issues related to rating the quality of individual articles, understanding narrative and systematic reviews, grading the strength of the body of evidence, searching for evidence, and finally, the analytical preparation of guidelines, with a focus on interventional pain management.

Conclusion

Evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management is a complex and difficult task. It is emphasized that practice guidelines are not intended as standards or absolute requirements. Consequently, practice guidelines may be adapted, modified, or rejected, according to the clinical needs and constraints of each practitioner and patient.

### Consistent definitions of clinical practice guidelines, consensus statements, position statements, and practice alerts [^a0825806]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

An evidence-based approach to clinical decision-making for optimizing patient care is desirable because it promotes quality of care, improves patient safety, decreases medical errors, and reduces health care costs. Clinical practice recommendations are systematically developed documents regarding best practice for specific clinical management issues, which can assist care providers in their clinical decision-making. However, there is currently wide variation in the terminology used for such clinical practice recommendations. The aim of this article is to provide guidance to authors, reviewers, and editors on the definitions of terms commonly used for clinical practice recommendations. This is intended to improve transparency and clarity regarding the definitions of these terminologies.

### Translating evidence to optimize patient care using GRADE [^7cf9dbfa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Optimal evidence-based clinical practice requires systematic summaries of the best available evidence, including ratings of the quality of that evidence, and is facilitated by the availability of trustworthy guidelines. In this review, we describe the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rating quality of evidence and moving from evidence to recommendations using examples from allergy-immunology. GRADE focuses on systematic summaries of the best evidence, systematic reviews and trustworthy guidelines, and emphasizes a structured approach to determining quality (certainty) of bodies of evidence, absolute magnitude of effects of desirable and undesirable consequences (benefits and harms), and use of evidence to develop clinical recommendations. Adopted by over 110 organizations worldwide, including the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, GRADE is foundational to the optimal interpretation of research evidence and its application in clinical practice. This review supports the clinician's ability to find and use the information in GRADE guidelines to help care for patients in the clinic.

### Evidence-based pathology: systematic literature reviews as the basis for guidelines and best practices [^974a17da]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Evidence-based medicine has been proposed as a new paradigm for the identification and evaluation of medical information. Best available evidence or data are identified and used as the basis for the diagnosis and treatment of individual patients. Evidence-based pathology has adapted basic evidence-based medicine concepts to the specific needs of pathology and laboratory medicine.

Objectives

To briefly review the history and basic concepts of evidence-based medicine and evidence-based pathology, describe how to perform and interpret systematic reviews, and discuss how to integrate best evidence into guidelines.

Data Sources

PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Washington, DC) and Web of Science (Thompson Reuters, New York, New York) were used.

Conclusions

Evidence-based pathology provides methodology to evaluate the quality of information published in pathology journals and apply it to the diagnosis of tissue samples and other tests from individual patients. Information is gathered through the use of systematic reviews, using a method that is less biased and more comprehensive than ad hoc literature searches. Published data are classified into evidence levels to provide readers with a quick impression about the quality and probable clinical validity of available information. Best available evidence is combined with personal experience for the formulation of evidence-based, rather than opinion-based, guidelines that address specific practice needs.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^1553a5ec]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Application — psychologists attempt to stay abreast of the research literature relevant to their practice areas and also seek to familiarize themselves with current standards of practice by reviewing professional practice guidelines and clinical practice guidelines. Professional practice guidelines provide psychologists guidance on roles, patient populations, or practice settings, whereas clinical practice guidelines systematically summarize the evidence base on the efficacy of treatments for specific health conditions, and because clinical practice guidelines do not address the entire range of symptoms, co-occurring conditions, populations, settings, and roles, psychologists use clinical practice guidelines in conjunction with professional practice guidelines and other sources of relevant research to tailor services to the individual patient. Several professional groups offer evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and similar reviews of research evidence on treatment efficacy relevant to psychological practice within health care, and psychologists endeavor to gauge the quality of the guideline development process before following guideline recommendations; when evaluating guideline quality, psychologists are encouraged to consult APA's "Criteria for Evaluating Treatment Guidelines" and the Institute of Medicine's "Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews", considering factors such as the type and amount of research evidence on which findings and recommendations of guidelines are based and the extent to which the evidence answers the questions posed and supports the conclusions reached.

### Evidence-based public health: an evolving concept [^5f593963]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence-based public health (EBPH) has been proposed as a practice model that builds upon the success of evidence-based medicine (EBM). EBM has been described as a more scientific and systematic approach to the practice of medicine. It has enhanced medical training and practice in many settings. Both EBM and EBPH systematically use data, information, and scientific principles to enhance clinical care and population health, respectively. In this paper, we review the evolution of EBPH, propose a new definition for EBPH, and discuss developments that may support its further advancement.

### From best evidence to best practice: effective implementation of change in patients' care [^8d51d159]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Major difficulties arise when introducing evidence and clinical guidelines into routine daily practice. Data show that many patients do not receive appropriate care, or receive unnecessary or harmful care. Many approaches claim to offer solutions to this problem; which ones are as yet the most effective and efficient is unclear. We aim to provide an overview of present knowledge about initiatives to changing medical practice. Substantial evidence suggests that to change behaviour is possible, but this change generally requires comprehensive approaches at different levels (doctor, team practice, hospital, wider environment), tailored to specific settings and target groups. Plans for change should be based on characteristics of the evidence or guideline itself and barriers and facilitators to change. In general, evidence shows that none of the approaches for transferring evidence to practice is superior to all changes in all situations.

### Evidence-based medicine: facts and controversies [^5152af68]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is a paradigm shift in the biomedical field toward scientific-based clinical practice. It is recognized as the process of acquiring and applying into practice the best available research findings in a defined filed. Although the roots of evidenced-based medicine date back more than 150 years, the modern evidenced-based medicine concept has been rapidly and constantly developing in the past two decades. Since its introduction, evidenced-based medicine has simultaneously attracted proponents and critics. This contribution provides a critical overview of the major advantages and drawbacks of evidenced-based medicine. The discussion and the examples cover the field of biomedical research and dermatovenereology in particular.

### How to interpret and use a clinical practice guideline or recommendation: users' guides to the medical literature [^c036f094]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Clinicians may rely on recommendations from clinical practice guidelines for management of patients.

Observations

A clinical practice guideline is a published statement that includes recommendations that are intended to optimize patient care. In the guideline development process, a panel of experts formulates recommendation questions that guide the retrieval of evidence that is used to inform the recommendations. Typically, methods of guideline development, a summary of the supporting evidence, and a justification of the panel's decisions accompany the recommendations. To use such guidelines optimally, clinicians must understand the implications of the recommendations, assess the trustworthiness of the development process, and evaluate the extent to which the recommendations are applicable to patients in their practice settings. Helpful recommendations are clear and actionable, and explicitly specify whether they are strong or weak, are appropriate for all patients, or depend on individual patients' circumstances and values. Rigorous guidelines and recommendations are informed by appropriately conducted, up-to-date systematic reviews that consider outcomes important to patients. Because judgments are involved in the interpretation of the evidence and the process of moving from evidence to recommendations, useful guidelines consider all relevant factors that have a bearing in a clinical decision and are not influenced by conflicts of interest.

Conclusions and Relevance

In considering a guideline's recommendations, clinicians must decide whether there are important differences between the factors the guideline panel has considered in making recommendations and their own practice setting.

### Practitioner perspectives on evidence-based practice [^6a301a40]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Most aspiring child mental health professionals would support the premise that clinical practice should have a scientific foundation. Why, then, is the implementation of evidence-based practice in child and adolescent psychiatry so difficult? Considering the multiple stakeholders in clinical work, impediments are not surprising. Practitioner delays in implementation of research findings are common to all specialties of medicine. This article outlines the barriers to implementation of evidence-based practice and suggests changes to motivate and enable clinicians to use evidence-based practices.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^a6cddd0a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus clinical practice guideline — classification of evidence-based statements and review — states that the definitions for evidence-based statements are listed in Table 3 and Table 4, and because much of the guideline addresses diagnostic tests, Table 4 was adapted to include current recommendations from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. It explains that the evidence-based approach requires evidence be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link to statements, and that evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the anticipated balance of benefit and harm; guidelines are intended to produce optimal health outcomes, minimize harms, and reduce inappropriate variations while not superseding professional judgment, with less frequent variation in practice expected for a strong recommendation than for a recommendation and recommendations offering the most opportunity for practice variability. The draft underwent extensive external peer review including open public comment, and a scheduled review process will occur at 5 years from publication, or sooner if compelling evidence warrants earlier consideration.

### Development, reporting, and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines [^460c5d61]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice parameters have been published with greater frequency by professional societies and groups of experts. These publications run the gamut of practice standards, practice guidelines, consensus statements or practice advisories, position statements, and practice alerts. The definitions of these terms have been clarified in an accompanying article. In this article, we present the criteria for high-quality clinical practice parameters and outline a process for developing them, specifically the Delphi method, which is increasingly being used to build consensus among content experts and stakeholders. Several tools for grading the level of evidence and strength of recommendation are offered and compared. The speciousness of categorizing guidelines as evidence-based or consensus-based will be explained. We examine the recommended checklist for reporting and appraise the tools for evaluating a practice guideline. This article is geared toward developers and reviewers of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements.

### Can evidence-based medicine and clinical quality improvement learn from each other? [^aeea2ea1]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

The EBM perspective

One cause of the evidence–practice gap is information overload, for example, approximately 8000 references — including around 350 randomised trials — are added to MEDLINE each week. But only a small fraction of this is research that is sufficiently valid and relevant to change practice. So keeping up to date with new developments and information is problematic. One arm of EBM has been to synthesise and summarise this flood of research, and be able to access evidence wherever and whenever it is needed. To achieve this requires both ready access (to resources such as MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library) and skills (in finding, appraising and applying evidence) that few healthcare workers currently have. The EBM movement has focused on developing both the skills and tools to better connect research and clinical practice, with somebut not universal successes.

A particular focus of EBM has been to take a more sceptical approach to innovation, asking for clear evidence before changing practice. Given that few innovations represent a real advance, this cautious approach means less disruption arising from unnecessary changes in practice.

### Principles of evidence based medicine [^566290f7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Health care professionals are increasingly required to base clinical decisions on the best available evidence. Evidence based medicine (EBM) is a systematic approach to clinical problem solving which allows the integration of the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values. This paper explains the concept of EBM and introduces the five step EBM model: formulation of answerable clinical questions; searching for evidence; critical appraisal; applicability of evidence; evaluation of performance. Subsequent articles will focus on the principles and critical appraisal of randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, and provide a practical demonstration of the five step EBM model using a real life clinical scenario.

### A primer on selected aspects of evidence-based practice to questions of treatment. part 2: interpreting results, application to clinical practice, and self-evaluation [^e2d1c8c4]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

The process of evidence-based practice (EBP) guides clinicians in the integration of individual clinical expertise, patient values and expectations, and the best available evidence. Becoming proficient with this process takes time and consistent practice, but should ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. The EBP process entails 5 steps: (1) formulating an appropriate question, (2) performing an efficient literature search, (3) critically appraising the best available evidence, (4) applying the best evidence to clinical practice, and (5) assessing outcomes of care. This second commentary in a 2-part series will review principles relating to steps 3 through 5 of this 5-step model. The purpose of this commentary is to provide a perspective to assist clinicians in interpreting results, applying the evidence to patient care, and evaluating proficiency with EBP skills in studies of interventions for orthopaedic and sports physical therapy.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use… [^1e4ad513]. stacks.cdc.gov (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal- and periapical-related dental pain and intra-oral swelling Supporting Files 11 2019 By Lockhart, Peter B.; Tampi, Malavika P.; Abt, Elliot;. File Language: English. Description: Background: An expert panel convened by the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs and the Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry conducted a systematic review and formulated clinical recommendations for the urgent management of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis, pulp necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis, or pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess using antibiotics, either alone or as adjuncts to definitive, conservative dental treatment in immunocompetent adults.

Types of Studies Reviewed: The authors conducted a search of the literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL to retrieve evidence on benefits and harms associated with antibiotic use. Authors used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty in the evidence, and the Evidence-to-Decisions Framework. Results: The panel formulated five clinical recommendations and two good practice statements, each specific to the target conditions, for settings where DCDT is and is not immediately available. With likely negligible benefits and potentially large harms, the panel recommended against using antibiotics in the majority of clinical scenarios, irrespective of DCDT availability. They recommended antibiotics in patients with systemic involvement due to the dental conditions, or when the risk of progression to systemic involvement is high.

Conclusion and Practical Implications: Evidence suggests that antibiotics for the target conditions may provide negligible benefits and probably contributes to large harms. The expert panel only suggests antibiotics for target conditions when systemic involvement is present, and immediate DCDT should be prioritized in all cases.

### The American Society of Addiction Medicine clinical practice guideline development methodology [^8fa4772e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations — Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are one way to translate evidence into clinical practice, and ideally a CPG is based on a systematic review of the evidence conducted by a group with experience in evidence synthesis. The CPG Writing Group is to use its expertise and perspective to translate evidence into practical recommendations that can be used by clinicians, policymakers, and the public. Elements to consider when translating evidence from the systematic review into recommendations include "Benefits and harms of the intervention or diagnostic test in question", "Certainty of evidence about these benefits and harms", "Values and preferences of the populations affected by the guideline", and "Costs and/or burden of the intervention or diagnostic test". The systematic review will outline estimates of the benefits and harms of a given intervention or diagnostic test for each outcome of interest and will also qualify how convincing the body of evidence is that underlies each effect estimate, with the degree to which a body of evidence is convincing or unconvincing most commonly referred to as the "certainty of evidence". The most commonly used framework to assess the certainty of a body of evidence was initially developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group in 2000, and there is also a GRADE framework for assessing the strength of recommendation.

### Introduction to and techniques of evidence-based medicine [^e6f7f4d9]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Literature review.

Objective

To outline the components and application of evidence-based medicine (EBM) with an emphasis on the critical components of conduct and appraisal of clinical research.

Summary Of Background Data

"Evidence-based medicine" is now a commonplace phrase representing the hallmark of excellence in clinical practice. EBM integrates a question, thoughtful comprehensive evaluation of the pertinent literature, with clinical experience and patient preference to make optimal patient care decisions. These decisions must be evaluated with objective outcome measures to ensure effectiveness. There have been some misconceptions around the application of EBM and that it is synonymous with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or based purely on levels of evidence.

Methods

Narrative and review of literature.

Conclusion

Clinicians must understand the importance of the research question, study design, and outcomes in order to apply the best available research to patient care. Treatment recommendations evolving from critical appraisal are not only based on levels of evidence, but the risk benefit ratio and cost. The true philosophy of EBM, however, is not for research to supplant individual clinical experience and the patient's informed preference, but to integrate them with the best available research. Healthcare professionals and administrators must grasp that EBM is not a RCT. They must realize that the question being asked and the research circumstances dictate the study design. Furthermore, they must not diminish the role of clinical expertise and informed patient preference in EBM.

### Has research informed us on the practical drug treatment of schizophrenia? [^4a3c8d1e]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Other Considerations

One of the functions of evidence-based medicine is to remind us of the absence of evidence. Some of the areas of ignorance can be answered by traditional randomized studies; others require different methodologies. Some writers claim that their recommendations are evidence based but actually state their opinion in the absence of evidence or the presence of evidence contradicting their conclusions. "Not studied" does not indicate "disproved". Indeed, everyday issues addressed in clinical practice require integration of general knowledge rather than specifically relevant evidence for RCTs. The clinician's expertise is based on general knowledge and experience. The art of medicine is essential even in the day of evidenced-based practice.

### Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations [^66b63d23]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Users of clinical practice guidelines and other recommendations need to know how much confidence they can place in the recommendations. Systematic and explicit methods of making judgments can reduce errors and improve communication. We have developed a system for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations that can be applied across a wide range of interventions and contexts. In this article we present a summary of our approach from the perspective of a guideline user. Judgments about the strength of a recommendation require consideration of the balance between benefits and harms, the quality of the evidence, translation of the evidence into specific circumstances, and the certainty of the baseline risk. It is also important to consider costs (resource utilisation) before making a recommendation. Inconsistencies among systems for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations reduce their potential to facilitate critical appraisal and improve communication of these judgments. Our system for guiding these complex judgments balances the need for simplicity with the need for full and transparent consideration of all important issues.

### Introduction: guidelines and advisory development [^093194ad]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Since 1992, the American Society of Anesthesiologists has produced 12 evidence-based practice guidelines, 2 practice advisories, and 3 guideline updates. These documents have assisted anesthesiologists and practitioners in many other specialties. Their brevity, practicality, and ease of use, coupled with a thorough and systematic evaluation of the evidence have been instrumental in bringing together the science and practice of medicine. The application of formal evidence-collection processes for literature and opinion and efficient analytic evaluations combine with the experience and practical knowledge of clinicians to produce widespread application of the guidelines. The evidence-based process developed by the ASA has been found to be adaptable to a wide variety of issues relating to clinical practice. The goal is to systematically collect and evaluate evidence from multiple sources and apply it ina comprehensive manner to the guideline recommendations. The ASA guideline and advisory development process is continuing to evolve in response to changes in medical technology, research, and practice. By providing synthesized evidence from multiple sources and robust clinical recommendations the ASA offers the practice of anesthesiology, an invaluable bridge between science and clinical practice.

### An evidence integration triangle for aligning science with policy and practice [^126a1a78]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Over-reliance on decontextualized, standardized implementation of efficacy evidence has contributed to slow integration of evidence-based interventions into health policy and practice. This article describes an "evidence integration triangle" (EIT) to guide translation, implementation, prevention efforts, comparative effectiveness research, funding, and policymaking. The EIT emphasizes interactions among three related components needed for effective evidence implementation: (1) practical evidence-based interventions; (2) pragmatic, longitudinal measures of progress; and (3) participatory implementation processes. At the center of the EIT is active engagement of key stakeholders and scientific evidence and attention to the context in which a program is implemented. The EIT model is a straightforward framework to guide practice, research, and policy toward greater effectiveness and is designed to be applicable across multiple levels-from individual-focused and patient-provider interventions, to health systems and policy-level change initiatives.

### Methodology for lung cancer evidence review and guideline development: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^e70037cf]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

ACCP evidence grading framework for lung cancer guidelines combines recommendation strength and evidence quality into final grades. Weak recommendations are "those for which the benefits and harms are more equally balanced, and thus a clear choice is not as obvious; these are graded with a 2". Strong recommendations are phrased "we recommend", whereas weak recommendations are phrased "we suggest". Evidence quality carries a letter score "A, B, or C", and "RCTs start with a high score but might be downgraded to moderate or even low based on the following criteria: limitations in the study design or conduct of the trial, imprecision, indirectness relative to the specifics of the PICO question, inconsistency in the results, and risk of reporting bias". "Observational studies, on the other hand, start off as low-level evidence but can be upgraded to moderate or even high if exceptionally large and consistent treatment effects increase confidence in the findings, especially if there is a strong dose-response gradient". "The final grades are combinations reflecting the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence". "Strong recommendations with high-quality evidence, grade of 1A, are less common", and "These recommendations apply to most patients in most circumstances". As grades decline, "patient values and preferences likely would play an increasingly greater role in determining the best treatments or interventions for each patient".

### Grading of evidence of the effectiveness of health promotion interventions [^402fb232]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Grading of evidence of the effectiveness of health promotion interventions remains a priority to the practise of evidence-based health promotion. Several authors propose grading the strength of evidence based on a hierarchy: convincing, probable, possible and insufficient; or strong, moderate, limited and no evidence. Although these grading hierarchies provide simple and straightforward rankings, the terms that describe the categories in the hierarchies, however, do not explain, in an explicit manner, in what way the strength of the evidence in one category is more, or less, superior than that in another.

Methods

To enhance the explanatory power of the hierarchy, we propose that evidence be classified into three grades, each with a short explanatory note on the basis of three criteria: the degree of association between the intervention under study and the outcome factors, the consistency of the findings from different studies, and whether there is a known cause-effect mechanism for the intervention under study and the outcome factors.

Conclusion

For more in-depth grading, a three-grade expanded hierarchy is also recommended. Examples are given to illustrate our proposed grading schemes.

### The relationship between evidence and guidelines [^de137c25]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This reflection aims to soothe some frustrations, to cool current debates, and to encourage an understanding whereby the relationship between evidence and guidelines can be more productive in future. The relationship of evidence to guidelines, an important link between research and application, is not as simple and unidirectional as is often imagined. The recent emphasis on evidence of high quality and aggregation of evidence is appropriate but can be modified and extended. There are other important elements in guidelines besides the available evidence (which is centered on efficacy and effectiveness). Available evidence may be poor, or not be the most relevant to the decision at hand. To offset the limitations to which this predicament leads, effort is also appropriate to develop more rigorous principles for interpretation and evaluation of evidence, so as to make better use of what is available. The processes for generating guidelines from evidence emphasize reliability, generalizability of a limited kind, and freedom from bias to be achieved via systematic review. If the inclusion criterion for studies is too stringent, there may be little to say from evidence alone, or the evidence that remains may suffer limitations of relevance due to context, or it may be misapplied, simply because it has been endorsed as to quality. Knowledge-based medicine (KBM) would acknowledge a greater role for the scientific principles underlying particular pieces of evidence and deploy a fuller understanding of the health-care context. It should thus make guidelines more professionally accepted and useful in the future.

### AAFP endorsement of evidence-based clinical practice… [^f1f31daf]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

The AAFP considers endorsement of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines that meets its criteria and process. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines developed by other organizations may be placed in the following categories: endorsed, affirmation of value, or not endorsed by the AAFP. External guidelines designated as endorsed or affirmation of value will be reviewed every five years following their date of publication. Guidelines may be reviewed earlier if new evidence warrants an update. In December 2014, the AAFP Board of Directors approved an amended process for endorsement of clinical practice guidelines developed by external organizations. Clinical practice guidelines developed by external organizations relevant to family medicine reviewed after 2014 may be categorized as: ENDORSED
- the AAFP fully endorses the guideline;.

AFFIRMATION OF VALUE
- the guideline does not meet the requirements for full endorsement or if the AAFP cannot endorse all recommendations but provides some benefit for family physicians. NOT ENDORSED
- the AAFP does not endorse the guideline and the reasons are stated. Prior to 2015, clinical practice guidelines that are relevant to family medicine reviewed by the AAFP and categorized as: ENDORSED
- the AAFP fully endorses the guideline; ENDORSED WITH QUALIFICATIONS
- the AAFP endorses the guideline or portions of the guideline with qualifications. The qualifications are described;. NOT ENDORSED
- the AAFP does not endorse the guideline and the reasons are stated.

All clinical practice guidelines considered for endorsement by the AAFP go through a structured review process by the AAFP's Commission on Health of the Public and Science with Board approval. These guidelines are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These guidelines are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America. To be effective, the guidelines must be implemented.

### Principles of evidence-based medicine [^38891654]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine integrates clinical expertise, patients' values and preferences, and the best available evidence from the medical literature. Evidence-based orthopedics is a model to assist surgeons to improve the process of asking questions, obtaining relevant information efficiently, and making informed decisions with patients. With an increasing appreciation for higher levels of evidence, orthopedic surgeons should move away from lower forms of evidence. The adoption of randomized trials and high-quality prospective studies to guide patient care requires 2 prerequisites: (1) greater appreciation for the conduct of randomized trials in orthopedics and (2) improved education and training in evidence-based methodologies in surgery.

### Evidence-based practice education for healthcare professions: an expert view [^3ffcd7b7]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Internationally, evidence-based practice (EBP) is recognised as a foundational element of healthcare professional education. Achieving competency in this area is a complex undertaking that is reflected in disparities between 'best EBP' and actual clinical care. The effective development and implementation of professional education to facilitate EBP remains a major and immediate challenge. To ascertain nuanced perspectives on the provision of EBP education internationally, interviews were conducted with five EBP education experts from the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Definitive advice was provided in relation to (1) EBP curriculum considerations, (2) teaching EBP and (3) stakeholder engagement in EBP education. While a considerable amount of EBP activity throughout health profession education is apparent, effectively embedding EBP throughout curricula requires further development, with a 'real-world' pragmatic approach that engenders dialogue and engagement with all stakeholders required.

Internationally, evidence-based practice (EBP) is recognised as a foundational element of healthcare professional education. Achieving competency in this area is a complex undertaking that is reflected in disparities between 'best EBP' and actual clinical care. The effective development and implementation of professional education to facilitate EBP remains a major and immediate challenge. To ascertain nuanced perspectives on the provision of EBP education internationally, interviews were conducted with five EBP education experts from the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Definitive advice was provided in relation to (1) EBP curriculum considerations, (2) teaching EBP and (3) stakeholder engagement in EBP education. While a considerable amount of EBP activity throughout health profession education is apparent, effectively embedding EBP throughout curricula requires further development, with a 'real-world' pragmatic approach that engenders dialogue and engagement with all stakeholders required.

### Moving from evidence-based medicine to evidence-based health [^ee7cefc4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

While evidence-based medicine (EBM) has advanced medical practice, the health care system has been inconsistent in translating EBM into improvements in health. Disparities in health and health care play out through patients' limited ability to incorporate the advances of EBM into their daily lives. Assisting patients to self-manage their chronic conditions and paying attention to unhealthy community factors could be added to EBM to create a broader paradigm of evidence-based health. A perspective of evidence-based health may encourage physicians to consider their role in upstream efforts to combat socially patterned chronic disease.

### How to perform a critical appraisal of diagnostic tests: 7 steps [^f155fd78]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The critically appraised topic (CAT) is a format in evidence-based practice for sharing information. A CAT is a standardized way of summarizing the most current research evidence focused on a pertinent clinical question. Its aim is to provide both a critique of the most up-to-date retrieved research and an indication of the clinical relevance of results. A clinical question is initially generated following a patient encounter, which leads to and directs a literature search to answer the clinical question. Studies obtained from the literature search are assigned a level of evidence. This allows the most valid and relevant articles to be selected and to be critically appraised. The results are summarized, and this information is translated into clinically useful procedures and processes.

### Discordant and inappropriate discordant recommendations in consensus and evidence based guidelines: empirical analysis [^94110975]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Both consensus and evidence based approaches require judicious consideration of the relevant evidence, expert interpretation of the evidence, and ultimately. panel consensus. In other words, guideline panels must always carefully consider the available evidence, regardless of quality, and must always rely on expert insights to arrive at consensus recommendations; in this sense, denoting evidence based and consensus based recommendations as separate categories is misleading. Intention-to-treat consensus based guidelines as a separate category of guidelines seem to purposefully relax the necessary requirement that the strength of the recommendations should align with the underlying quality of evidence, which in turn, might result in inappropriate discordant recommendations.

If this is the case, one would expect a greater number of discordant recommendations, particularly inappropriate discordant recommendations, in consensus based guidelines than in evidence based guidelines. To date, however, empirical support for this expected findingis lacking. We provide an empirical assessment of how often consensus versus evidence based guidelines issued strong recommendations based on low quality evidence (discordant) and how many of them are inappropriate (inappropriate discordant recommendations). Because these are the world's leading professional organisations developing recommendations for people with cardiovascular diseases and cancer, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in much of the world, we evaluated ACC/AHA and ASCO guidelines. Recommendations by these organisations affect the decisions of thousands of physicians and outcomes for millions of patients worldwide.

### Classifying recommendations for clinical practice guidelines [^6df22021]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are intended to improve the quality of clinical care by reducing inappropriate variations, producing optimal outcomes for patients, minimizing harm, and promoting cost-effective practices. This statement proposes an explicit classification of recommendations for clinical practice guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to promote communication among guideline developers, implementers, and other users of guideline knowledge, to improve consistency, and to facilitate user understanding. The statement describes 3 sequential activities in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and related policies: 1) determination of the aggregate evidence quality in support of a proposed recommendation; 2) evaluation of the anticipated balance between benefits and harms when the recommendation is carried out; and 3) designation of recommendation strength. An individual policy can be reported as a "strong recommendation", "recommendation", "option", or "no recommendation". Use of this classification is intended to improve consistency and increase the transparency of the guideline-development process, facilitate understanding of AAP clinical practice guidelines, and enhance both the utility and credibility of AAP clinical practice guidelines.

### Evidence-based practice education for healthcare professions: an expert view [^fd0f4066]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

To highlight and advance clinical effectiveness and evidence-based practice (EBP) agendas, the Institute of Medicine set a goal that by 2020, 90% of clinical decisions will be supported by accurate, timely and up-to-date clinical information and will reflect the best available evidence to achieve the best patient outcomes. To ensure that future healthcare users can be assured of receiving such care, healthcare professions must effectively incorporate the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes required for EBP into education programmes.

The promotion of EBP requires a healthcare infrastructure committed to supporting organisations to deliver EBP and an education system efficient in supporting healthcare professionals in acquiring EBP competencies. To this end, healthcare education programmes must effectively implement curricula that target these competencies. To facilitate this, the Sicily consensus statement on EBP provides a description of core knowledge and skills required to practise in an evidence-based manner and a curriculum that outlines the minimum requirements for educating health professionals in EBP. Initiatives such as the European Union Evidence-Based Medicine projectand EBP teaching programmes for educators facilitated by Oxford (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine) and McMaster Universities provide support in advancing the EBP agenda within healthcare education. Over the past two decades, more than 300 articles have been published on teaching evidence-based medicine alone and in excess of 30 experiments have been conducted to measure its effects. Recent reviewsevaluating the adoption of evidence-based recommendations for teaching EBP however point to poor uptake of existing resources available to guide EBP education.

The application of EBP continues to be observed irregularly at the point of patient contact. The effective development and implementation of professional education to facilitate EBP remains a major and immediate challenge. Momentum for continued improvement in EBP education in the form of investigations which can provide direction and structure to developments in this field is recommended.

As part of a larger national project looking at current practice and provision of EBP education across healthcare professions at undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing professional development programme levels, we sought key perspectives from international EBP education experts on the provision of EBP education for healthcare professionals. The two other components of this study, namely a rapid review synthesis of EBP literature and a descriptive, cross-sectional, national, online survey relating to the current provision and practice of EBP education to healthcare professionals at third-level institutions and professional training/regulatory bodies in Ireland, will be described in later publications.

### Evidence-based practice guidelines for plasma transfusion [^2db41826]. Transfusion (2010). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based plasma transfusion guidelines — recommendation strength and panel voting define the strength of a recommendation as the extent to which confidence in an effect estimate supports it and align with the belief that adherence will do more good than harm; strong recommendations indicate that most well-informed people would make the same choice, whereas weak recommendations indicate that many would make the choice but a substantial minority would not; when neither can be agreed upon, no specific recommendation is made or use is endorsed in the context of research; for development, panelists reviewed the SR and GRADE evidence profiles, made final judgments on strength and overall evidence quality, and voted anonymously using GRADE grids, with a strong recommendation issued if 70% or more voted strongly for or against an intervention.

### Questioning the ethics of evidence-based practice for indigenous health and social settings in Australia [^fc622082]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Australian government planning promotes evidence-based action as the overarching goal to achieving health equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. However, an inequitable distribution of power and resources in the conduct of evidence-based practice produces a policy environment counterintuitive to this goal. This context of contemporary evidence-based practice gives legitimacy to 'expert practitioners' located in Australian governments and universities to use Western guidelines and tools, embedded in Western methodology, to make 'evidence' informed policy and programming decisions about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. This method for decision making assumes a positional superiority that can marginalise the important perspectives, experiences and knowledge of Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations and their processes for decision making. Here we consider the four steps of an evidence review: (1) developing a review question; (2) acquiring studies; (3) appraising the evidence and (4) assessing the evidence, as components of wider evidence-based practice. We discuss some of the limitations across each step that arise from the broader context within which the evidence review is produced. We propose that an ethical and just approach to evidence-based review can be achieved through a well-resourced Aboriginal community controlled sector, where Aboriginal organisations generate their own evidence and evidence is reviewed using methods and tools that privilege Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ways of knowing, doing and being.

### Evidence-based practice in psychology [^268e377a]. The American Psychologist (2006). Low credibility.

The evidence-based practice movement has become an important feature of health care systems and health care policy. Within this context, the APA 2005 Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice defines and discusses evidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP). In an integration of science and practice, the Task Force's report describes psychology's fundamental commitment to sophisticated EBPP and takes into account the full range of evidence psychologists and policymakers must consider. Research, clinical expertise, and patient characteristics are all supported as relevant to good outcomes. EBPP promotes effective psychological practice and enhances public health by applying empirically supported principles of psychological assessment, case formulation, therapeutic relationship, and intervention. The report provides a rationale for and expanded discussion of the EBPP policy statement that was developed by the Task Force and adopted as association policy by the APA Council of Representatives in August 2005.

### Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations in clinical practice guidelines. part 1 of 3. An overview of the GRADE approach and grading quality of evidence about interventions [^0b4d9c11]. Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

The GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach provides guidance to grading the quality of underlying evidence and the strength of recommendations in health care. The GRADE system's conceptual underpinnings allow for a detailed stepwise process that defines what role the quality of the available evidence plays in the development of health care recommendations. The merit of GRADE is not that it eliminates judgments or disagreements about evidence and recommendations, but rather that it makes them transparent. This first article in a three-part series describes the GRADE framework in relation to grading the quality of evidence about interventions based on examples from the field of allergy and asthma. In the GRADE system, the quality of evidence reflects the extent to which a guideline panel's confidence in an estimate of the effect is adequate to support a particular recommendation. The system classifies quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low according to factors that include the study methodology, consistency and precision of the results, and directness of the evidence.

### Evidence-based practice guidelines for plasma transfusion [^cdb8456f]. Transfusion (2010). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for plasma use — strength grading and determinants — state that strength of recommendation is graded as Strong, Weak, or Uncertain, where Strong is "indicating the judgment that most well-informed people will make the same choice", Weak is "indicating the judgment that a majority of well-informed people will make the same choice, but a substantial minority will not", and Uncertain is "indicating that the panel made no specific recommendations for or against interventions or made recommendations only in the context of research". It further notes that "As long as there is judgment that benefits outweigh the harms, recommendation can be strong even if the quality of evidence is low or very low". Determinants that influence the strength include "Quality of evidence — The higher the quality of evidence, the more likely a strong recommendation will be made", the balance of effects — "The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable consequences, the more likely a strong recommendation is warranted. The smaller the net benefit, and the lower the certainty of that benefit, the more likely a weak recommendation will be made", "Values and preferences — The greater the variability in values and preferences, or the more uncertain the values and preferences, the more likely a weak recommendation is warranted", and "Costs (resource allocation) — The higher the costs of an intervention — that is, the more resources consumed — the less likely a strong recommendation is warranted".

### Discordant and inappropriate discordant recommendations in consensus and evidence based guidelines: empirical analysis [^a202fcc0]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Development of trustworthy guidelines — a collection of related recommendations for clinical practice — is key to improving physicians' decision making and patients' outcomes. Necessary requirements for trustworthiness include assessing quality/certainty of evidence and issuing recommendations graded by strength (strong or weak/conditional). When they make recommendations, many organisations, including the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), categorise their guidelines as evidence based or consensus based. This practice remains common: authors of numerous recent covid-19 guidelines classify them as consensus based versus evidence based.

Organisations adopt different grading systems to rate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations, of which GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation)is one choice. ACC/AHA and ASCO each use their own systems to develop practice guidelines (appendixes 1 and 2). Guidelines that are labelled as evidence based often include considerable evidence of high or moderate quality and commit to recommendations consistent with underlying evidence — that is, respecting a close link between quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Consensus based guidelines typically rely on evidence of lower quality, and might not respect the link between quality and strength of recommendations.

The failure to ensure concordance between quality of evidence and strength of recommendations violates a key principle of evidence based medicine and risks misleading guidance. The GRADE working group has identified exceptions to this rule: five characteristic situations in which strong recommendations based on low quality evidence might be appropriate (box 1).

Box 1
Five paradigmatic situations warranting strong recommendation despite low or very low quality evidence in effect estimates

In their approach to particular guidelines, some organisations, including ACC/AHA and ASCO, classify their guidelines as evidence based when much of the supporting evidence is deemed moderate or high quality. When most of the evidence is of low or very low quality, these organisations then often categorise their approach as consensus based. In doing so, organisations seem to characterise consensus based recommendations as highly reliant on expert opinion, but this might not be the case for recommendations that are considered evidence based.

### Evidence-based practice education for healthcare professions: an expert view [^d648d31b]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2019). High credibility.

If patients are considered as recipients of EBP rather than key stakeholders, the premise of shared decision-making for care cannot be achieved.

The implementation of a successful EBP education is necessary so that learners not only understand the importance of EBP and be competent in the fundamental steps, but it ultimately serves to influence behaviour in terms of decision-making, through application of EBP in their professional practice. In essence, it serves the function of developing practitioners who value EBP and have the knowledge and skills to implement such practice. The ultimate goal of this agenda is to enhance the delivery of healthcare for improved patient outcomes. The overarching theme of 'Improving healthcare through enhanced teaching and application of EBP' represents the focus and purpose of the effort required to optimally structure healthcare professional (HCP) curricula, promote effective EBP teaching and learning strategies, and engage with key stakeholders for the overall advancement of EBP education as noted:

… we think that everyone in training should be in the game of improving healthcare… It's not just saying I want to do some evidence-based practice… it's ultimately about… improving healthcare. (CH)

### Understanding observational studies [^6182b3c7]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

The development of evidence-based medicine has encouraged clinicians to consider the best available evidence when making clinical decisions, individualised for the patient.(1,2) A hierarchy of levels of evidence about therapy is described, with the highest being meta-analyses and large, well-designed randomised controlled trials.(3–5) Lower down the hierarchy are observational studies, a group that includes cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies. Here we describe the benefits and limitations of observational studies, and how to assess their quality.

### Evidence-based practice guidelines for plasma transfusion [^1d3556fd]. Transfusion (2010). Medium credibility.

Appendix: GRADE definitions — the quality of evidence represents "the extent of confidence that an estimate of effect is correct" and is "rated as" High, Moderate, Low, or Very Low with the following meanings: "High: Considerable confidence in the estimate of effect. Further research is unlikely to change the estimate of the health intervention's effect"; "Moderate: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate of the health intervention's effect"; "Low: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate"; and "Very Low: Any estimate of effect is very uncertain". Strength of recommendation according to GRADE is defined as "the extent to which confidence in an estimate of the effect is adequate to support recommendations; that is, it is consistent with belief that adherence to a particular recommendation will do more good than harm", and "weak recommendations… indicate that while many well-informed people would make the same choice, a substantial minority would not".

### Next steps in improving healthcare value: AHRQ evidence-based practice center program-applying the knowledge to practice to data cycle to strengthen the value of patient care [^c18d846c]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

For more than 20 years, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program has been identifying and synthesizing evidence to inform evidence-based healthcare. Recognizing that many healthcare settings continue to face challenges in disseminating and implementing evidence into practice, AHRQ's EPC program has also embarked on initiatives to facilitate the translation of evidence into practice and to measure and monitor how practice changes impact health outcomes. The program has structured its efforts around the three phases of the Learning Healthcare System cycle: knowledge, practice, and data. Here, we use a topic relevant to the field of hospital medicine-Clostridium difficile colitis prevention and treatment-as an exemplar of how the EPC program has used this framework to move evidence into practice and develop systems to facilitate continuous learning in healthcare systems.

### Evidence-based quality improvement: a scoping review of the literature [^b6a889f2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Quality improvement (QI) initiatives often reflect approaches based on anecdotal evidence, but it is unclear how initiatives can best incorporate scientific literature and methods into the QI process. Review of studies of QI initiatives that aim to systematically incorporate evidence review (termed evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI)) may provide a basis for further methodological development.

Methods

In this scoping review (registration: https://osf.io/hr5bj) of EBQI, we searched the databases PubMed, CINAHL, and SCOPUS. The review addressed three central questions: How is EBQI defined? How is evidence used to inform evidence-informed QI initiatives? What is the effectiveness of EBQI?

Results

We identified 211 publications meeting inclusion criteria. In total, 170 publications explicitly used the term "EBQI". Published definitions emphasized relying on evidence throughout the QI process. We reviewed a subset of 67 evaluations of QI initiatives in primary care, including both studies that used the term "EBQI" with those that described an evidence-based initiative without using EBQI terminology. The most frequently reported EBQI components included use of evidence to identify previously tested effective QI interventions; engaging stakeholders; iterative intervention development; partnering with frontline clinicians; and data-driven evaluation of the QI intervention. Effectiveness estimates were positive but varied in size in ten studies that provided data on patient health outcomes.

Conclusions

EBQI is a promising strategy for integrating relevant prior scientific findings and methods systematically in the QI process, from the initial developmental phase of the IQ initiative through to its evaluation. Future QI researchers and practitioners can use these findings as the basis for further development of QI initiatives.

### Trustworthy evidence-based versus untrustworthy guidelines: detecting the difference [^f756e929]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence

Trading off benefits versus harms and burdens is the core of a guideline panel's job. Doing so requires best evidence summaries of the magnitude of effects on all important outcomes and an assessment of the certainty of the evidence. In trustworthy guidelines, this summary is informed by rigorously conducted systematic reviews, often with meta-analyses providing single best estimates of effect.

Rigorous systematic reviews include explicit eligibility criteria, a comprehensive search for eligible studies, assessment of risk of bias of individual studies, with judgement of eligibility and risk bias conducted in duplicate. Rigorous reviews also involve judgements regarding the certainty or quality of the evidence, from high to very low certainty. Ideally, that judgement will use the rigorously developed and widely adopted the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach in which randomised trials begin as high-certainty evidence and observational studies as low-certainty evidence in a four-category system of certainty of evidence (high, moderate, low and very low).

Beyond study design, GRADE has identified five domains that may lead to rating down the certainty of evidence: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. Reviewers may rate up the certainty of evidence from observational studies, primarily for large or very large magnitude of effect. If a panel is fortunate, rigorous reviews will already be available; if not, they will have to commission or conduct their own.

Without systematic reviews, the evidence summaries become untrustworthy, and guidelines regress to the GOBSAT approach. Systematic reviews following methodological standards are, therefore, essential for guideline trustworthiness.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^c13b3f1f]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Rating for strength of recommendations — category definitions: Strong reflects a strong degree of confidence that the recommendation reflects best practice, based on consistent high-quality evidence with consideration that benefits outweigh risks and consensus of the expert task force and Practice Committee. Moderate reflects a moderate degree of confidence based on limited high-quality evidence or a mix of high and intermediate quality or a consistent body mostly of intermediate quality, with consideration that benefits outweigh risks and expert consensus. Weak/Conditional reflects a low degree of confidence due to low-quality or insufficient evidence, limited ability to assess benefit vs. risk, and inability of the expert task force or Practice Committee to reach evidence-based consensus. No recommendation reflects insufficient available evidence and lack of confidence or consensus to provide a recommendation for clinical practice.

### The evolution of the randomized controlled trial and its role in evidence-based decision making [^7f4623e0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The randomized controlled trial has been used in medical research for a little over half a century. This manuscript provides an overview of some of the history and evolution of the randomized controlled trial during this period. There exists hierarchies of evidence for therapeutic, diagnostic and prognostic questions, and the randomized controlled trial is at the top of the therapeutic hierarchy. Despite being at the top of the therapeutic hierarchy randomization in itself does not guarantee the trial results approximate the true effect. Issues that result in systematic and nonsystematic deviations from the truth in randomized controlled trials must also be considered. We present a model for evidence-based decision making that includes the following components: the clinical state, patient preferences, research evidence from a range of studies and clinical expertise. We discuss the role of the randomized controlled trial within evidence-based decision making.

### Evidence-based radiology: why and how? [^b999e1e8]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide an overview of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in relation to radiology and to define a policy for adoption of this principle in the European radiological community.

Results

Starting from Sackett's definition of EBM we illustrate the top-down and bottom-up approaches to EBM as well as EBM's limitations. Delayed diffusion and peculiar features of evidence-based radiology (EBR) are defined with emphasis on the need to shift from the demonstration of the increasing ability to see more and better, to the demonstration of a significant change in treatment planning or, at best, of a significant gain in patient outcome. The "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) principle is thought as a dimension of EBR while EBR is proposed as part of the core curriculum of radiology residency. Moreover, we describe the process of health technology assessment in radiology with reference to the six-level scale of hierarchy of studies on diagnostic tests, the main sources of bias in studies on diagnostic performance, and levels of evidence and degrees of recommendations according to the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (Oxford, UK) as well as the approach proposed by the GRADE working group. Problems and opportunities offered by evidence-based guidelines in radiology are considered. Finally, we suggest nine points to be actioned by the ESR in order to promote EBR.

Conclusion

Radiology will benefit greatly from the improvement in practice that will result from adopting this more rigorous approach to all aspects of our work.

### Can evidence-based medicine and clinical quality improvement learn from each other? [^d51bd85f]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

Marrying EBM and QI

As illustrated by the above examples, EBM is involved in the early stages of checking the validity and applicability of the available evidence to the clinical problem. This involves the traditional 'four steps' of EBM illustrated in figure 2. QI processesmay be triggered at the fourth step if it seems likely that the clinical problem is a common one for which the current system of practice is not optimal. Similarly, in the planning stage of a QI project there may be several questions that trigger an EBM cycle to check for evidence.

Proposed linkage between EBM and one model for QI.

In addition to this merging of EBM and QI processes, there are deeper organisational and epistemological issues in common which we briefly discuss in the next section.

ASAM guideline document types — Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG), Clinical Consensus Statement, and Clinical Consideration — are differentiated by definition, scope, and methodology. Clinical Practice Guideline is "The most rigorous clinical and scientific document ASAM develops informed by a formal systematic review" that "addresses prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions within the scope of Addiction Medicine", and CPGs "include Full CPG Updates and Focused CPG Updates". Clinical Consensus Statement "While remaining informed by evidence, these statements are more relevant to topics with observational evidence, case studies, and consensus agreement", and "may also provide consensus agreement when several conflicting clinical guidelines are available", with these statements "meant to have high clinical relevance". Clinical Consideration is described as "Expert consensus-based clinical documents that discuss existing evidence for a focused topic. This document is based on less rigorous methods of development than a Clinical Practice Guideline or Clinical Consensus Statement", and "This document is meant to have high clinical relevance and address real-practice complexities of care". Regarding scope, CPGs cover "High priority, far reaching topics", Clinical Consensus Statement aims to "Reconcile clinical guidelines", and Clinical Consideration "Tackles issues that emerge as being clinically relevant at a given point in time". Methodologically, CPG recommendations follow a "Formal process. Recommendations follow a formal process with systematic review of evidence as outlined by the new 2023 ASAM methodology", Clinical Consensus Statement uses a "Rigorous review of available evidence and/or existing CPGs and their evidence base is used to develop consensus statements based on reported benefits, harms, costs, patient preferences, and values", and Clinical Consideration "Incorporates some evaluation of evidence but can be a narrative review and involve consensus opinion".

### Clinical practice guideline manual… [^9383fa67]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

I. Development of Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines The American Academy of Family Physicians develops evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to support family physicians in delivering high-quality, patient-centered care. CPGs are systematically developed statements that include recommendations informed by a comprehensive review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of available care options. Their purpose is to help clinicians and patients make informed decisions that improve health outcomes. Clinical practice guidelines should be developed using rigorous evidence-based methodology with the strength of evidence for each guideline explicitly stated. a. Definition Clinical practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care. They are informed by a systematic review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options.

Rather than dictating a one-size-fits-all approach, CPGs evaluate the quality of scientific evidence and translate it into clinically useful recommendations that support shared decision-making between family physicians and their patients. AAFP develops CPGs using rigorous, evidence-based methodology, with the strength of evidence explicitly stated for each recommendation. Guideline development emphasizes feasibility, actionability, and applicability to the family medicine setting. AAFP strives to ensure that recommendations: Are supported by high-quality evidence demonstrating meaningful improvement in patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, symptoms, and quality of life. Support the delivery of equitable, accessible, person-centered care, with attention to the applicability of evidence across diverse populations and clinical settings. Are feasible for implementation in typical family medicine practices.

Are disseminated broadly, including through peer-reviewed journals and AAFP's online platforms, to enhance accessibility and clinical impact. The AAFP supports the development of patient-centered, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines that focus on what care patients should receive rather than which clinician or specialty should provide it. When guidelines address questions of management, consultation, or referral, the AAFP emphasizes the importance of clearly defined clinical competencies rather than specialty designation. b. Methodology The guideline reports the methods used for the evidence review, search criteria, quality assessment, and GRADE determinations. Flow diagrams may be included when applicable. c.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^b3ed17fb]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical consensus methodology — evidence review for clinical consensus describes how literature is searched, screened, prioritized, and mapped to support recommendations. Just before publication submission, a final supplemental literature search is performed, and study inclusion and exclusion criteria are developed by the authoring team members, committee leadership, and the methodologist; titles and abstracts are screened by staff with priority given to high-quality systematic reviews, published evidence-based guidelines by clinical or public health organizations, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies. Authors complete full-text review based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria with standardized reasons for article exclusion, and the development process does not involve a risk of bias analysis or grading of the evidence. After identifying a final list of relevant studies and guidelines, ACOG staff develop summary evidence maps that provide a concise display organized by the hierarchy of evidence (systematic reviews, RCTs, observational studies, case studies, and narrative reviews), summarize guidelines from professional societies and other relevant stakeholders, and are used by the writing team and committee when developing full recommendation statements and descriptions of supportive evidence.

APA evidence-based psychological practice (EBPP) — Guideline 1 states that "Psychologists are mindful of the principles and importance of evidence-based practice". APA policy on EBPP "calls for the integration of three factors in the delivery of psychological care: the best available research evidence, the expertise of the clinician, and patient characteristics, culture, and preferences", and psychologists "seek to consult research evidence of relevance to their practice", which "includes but is not limited to the literature on human development and functioning; psychopathology; therapeutic treatments, relationships, and processes; preventive strategies; assessment; outcomes monitoring; ethical, legal, and cultural considerations; as well as professional practice guidelines and clinical practice guidelines". Clinical expertise is defined as "competence attained by psychologists through education, training, and experience that results in effective practice", EBPP "entails flexibly tailoring services to patient characteristics, culture, and preferences, which minimizes dropout and improves outcomes", and "Guideline 6 provides guidance for adapting treatment to these patient characteristics". The rationale emphasizes attention to "biases and heuristics that can adversely affect judgment" and notes that "regular consultation with colleagues and systematic collection of patient feedback can offer protection from the adverse effects of biases and heuristic shortcuts and contribute to improved patient outcomes".

### The need to systematically evaluate clinical practice guidelines [^5043fbf5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines abound. The recommendations contained in these guidelines are used not only to make decisions about the care of individual patients but also as practice standards to rate physician "quality". Physicians' confidence in guidelines is based on the supposition that there is a rigorous, objective process for developing recommendations based on the best available evidence. Though voluntary standards for the development of guidelines exist, the process of guideline development is unregulated and the quality of many guidelines is low. In addition, the few tools available to assess the quality of guidelines are time consuming and designed for researchers, not clinicians. Few guidelines are evaluated, either before or after their dissemination, for their impact on patient outcomes. Just as with pharmaceuticals and other products that can affect patients for better or worse, perhaps it is time to develop more standardized ways to evaluate the development and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines to ensure a similar balance between risk and benefit.

### Moving from evidence-based medicine to evidence-based health [^ecece4f2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The reigning paradigm underlying the work of physicians is evidence-based medicine (EBM). EBM aims to apply the best available evidence gained from the scientific method to medical decision making. It assesses the quality of evidence regarding the risks and benefits of treatments.

Since the early 1990s, EBM has become widely disseminated among medical practitioners and is universally regarded as a major advance in medico-scientific thinking. One might expect, 10–20 years following such an advance, that the benefits of EBM would have shown up in the population. In some cases, the benefits are clear; for example the percent of patients with myocardial infarction taking beta-blockers has increased substantially. Yet for a number of conditions, a large proportion of patients remain in poor control despite excellent evidence guiding management and treatment. For two-thirds of Americans with diabetes and half of those with hypertension — conditions with strong evidence-based guidelines — these conditions are inadequately controlled.

EBM has two major limitations: 1) the medical care system is not well structured to assist patients in incorporating the advances of EBM into their lives, and 2) the physical and social environment in which patients live create major challenges to patients' ability to make the evidence-based changes required for disease control. We argue that EBM alone is insufficient as a guiding principle for medical practice and that a fundamental shift in thinking is needed. The following few paragraphs explain this paradigm shift.

The Chronic Care Model represents one effort to extend EBM by restructuring primary care, in particular by implementing planned visits — led by nurses, pharmacists health educators or health coaches — that provide patients with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to improve their health behaviors and increase medication adherence. These services are called "self-management support" (SMS), which has been shown to be the Model's component most commonly associated with outcome improvements. This is not surprising since patients themselves make the day-to-day decisions regarding chronic conditions. Many SMS models exist, among them the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program in which trained patients lead a group of people with chronic conditionsand the health coaching teamlet in which a trained health coach works closely with a clinician to provide self-management support in the primary care setting.

### Instruments for evaluating education in evidence-based practice: a systematic review [^3d643aa3]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence-based practice (EBP) is the integration of the best research evidence with patients' values and clinical circumstances in clinical decision making. Teaching of EBP should be evaluated and guided by evidence of its own effectiveness.

Objective

To appraise, summarize, and describe currently available EBP teaching evaluation instruments.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, HAPI, and ERIC databases; reference lists of retrieved articles; EBP Internet sites; and 8 education journals from 1980 through April 2006. For inclusion, studies had to report an instrument evaluating EBP, contain sufficient description to permit analysis, and present quantitative results of administering the instrument.

Data Extraction

Two raters independently abstracted information on the development, format, learner levels, evaluation domains, feasibility, reliability, and validity of the EBP evaluation instruments from each article. We defined 3 levels of instruments based on the type, extent, methods, and results of psychometric testing and suitability for different evaluation purposes.

Data Synthesis

Of 347 articles identified, 115 were included, representing 104 unique instruments. The instruments were most commonly administered to medical students and postgraduate trainees and evaluated EBP skills. Among EBP skills, acquiring evidence and appraising evidence were most commonly evaluated, but newer instruments evaluated asking answerable questions and applying evidence to individual patients. Most behavior instruments measured the performance of EBP steps in practice but newer instruments documented the performance of evidence-based clinical maneuvers or patient-level outcomes. At least 1 type of validity evidence was demonstrated for 53% of instruments, but 3 or more types of validity evidence were established for only 10%. High-quality instruments were identified for evaluating the EBP competence of individual trainees, determining the effectiveness of EBP curricula, and assessing EBP behaviors with objective outcome measures.

Conclusions

Instruments with reasonable validity are available for evaluating some domains of EBP and may be targeted to different evaluation needs. Further development and testing is required to evaluate EBP attitudes, behaviors, and more recently articulated EBP skills.

### Methodology for lung cancer evidence review and guideline development: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^2dfb3fd3]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

ACCP recommendation grades — weak (2A–2C) describe closely balanced benefit–risk scenarios, evidence sources, and implications. Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A) applies when "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden", supported by "Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies", and implies "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values" and "Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B) also has "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden" with "Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies", and implies "Best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values" and that "Higher-quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate". Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence (2C) is marked by "Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk and burden may be closely balanced", based on "Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence", and implies "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and that "Higher-quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate".

### Evidence-based practice guidelines for plasma transfusion [^6ce70c60]. Transfusion (2010). Medium credibility.

GRADE methodology — quality-of-evidence assessment separates evidence quality from the strength of recommendations and considers multiple factors that affect quality, including study design, methodologic factors that may decrease quality of evidence, factors that may increase quality of evidence, consistency or inconsistency of results, directness or indirectness, precision or imprecision, and reporting bias; quality represents an estimate of the "correctness" or "truth" of results, while strength of recommendations depends in addition on tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^961fbf16]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) methods — evidence review and recommendation development explain that all ACP clinical guidelines are based on systematic reviews of evidence from sources that include external evidence review groups such as an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center or a Cochrane Center, the Agency's Effective Health Care Program Evidence-based Practice Center Program, and the Veterans Affairs Evidence Synthesis Program; a technical expert panel is convened to inform the evidence review and refine the population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO); outcomes are categorized as critical, important, or not important for decision making and ratings must include both clinical benefits and harms; the evidence review team and the CGC use GRADE to rate certainty of evidence for each outcome and overall, grading certainty as high, moderate, or low, and the CGC does not have a "very low" category and instead considers such evidence to be insufficient; following the GRADE framework, the CGC uses evidence-to-decision (EtD) tables to document decisions and summarize PICO, desirable versus undesirable effects, certainty, patient values and preferences, costs and resources, and judgments, and EtD tables containing the final recommendations are published as an appendix to each guideline to ensure transparency.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^5de8e7f2]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Research evidence — when evaluating the research evidence, psychologists endeavor to pay attention to both efficacy (the strength of evidence for a causal effect) and clinical utility (generalizability, feasibility, and cost–benefit analysis) and recognize the value of various study designs including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case control studies, case series, single-case experimental designs, process-outcome studies, effectiveness research, ethnographic research, clinical observation, qualitative research, and mixed-methods research; different designs are best suited to answering different types of questions. For example, RCTs control most effectively for threats to internal validity and are thus best suited for drawing causal inferences about treatment effects; however, RCTs often have specific selection criteria that may not generalize to patients typically seen in practice, generally study changes in diagnostic symptoms or status, typically do not test the mechanisms hypothesized to underlie the treatment, and generally examine treatments as a whole such that RCT findings for multicomponent treatment methods do not identify the necessary and sufficient subcomponents. Effectiveness studies are well positioned to establish the ecological validity and portability of treatments in real-world practice settings.

### Clarification and elaboration on evidence-based practice in psychology [^58b0fe75]. The American Psychologist (2007). Low credibility.

Responds to comments by D. C. Wendt and B. D. Slife, P. H. Hunsberger, and R. B. Stuart and S. O. Lilienfeld regarding the report by the APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice entitled Evidence-based practice in psychology. The goal of the task force was to create a scheme that would suggest how evidence should be used to design and offer services that will benefit patients and to assure the public and the health care system that psychologists are providing evidence-based services. There were and will continue to be many scientific and philosophical issues inherent in any such enterprise, and agreement by all psychologists with every aspect of EBPP may not be possible. Nevertheless, the APA's EBPP policy and the report that accompanied it are remarkably inclusive of various perspectives while remaining unambiguous about the need to use evidence in a way that leads to effective services. What is needed at this point are clinically relevant evidence and investigations of how such evidence can be used to best benefit those served by psychological interventions.

### Methods and definition of terms: effectiveness of continuing medical education: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based educational guidelines [^a0f68444]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A core mission of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) is the education of its members, including continuing medical education (CME). The question of what evidence supports the effectiveness of CME activities became central to the ACCP's Educational Resources Division and its education committee.

Methods

An application for consideration as a topic for an evidenced-based guideline was submitted to the ACCP Health and Science Policy Committee in 2004. The application was approved contingent on acceptance by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as a topic for an evidence-based review to be awarded to an AHRQ evidence-based practice center (EPC). The topic was accepted by AHRQ, with a collaborative revision developed by AHRQ and ACCP of the focused questions submitted in the nomination. The AHRQ awarded the evidence review to The Johns Hopkins University EPC (Baltimore, MD). An expert writing panel was assembled comprising methodologists from the EPC, and recommendations were developed from the EPC evidence review and graded using the ACCP system of categorizing the strength of each recommendation and the quality of evidence.

Conclusions

This section describes the processes used to develop these guidelines, including identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the evidence; assessing the strength of evidence; and grading each recommendation.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^e6498189]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline formats, recommendation wording, and implementation — Each guideline is produced in 4 formats, including a full version detailing methods, evidence, and the link between evidence and recommendations; a NICE version that lists the recommendations; a quick reference guide summarizing recommendations for health care professionals; and an "understanding NICE guidance" version for patients, carers, and the general public. The wording of each recommendation is considered carefully to ensure that it is clear and concise, and recommendations are action-based and attempt to be specific about the intervention and the population to which the recommendation applies; justifications are not normally included because they are available in the full version's section describing the link between evidence and recommendations. The guideline development group selects 5 to 10 recommendations as key priorities for implementation; these are not necessarily all "strong" and are chosen as being likely to do at least 1 of the following: result in significant benefits for patients, reduce variation in care and outcomes, lead to more efficient use of National Health Service resources, promote patient choice, or promote more equitable access to health care. The guideline development group also identifies recommendations likely to benefit from implementation support, with criteria including not being part of routine care, requiring changes in service delivery or retraining, needing implementation across several agencies or settings, being potentially contentious, or being difficult to implement. While assessing the evidence and making recommendations for best practice, the group also considers how the recommendations will be implemented, and NICE has set up a team to assist with implementation that helps disseminate guidelines and provides tools to put them into practice.

### Public policy and evidence-based practice [^471ac4e3]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The time has come to add to the body of EBP implementation knowledge at multiple levels, including knowledge about policy, program priorities, clinician practice, consumer adherence, and family member support. Implementation at the policy level, however, is primary and paramount. The national initiative supporting EBP implementation is one of the most important innovations on the mental health horizon. It will serve as the testing ground for what can be learned about bridging the gap between science and service. This important initiative will not go far if it is not supported by mental health policies — at state and federal levels — that create the organizational and financial incentives to implement EBPs. In addition, it will be a time-limited activity if it also does not yield lessons about how to adapt to new evidence and on-going systemic changes. Organizations must be flexible and able to learn and adapt. The promise of decades of research must be realized in practice. There is an opportunity to combine quality improvement with accountability through performance measurement and the implementation of effective new services and treatments. The Surgeon General simultaneously identified this research's promise and documented its shortcomings. His report outlines courses of action for policymakers that should guide clinicians away from service disparities and toward the implementation of EBP.

### A scoping review of evidence-based guidance and guidelines published by general practice professional organizations [^f175fc88]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical and policy implications

This review shows that international GP organizations, despite working in different healthcare systems, with different governance structures, produce guidelines with similar topics, methods, and dissemination strategies for use by their members. The standard transparent approach to production methods can facilitate a standardization across GP organizations thus promoting sharing of resources, but this needs to be balanced with the need for local relevance to improve the success of guideline implementation. Emerging evidence on the effectiveness of guideline implementation in terms of improving patient outcomes, may influence policy around the use of alternative strategies to support the use of guidelines in practice.

### De-implementing wisely: developing the evidence base to reduce low-value care [^6747a38b]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). High credibility.

Despite such clear uptake of and enthusiasm in the CW initiative and some early successes in lowering low-value care through local interventions, studies have shown limited large-scale change in ordering rates of low-value care since the launch of these campaigns. The issue of implementing CW recommendations and evaluating the effects of these recommendations has received much less attention. Recommendations alone will not change practice. Recent commentaries have suggested that the focus of the campaign should be on identifying and applying evidence-based strategies to effectively reduce low-value care. There is substantial evidence and guidance on how to implement evidence-based strategies. However, few conceptual frameworks exist to guide de-implementation, and those that do exist focus on team culture or organisational changeor target change in a specific clinical setting, making it difficult to generalise the frameworks across a myriad of healthcare settings and contexts.

What is de-implementation?

Broad definitions of implementation and de-implementation exist in healthcare. The National Institute of Health defined implementation as "the use of strategies to introduce or change evidence-based health interventions within specific settings"whereas de-implementation in the healthcare context has been defined as the "abandonment of medical practices or interventions that have been found to be ineffective and harmful". Developing theory and evidence to support de-implementation interventions is of significant importance for healthcare systems.

While evidence exists about how to implement evidence-based practices in general and some interventions are reported as generally effective (eg, audit and feedback, academic detailing), there has been less attention focused on the problem of implementing recommendations to reduce low-value healthcare. Further research is needed to explore the generalisability of research findings about general implementation activities that aim that to reduce low-value healthcare.

### Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations in clinical practice guidelines part 3 of 3. the GRADE approach to developing recommendations [^77d7ba19]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

This is the third and last article in the series about the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations in clinical practice guidelines and its application in the field of allergy. We describe the factors that influence the strength of recommendations about the use of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic interventions: the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, the quality of a body of evidence related to a decision, patients' values and preferences, and considerations of resource use. We provide examples from two recently developed guidelines in the field of allergy that applied the GRADE approach. The main advantages of this approach are the focus on patient important outcomes, explicit consideration of patients' values and preferences, the systematic approach to collecting the evidence, the clear separation of the concepts of quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, and transparent reporting of the decision process. The focus on transparency facilitates understanding and implementation and should empower patients, clinicians and other health care professionals to make informed choices.

### Considerations in the determination of medical necessity in children: application to contractual language [^f38c89a3]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Considerations for medical necessity — evidence standards and expected benefit — state that 'Medically necessary services should be reasonably expected to produce the intended results for children to whom they are delivered and should have expected benefits that outweigh potential harmful effects'. Coverage determinations align with evidence frameworks: 'Evidence-based and evidence-informed practices are widely embraced as appropriate frameworks to guide which health care services should be included in what is covered by a payer or health care agency', and 'Evidence-based practice is rooted in the acquisition and interpretation of scientific evidence'. Evidence hierarchy is specified: 'Robust randomized, controlled clinical trials that demonstrate a salutary effect of the intervention on health outcomes provide the highest level of evidence'; if absent, 'methodologically sound observational studies that support a causal relationship between the intervention and improved health outcomes can be used', whereas 'Less methodologically sound observational studies and uncontrolled clinical series may be suggestive but cannot be used to document a causal salutary relationship unless the magnitude of the effect observed far exceeds what would be expected' given natural history or bias, and 'the amount and quality of available scientific evidence may not always be sufficient to determine the efficacy of a given service or intervention'.

### Physiology versus evidence-based guidance for critical care practice [^adc90c6f]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence based medicine is an attempt to optimize the medical decision process through methods primarily based on evidence coming from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials ("evidence-based medicine"), rather than on "clinical judgment" alone. The randomized trials are the cornerstones of this process. However, the randomized trials are just a method to prove or disprove a given hypothesis, which, in turn, derives from a general observation of the reality (premises or theories). In this paper we will examine some of the most recent randomized trials performed in Intensive Care, analyzing their premises, hypothesis and outcome. It is quite evident that when the premises are wrong or too vague the unavoidable consequences will be a negative outcome. We should pay when designing the trial an equal attention in defining premises and hypothesis that we pay for the trial conduction.
