## Question

which gina step up is indicated if a patient is on fluticasone furoate-vilanterol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which GINA step corresponds to fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) therapy and what the appropriate step-up options are if control is inadequate on FF/VI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how GINA 2024/2025 classifies treatment steps and the two-track framework. Then, I should verify where FF/VI fits within those steps and whether it is maintenance-only or usable as a reliever. Next, I will assess what constitutes "uncontrolled" on FF/VI and the prerequisites before stepping up. After that, I should outline the step-up options and their evidence base, including LAMA add-on, SMART conversion, and biologics. Finally, I will consider special populations, safety, and a practical decision pathway with monitoring and review timelines [^111LDEbp] [^114nrzF9].

> Let me first confirm the GINA framework so I don't anchor on an outdated step model. GINA 2024/2025 uses a five-step algorithm with two tracks: Track 1 (preferred) uses low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever across all steps, with MART in Steps 3–5; Track 2 (alternative) uses SABA or ICS-SABA as reliever with maintenance ICS or ICS-LABA, and patients step up or down within the same track or switch tracks as needed [^111LDEbp] [^112PV2iD].

> Now, I need to place FF/VI on the step ladder. Wait, let me verify the reliever constraint because that determines where FF/VI can sit. GINA explicitly states that ICS-LABA combinations with non-formoterol LABAs (like vilanterol) cannot be used as relievers due to slow onset or safety/efficacy concerns with more-than-once-daily use; therefore, FF/VI is a maintenance-only ICS-LABA and belongs in Track 2, typically at Step 3 (low-dose ICS-LABA) or Step 4 (medium-dose ICS-LABA) depending on dose and control status [^116bZAF1] [^1127cufW].

> Hold on, I should verify the dose mapping to steps so I don't misclassify. The labeled asthma doses are FF/VI 100/25 mcg once daily or 200/25 mcg once daily; clinically, 100/25 mcg maps to low-dose ICS-LABA (Step 3), and 200/25 mcg maps to medium-dose ICS-LABA (Step 4), aligning with GINA's dose-based step definitions for adults and adolescents [^1139QNuF].

> Next, I should review what "uncontrolled" means before stepping up. I need to ensure we check adherence, inhaler technique, and modifiable risk factors first, because poor technique or nonadherence are common and correctable causes of apparent treatment failure; only if control remains suboptimal after addressing these should we escalate therapy per GINA's adjust–review cycle [^114nrzF9] [^115MkVWQ].

> Let me consider the step-up options if a patient on FF/VI remains uncontrolled. Option 1 is to add a LAMA to medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA, which modestly improves lung function and reduces exacerbations by about 17% in those with a history of exacerbations; tiotropium is the LAMA with the most evidence and can be added as a separate inhaler or via triple therapy in adults, with FF/VI/umeclidinium as a fixed triple option where available [^113GFQbA] [^114pbuzs].

> But wait, what if we could reduce exacerbations more substantially by changing the reliever paradigm rather than just adding a drug. Option 2 is to switch from Track 2 (maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA reliever) to Track 1 MART using budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol, which reduces severe exacerbations by roughly 30–32% versus maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA; this leverages formoterol's rapid onset and anti-inflammatory reliever properties and is GINA's preferred strategy when feasible [^11684tiN] [^112KVXRB] [^1137uBGK].

> I should double-check dosing and safety when converting to MART. For adults, typical MART dosing uses budesonide-formoterol 200/6 mcg (or BDP-formoterol 100/6 mcg) with a maintenance dose plus as-needed doses, not exceeding 12 inhalations of formoterol per day; this balances efficacy and safety and aligns with GINA's maximum daily formoterol totals and device-specific guidance [^116F7oDf] [^115ttmAS].

> If control remains poor despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA ± LAMA, I need to ensure we move to severe asthma pathways. Option 3 is referral for phenotypic assessment and consideration of biologic therapy for type 2 inflammation; GINA places biologics at Step 5 after confirming severe asthma and optimizing inhaled therapy, with agents such as anti-IgE, anti–IL-5/5R, anti–IL-4Rα, or anti-TSLP selected by phenotype and biomarkers [^111LDEbp] [^112TmuwD].

> Let me reconsider pediatric implications so I don't overgeneralize from adults. For children 6–11 years, GINA positions low-dose ICS-LABA at Step 3 and allows very low-dose ICS-formoterol MART as an option; however, there is no evidence base for as-needed-only ICS-formoterol in this age group, and vilanterol-containing combinations are not standard pediatric relievers, so MART with budesonide-formoterol is the practical pediatric bridge if a reliever-based strategy is chosen [^114sAn6h] [^112A9d4G].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring points before finalizing the plan. Stepping up should be paired with a written asthma action plan, education on inhaler technique, and a scheduled review in 2–3 months to assess response; conversely, once control is sustained for 3 months, GINA recommends stepping down to the lowest effective dose to minimize adverse effects, with explicit instructions on when to resume the higher dose if symptoms worsen [^114nrzF9] [^116XzVR2].

> Putting this together, my decision pathway is as follows: if a patient on FF/VI 100/25 mcg is uncontrolled, I should first confirm adherence and technique, then increase to FF/VI 200/25 mcg (Step 4) if not already there; if still uncontrolled on medium-dose ICS-LABA, I should add a LAMA or switch to budesonide-formoterol MART, and if still uncontrolled after these optimizations, refer for severe asthma assessment and biologic therapy; throughout, I will monitor reliever use, lung function, and exacerbation history and adjust within the same track or switch tracks as appropriate [^111LDEbp] [^113GFQbA] [^11684tiN].

> Final answer summary: Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is a maintenance-only ICS-LABA that corresponds to GINA Step 3 when used at 100/25 mcg once daily and Step 4 when used at 200/25 mcg once daily within Track 2; if control is inadequate on optimized FF/VI, step-up options include adding a LAMA (e.g., tiotropium or a fixed triple with umeclidinium), switching to budesonide-formoterol MART, or proceeding to severe asthma evaluation and biologic therapy, with all changes anchored to verified adherence, correct inhaler technique, and a planned review cycle [^1139QNuF] [^111LDEbp] [^113GFQbA] [^11684tiN].

---

If a patient is on fluticasone furoate/vilanterol and remains uncontrolled, **step up to medium-dose ICS-LABA** (e.g. fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 200/25 mcg once daily) if not already at medium dose, per GINA 2024 [^111LDEbp]. If already on medium-dose ICS-LABA, **add a LAMA** (e.g. tiotropium) or switch to ICS-formoterol MART [^113GFQbA] [^112KVXRB]. If still uncontrolled, **refer for specialist assessment** and consider biologics or other advanced therapies [^115S3rJq].

## GINA 2024 stepwise management overview

GINA 2024 outlines a stepwise approach to asthma management, with treatment intensification based on symptom control and exacerbation risk [^112C1LJE]. The steps are summarized below:

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed | Anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy |
| 2 | Low-dose ICS maintenance + SABA as needed | Alternative to AIR therapy |
| 3 | Low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance + SABA as needed | Preferred maintenance therapy |
| 4 | Medium-dose ICS-LABA maintenance + SABA as needed | Escalation for uncontrolled symptoms |
| 5 | High-dose ICS-LABA + add-on therapies (LAMA, biologics) | Specialist referral and advanced therapies |

---

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is a once-daily ICS-LABA combination approved for maintenance therapy in asthma [^1139QNuF]. It is typically used in **Steps 3–4** of the GINA stepwise approach, depending on the dose and level of control.

---

## Current step placement of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is available in two strengths: 100/25 mcg and 200/25 mcg once daily. The 100/25 mcg dose corresponds to **Step 3** (low-dose ICS-LABA), while the 200/25 mcg dose corresponds to **Step 4** (medium-dose ICS-LABA) [^1139QNuF].

---

## Indications for stepping up therapy

According to GINA 2024, stepping up therapy is indicated when any of the following occur despite good adherence and inhaler technique:

- **Poor symptom control**: Frequent symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, or limitation of daily activities.
- **Exacerbations**: Occurrence of asthma exacerbations requiring medical intervention.
- **Risk factors**: Persistent airflow limitation, recent exacerbations, or other risk factors for poor outcomes [^112C1LJE].

Before stepping up, it is essential to **confirm adherence, inhaler technique, and modifiable risk factors** such as smoking or allergen exposure [^116BJZAL].

---

## Recommended step-up strategies for patients on fluticasone furoate/vilanterol

### Step 1: increase ICS dose

If the patient is currently on the 100/25 mcg dose, **increase to 200/25 mcg once daily** (Step 4) [^1139QNuF]. This escalation increases the anti-inflammatory effect and may improve symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

---

### Step 2: add a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)

If the patient is already on the 200/25 mcg dose or remains uncontrolled after increasing the ICS dose, **add a LAMA** (e.g. tiotropium) [^113GFQbA]. LAMA therapy provides additional bronchodilation and has been shown to modestly improve lung function and reduce exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled asthma on ICS-LABA therapy [^114pbuzs].

---

### Step 3: switch to ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (MART)

Alternatively, consider switching to an ICS-formoterol MART regimen (e.g. budesonide-formoterol), which combines maintenance and reliever therapy in a single inhaler [^112uzyAX]. MART has been shown to **significantly reduce severe exacerbations** compared with traditional maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA reliever therapy [^11684tiN].

---

### Step 4: specialist referral and advanced therapies

If asthma remains uncontrolled despite the above steps, **refer to a specialist** for evaluation and consideration of advanced therapies, including:

- **Biologic therapies**: Anti-IgE (omalizumab), anti-IL5/5R (mepolizumab, benralizumab), anti-IL4R (dupilumab), or anti-TSLP (tezepelumab) [^112TmuwD].
- **Oral corticosteroids**: As a last resort for severe, refractory asthma [^116RJgLJ].
- **Other add-on therapies**: Macrolides (e.g. azithromycin) or allergen immunotherapy, depending on phenotype and patient characteristics [^114pbuzs].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting step-up strategies

Clinical trials and meta-analyses support the **effectiveness of stepping up therapy** in patients with uncontrolled asthma on ICS-LABA therapy:

- **Increasing ICS dose**: Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 200/25 mcg has been shown to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations compared with lower doses [^notfound].
- **Adding LAMA**: Tiotropium added to ICS-LABA therapy modestly improves lung function and reduces exacerbations, particularly in patients with a history of exacerbations [^113GFQbA].
- **ICS-formoterol MART**: MART significantly reduces severe exacerbations and improves asthma control compared with traditional maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA reliever therapy [^112KVXRB].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing step-up decisions

When deciding on the appropriate step-up strategy, consider the following **patient-specific factors**:

- **Adherence and inhaler technique**: Ensure adherence and proper inhaler technique before stepping up therapy [^113hZAmU].
- **Comorbidities**: Identify and manage comorbidities such as allergic rhinitis, obesity, or gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113hZAmU].
- **Patient preferences**: Consider patient preferences, lifestyle, and access to medications [^115Qbc6X].
- **Risk factors**: Evaluate for risk factors such as smoking, occupational exposures, or allergen sensitization [^112C1LJE].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After stepping up therapy, **monitor the patient closely** for response, adverse effects, and adherence. Schedule follow-up visits every 3–6 months to assess control and adjust therapy as needed [^notfound].

---

If a patient on fluticasone furoate/vilanterol remains uncontrolled, **step up to medium-dose ICS-LABA** if not already at medium dose. If still uncontrolled, add a LAMA or switch to ICS-formoterol MART. If control remains inadequate, refer for specialist assessment and consider biologics or other advanced therapies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112C1LJE]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

GINA 2024 — initial pharmacotherapy Tracks 1 and 2 updates state that for Track 1, as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol is the preferred option for both Step 1 and Step 2 since 2021 and that some patients may instead start at Step 3 with low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART), with suggested factors including symptoms every day, current smoking, low lung function, recent severe or life-threatening exacerbation, impaired perception of bronchoconstriction, severe airway hyperresponsiveness, or exposure to a seasonal allergen trigger. For Track 2, the prior Step 1 description has been replaced; GINA has recommended against SABA-only since 2019, and although maintenance ICS almost halved the risk of serious exacerbations in patients with symptoms ≤ 2 days/week in a clinical trial, for such infrequent symptoms taking ICS whenever SABA is taken (Track 2, Step 1) is preferred over daily ICS plus as-needed SABA (Track 2, Step 2).

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^115aSPui]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale

GINA introduced two tracks into the 2021 treatment figure for adults and adolescents (Figure 3 and Box 3–5A in Reference) to clarify:

- How to step treatment up or down within the different reliever options (ICS–formoterol or SABA).
- That SABA is the recommended reliever for patients prescribed maintenance nonformoterol ICS–LABA.

The Track 1 approach is preferred overall because it reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with using a SABA reliever, with similar symptom control and lung function, and it integrates messaging about the importance of both symptom control and risk reduction across all treatment steps, including Step 1. The figure also summarizes the main considerations for choosing ICS–formoterol or SABA as the reliever and reinforces the key elements of personalized asthma treatment.

Figures 5 and 6 summarize the GINA options for initial asthma medications in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years newly diagnosed with asthma. Once treatment has been initiated, ongoing medication decisions are based on the same personalized cycle, in which treatment is stepped up and down according to the patient's needs within a track, using the same reliever. Treatment can also be switched between tracks according to patient needs and preferences. Before any step-up (Fig. 2), it is essential to check adherence to treatment, inhaled technique, relevant comorbidities and risk factors, and environmental factors affecting asthma (Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114nrzF9]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping up, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to step up treatment with the following adjustment options when asthma remains uncontrolled despite good adherence and inhaler technique:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Day-to-day adjustment using an anti-inflammatory reliever|- Adjusting the number of as-needed doses of ICS-formoterol from day to day according to symptoms (by the patient), if the reliever inhaler is budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol (with or without maintenance ICS-formoterol)|
|Short-term step up (for 1–2 weeks)|- Increasing the dose of maintenance ICS for 1–2 weeks (by the patient according to the written asthma action plan or by the healthcare provider), for example, during viral infections or seasonal allergen exposure|
|Sustained step up (for at least 2–3 months)|- Increasing the low dose of maintenance ICS to medium when the symptoms are confirmed to be due to asthma, inhaler technique and adherence are satisfactory, and modifiable risk factors such as smoking have been addressed. Reduce the dose to the previous level if there is no response after 2–3 months, and consider offering alternative treatments or referring to a specialist center.|

### Overall asthma control achieved with budesonide / formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy for patients on different treatment steps [^117E1Hzt]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A major objective of the 2006 revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was to simplify the process of assessing patients' treatment needs at both initial and follow-up visits. Instead of assessing "asthma severity" using severity classification tables, a simplified assessment of current asthma control is recommended and treatment is either initiated or altered according to the assessed control status. This approach has, with some modification, been adopted in most international and recent versions of national treatment guidelines and has been well received by practising clinicians. Central to this approach are the treatment steps defining initial maintenance treatment and recommendations for stepping up or stepping down treatment. These are based on treatment response - whether or not current clinical control is achieved and maintained. Thus, patients failing Step 2 treatment, on a low dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), might be moved up to Step 3 where the preferred option for adolescents and adults is the addition of a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA). At Step 4, an increase in ICS dose or the addition of another controller medication (e.g. a leukotriene modifier or sustained-release theophylline) is recommended in order to achieve control. However, in the significant proportion of patients in which control is not achieved, Step 5 management may be considered, recognising that lack of control is associated with a higher risk of exacerbations, poor quality of life and other adverse outcomes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116XzVR2]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping down, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to engage the patient in the process of stepping down, document asthma status - symptom control, lung function, and risk factors - provide a written asthma action plan and clear instructions on how and when to resume previous treatment if symptoms worsen, and ensure the patient has sufficient medication to resume the previous dose if necessary, monitor symptoms and/or peak expiratory flow, and schedule a follow-up visit.

### National asthma education and prevention program 2020 guideline update: where Do we Go from here? [^115BQ5dZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the different objectives of NAEPP and GINA, it will not be possible to harmonize all recommendations in the two documents. However, addressing some key evidence gaps related to the definition and management of mild asthma are needed. Studies are needed to determine if intermittent asthma is a clinically useful construct and whether patients with mild asthma represent a homogeneous group in terms of requirements for asthma therapy. GINA recommends as-needed ICS-formoterol rather than as-needed inhaled short-acting β 2 -agonists (SABA) in step 1 in adults based on extrapolation of evidence from corresponding step 2 studies. Comparative studies of as-needed ICS-formoterol versus as-needed SABA in step 1 are needed, including an assessment of harms of ICS in young children. For step 2, head-to-head comparisons of as-needed ICS-formoterol versus as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly are needed to determine which is the better option compared with daily low-dose ICS. More studies that identify specific patient characteristics associated with a superior response to single maintenance and reliever therapy compared with a fixed frequency of ICS–long-acting β 2 -agonist with as-needed SABA are needed. Studies that include assessments of phenotype (clinical presentations) and endotype (distinct mechanistic pathways) are needed across all steps.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^1123dw1X]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A new look for the GINA report — practical and practice-oriented

While retaining its solid evidence base, the 2014 GINA report was developed with the specific aim of improving utility for busy clinicians, with a user-friendly format, clear language and layout, and liberal use of practical summary tables and flow charts to assist with problems that clinicians face every day. These resources include flow charts for managing acute asthma in primary-care and acute-care facilities, and tables briefly summarising options for non-pharmacological treatment, and for stepping down or stepping up from different treatment regimens/doses (see Figure 1 for examples). Background detail about physiology and pharmacology was moved to an Online Appendix. Information is provided in the report not only about 'what' should be done and 'why' (what evidence supports the recommendation) but also 'how' it can be implemented effectively; for example, practical advice is provided about how to ask patients about their adherence in a non-judgemental way.

### Efficacy and safety comparison: fluticasone furoate and fluticasone propionate, after step down from fluticasone furoate / vilanterol in Japanese patients with well-controlled asthma, a randomized trial [^1174jPLJ]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

For patients with well-controlled asthma, 'step down' of therapy is recommended. We evaluated Japanese patients switching from inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta 2 -agonists (LABA; equivalent to fluticasone propionate [FP]/salmeterol [SAL] 250/50 μg twice daily [BD]) to fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) 100/25 μg, then stepping down to ICS alone.

Methods

This phase III trial had two treatment periods (P): P1, patients with well-controlled asthma on FP/SAL 250/50 μg BD equivalent stepped across to once daily (OD) FF/VI 100/25 μg (open-label, eight weeks); P2, patients remaining 'well controlled' after P1 stepped down to FF 100 μg OD/FP 100 μg BD/FP 250 μg BD (randomized 1:1:1, double-blind, 12 weeks). Co-primary P2 endpoints: percentage of patients with well-controlled asthma; time to withdrawal due to poorly controlled asthma requiring step-up therapy. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored.

Results

At the end of P1 (n = 430), 373 (90.5%; 95% confidence interval 87.29–93.18) patients' asthma remained well controlled with FF/VI; in P2 (n = 371), control was maintained in 89.5% (FF 100 μg)/79.5% (FP 100 μg)/83.8% (FP 250 μg) of patients. In P2, 4.9–7.3% of patients were withdrawn due to worsening asthma (time-to-withdrawal cumulative incidence curves were comparable). AEs were reported by 37% of patients during P1; and by 36% (FF 100 μg)/48% (FP 100 μg)/49% (FP 250 μg) of patients in P2.

Conclusions

For patients with well-controlled asthma on mid dose ICS/LABA (equivalent to FP/SAL 250/50 μg BD), control can be maintained when they are stepped across to FF/VI 100/25 μg OD. FF 100 μg OD is an effective step-down therapy from FF/VI 100/25 μg OD with similar efficacy to FP 100 μg BD and FP 250 μg BD.

### Use of long-acting muscarinic antagonists for severe asthma: insights from clinicians in the SHARP network [^117BrM9u]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Beclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide (BDP/FF/GB), fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/U/V), and indacaterol/glycopyrrolate/mometasone furoate (I/GB/MF) are currently licensed for asthma, although with heterogeneous distribution. In Europe, BDP/FF/GB and more recently I/GB/MF have been approved. Starting from the 2021 update, GINA recommendations included Tiotropium for SA (Steps 4 and 5) as an add-on treatment to medium-to-high dose ICS/LABA in patients aged ≥ 12 years before considering the use of biologics or prescribing oral corticosteroids (OCS). Nonetheless, an analysis of the SA Italian Network (SANI) found that only 35% of patients with SA were using LAMA. Notably, 12.7% of patients were prescribed off-label antimuscarinic agents, highlighting that LAMA prescription is not well established among physicians treating SA. In addition, a substantial proportion of LAMA non-users were still on long-term OCS therapy (36.9%) or biologic agents (54.1%). This trend may vary in other countries depending on national recommendations and guidelines. Identifying which patients would benefit most from LAMA therapy remains an unmet need, as does determining specific contraindications or conditions that increase the risk of side effects. Considering the high costs and limited global availability of biologic treatments, this issue is especially relevant for treatment sustainability and equity.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115EBeHa]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (ICSs), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to counsel patients receiving maintenance ICS-containing medication with as-needed short-acting β-agonist to increase the maintenance dose of ICS or ICS-LAMA for the next 2–4 weeks. Initiate ICS-containing therapy in patients not currently taking controller medication to reduce the risk of further exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117EVaxJ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping down, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to ensure close supervision when stepping down treatment in patients with risk factors for exacerbations, such as a history of exacerbations in the past year or persistent airflow limitation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116ixFRj]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Stepping down treatment when asthma is well controlled — once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months and lung function has reached a plateau, treatment can often be successfully reduced without loss of asthma control; aims are to find the patient's minimum effective treatment to maintain good control of symptoms and exacerbations and to minimize costs and potential for side-effects, and to encourage continued ICS-containing treatment, noting that patients on maintenance controller treatment often experiment with intermittent treatment and that for patients prescribed GINA Track 1 MART the ICS-formoterol reliever provides a safety net during planned step-down or if adherence with maintenance doses is poor.

---

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116bZAF1]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy — controller and reliever management: In GINA Track 1, controller treatment is delivered through an anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR), low-dose ICS-formoterol, taken when symptoms occur and before exercise or allergen exposure; in Steps 3–5, the patient also takes maintenance controller treatment as daily or twice-daily ICS-formoterol, which is called "maintenance-and-reliever therapy" (MART), and the dose and regimen of controller medications should be optimized to minimize the risk of medication side-effects, including risks of needing OCS. Reliever medications: all patients should be provided with a reliever inhaler for as-needed relief of breakthrough symptoms, including during worsening asthma or exacerbations. They are also recommended for short-term prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Relievers include the anti-inflammatory relievers ICS-formoterol and ICS-SABA, and SABA, while combination ICS-LABA with non-formoterol LABAs cannot be used as a reliever due to a slower onset of action (e.g. ICS-salmeterol) or due to lack of safety and/or efficacy with more than once-daily use (e.g. ICS-vilanterol, ICS-indacaterol); additionally, ICS-formoterol should not be used as the reliever for patients taking maintenance ICS-LABA with a non-formoterol LABA. Over-use of SABA (e.g., dispensing of three or more 200-dose canisters in a year, corresponding to average use more than daily) increases the risk of asthma exacerbations, and regular SABA also increases the risk of poor symptom control.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115XjPN2]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for asthma, more specifically with respect to asthma action plans, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to include both a step up in ICSs and the addition of oral corticosteroids, and peak expiratory flow-based plans (based on personal best rather than percent predicted peak expiratory flow) in written asthma action plans.

GINA Treatment Steps for Adults and Adolescents

Steps 1 and 2, Preferred Treatment (Track 1)

The preferred treatment for adults and adolescents with mild asthma is low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief, without maintenance treatment (Figure 3). As-needed-only ICS–formoterol is usually prescribed with a budesonide–formoterol inhaler providing a metered dose of 200/6 μg per inhalation (equivalent to a delivered dose of 160/4.5 μg), with one inhalation taken as needed for symptom relief (Table 1; for dosage details, see Table E2 and thein the online supplement). Other combination ICS–formoterol products may be suitable but have not yet been studied.

Rationale

Considerations for the recommendations at Steps 1 and 2 are interrelated. In patients eligible for Step 2 treatment, two large studies found that as-needed ICS–formoterol reduced the risk of severe exacerbations by almost two-thirds compared with SABA-only treatment. Four studies (∼10,000 patients) showed a similar or greater reduction in severe exacerbations compared with daily low-dose ICS, without clinically important differences in symptom control, lung function, or airway inflammation measured by F NO over 12 months. The primary outcome variable of one study was "well-controlled asthma weeks", but this outcome was not considered reliable because it was based on a past definition of asthma control and was systematically biased against the as-needed ICS–formoterol treatment group, in which patients were permitted much less ICS than those on maintenance ICS before a week was classified as not well controlled. In two studies that showed a greater overall reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations with as-needed ICS–formoterol compared with maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA, no predictors of differential response were identified among many baseline characteristics, including inflammatory phenotype, except for a clinically unimportant difference in the five-item Asthma Control Questionnaire in one study.

### It is time to change the way we manage mild asthma: an update in GINA 2019 [^1176gShs]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

For patients requiring Step 2 treatment, GINA 2019 has retained the previous recommendation for preferred controller treatment as daily low dose ICS with as-needed SABA. This is based on cumulative evidence demonstrating that regular low dose ICS use substantially reduces asthma symptoms, increases lung function, improves QoL and reduces risks of severe exacerbations, hospitalisations or death. The benefits of low dose ICS are evident even in mild asthma. Another preferred controller option in Step 2 in the 2019 GINA recommendations is the newly included, as-needed low dose ICS-formoterol (off-label) combination which reflects the clinical concern of non-adherence to regular low dose ICSs in people with milder forms of asthma (needing Step 1 and Step 2 treatment) and resultant exposure to SABA monotherapy with such non-adherence. GINA 2019 also added the new recommendation "low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken" (off-label, combination/separate inhalers) in Step 2 management (under other controller options).

### Overall asthma control achieved with budesonide / formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy for patients on different treatment steps [^113QSP45]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this analysis confirms that the BUD/FORM maintenance and reliever therapy approach is a highly effective option for patients requiring treatment adjustments across Steps 2 to 4 in the GINA treatment guidelines. The as-needed use of BUD/FORM for relief is obviously of greatest benefit to patients in each treatment step whose asthma control is not optimal, either because they are undertreated or because their asthma is more refractory (severe). The reduction in such patients' rates of asthma exacerbations, with attendant reduction in need for systemic corticosteroids, is a useful advantage and, although not examined in this analysis, might be associated with reductions in risk of adverse effects of treatment, particularly in the long term.

Methods

Clinical studies

Fourteen clinical studies (six Phase II and eight Phase III) were conducted (FF asthma global clinical development programme): 10 assessed FF only and four investigated FF/vilanterol with a FF arm (Table 1). In 12 studies, FF was administered using the ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler in the evening. The remaining studies used Rotadisk Diskhaler™ or Diskus™/Accuhaler™, in the morning or evening.

Across the 14 studies, inclusion criteria were as follows: patients ≥ 12 years of age; a clinical history of asthma (in accordance with the definition of National Institutes of Health); forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), 40–90% of the predicted normal value (50–90% in one study); bronchodilator reversibility of disease (≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL increase in FEV 1 within 10–40 min following two to four inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol); and documented use of albuterol/salbutamol and/or asthma symptoms on ≥ 4 of the last 7 consecutive days of a run-in period (or in one study, ≥ 3 of the last 7 consecutive days of the run-in period). As patients entering the Phase III studies were symptomatic on ICS or ICS/LABA therapy, their asthma severity may be considered equivalent to GINA steps 3–4.

### Efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate / vilanterol compared with fluticasone propionate / salmeterol combination in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma: a randomized trial [^115Zr1Xh]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study of patients aged ≥ 12 years with persistent asthma uncontrolled on a medium dose of ICS, FF/VI 100/25 μg once daily in the evening was not significantly different from FP/SAL 250/50 μg bid for the primary end point of 0- to 24-h serial wmFEV 1 at week 24 or for any of the secondary end points. The AE profiles for both treatments were similar, and those AEs reported with FP/SAL were consistent with those previously reported with this drug combination.

Patients were symptomatic on a medium dose of ICS at baseline. According to current asthma guidelines, these patients would require a step up in their asthma treatment from step 3 to 4. Lack of asthma control in the patient population at baseline was evident by an FEV 1 of approximately 68% of the predicted normal value for both groups and by the fact that ≥ 50% of patients had an Asthma Control Test score of < 20. The goal of asthma treatment is to control asthma symptoms. A number of studies have shown that nonadherence to asthma therapy is an important reason for loss of asthma control in some patients. ‐ Adherence to the treatment schedule was high during the study (> 94% in both groups), although the artificial setting of a clinical trial may have encouraged normally nonadherers to take their medication. If poor adherence to the dosing schedule is an important factor in loss of asthma control, then once-daily dosing (as opposed to bid dosing) such as that provided by FF/VI may represent a more-convenient treatment option for patients in a real-world setting.

### American college of allergy, asthma and immunology members' preferred steps 1 to 3 asthma maintenance and reliever therapy and incomplete insurance coverage indicated as main practice hurdle [^117FWzQV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

New asthma guidelines (GINA, 2022; NAEPP EPR-4, 2020) include considerable changes in treatment recommendations, specifically regarding anti-inflammatory rescue and Single MAintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART).

Objective

To explore American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology members' preferred treatment and perceived hurdles.

Methods

A survey (SurveyMonkey) regarding steps 1 to 3 asthma therapy was e-mailed to American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology members.

Results

The allergists completed 147 surveys (46% with > 20 years of experience; 98% from United States; 29% academic, 75% [also] private practice). In addition, 69% follow the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and 81% the Global Initiative for Asthma recommendations. Of 147 allergists, 117 (80%) indicated correctly what SMART strategy is; 21%/36%/50%/39% would use SMART in step 3 treatment of a below 5-year-old/5- to 11-year-old/12- to 65-year-old/above 65-year-old patient, respectively. In this group, 11% to 14% incorrectly chose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus salmeterol and 9% ICS plus vilanterol for SMART. In a 4-year-old needing step 1 therapy (N = 129), 55% of the respondents would add anti-inflammatory therapy; for step 2 treatment, most would prescribe ICS 100 to 200 µg budesonide equivalent daily; in step 3, 49% would prescribe ICS plus long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). In a 7-year-old needing step 1 treatment (N = 134), 40% would prescribe only short-acting beta-agonist; in step 3, 45% would institute SMART strategy, but only 8 of 135 (6%) chose very-low dose ICS plus formoterol (as recommended in Global Initiative for Asthma); most (39%) use low-dose ICS plus formoterol. As for rescue therapy, 59% is now instituting some form of anti-inflammatory rescue. Finally, in a 25-year-old patient (N = 144): in step 1, 39% would prescribe exclusively short-acting beta-agonist; in step 2, 4% only anti-inflammatory rescue and the rest prescribes ICS maintenance; one-third begins SMART strategy at step 2 and 50% in step 3. Major hurdles for prescribing one's preferred strategy included incomplete insurance coverage, insurance not approving more than one canister of ICS-formoterol per month, and cost.

Conclusion

Asthma therapy varies among physicians, with respondents suggesting underutilization of the recommended anti-inflammatory rescue and SMART therapy. A major hurdle is lack of insurance coverage of medication in line with the guidelines.

Descriptive findings of key trials

Since we are not able to pool the data and establish an evidence based ranking of effectiveness of drug treatments in GINA steps 3 and 4, we describe the main findings from the trials of the most frequently compared interventions (> 2 trials/comparison), including over 100 patients per intervention group and having a follow up of at least 8 weeks. Many different outcomes are reported. However, in the trial descriptions below we restrict our focus to the following clinically most relevant ones: number of exacerbations, level of control, reliever medication use, symptom score, frequency of night-time awakening, quality of life, FEV 1, hyperresponsiveness (PC 20 -FEV 1) and PEF. The only interventions compared more than two times were steps 3A versus 3B, that is, adding a LABA to a low dose of ICS or increasing the dose of ICS, and 3B versus 4A, that is, adding a LABA to medium or high dose ICS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1137uBGK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

GINA Track 1 anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy — using low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever with or without maintenance ICS-formoterol — applies AIR-only at Steps 1–2 and maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) at Steps 3–5, and reduces exacerbations versus SABA-based regimens. In Steps 1–2, low-dose ICS-formoterol is used as needed and "reduces the risk of severe exacerbations and ED visits/hospitalizations by 65% compared with SABA alone, and reduces ED visits/hospitalizations by 37%, compared with daily ICS plus as-needed SABA". In Steps 3–5 (MART), ICS-formoterol "reduces the risk of severe exacerbations by 32% compared with the same dose of ICS-LABA, by 23% compared with a higher dose of ICS-LABA, and by 17% compared with usual care", and "MART is also an option for children 6–11 years in Steps 3–4". Additional notes state this step-up/step-down flexibility "cannot be done with any other ICS-LABA" and that "ICS-formoterol can also be used before exercise and before allergen exposure".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112uzyAX]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Track 1 — the reliever is as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol: This is the preferred approach recommended by GINA for adults and adolescents because using low-dose ICS formoterol (an anti-inflammatory reliever; AIR) reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with regimens that use SABA as reliever, with similar symptom control, and the regimen is simpler with a single medication across treatment steps. With this approach, when a patient at any treatment step has asthma symptoms, they use low-dose ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler for symptom relief; in Steps 1–2, this provides their anti-inflammatory therapy, and in Steps 3–5 patients also take ICS formoterol as their daily maintenance treatment; together, this is called "maintenance-and-reliever therapy" (MART).

### Ethnic sensitivity assessment of fluticasone furoate / vilanterol in east Asian asthma patients from randomized double-blind multicentre phase IIb / III trials [^111ETA2J]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma represents a considerable disease burden worldwide. The prevalence of asthma in Japan is amongst the highest in Asia. Japanese and global asthma guidelines recommend the use of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) combination as step-up therapy for asthma patients uncontrolled using reliever medication and low-dose ICS alone. The inhaled ICS and LABA combination of fluticasone furoate (FF) and vilanterol (VI) is suitable for once-daily (OD) dosing having 24 h efficacy in asthma patients. FF/VI is delivered via the ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler (DPI; ELLIPTA® is a trademark of the GSK group of companies).

The Japanese and global asthma guidelines support the use of ICS/LABA combination inhalers; they reduce the number of inhalation procedures, increase patient adherence, and reduce the risk of the LABA being delivered alone. Additionally, OD therapy has been shown to improve treatment adherence in asthma patients and is associated with treatment success and decreased healthcare costs. OD FF/VI 100/25 μg and 200/25 μg are approved in Japan, the United States, and the European Union for the treatment of asthma.

Biologic Implications of Current Therapeutic Approaches

Standard Controller Therapies

Step-up therapy and current ERS–ATS guidelines all recommend high-dose ICSs, with additional controller agents (long-acting β-agonists [LABAs]), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), or leukotriene modifiers as central therapies for patients with severe asthma. Treatment with some combination of these, with high-dose ICSs, is often required before biologic therapies can be started. Yet, the evidence to suggest these combinations are more than modestly better than lower doses in patients with severe asthma is limited. The only step-up study of medium- to high-dose ICS, in combination with a LABA, showed only small improvements in control with step-up to higher-dose ICSs plus a LABA. With recent control standards and increasing severity, less than 50% achieved well-controlled status. Similarly, severe exacerbations were not significantly reduced with high-dose salmeterol–fluticasone versus fluticasone alone in patients who entered the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-mandated LABA safety study with poorly controlled asthma. Thus, even in controlled clinical-trial settings, efficacy is generally incremental. Another variation of ICS–LABA treatment is treatment with "maintenance and reliever therapy", in which the combination of single-inhaler formoterol and an ICS is used both as controller and as reliever. This reliever approach reduces asthma exacerbations, as compared with either formoterol or terbutaline alone, in patients with mild-to-moderate or, possibly, more severe asthma. Pooled analyses and meta-analyses also support the efficacy of this approach in patients with Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 4 asthma, with suggestions that severe exacerbations may be reduced by ∼30%. GINA recommends low-dose combination ICS–LABA treatment (specifically formoterol) as a reliever for asthma described by GINA steps 3–5. Because of the complexities of the U.S. medical system, this approach is often financially challenging. Finally, the specific efficacy of this approach in symptomatic patients already on high-dose ICSs with a LABA (ERS–ATS severe asthma definition) remains to be determined.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — interim advice on severity descriptors for clinical practice and education: The document states that GINA "continues to support the current definition of severe asthma as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS-LABA, or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA or biologic therapy to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled". It adds, "We suggest that in clinical practice, the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided if possible", and advises explaining that patients with infrequent or mild symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations if treated with SABA alone and that "this risk is reduced by half to two-thirds with low-dose ICS or with as-needed low-dose ICS formoterol". It further directs, "Ensure that you prescribe ICS-containing therapy to reduce the patient's risk of severe exacerbations", clarifies that "'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which treatment patients should receive", and notes that guidance about low-intensity treatment suitability is in "Step 1 and 2". For education, it states that "'apparently mild asthma' may be useful to highlight the discordance between symptoms and risk".

### Once-daily fluticasone furoate (FF) / vilanterol reduces risk of severe exacerbations in asthma versus FF alone [^113vLdxE]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The addition of a long-acting β 2 agonist (LABA) to an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is recommended for patients whose asthma is inadequately controlled on medium-dose ICS. This has been shown to improve both pulmonary function and asthma control and to reduce the risk of exacerbations, and is the most effective and preferred option for patients requiring a step-up in asthma controller therapy, at least in adolescents and adults. However, although almost all studies have confirmed that the addition of a LABA reduces asthma exacerbations, controversy has arisen around data from a large-scale safety studyand meta-analysessuggesting that more severe and life-threatening asthma events and even deaths may be increased in patients receiving LABAs. A possible explanation for this apparent increase in risk is the failure of patients being treated with LABA to receive concurrent ICS treatment. Indeed, this has been supported by meta-analyses comparing ICS/LABA administered as concurrent treatment (rather than from separate inhalers) with ICS alone. Nonetheless, this concern has resulted in reassessment of the benefits and costs of combined treatment with LABA and ICS, whether as mono-components or in combination inhalers, and for studies to examine more closely rare severe life-threatening asthma exacerbations. Thus, large prospective safety trials of currently marketed LABAs are underway internationally.

A new ICS/LABA combination currently being evaluated for use in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contains fluticasone furoate (FF) and vilanterol (VI). FF is a novel ICS structurally distinct from fluticasone propionate (FP), with an ester derived from 2-furoic acid at the C-17α position that replaces the simpler propionate ester, conferring both greater affinity for the GC receptor and longer retention in respiratory tissues than FP. Once-daily FF has been shown to be effective in phase IIb trials, and the FF dose used in this study was selected on the basis of data from these studies. VI is a once-daily inhaled LABA shown to produce prolonged bronchodilation for at least 24 h. Previous clinical studies of FF/VI delivered from a single inhaler, conducted in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and including higher dosages of FF than in the present study, have shown this combination to have an acceptable safety profile.

Conclusion

The new GINA strategy report and supporting resources provide a substantial array of new, practical, evidence-based materials that supplement current national asthma guidelines, or can be adapted for local use, in both high- and low-resource countries. In the 2014 revision and 2015 update, GINA has moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk in a practical, practice-centred format. The aim is to reduce the burden of asthma, both for patients who suffer from this disease and for health-care systems.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

The recommended dosage of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg (containing fluticasone furoate 100 mcg and vilanterol 25 mcg) is 1 actuation once daily by oral inhalation.

If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be used for immediate relief.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Maintenance Treatment of Asthma

Adult Patients Aged 18 Years and Older

The recommended dosage of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg (containing fluticasone furoate 100 mcg and vilanterol 25 mcg) is 1 actuation once daily by oral inhalation or Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg (containing fluticasone furoate 200 mcg and vilanterol 25 mcg) is 1 actuation once daily by oral inhalation.

When choosing the starting dosage strength of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA, consider the patients' disease severity, their previous asthma therapy, including the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dosage, as well as the patients' current control of asthma symptoms and risk of future exacerbation.
The median time to onset, defined as a 100-mL increase from baseline in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), was approximately 15 minutes after beginning treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.
For patients who do not respond adequately to Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg once daily, increasing the dose to Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg once daily may provide additional improvement in asthma control. For patients who do not respond adequately to Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg once daily, re-evaluate and consider other therapeutic regimens and additional therapeutic options.
The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg once daily.
If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be used for immediate relief.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^112bL39Z]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently at each step, the GINA algorithm aligns treatment recommendations based on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol reliever therapy with those of the traditional short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA) reliever therapy. This assumes that the efficacy of treatment incorporating ICS/formoterol reliever therapy at each step aligns more closely with the corresponding alternative treatment incorporating a SABA reliever at the same step, rather than at adjacent higher or lower steps, which is not the case. This is illustrated by the recent systematic review and network meta-analysis that reported that the relative risk of a severe exacerbation with low-dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy at GINA step 3 compared with low-dose ICS/long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) plus SABA therapy (GINA step 3), medium-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA (GINA step 4), and high-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA (GINA step 5) was 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.47–0.64), 0.71 (95% CI, 0.56–0.91), and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.51–1.21) respectively. Thus, low-dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy at GINA step 3 aligns most closely in terms of efficacy with high-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA therapy at GINA step 5 and then progressively aligns to a lesser extent with medium-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA therapy at GINA step 4 and then with low-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA therapy at GINA step 3. This ranking of efficacy is thus discordant with the current algorithm. This structural problem could be resolved by separating the instructions for the stepwise approach incorporating ICS/formoterol reliever therapy from those incorporating SABA reliever therapy by using two separate algorithms, as was undertaken in the New Zealand asthma guidelines in 2020. This avoids the problem of step misalignment and the potential inadvertent mixing of the two approaches. It is possible to simplify the algorithms further by not including other less effective "second-line" alternative treatments.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112PV2iD]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment tracks for adults and adolescents — Track 1, in which the reliever is low-dose ICS-formoterol, is the preferred approach recommended by GINA; when a patient at any step has asthma symptoms they use low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed for relief, and in Steps 3–5 they also take ICS-formoterol as regular daily treatment; this approach is preferred because it reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with using a SABA reliever, with similar symptom control, and because of the simplicity of needing only a single medication across treatment Steps 1–4; medications and doses for Track 1 include the maximum recommended total formoterol (with ICS) dose in any day for each formulation, and GINA suggests that the same maximum total daily dose should apply for beclometasone-formoterol. Track 2, in which the reliever is an ICS-SABA or SABA, is an alternative if Track 1 is not possible or if a patient is stable with good adherence and no exacerbations in the past year; in Step 1 the patient takes a SABA and a low-dose ICS together for symptom relief (in combination if available, or with the ICS taken immediately after the SABA), and in Steps 2–5 the reliever is a SABA or combination ICS-SABA; before considering a SABA reliever, consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their ICS-containing treatment, as otherwise they would be at higher risk of exacerbations.

After 25 years of GINA, we need an overarching strategy. The resounding changes in GINA 2019 should be accompanied by another major change in general strategy of asthma management. The concept of control asthma and step strategy was established in 1997 by GINA; but still there is a great gap between GINA objectives and outcomes. O'Byrne and colleagues proposed a continuum of care approach; where patient-adjusted therapy would comprise both a controller and reliever (usually ICS/fast-acting LABA) in a single inhaler. We use a similar approach in our asthma centre.

### An independent in-depth analysis proposing adjusted global initiative on asthma step 1–2 treatment suggestions [^111rLgEj]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) strategy included major changes for the treatment of mild asthma in the 2020 version that are even taken to the next level in 2021, leaving a preferred track with only rescue therapy with inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol (ICS-FORM) for steps 1–2 in 12+ years old. It has been questioned how solid the evidence behind these recommendations is. We decided to independently conduct an in-depth analysis of published evidence based on a comprehensive evaluation of original articles and related appendices and publications, including quality of evidence and risk of bias per article. We first defined the major asthma treatment goals and proceeded to review how these were met in publications referenced in the main asthma guidelines. For patients with GINA (2021) Step 1 characteristics, the analysis supports GINA's decision to avoid SABA monotherapy and to prefer ICS-FORM rescue with an alternative ICS rescue every time a SABA is used for ≥ 12 years, even though evidence is extrapolated from step 2 patients. For 6- to 11-year-olds, we propose to consider ICS-FORM rescue as an alternative, as its use has been approved in this age group, be it not as rescue medication. For patients with GINA 2021 Step 2 characteristics, our proposal slightly differs from GINA 2021. We propose to continue avoiding the separate use of SABA, using ICS rescue whenever a fast-acting bronchodilator is taken (even with ICS maintenance). Also, the superiority of ICS-FORM rescue over classical step 2 treatment is not uniform and year-long experience is lacking. Consequently, for now, both treatment options seem equal: ICS-FORM rescue or ICS maintenance with SABA (+ICS) rescue. For 6- to 11-year-olds, ICS rescue every time a SABA is used has the advantage of lower total ICS dose; as alternative we suggest ICS-FORM rescue. The best treatment option depends on patient characteristics and treatment goals. Recommendations should be reviewed as soon as new evidence becomes available.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^112Gt4rC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The antiinflammatory reliever–based algorithm using ICS/formoterol can be based on four steps, the first step being use of ICS/formoterol as the sole reliever therapy (Figure 2A), which is currently proposed at GINA steps 1 and 2 (Figure 1). Steps 2 and 3/4 are use of "standard"-dose (low-dose) and "higher"-dose (medium-dose) ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy, corresponding to the current GINA steps 3 and 4/5; the add-on therapies in severe asthma are introduced at step 4 (currently GINA step 5) (Figures 1 and 2A). The antiinflammatory reliever–based algorithm can be considered the preferred strategy, as it outperforms the traditional SABA reliever–based algorithm at each step in reducing the risk of severe exacerbations.

Figure 2.
The prototypic algorithms based on (A) antiinflammatory reliever therapy and (B) SABA reliever therapy. *Or standard-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken. AIR = antiinflammatory reliever therapy; ICS = inhaled corticosteroid; LABA = long-acting β 2 -agonist; SABA = short-acting β 2 -agonist.

The traditional SABA reliever–based algorithm can also comprise four steps (Figure 2B). With the recommendation that a SABA should no longer be used as the sole reliever therapy without an ICS, regularly scheduled maintenance ICS therapy together with SABA reliever therapy (currently one of the preferred treatment options at GINA step 2) is recommended for step 1. At steps 2 and 3/4, "standard"-dose (low-dose) and "higher"-dose (medium- or high-dose) maintenance ICS/LABA and SABA reliever therapies are recommended, corresponding to the current GINA steps 3 and 4/5: the add-on therapies in severe asthma are introduced at step 4 (previously GINA step 5). Although the option to prescribe either medium- or high-dose ICS/LABA therapy is provided, including them at the same step is based on the similar efficacy yet greater risk of adverse systemic effects with the high-dose ICS regimen and the known reluctance to step down from high doses of ICS/LABA therapy, which may contribute to the common prescription of inappropriately excessive doses of ICSs.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116RJgLJ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping down, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer the following options when stepping down treatment:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 5. High-dose ICS-LABA plus oral corticosteroids|- Add biologic therapy in cases of type 2-high severe asthma if eligible and reduce oral corticosteroids <br/> -; optimize inhaled therapy and reduce oral corticosteroid dose <br/> -; use sputum-guided approach to reducing oral corticosteroids <br/> -; switch to alternate-day dosing for low-dose oral corticosteroids|
|Step 5. Biologic therapy plus high-dose ICS-LABA|- Discontinue other add-on medications, especially oral corticosteroids, then consider reducing inhale corticosteroid-long-acting β-agonis dose|
|Step 4. Moderate-to-high-dose ICS-LABA maintenance treatment|- Continue combination ICS-LABA with 50% reduction in ICS component by using available formulations <br/> -; recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration <br/> -; switch to maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol, with lower maintenance dose|
|Step 4. Medium-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever|- Reduce maintenance ICS-formoterol to low dose, and continue as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever|
|Step 4. High-dose ICS plus second controller|- Reduce ICS dose by 50% and continue second controller|
|Step 3. Low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance|- Reduce ICS-LABA to once daily <br/> -; recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration|
|Step 3. Low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever|- Reduce maintenance ICS-formoterol dose to once daily and continue as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever <br/> -; consider stepping down to as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol|
|Step 3. Medium or high-dose ICS|- Reduce ICS dose by 50% <br/> -; consider adding leukotriene receptor antagonists to allow ICS dose to be stepped down|
|Step 2. Low-dose maintenance ICS|- Switch to once-daily dosing - budesonide, ciclesonide, mometasone, fluticasone furoate <br/> -; switch to as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol <br/> -; switch to taking ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken <br/> -; do not discontinue ICS completely because the risk of exacerbations is increased with short-acting β-agonist-only treatment|

Materials and methods

Study patients

This retrospective study was conducted at the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan, from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2023. The inclusion criteria were patients: (1) aged 20 years or older; (2) diagnosed with asthma based on clinical symptoms and spirometry characteristics, including diurnal peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability of over 20%, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) improvement of over 12% and 200 mL after 400 μg inhaled salbutamol, clinical symptoms (e.g. difficulty breathing, cough, sputum production, wheezing), and lifetime asthma risk; (3) with data on FeNO, serum eosinophil count; (4) who received combination therapy with an ICS + LABA (e.g. BUD/FOR or FF/VIL) as MART; and (5) classified as steps 3 and 4 according to the GINA guidelines.

The exclusion criteria were patients: (1) diagnosed with cancer; (2) who had previously received biological agents such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, or dupilumab; (3) treated with triple therapy (ICS + LABA + LAMA); (4) who had used short-acting bronchodilators as rescue inhalers in the past 6 months, including monotherapy such as SABAs or combination therapy: SABA + short-acting muscarinic antagonist; and (5) with insufficient available data for further analysis or those lost to follow-up. The enrolled patients were divided into two groups. One group received BUD/FOR as MART, while the other received FF/VIL as MART for asthma control. Patients being treated with FF/VIL as MART were administered either FF/VIL 92/22 μg or FF/VIL 184/22 μg as 1 puff once daily (QD), with the option to take more puffs when they experienced discomfort. All patients participated in healthcare case management to enhance their health outcomes and healthcare quality. The study received approval from the China Medical University Hospital Institutional Review Board (CMUH112-REC1–175). The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the observational and retrospective nature of the study design.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113GFQbA]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Other Step 4 treatment options for adults and adolescents — Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) may be considered as add-on therapy in a separate inhaler for patients aged ≥ 6 years (tiotropium), or in a combination triple inhaler for patients aged ≥ 18 years if asthma is persistently uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta2 agonist (ICS-LABA). Adding a LAMA to medium or high-dose ICS-LABA modestly improved lung function but with no difference in symptoms; in some studies it modestly reduced exacerbations, and meta-analyses reported a 17% reduction in risk of severe exacerbations with addition of LAMA to medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA, mainly in those with a history of exacerbations in the previous year. For patients with exacerbations despite low-dose ICS-LABA, the ICS dose should be increased to at least medium, or switched to maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol, before considering adding a LAMA. One study found the severe exacerbation rate was lower with high-dose fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (ICS-LABA) than with low- to medium-dose fluticasone furoate-vilanterol-umeclidinium (ICS-LABA-LAMA), and for patients prescribed an ICS-LABA-LAMA with a non-formoterol LABA, the appropriate reliever is SABA or ICS-SABA. In Step 4, there is insufficient evidence to support ICS-LAMA over low- or medium-dose ICS-LABA combination; in one analysis, response to adding LAMA to medium-dose ICS was not modified by baseline demographics, body-mass index, FEV1, FEV1 responsiveness, or smoking status. Consider adding sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) for adult patients with sensitization to house dust mite with suboptimally controlled asthma despite low- to high-dose ICS, but only if FEV1 is > 70% predicted.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^114kGgpg]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Compared with as-needed SABA, as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol for symptom relief reduces the risk of severe asthma flare-ups (severe exacerbations) across all levels of asthma severity — either as-needed only in mild asthma or in addition to maintenance ICS–formoterol

GINA's current recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of asthma in adults and adolescents are shown in two 'tracks' (Figs. 4–5). There is strong evidence favoring the Track 1 option, in which low-dose ICS–formoterol is the reliever across all treatment steps, compared with Track 2, in which SABA is the reliever.

This recommendation is based on multiple studies demonstrating that combination low-dose ICS and formoterol, taken as-needed for relief of asthma symptoms (either as-needed only in mild asthma, or in addition to maintenance ICS–formoterol), is a more effective and safer reliever than as-needed SABA.

In patients with mild asthma, as-needed ICS–formoterol reduces the risk of severe flare-ups by 60–64% compared with as-needed SABA. Compared with low-dose maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA, the risk of severe exacerbations is similar –. In a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis (n = 9565), patients with mild asthma treated with as-needed ICS–formoterol had a 55% reduction in severe exacerbations and 65% lower emergency department visits or hospitalizations compared with SABA alone. In addition, those treated with as-needed ICS–formoterol had 37% lower risk of emergency department visits or hospitalizations than with daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. In some of these studies, there were small differences in lung function (FEV 1) and symptom control assessed by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) score that favored daily maintenance ICS over as-needed-only low-dose ICS–formoterol. These differences were not clinically important, and may reflect that adherence with maintenance ICS was much higher than is usually achievable in clinical practice. The average daily dose of ICS was much lower with as-needed ICS–formoterol compared with daily ICS plus as-needed SABA.

### Comparison of budesonide / formoterol versus fluticasone furoate / vilanterol as maintenance and reliever therapy for asthma control: a real-world observational study [^111LUagk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

According to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, there are two treatment options for asthma patients based on different relievers. In Track 1, the reliever is an as-needed low-dose ICS plus formoterol, while in Track 2, the reliever is an as-needed short-acting B2 agonist (SABA). Previous studies have reported that Track 1 is the preferred approach for adults. However, most of these studies were traditional randomized controlled trials with close monitoring of compliance and inhalation techniques. Consequently, they may not fully represent real-world clinical settings where medication adherence is lower and technique errors are common, impacting treatment effectiveness.

A recently approved asthma treatment combines fluticasone furoate (FF) and vilanterol (VIL) in a new ICS/LABA combination. FF demonstrates superior affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and longer retention in respiratory tissues compared to other glucocorticoids such as fluticasone propionate (FP) and BUD. VIL exhibits superior affinity and selectivity for the β2-adrenoceptor than FOR, providing faster onset and longer duration of action than salmeterol (SM) in human airways. It also delivers effective 24-h bronchodilation in asthma patients receiving ICS treatment. In the UK's Sanford Lung Study, asthma patients on FF/VIL (once daily) were twice as likely to achieve or improve asthma control compared to those on usual care (other ICS/LABA twice daily). In a real-world study, patients using once-daily ICSs had higher adherence (61%) than those using ICSs ≥ 2 times daily (41%), with better adherence correlating to fewer exacerbations. Based on these data, FF/VIL shows promise in providing stronger anti-inflammatory and faster bronchodilation effects with longer duration than current ICS/LABA treatments.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1127cufW]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to stepwise management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to use the following track as the alternative stepwise approach to the management of asthma in adult and adolescent patients, with as-needed inhaled-corticosteroid-short-acting β-agonist or as-needed short-acting β-agonist as the reliever in all steps:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 1. Symptoms ≤ 1–2 days per week|- Offer low-dose inhaled-corticosteroid whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken, in combination or separate inhalers|
|Step 2. Symptoms 3–5 days per week, with normal or mildly reduced lung function|- Offer low-dose maintenance daily ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist|
|Step 3. Symptoms on most days of the week, or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week, or low lung function|- Offer low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - or plus as-needed ICS-short-acting β-agonist, <br/> -, OR medium-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - or plus as-needed ICS-short-acting β-agonist|
|Step 4. Daily symptoms or waking at night due to asthma ≥ 1 per week, and with low lung function or recent exacerbation|- Offer medium-dose ICS-LABA <br/> - plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist or plus as-needed ICS-short-acting β-agonist, OR high-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist as another option <br/> - but adherence is worse than with combination ICS-LABA|
|Step 5.|- Offer add-on LAMAs <br/> - Refer for phenotypic assessment <br/> - Consider offering high-dose maintenance ICS-LABA <br/> -; consider offering anti-IgE, anti-IL-5/5R, anti-interleukin 4-receptor, anti-thymic lymphopoietin|
|Initial presentation with exacerbation|- Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of oral corticosteroids if severe <br/> - Offer medium-dose ICS-long-acting β-agonis plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist|

### Step-down from high dose fixed combination therapy in asthma patients: a randomized controlled trial [^117QSxUj]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

International guidelines recommend a stepwise approach for managing asthma in adults and children over 5 years of age. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines indicate that "asthma control" is the objective of treatment, i.e. achieving and maintaining the control of symptoms and normal activity levels, maintaining pulmonary function as close to normal as possible, preventing asthma exacerbations and asthma mortality and avoiding adverse effects from asthma medications. Maintenance treatment should be stepped up or stepped down to the minimum amount of medication necessary to maintain asthma control and minimise the potential for long-term side effects.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent the cornerstone of maintenance treatment. If asthma control is inadequate with low-dose ICS, the addition of a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) provides enhanced clinical benefits compared to increasing the ICS dosage. ICS and LABAs have complementary clinical and pharmacological activities when administered together.

Although asthma guidelines advocate reducing treatment once asthma is well controlled, clinicians appear to be reluctant to reduce treatment. Both treatment prescription surveys and clinical trials indicate that a large proportion of asthmatic patients are over-treated and seldom stepped-down in clinical practice.

Relatively few studies have evaluated the best strategy for dose reduction. Some studies have documented a better maintenance of asthma control when the patients who are treated with ICS/LABA combination treatments were stepped down to a lower dose of the ICS/LABA combination, as opposed to suspending the LABA while maintaining the ICS at the same dose. This step-down strategy has the advantage of maintaining asthma control and lowering the dose of ICS. Conversely, 2 studies have shown that stepping-down from a low dose of ICS or the ICS/LABA combination to montelukast leads to a deterioration of asthma control. To date, no studies have assessed a treatment step-down to different drug combinations that are delivered by different inhaler devices (dry powder and pressurised metered dose inhalers).

GINA Treatment Tracks for Adults and Adolescents

There are five levels of treatment (Steps 1–5; Figure 3), with two "tracks", depending on the choice of reliever: ICS–formoterol (Track 1, preferred) or SABA (Track 2, alternative). Treatment may be stepped up or down within a track by using the same reliever at each step or may be switched between tracks.

Figure 3.
Personalized management for adults and adolescents to control symptoms and minimize risk. For ICS doses, see Box 3–6 in Reference. Reproduced by permission from Reference(Box 3–5A). HDM = house dust mite; ICS = inhaled corticosteroid; LABA = long-acting β 2 -agonist; LAMA = long-acting muscarinic antagonist; LTRA = leukotriene receptor antagonist; OCS = oral corticosteroid; SABA = short-acting β 2 -agonist; SLIT = sublingual immunotherapy.

Within Track 1, the reliever is as-needed, low-dose ICS–formoterol. This means that when a patient at any treatment step has asthma symptoms, they take low-dose ICS–formoterol for symptom relief. In Steps 1–2, this also provides the patient's controller therapy and reduces severe exacerbation risk, without daily maintenance treatment. This is distinguished from maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) in Steps 3–5, where patients take ICS–formoterol both as daily maintenance treatment and, as needed, for symptom relief (Table 1).

Table 1.
Differences between Current Asthma Treatment Regimens Containing an AIR

Track 2, with SABA reliever, is suggested where ICS–formoterol is not available or is not preferred by a patient at low risk of exacerbations (including having no exacerbations in the past year). Before prescribing therapy with SABA reliever, consider if the patient is likely to be poorly adherent with ICS controller therapy, as this increases the risk of exacerbations.

In Figure 3, additional or alternative treatments with less evidence for safety, efficacy, and/or effectiveness are shown as "other controller options".

GINA Track 1 anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy — general notes and restrictions specify that "Maximum total inhalations in any day = as-needed doses plus maintenance doses, if used". For beclometasone (BDP)-formoterol, it "has not been studied for as-needed-only use (Steps 1–2), but it may be suitable given its efficacy for MART in moderate-severe asthma", and "GINA suggests that the maximum total dose of BDP-formoterol in any day should be 12 inhalations". Additionally, "Budesonide–formoterol 400/12 [320/4.5] mcg should not be used as an anti-inflammatory reliever", and "For adults/adolescents, GINA does not suggest use of budesonide-formoterol 100/6 [80/4.5] as an anti-inflammatory reliever, since most evidence is with budesonide–formoterol 200/6 [160/4.5] mcg".

### A call to action for improving clinical outcomes in patients with asthma [^116ZKEsW]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based revised treatment recommendations now place ICS at the forefront of asthma treatment and no longer recommend SABA monotherapy. The 2019 and, more recently, the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy recommends ICS–formoterol — a combination of a low-dose ICS and a LABA with a fast onset of action — as the preferred as-needed reliever for adults and adolescents belonging to GINA treatment steps 1 and 2, and in steps 3–5, for patients prescribed ICS–formoterol maintenance therapy. As-needed budesonide-formoterol is currently approved for mild asthma in Canada, Brazil, Russia, Australia and New Zealand based on data from two Phase III RCTs, and is further substantiated by open-label pragmatic clinical trials, as an effective and safe means of reducing severe exacerbations in comparison with as-needed SABA or maintenance budesonide plus as-needed SABA. Even in paediatric patients, the use of ICS is emphasised, with GINA recommending low-dose ICS whenever SABA is taken.

These changes represent a fundamental shift in recommended asthma treatment, making safety and the prevention of asthma exacerbations important goals, even in patients with mild asthma. However, to enable tangible improvements in asthma outcomes, changes in treatment recommendations need to be integrated into routine clinical practice in primary care where most asthma patients are managed.

Despite all the progress made, in some countries, access to even basic asthma treatment such as ICS is out of reach for most patients. Although efforts have been made in recent years to improve respiratory outcomes through international agency policies on chronic/non-communicable diseases, more needs to be done, especially to improve access to asthma controller treatment in developing countries.

### Evaluation of budesonide-formoterol for maintenance and reliever therapy among patients with poorly controlled asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11684tiN]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends 2 alternative treatments for patients receiving treatment at steps 3 to 5: single inhaler combination inhaled corticosteroid-formoterol as both maintenance and reliever (SMART) or inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting β2-agonist as maintenance plus short-acting β2-agonist as reliever.

Objective

To assess whether switching to SMART is associated with longer time to first severe asthma exacerbation compared with a step up or continuation of GINA treatment step with maintenance inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting β2-agonist plus short-acting β2-agonist reliever among patients with poorly controlled asthma.

Data Sources

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the literature, internal study databases at AstraZeneca and the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand, and references from a previous systematic review and meta-analysis on SMART were searched to identify randomized clinical trials published from January 1990 to February 2018, that compared budesonide-formoterol by SMART with maintenance inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting β2-agonist plus short-acting β2-agonist reliever.

Study Selection

Trials of at least 24 weeks' duration were included if they reported baseline data on GINA treatment step, asthma control status, and efficacy measures of severe exacerbations. Included patients were adults and adolescents with asthma and baseline Asthma Control Questionnaire 5-item version scores of 1.5 or higher.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Patient-level data were identified by independent extraction, and analyses were performed using a fixed-effect model. Data analysis was performed from August 2018 to November 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to first severe asthma exacerbation associated with each treatment, analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

Overall, 4863 patients were included (3034 [62.4%] female; mean [SD] age, 39.8 [16.3] years). Switching patients with uncontrolled asthma at GINA step 3 (n = 1950) to SMART at either step 3 or 4 was associated with a prolonged time to first severe asthma exacerbation, with a 29% reduced risk compared with stepping up to step 4 inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting β2-agonist maintenance plus short-acting β2-agonist reliever (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52–0.97). For patients with uncontrolled asthma at step 3 and step 4 (n = 2913), switching to SMART was associated with a prolonged time to first severe asthma exacerbation and a 30% reduced risk compared with remaining at the same treatment step (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58–0.85).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, for patients with poorly controlled asthma, SMART was associated with longer time to first severe asthma exacerbation compared with a step up or continuation of GINA step with maintenance inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting β2-agonist plus short-acting β2-agonist reliever. These findings suggest that if an adult or adolescent receiving treatment at GINA step 3 or 4 has poorly controlled asthma, it is preferable to switch to the SMART regimen rather than to step up or continue the GINA treatment step with maintenance inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting β2-agonist plus short-acting β2-agonist reliever therapy.

It has been evaluated as add-on to at least ICS therapy in > 6000 patients aged 6–75 years with symptomatic asthma, and aged 1–5 years with persistent asthmatic symptoms, in the comprehensive Phase II and III UniTinA-asthma® clinical trial programme. Within the individual trials, it has been shown to be an efficacious and well-tolerated add-on treatment to ICS therapy with or without additional controllers –.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117DBZLs]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Track 1 (preferred) treatment steps 1–4 for adults and adolescents using ICS-formoterol reliever is the preferred approach recommended by GINA for adults and adolescents with asthma because using low-dose ICS formoterol (an anti-inflammatory reliever; AIR) reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with regimens that use SABA as reliever, with similar symptom control and lung function. With the AIR approach, when a patient at any treatment step has asthma symptoms, they use low-dose ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler for symptom relief. The box details steps as follows: Steps 1–2 "As-needed-only low dose ICS-formoterol reliever", Step 3 "Low dose maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) with ICS formoterol", Step 4 "Medium dose maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) using low-dose ICS-formoterol", and Step 5 "Refer for expert assessment, phenotyping, and add-on treatment for severe asthma". Using ICS-formoterol as an anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR), with or without maintenance ICS-formoterol, reduces the risk of exacerbations compared with using a SABA reliever, and is a simpler regimen, with a single medication across treatment steps.

4. A practical algorithm for distinguishing between uncontrolled asthma and severe asthma in primary care

As above, asthma control relates both to symptom control and risk factors for future adverse outcomes such as exacerbations, and it can be quickly assessed at any time; whereas asthma severity (based on the level of treatment required to achieve good control) is a label that can only be applied retrospectively after the patient has been on treatment for at least several months. Of patients with poor symptom control and/or exacerbations despite treatment, few actually have severe refractory (i.e. treatment-resistant) asthma; the latter are estimated to comprise 5–10% of the asthma population. The GINA report provides a practical algorithm that, for primary care, prioritises the investigations for the most common remediable causes of uncontrolled asthma. It starts first with checking inhaler technique, as this is incorrect in up to 70–80% of patientsand can be corrected with appropriate skills training. Confirming the diagnosis of asthma is important, as up to 25–35% of people with asthma may have been misdiagnosed; however, if symptoms and lung function improve substantially when inhaler technique or adherence are corrected, this may effectively confirm the diagnosis of asthma, avoiding the need for additional investigations. Patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled despite appropriate management should be referred promptly for specialist investigation and advice.

5. Control-based management

In the past, this concept was sometimes interpreted as prompting an automatic step-up in controller treatment if symptoms were not well controlled. Key changes for primary care in the GINA report emphasise that control-based management should include three components:

'Assess': document the patient's symptom control and risk factors, and if these are uncontrolled, also check inhaler technique and adherence, and consider whether the symptoms are due to a co-morbid condition such as allergic rhinitis, obesity or reflux rather than asthma
'Adjust treatment' (up or down): not only drug therapy but also non-pharmacological strategies (e.g. physical activity) and treatment of modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking cessation, providing a written asthma action plan, weight reduction). Tables with evidence levels are provided in the report
'Review response': every treatment change should be followed by a scheduled asthma review, e.g. after 2–3 months, carried out by someone with appropriate expertise, to assess and optimise control and ensure that ineffective or poorly-tolerated treatments are reviewed.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112uwgAT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β 2 -agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

### Evaluation of budesonide-formoterol for maintenance and reliever therapy among patients with poorly controlled asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114g1msH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Patients randomly assigned to the SMART regimen in the step-up comparison were receiving GINA step 3 treatment at enrollment and could either stay at the same GINA step (GINA step 3) or step up as in the control arm (GINA step 4). Patients randomly assigned to the SMART regimen in the same-step comparison were either receiving GINA step 3, or step 4, treatment at enrollment and received the same GINA step after randomization (GINA step 3, or 4,) or a lower GINA step treatment (GINA step 4 down to 3).

Patients were included in this analysis if their ACQ-5 score was 1.5 or higher at baseline, representing poorly controlled asthma. To reflect clinical practice, patients who were randomly assigned to a lower maintenance treatment than treatment at enrollment in the comparator ICS-LABA maintenance therapy plus SABA arm were excluded from the analyses.

End Points

Time to first severe asthma exacerbation was the primary outcome variable. A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as deterioration in asthma leading to treatment with an oral glucocorticoid for at least 3 days and/or hospitalization or an emergency department visit (or equivalent) in accordance with the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria. Secondary end points included number of severe exacerbations, ACQ-5 score, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) measured at baseline and clinical visits at months 1 and 6. Because of trial design differences, for the COMPASS trial, the 2-month follow-up was used as 1-month data, and for the SMILE trial, the 4-month follow-up was used as 6-month results. The number of symptom-free days (defined as a day with no morning and no evening symptoms and no nighttime awakening) was analyzed in the studies in which a daily symptom diary was included.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^115U7uNL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

One of the main uncertainties with both algorithms is the paucity of evidence on which to base the thresholds for changing treatment steps, a limitation that is shared with the current GINA algorithm. Current evidence suggests that the presence of biomarkers of type 2 airway inflammation is the most effective way to identify patients likely to respond to higher-intensity ICS treatment. In their absence, a reasonable approach is to base changes in treatment on two key factors, namely whether there has been a recent severe exacerbation and the frequency of reliever use. A severe exacerbation could prompt medical review for consideration of an increase in the treatment step, as such an event is associated with an increased risk of future severe exacerbations. Transition points based on high SABA use could be used for the traditional SABA reliever–based algorithm, as increasing use is a marker of poor asthma control and exacerbation risk. However, there is a different relationship with increasing ICS/formoterol use, in which higher use reduces the level of risk of an exacerbation, compared with SABA use. This could be addressed by guiding the patient to assign the higher reliever use to a higher regularly scheduled maintenance dose for the period of increased use. For both algorithms, "treatable traits" would be identified and managed in their own right.

In conclusion, the scientific evidence that ICS/formoterol reliever therapy is more effective at reducing severe exacerbation risk than SABA reliever therapy, either alone or when received together with maintenance ICS/formoterol therapy, has led to a paradigm shift in asthma management, which has the potential to cause confusion, as it replaces the long-established clinical practice that all patients should receive SABA reliever therapy. The potential confusion is evident from the current stepwise treatment algorithm's complexity, due to the attempt to represent all treatment options, and the inclusion of two reliever therapy regimens with differing efficacy in a single figure (Figure 1). These structural problems can be addressed by separating the current algorithm into two separate algorithms based on antiinflammatory ICS/formoterol and SABA reliever therapy strategies. The priority now is to investigate the practical implementation of the algorithms to better inform their use in clinical practice.

Source: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Institutes of Health; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

For many years, the lowest treatment step, recommended in most guidelines for intermittent or mild asthma, has been a short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA) reliever, which relieves bronchoconstriction rapidly and effectively but does not reduce the underlying inflammation usually present even in mild asthma. The recommendation for SABA alone as initial treatment for mild asthma dates back to the era when asthma was thought to be a disease only of bronchoconstriction. Also, the development of SABA predated the development of ICS by many years, so SABA use became ingrained in the management of asthma. Over-reliance on β 2 -agonist bronchodilators may even worsen inflammation and increase the risk of exacerbations and hospital admissions. The 2019 update to the GINA guideline now recommends replacing SABA with low-dose ICS/formoterol as preferred reliever, for safety reasons, both for mild asthma and also at higher GINA steps, in patients already on ICS/formoterol maintenance therapy(Fig. 3).

Anti-inflammatory therapy with ICS is recommended as maintenance therapy, initially at a low dose but at higher doses for more severe asthma. However, in patients on ICS, add-on of a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) has been shown to be more effective than increasing the ICS dose in improving asthma control and preventing exacerbations. As a result, an ICS/LABA combination inhaler is now the first choice of maintenance therapy for the majority of patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.

Conclusion

Due to extreme variation in choice of outcome measures and their reporting, firm evidence-based ranking of effectiveness of the treatment options in GINA 3&4 for 5 to 18 year-olds based on evidence from randomized trials is currently impossible. Implementation of the recommendations issued by the recent ATS/ERS taskforce on measures of asthma control in RCTs is urgent.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113doBTf]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to include the following short-term self-management strategies for 1–4 weeks for worsening asthma in the written asthma action plans for patients on Track 2 with combination ICS-short-acting β-blocker reliever:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 1, as-needed-only combination ICS-short-acting β-blocker as usual treatment|- Take 2 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker as needed for symptom relief, with a maximum 12 inhalations in any 24-hour period|
|Step 2, maintenance ICS as usual treatment|- Continue usual maintenance ICS dose <br/> - Take 2 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker as needed for symptom relief, with a maximum 12 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker in any 24-hour period|
|Steps 3–4, maintenance ICS-long-acting β-blocker as usual treatment|- Continue usual maintenance ICS-long-acting β-blocker dose <br/> - Take 2 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker as needed for symptom relief, with a maximum 12 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker in any 24-hour period|

### Overall asthma control achieved with budesonide / formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy for patients on different treatment steps [^113tvgR9]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

For patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on Step 2 or higher treatment, a recent strategy included in GINA guidelines is the use of a combination inhaler containing budesonide and formoterol for both maintenance therapy and relief of symptoms (option for Steps 3–5). This approach has been shown in several large-scale randomised controlled trials to achieve similar current clinical control of asthma and to be superior to comparators in reducing asthma exacerbations. These results have been achieved with the use of significantly lower doses of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids. The comparators in these studies have been either a two- to four-fold higher dose of budesonide (a Step 2–3 option), the same dose of ICS plus a LABA (a Step 3 option) or a higher-dose ICS plus a LABA (a Step 4 treatment), together with a short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA) for as-needed relief of symptoms. Recent post hoc analyses of the results of these studies have provided further insights into the relationship between levels of current asthma control achieved and "future risk". From the clinician's perspective, the decision to consider a change in medication will usually be prompted by a patient's failure to achieve control on current treatment (Steps 2–4). It is therefore appropriate to examine the relative benefit of introducing budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FORM) maintenance and reliever therapy in patients previously prescribed different GINA steps of treatment. We report here a post hoc analysis of the results of five clinical trials comparing BUD/FORM maintenance and reliever therapy with comparator treatments when introduced in patients on different treatment steps (Steps 2–4) according to GINA guidelines at study entry.

### Metabolomic changes related to airway inflammation, asthma pathogenesis and systemic activity following inhaled fluticasone furoate / vilanterol: a randomized controlled trial [^112CZmLR]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic, non-communicable respiratory disease, characterized by airway inflammation, variable symptoms and expiratory airflow limitation. It is associated with multiple clinical phenotypes and inflammatory endotypes, driven by heterogenous inflammatory mechanisms. The Global Initiative for Asthma recommends that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment, with additional therapies including long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABA) added on in a "step-up"/"step-down" approach to achieve good control of symptoms and exacerbations, whilst attempting to find the patient's minimum effective level of treatment.

Fluticasone furoate (FF) is an enhanced-affinity ICS with potent anti-inflammatory action and greater lung retention than other ICS therapies. Vilanterol trifenatate (VI) is a selective LABA which induces rapid and prolonged bronchodilation over a 24 h period. FF/VI 100 µg/25 µg is an ICS/LABA combination therapy licensed for the once-daily treatment of adults and adolescents with asthma aged ≥ 12 years, and in adults with moderate-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who experience persistent exacerbations despite ongoing maintenance therapy. FF/VI has demonstrated a prolonged duration of bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory action in previous clinical trials of adults with asthma. Braithwaite et al. found that bronchodilation was maintained for 72 h following a single dose of FF/VI, with clinically significant bronchodilation persisting for ≥ 48 h post dose. Furthermore, Bardsley et al. reported that the onset of anti-inflammatory action, as measured by a reduction in fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, occurred at 72 h post dose, with a maximum reduction 14 days post dose (Fig. 1). Anti-inflammatory effects were also maintained for 18 days following cessation of treatment.

### Be SMART about asthma management: single maintenance and reliever therapy [^116Lsz88]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) is an asthma treatment approach that utilizes combined inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists for maintenance and quick relief therapy. Despite the evidence for its benefits in asthma treatment and its adoption into American and international asthma guidelines and recommendations, SMART remains a practice of some debate. This article reviews the available evidence for SMART and offers guidance for its integration into comprehensive asthma management. Overall, short-acting β-agonist-only asthma therapy regimens should be avoided, regardless of condition severity (SOR A Recommendation). Family medicine clinicians should start SMART for patients requiring either GINA Step 3 or 4 therapy, especially if they have signs of poor adherence (SOR B Recommendation). Finally, use budesonide-formoterol over other inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β-agonist combinations when implementing SMART (SOR B Recommendation).

### Evaluation of budesonide-formoterol for maintenance and reliever therapy among patients with poorly controlled asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147ZuL7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–long acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) therapy is the mainstay pharmacological treatment of moderate and severe asthma in adolescents and adults. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)recommends 2 ICS-LABA treatment regimens for patients at treatment steps 3, 4, and 5: single inhaler combination ICS–formoterol as both maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) or ICS-LABA as maintenance therapy plus short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA) as reliever (ICS-LABA maintenance plus SABA). As-needed ICS-formoterol is the preferred reliever at all GINA steps except when the ICS-LABA maintenance combination does not include formoterol as the LABA component.

Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), have provided level I evidence that in adolescents and adults with asthma, the SMART regimen is associated with a lower risk of severe asthma exacerbations compared with ICS-LABA maintenance plus SABA. In a meta-analysis, SMART was associated with a 32% reduced exacerbation risk compared with the same dose of ICS-LABA maintenance therapy but with SABA as reliever and with a 23% reduced exacerbation risk compared with a higher-dose ICS-LABA maintenance plus SABA. Although there was no significant heterogeneity in treatment effects across the studies included in these meta-analyses, there were differences in terms of whether the randomized comparator treatments represented an escalation, continuation, or reduction in the level of treatment received compared with the patients' prescribed treatment before study start. There were also differences in patients' asthma control levels between and within studies, and thus, whether a change of treatment was clinically indicated is not clear. Furthermore, the inclusion of step down in maintenance treatment for patients with poor asthma control, which is not in line with asthma guidelines (eg, GINA), may have biased the overall results. An important clinical question is whether, in patients with poorly controlled asthma, a change in treatment to SMART is more effective than stepping up to a higher ICS dose with ICS-LABA maintenance plus SABA reliever. The aim of this study was to assess whether, in patients with poorly controlled asthma at study start, the SMART regimen was associated with a longer time to first severe exacerbation compared with a step up or continuation in GINA step maintenance treatment with a SABA reliever.

### Once-daily fluticasone furoate (FF) / vilanterol reduces risk of severe exacerbations in asthma versus FF alone [^116rmMei]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting β2 agonist (LABA) is recommended for patients with asthma symptomatic on ICS alone. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the risk-benefit ratio of using LABA in asthma.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of the addition of a novel LABA, vilanterol (VI), to a once-daily ICS, fluticasone furoate (FF), on the risk of severe asthma exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled asthma.

Methods

This randomised double-blind comparative study of variable duration (≥ 24–78 weeks) was designed to finish after 330 events (each patient's first on-treatment severe asthma exacerbation). 2019 patients with asthma aged ≥ 12 years with ≥ 1 recorded exacerbation within 1 year were randomised and received FF/VI 100/25 μg or FF 100 μg, administered once daily in the evening. The primary endpoint was time to first severe exacerbation; secondary endpoints were rate of severe asthma exacerbations per patient per year and change in trough evening forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from baseline.

Results

Compared with FF, FF/VI delayed the time to first severe exacerbation (HR 0.795, 95% CI 0.642 to 0.985) and reduced the annualised rate of severe exacerbations (rate reduction 25%, 95% CI 5% to 40%). Significantly greater improvements in trough FEV1 (p < 0.001) were observed with FF/VI than with FF at weeks 12, 36, 52 and at endpoint. Both treatments were well tolerated with similar rates of treatment-related adverse events and on-treatment serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Once-daily FF/VI reduced the risk of severe asthma exacerbations and improved lung function compared with FF alone, with good tolerability and safety profile in adolescents and adults with asthma currently receiving ICS.

Nonpharmacological recommendations are also considered and contrasted, including for exhaled nitric oxide, environmental control, immunotherapy, and bronchial thermoplasty. Similarities and differences in these 2 documents are highlighted, and recommendations are made about harmonizing the approaches where possible.

### Vilanterol and fluticasone furoate for asthma [^112Lnxii]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vilanterol (VI) is a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) that binds to the beta 2 -adrenoceptor on the airway smooth muscle, producing bronchodilation. LABA therapy, which is well established in adults as part of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guidelines for the Management of Asthma, leads to improvement in symptoms and lung function and reduction in exacerbations. At present, the commonly used LABAs licensed for use in asthma management (formoterol and salmeterol) require twice-daily administration, whereas VI is a once-daily therapy. Fluticasone furoate (FF) is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and ICS therapy is recommended by the BTS asthma guidelines. ICSs, the mainstay of asthma treatment, lead to a reduction in both airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness. Regular use leads to improvement in symptoms and lung function. ICSs are currently recommended as 'preventer' therapy for patients who use a 'reliever' medication (e.g. short-acting beta 2 agonist (SABA), salbutamol) three or more times per week. Most of the commonly used ICS treatments are twice-daily medications, although two once-daily products are currently licensed (ciclesonide and mometasone). At the present time, only one once-daily ICS/LABA combination (FF/VI) is available, and several other combination inhalers are recommended for twice-daily administration.

Objectives

To compare effects of VI and FF in combination versus placebo, or versus other ICSs and/or LABAs, on acute exacerbations and on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults and children with chronic asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of trials, clinical trial registries, manufacturers' websites and reference lists of included studies up to June 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults and children with a diagnosis of asthma. Included studies compared VI and FF combined versus placebo, or versus other ICSs and/or LABAs. Our primary outcomes were health-related quality of life, severe asthma exacerbation, as defined by hospital admissions or treatment with a course of oral corticosteroids, and serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and analysed outcomes using a fixed-effect model. We used standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

We identified 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 6641 randomised participants, of whom 5638 completed the study. All studies lasted between two and 78 weeks and showed good methodological quality overall. We included 10 comparisons in this review, seven for which the dose of VI and FF was 100/25 mcg (VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs placebo; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs same dose of FF; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs same dose of VI; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs fluticasone propionate (FP) 500 mcg twice-daily; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) 250/50 mcg twice-daily; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs FP/SAL 250/25 mcg twice-daily; FF/VI 100/25 vs FP/SAL500/50) and three for which the dose of VI and FF was 200/25 mcg (VI/FF 200/25 mcg vs placebo; VI/FF 200/25 mcg vs FP 500 mcg; VI/FF 200/25 mcg vs same dose of FF). We found very few opportunities to combine results from the 14 included studies in meta-analyses. We tabulated the data for our pre-specified primary outcomes. In particular, we found insufficient information to assess whether once-daily VI/FF was better or worse than twice-daily FP/SAL in terms of efficacy or safety. Only one of the 14 studies looked at health-related quality of life when comparing VI and FF 100/25 mcg versus placebo and identified a significant advantage of VI/FF 100/25 mcg (mean difference (MD) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.46; 329 participants); we recognised this as moderate-quality evidence. Only two studies compared VI/FF 100/25 mcg versus placebo with respect to exacerbations; both studies reported no exacerbations in either treatment arm. Five studies (VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs placebo) sought information on serious adverse events; all five studies reported no serious adverse events in the VI/FF 100/25 mcg or placebo arms. We found no comparison relevant to our primary outcomes for VI/FF at a higher dose (200/25 mcg) versus placebo. The small number of studies contributing to each comparison precludes the opportunity to draw robust conclusions for clinical practice. These studies were not of sufficient duration to allow conclusions about long-term side effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Some evidence suggests clear advantages for VI/FF, in combination, compared with placebo, particularly for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and peak expiratory flow; however, the variety of questions addressed in the included studies did not allow review authors to draw firm conclusions. Information was insufficient for assessment of whether once-daily VI/FF was better or worse than twice-daily FP/SAL in terms of efficacy or safety. It is clear that more research is required to reduce the uncertainties that surround interpretation of these studies. It will be necessary for these findings to be replicated in other work before more robust conclusions are revealed. Only five of the 13 included studies provided data on health-related quality of life, and only six recorded asthma exacerbations. Only one study focused on paediatric patients, so no conclusions can be drawn for the paediatric population. More research is needed, particularly in the primary outcome areas selected for this review, so that we can draw firmer conclusions in the next update of this review.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^115S3rJq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Difficult-to-Treat and Severe Asthma in Adults and Adolescents

Detailed information is provided in the GINA 2021 pocket guide on difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, including an integrated decision tree for diagnosis and management across primary and specialist care. A brief summary is included below.

Assessment and Optimization of Therapy

Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA treatment or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite good adherence with optimized high-dose ICS–LABA therapy and management of contributory factors or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma.

Assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to identify and manage factors that commonly contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and/or exacerbations. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS–LABA, assess the clinical and inflammatory phenotype, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Refer for expert advice if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing Step 4 or 5 treatment (or earlier, if needed).

### It is time to change the way we manage mild asthma: an update in GINA 2019 [^1151TMbG]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous lung disease, usually characterised by chronic airway inflammation. Although evidence-based treatments are available in most countries, asthma control remains suboptimal, and asthma-related deaths continue to be an ongoing concern. Generally, it is believed that between 50 to 75% of patients with asthma can be considered as having mild asthma. Previous versions of Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) suggested that mild asthma in adults can be well managed with either reliever medications, for example, short-acting beta 2 agonists (SABA) alone or with the additional use of controllers such as regular low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Given the low frequency or non-bothersome nature of symptoms in mild asthma, patients' adherence towards their controller medications, especially to ICS is usually not satisfactory. Such patients often rely on SABA alone to relieve symptoms, which may contribute to SABA over-reliance. Overuse of relievers such as SABAs has been associated with poor asthma outcomes, such as exacerbations and even deaths. The new GINA 2019 asthma treatment recommendations represent significant shifts in asthma management at Steps 1 and 2 of the 5 treatment steps. The report acknowledges an emerging body of evidence suggesting the non-safety of SABAs overuse in the absence of concomitant controller medications, therefore does not support SABA-only therapy in mild asthma and has included new off-label recommendations such as symptom-driven (as-needed) low dose ICS-formoterol and "low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken". The GINA 2019 report highlights significant updates in mild asthma management and these recommendations represent a clear deviation from decades of clinical practice mandating the use of symptom-driven SABA treatment alone in those with mild asthma. While the new inclusions of strategies such as symptom-driven (as-needed) ICS-formoterol and "ICS taken whenever SABA is taken" are based on several key trials, data in this context are still only emergent data, with clear superiority of as needed ICS-formoterol combinations over maintenance ICS regimens yet to be established for valid endpoints. Nevertheless, current and emerging data position the clinical asthma realm at a watershed moment with imminent changes for the way we manage mild asthma likely in going forward.

### Evaluation of budesonide-formoterol for maintenance and reliever therapy among patients with poorly controlled asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112KVXRB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that in adults and adolescents with poorly controlled asthma receiving GINA step 3 treatment, budesonide-formoterol taken according to the SMART regimen at step 3 or 4 was associated with a reduced risk of severe exacerbation compared with ICS-LABA maintenance plus SABA reliever at step 4 (medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA). The magnitude of the difference between the regimens was substantive, with a 29% reduction in risk of severe exacerbations. These findings suggest that for patients with poorly controlled asthma, switching to budesonide-formoterol administered by the SMART regimen at the same or higher level of treatment may be preferable to increasing to a higher level of treatment with maintenance ICS-LABA and SABA as required. This evidence supports the 2021 GINA Report, which recommends ICS-formoterol as reliever therapy at all steps of the treatment algorithm across the spectrum of asthma severity with the exception of use of an ICS-LABA that does not include formoterol.

### Comparing LAMA with LABA and LTRA as add-on therapies in primary care asthma management [^1171f42C]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

When stepping up asthma therapy and considering add-on therapy, it is important to review the options available, to involve patients in decisions about their treatment and to keep a dialogue between patients and HCPs. An up-to-date individualised asthma action plan can help to keep a record of any attempted treatment approaches and help the patient to self-manage. The action plans should be discussed and agreed with patients and reviewed at regular intervals to make sure that they remain up to date and are fit for purpose.

Poor asthma control leads to unfavourable outcomes, more frequent exacerbations, irreversible loss of lung function and even asthma-related deaths. Add-on therapy with LABA, LAMA or LTRA should be considered when asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled with at least medium–high ICS. Primary care practitioners can and should regularly assess symptom control following assessment of adherence, triggers, device technique and comorbidities. Therapy should be stepped up as recommended in GINA guidelines in order to attain optimal control, considering individual symptoms, lung function, comorbidities, inhaler technique, adherence and patient preference as important parameters for a personalised choice.

In conclusion, in adults, LAMAs and LABAs appear to provide a greater improvement in lung function than LTRAs as add-on to ICS, although there are no individual studies that directly compare LAMAs with LTRAs. LAMAs appear to be an effective alternative to LABAs for attaining asthma control, optimising lung function and preventing exacerbations, with a possible higher lung function benefit of LAMAs compared with LABAs. Data in patients aged < 18 years are currently limited due to inherent difficulties in the study of this population. Current available evidence from clinical trials suggests that LABAs, LTRAs and LAMAs have comparable safety profiles, with LABAs and LAMAs providing greater improvements in lung function than LTRAs, yet it should be noted the FDA have advised a boxed warning for the LTRA montelukast due to risk of mental health side effects. Asthma should be treated in accordance with current guidelines, with regular checks made to ensure symptoms are controlled, as well as ensuring optimal strategies are in place to prevent exacerbations and achieve best lung function. If control is not achieved, treatment should be stepped up, ensuring that factors that may influence control (such as adherence, administration technique, allergic triggers and comorbidities) are addressed for each individual patient.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113jvxvY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Anti-inflammatory reliever medications — low-dose combination ICS-SABA: Budesonide-salbutamol (also described as albuterol-budesonide) and beclometasone-salbutamol are delivered via pMDI or DPI. This is an anti-inflammatory reliever option (instead of SABA) for GINA Track 2; budesonide-salbutamol 100/100 mcg (delivered dose 80/90 mcg) taken 2 inhalations as needed on top of maintenance ICS or ICS-LABA reduced the risk of severe exacerbations in adults compared with SABA reliever, with most benefit seen in Step 3. ICS-SABA cannot be used for maintenance-and-reliever therapy, and there is no evidence for as-needed-only use of budesonide-salbutamol in Steps 1–2.

### Treatment patterns and related clinical consequences in adults with asthma [^111f1nmV]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

A stepwise therapeutic management is recommended for asthma patients by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Little is known about the recommendations applied in real world settings. This study aims to associate Treatment step with clinical events in patients with mild or severe asthma.

Methods

A retrospective claims database analysis included adult patients with mild (GINA step 1) or severe asthma (GINA step 4). Maximum Treatment Step was measured within the first and second 90-day period after index date (the first date of asthma diagnosis during the inclusion period). Step-down was defined as a Treatment Step change from a higher to lower step, while Step-up was defined as a Treatment Step change from a lower to higher step. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of asthma-related clinical events, measured at the third 90-day period.

Results and Conclusions

A total of 6,354 mild-asthma patients and 5,695 severe-asthma patients were included. In mild-asthma, when compared with No Change in Treatment Step, Step-down was associated with a lower risk of future clinical events [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (95% CI); 0.69–0.94], while Step-up was not associated with a change in clinical events [OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.77–1.27]. In severe-asthma patients, Step-down was not associated with a change in clinical events [OR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.81–1.10], while Step-up was associated with a higher risk of future clinical events [OR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.29–3.33]. Our findings reassure the appropriateness of stepping-down treatment in mild-asthma patients. Clinicians should closely monitor and/or provide detailed asthma action plans for severe-asthma patients who are stepping-up treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114pbuzs]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are an add-on option at Step 5 (or at Step 4, non-preferred because of weaker evidence for benefit) in combination or separate inhalers for patients with uncontrolled asthma despite ICS-LABA, and modestly improve lung function but not symptoms or quality of life with a small reduction in exacerbations; for patients with exacerbations, ensure that ICS is increased to at least medium dose before considering need for add-on LAMA. Medications include tiotropium, ≥ 6 years, by mist inhaler, added to separate ICS-LABA, and combination ICS-LABA-LAMA inhalers for adults ≥ 18 years: beclometasone-formoterol-glycopyrronium; fluticasone furoate-vilanterol-umeclidinium; mometasone-indacaterol-glycopyrronium. Delivery is pMDI or DPI or mist inhaler, and adverse effects are uncommon but include dry mouth and urinary retention.

### Effectiveness of fluticasone furoate plus vilanterol on asthma control in clinical practice: an open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^117GsWK3]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Evidence for management of asthma comes from closely monitored efficacy trials done in highly selected patient groups. There is a need for randomised trials that are closer to usual clinical practice.

Methods

We did an open-label, randomised, controlled, two-arm effectiveness trial at 74 general practice clinics in Salford and South Manchester, UK. Patients aged 18 years or older with a general practitioner's diagnosis of symptomatic asthma and on maintenance inhaler therapy were randomly assigned to initiate treatment with a once-daily inhaled combination of either 100 μg or 200 μg fluticasone furoate with 25 μg vilanterol or optimised usual care and followed up for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved an asthma control test (ACT) score of 20 or greater or an increase in ACT score from baseline of 3 or greater at 24 weeks (termed responders), in patients with a baseline ACT score less than 20 (the primary effectiveness analysis population). All effectiveness analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01706198.

Findings

Between Nov 12, 2012, and Dec 16, 2016, 4725 patients were enrolled and 4233 randomly assigned to initiate treatment with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol (n = 2114) or usual care (n = 2119). 1207 patients (605 assigned to usual care, 602 to fluticasone furoate and vilanterol) had a baseline ACT score greater than or equal to 20 and were thus excluded from the primary effectiveness analysis population. At week 24, the odds of being a responder were higher for patients who initiated treatment with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol than for those on usual care (977 [71%] of 1373 in the fluticasone furoate and vilanterol group vs 784 [56%] of 1399 in the usual care group; odds ratio [OR] 2.00 [95% CI 1.70–2.34], p < 0.0001). At week 24, the adjusted mean ACT score increased by 4.4 points from baseline in patients initiated with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol, compared with 2.8 points in the usual care group (difference 1.6 [95% CI 1.3–2.0], p < 0.0001). This result was consistent for the duration of the study. Pneumonia was uncommon, with no differences between groups; there was no difference in other serious adverse events between the groups.

Interpretation

In patients with a general practitioner's diagnosis of symptomatic asthma and on maintenance inhaler therapy, initiation of a once-daily treatment regimen of combined fluticasone furoate and vilanterol improved asthma control without increasing the risk of serious adverse events when compared with optimised usual care.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114sAn6h]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

GINA 2024 – Children 6–11 years — stepwise pharmacologic management specifies controller and reliever choices by step. Step 1 is "Low dose ICS taken whenever SABA taken". Step 2 preferred is "Daily low dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (see table of ICS dose ranges for children)", with alternatives "Daily leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA‡), or low dose ICS taken whenever SABA taken". Step 3 lists "Low dose ICS-LABA, OR medium dose ICS, OR very low dose ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever (MART)". Step 4 states "Refer for expert advice, OR medium dose ICS-LABA, OR low dose ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (MART)", with other options to "Add tiotropium or add LTRA‡". Step 5 advises "Refer for phenotypic assessment ± higher dose ICS-LABA or add-on therapy, e.g., anti-IgE, anti-IL4Rα, anti-IL5", and "As last resort, consider add-on low dose OCS, but consider side-effects". The reliever is "As-needed SABA (or ICS-formoterol reliever* in MART in Steps 3 and 4)". A footnote cautions, "If prescribing leukotriene receptor antagonists, note concerns about potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects".

### One time a day mometasone / indacaterol fixed-dose combination versus two times a day fluticasone / salmeterol in patients with inadequately controlled asthma: pooled analysis from PALLADIUM and IRIDIUM studies [^1138o7rr]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines recommend the combination of a medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) as the preferred controller treatment in patients with asthma uncontrolled on ICS alone or low-dose ICS/LABA combination. Compared with ICS monotherapy (higher or similar doses), ICS/LABA combination therapy reduces asthma exacerbations, improves lung function and demonstrates better asthma control in adults with persistent asthma.

One time a day ICS/LABA dosing regimens have been associated with better efficacy (asthma exacerbations), increased adherence and a lower risk of discontinuation compared with two times a day regimens, which might lead to improved asthma control. The standard-of-care ICS/LABA fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate (FLU/SAL), budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FORM), fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) and beclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol (BDP/FORM) have been shown to be safe and effective in the management of asthma. However, a substantial proportion of patients (approximately 30%–50%) remain uncontrolled on currently available ICS/LABA therapies. Patients with poor asthma control may have increased healthcare resource utilisation and higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared with patients with controlled asthma. The ICS mometasone furoate (MF) and the LABA indacaterol acetate (IND) have been formulated as FDC therapy (MF/IND) one time a day delivered via Breezhaler ® for maintenance treatment of patients with asthma. Two phase III pivotal studies (PALLADIUM and IRIDIUM) compared the efficacy and safety of high- and medium- dose MF/IND with high-dose FLU/SAL, among other comparisons, in patients with inadequately controlled asthma, and that supported the recent approvals of MF/IND and MF/IND/glycopyrronium bromide (GLY).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111DJ5mc]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (stepwise management), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to use the following track as the preferred stepwise approach to the management of asthma in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years, with as-needed short-acting β-agonist or low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever in Steps 3 and 4:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 1. Symptoms ≤ 1–2 days per week|- Offer low-dose ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken <br/> -, in separate inhalers or in combination if available|
|Step 2. Symptoms 2–5 days per week|- Offer low-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> -; consider offering ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken, in combination or separate inhalers, <br/> - or daily leukotriene receptor antagonist as non-preferred options; consider the probability of adherence to maintenance treatment if reliever is short-acting β-agonist|
|Step 3. Symptoms on most days of the week or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week|- Offer low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - Offer medium-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> -; offer very low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy <br/> -; consider offering daily low-dose ICS or leukotriene receptor antagonist, plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist as a non-preferred option|
|Step 4. Symptoms daily, waking at night ≥ 1 per week, low lung function|- Offer medium-dose maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - Offer low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy <br/> - Consider referring for expert advice|
|Step 5.|- Refer for phenotypic assessment <br/> - Offer higher-dose ICS-LABA <br/> - Offer add-on therapy, such as anti-IgE, anti-interleukin 4 receptor, or anti-interleukin 5 therapy|
|Initial presentation with exacerbation|- Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of oral corticosteroids if severe <br/> - Offer Step 3 or 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up|

### National asthma education and prevention program 2020 guideline update: where Do we Go from here? [^112tPDXG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

How Does the NAEPP 2020 Asthma Guideline Update Compare with Recommendations by the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma?

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and the NHLBI to promote a coordinated worldwide effort in asthma prevention and management. Although the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention 2020 Update (GINA 2020 report) is not a guideline, many readers of the NAEPP update are likely to ask whether the recommendations in the two documents are similar or different. The answer is yes and yes. For example, note the similarities and differences in pharmacologic step therapy recommendations for individuals age 12 years or older (Table 1).

Table 1.
Preferred Controller and Reliever Pharmacotherapy Recommendations for Individuals ≥ 12 Years with Asthma in the NAEPP 2020 Guideline Update and GINA 2020 Report

We believe the differences are largely the result of different objectives, methods used to review evidence, and definitions. The GINA report is intended to inform a comprehensive global strategy for various aspects of diagnosis and management of mild to severe asthma, including in low- and middle-income countries. The NAEPP update offers recommendations for six priority topics. GINA updates its report annually based on a twice-yearly review of the recently published literature by asthma clinicians and researchers from diverse geographic regions in the world. The GINA report is not a guideline, so it does not adhere to methodologies recommended for guidelines. GINA advises healthcare professionals "to use their own professional judgement, and to take into account local and national regulations and guidelines".

The GINA report includes five levels of progressive treatment intensification ("steps"), with step 1 therapy reserved for individuals with symptoms less than 2 times/mo. The NAEPP 2020 guideline update "pulled-through" the six-step pharmacotherapy framework used in the NAEPP 2007 asthma guidelines but only made changes to some of the pharmacotherapy recommendations in the six steps in each age group. For example, in individuals 12 years or older, the Expert Panel's pharmacotherapy recommendations for the preferred controller only address steps 2–5 (Table 1). The NAEPP 2007 asthma guideline pharmacotherapy recommendations for step 1, reserved for "intermittent asthma", was not reviewed by the Expert Panel for 2020 update. GINA does not include the construct of intermittent asthma because all patients with asthma are at risk for severe exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115MkVWQ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management cycle for personalized asthma care involves a continual cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment and review. Assess the patient's symptom control and their risk factors for exacerbations, for decline in lung function and for medication adverse effects, with particular attention to inhaler technique and adherence; assess comorbidities and the patient's goals and preferences, and confirm the diagnosis of asthma if not yet done. Adjust the patient's management based on these assessments, including treatment of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities, relevant non-pharmacologic strategies, education and skills training, and adjustment of medication as required; for adults and adolescents, the preferred controller and reliever treatment across all steps is with combination ICS-formoterol, as shown in GINA Track 1. Review the patient in line with the goals of treatment, reassess factors affecting symptoms, risk of adverse outcomes and patient satisfaction, arrange further investigations if needed, and readjust treatment if needed.

Fig. 2
Preferred pharmacological management.

Preferred pharmacological management of asthma in adults and adolescents (12 and over GINA)and adults and young people (12 and over BTS/NICE/SIGN).

They both emphasise the need for checking factors such as adherence, inhaler technique, trigger factors and diagnosis before escalating therapy and also considering of stepping -down therapy when a patient is "stable' (after 3 months-GINA).

However, there are some differences:

GINA recommends an alternative treatment pathway ("Track 2") to AIR and MART therapies, based on the traditional maintenance ICS and SABA relief therapy. However there is no Track 2 in the NICE/BTS/SIGN guidance for people with asthma age 12 and over.

GINA does not recommend adding LTRA or LAMA to moderate-dose MART (≤ 800 mcg per day of Beclometasone or equivalentvia DPI or standard-particle MDI before specialist referral. However, BTS/NICE/BTS suggest trying these options before referral unless FeNO is raised. (suggesting poor adherence with ICS or a need for additional anti-eosinophilic inflammatory drugs)

Overall the NICE/BTS/SIGN Guideline for management of asthma in people age 12 and over gives support for the GINA approach of single ICS/formoterol AIR and MART therapy as the core asthma treatment for chronic asthma management. However, this may not be applicable in lower economy countries where availability and cost of combination ICS/LABA inhalers may be problematic. In these case GINA's alternative treatment pathway centred around maintenance ICS and relief SABA use may be more relevant.

### Unmet need in severe, uncontrolled asthma: can anti-TSLP therapy with tezepelumab provide a valuable new treatment option? [^112TmuwD]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Current treatment options for severe asthma

The heterogeneity of severe asthma makes management of the disease highly challenging, and intensive treatment regimens involving multiple medications are required. Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines (treatment steps 4 and 5) recommend a combination medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting β 2 agonist (LABA) as maintenance therapy to prevent exacerbations and to control symptoms in these patients, with additional relief from a short-acting β 2 agonist as needed (or an ICS/LABA combination as both maintenance and reliever therapy, in the case of formoterol-containing combinations). Other controller medications recommended by GINA and European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society guidelines for use as potential add-on therapies are inhaled tiotropium (a long-acting muscarinic antagonist; at GINA steps 4 or 5), leukotriene receptor antagonists (at step 4) and macrolides (at step 5). However, many patients have an insufficient response to these treatments and so are prescribed frequent bursts of OCS, although the side effect profile of OCS limits the dose and makes chronic administration non-ideal. Furthermore, some patients have steroid-refractory disease. At GINA step 5, it is recommended that patients are assessed for eligibility for biologic therapies, which are indicated as additional controllers for specific phenotypes of severe asthma. Eligibility for these therapies is partly determined by meeting specific inflammatory biomarker thresholds (and, by extension, phenotypes) for which efficacy of the particular biologic treatment was demonstrated in clinical trials.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112EAN1M]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

ICS in combination with a long-acting beta2 agonist bronchodilator (ICS-LABA) for maintenance asthma treatment includes beclometasone-formoterol, budesonide-formoterol, fluticasone furoate-vilanterol, fluticasone propionate-formoterol, fluticasone propionate-salmeterol, mometasone-formoterol and mometasone-indacaterol, delivered by pMDI or DPI. When a low-dose of ICS alone fails to achieve good control of asthma, the addition of LABA to maintenance ICS improves symptoms, lung function and reduces exacerbations in more patients, more rapidly, than doubling the dose of ICS. Two regimens are available: low-dose combination beclometasone or budesonide with low-dose formoterol for both maintenance-and-reliever treatment (MART, GINA Track 1), and maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA or ICS-SABA as reliever (Track 2); MART with low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever is preferred as it reduces exacerbations compared with conventional maintenance therapy with SABA as reliever, and is a simpler regimen. The LABA component may be associated with tachycardia, headache or cramps; LABA is safe in asthma when used in combination with ICS, but LABA or LAMA should not be used without ICS in asthma (or in patients with asthma+COPD) due to increased risk of serious adverse outcomes. Concomitant treatment with cytochrome P450 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin may increase the risk of ICS adverse effects.

Asthma Step 4 MART dosing — In Step 4, the MART regimen can be prescribed with medium-dose maintenance budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol by increasing low-dose ICS-formoterol to 2 inhalations twice-daily; the reliever remains 1 inhalation of low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed. The usual dose for MART with budesonide-formoterol is 200/6 mcg metered dose (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose) and for beclometasone-formoterol is 100/6 mcg metered dose (delivered dose 84.6/5 mcg for pMDI and 81.9/5 mcg for DPI), and for Step 4 each is prescribed as two inhalations twice-daily plus one inhalation whenever needed for symptom relief. As in Step 3, the maximum recommended total dose of budesonide-formoterol in a single day (total of maintenance-and-reliever doses) gives 72 mcg metered dose (54 mcg delivered dose) of formoterol; based on this evidence, GINA suggests the same maximum total dose should also apply for MART with beclometasone-formoterol (maximum total 12 inhalations, total metered dose 72 mcg), and most patients need far fewer doses than this.

### A systematic review with attempted network meta-analysis of asthma therapy recommended for five to eighteen year olds in GINA steps three and four [^116KCzXy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines contain systematically developed statements to help practitioners make optimal healthcare decisions. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline is a major step forward in achieving best possible asthma control. The GINA guideline uses symptoms, exacerbations, airflow limitation, and lung function variability to categorize asthma severity into intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent or severe persistent. GINA suggests that 5 to 18 year-olds, whose symptoms are insufficiently controlled after three months of treatment at a particular GINA step, move up a step (see Table 1).

Table 1
GINA recommended treatment steps for 5 to 18 year olds

SABA = rapidly acting ß 2 -agonists; ICS = Inhaled Corticosteroids; LABA = Long–acting β 2 -adrenoceptor agonists; LTRA = Leukotriene modifier.

There is level A evidence (see glossary) on the effectiveness of short acting ß 2 -agonists (SABA; step 1) and adding a low dose inhaled glucocorticosteroid (ICS) (step 2) in children with mild asthma. However, although the level of evidence for GINA step 3&4 recommendations for children older than 5 years is deemed A to B, level A evidence to guide step-up therapy is lacking for this age group. Scrutiny of the randomized trials (RCTs) underlying the guideline, reveals that some are outdated, because children used daily oral prednisone (see for example), or compare step 2 with step 3 (see for example). This leaves only five RCTs comparing treatments of step 3&4 for this age group.

Network meta-analysis (NMA), also known as indirect comparisons, exploits the mathematical property that (A – B) – (A – C) = A – B – A + C = C – B. It enables one to formally compare drugs B and C although these were never compared head-to-head. NMA has major advantages over classic meta-analysis; it formally ranks treatment effects in case more than two treatments are involved; it circumvents the usual overrepresentation of drug comparisons to placebo, which may not always be the most informative for practising physicians. We set out, using NMA methodology, to compare GINA step 3&4 drug treatment efficacies in 5 to 18 year-old children/adolescents with moderate persistent asthma.

Asthma step-down — Step 2 options when asthma is well controlled and lung function stable for ≥ 3 months: For low-dose maintenance ICS, options include once-daily dosing with budesonide, ciclesonide, mometasone, or fluticasone furoate; switching to as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol; or switching to taking ICS whenever SABA is taken. Do not completely stop ICS, because the risk of exacerbations is increased with SABA-only treatment.
