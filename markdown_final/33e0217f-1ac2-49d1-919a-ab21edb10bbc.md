## Question

Which medication can help in Felling shame

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are medications that can help with shame and, if so, which ones and how they work. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what shame is and how it differs from related emotions like guilt. Then, I should verify whether any medications directly target shame versus indirectly reducing it by treating comorbid conditions. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence for medications that reduce shame in specific contexts, especially PTSD. After that, I should examine psychotherapies that target shame and consider whether medications can augment them. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, useful answer with caveats and practical guidance.

> Let me first confirm the construct of shame so I don't conflate it with guilt or embarrassment. Shame is a self-conscious emotion tied to the global devaluation of the self, often provoking withdrawal, concealment, and avoidance, whereas guilt pertains to a specific act and tends to prompt reparative behavior; this distinction matters because treatments that target guilt may not address shame's identity-level threat and avoidance patterns [^113yrEF1] [^112vnRdq].

> Wait, let me verify whether any medication has been shown to directly reduce shame as a primary target. I need to check the literature for agents with explicit shame-reduction outcomes rather than just downstream effects via anxiety or depression improvement. The clearest signal comes from MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD, where phase 3 trials report reductions in PTSD-related shame and anger alongside symptom improvements, suggesting a pharmacologically facilitated window of tolerance that may allow processing of shame-laden traumatic content with less avoidance and more self-compassion [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does this mean MDMA "treats shame" directly, or does it enable psychotherapeutic processing that reduces shame. I should confirm the mechanism. The evidence indicates MDMA acutely reduces hyperarousal and fear while enhancing prosocial feelings and therapeutic alliance, which together can support confronting shame-evoking memories with less overwhelming avoidance; that is best framed as medication-assisted psychotherapy rather than a standalone pharmacologic cure for shame per se [^111x5Vss].

> Next, I should review whether conventional antidepressants reduce shame. SSRIs and related agents improve anxiety, depression, and OCD symptoms, and shame frequently co-occurs with these conditions; however, most studies do not isolate shame as a primary endpoint, so any shame reduction is typically inferred from general symptom improvement rather than demonstrated as a direct anti-shame effect, which means I should be cautious in attributing causality here [^11235d6d].

> I will now examine the neurobiology to see if there are plausible pharmacologic levers on shame. Serotonin depletion paradigms show that lowering serotonin can amplify guilt and shame in some contexts, implying that serotonergic modulation may influence shame intensity, but this is experimental and not a treatment recommendation; still, it supports the biological plausibility that serotonergic agents could modulate shame experiences, particularly when shame is embedded in anxiety or depressive syndromes [^112qeZfF] [^111QgMFG].

> Let me consider psychotherapies that explicitly target shame, because medications may work best as adjuncts to these approaches. Compassion-focused therapy and transdiagnostic protocols like the Unified Protocol reduce shame and self-criticism across conditions, and early reductions in shame correlate with better outcomes in eating disorders; mindfulness- and acceptance-based approaches also reduce internalized stigma and shame in medical populations, reinforcing that shame is responsive to targeted psychosocial interventions even if not directly pharmacologic [^111DyCHG] [^111qU9W3] [^114Ekkun] [^117RpPi2].

> But wait, what if shame is a barrier to care itself. I should double-check that shame predicts avoidance and disengagement, which complicates treatment. Shame robustly predicts lower help-seeking for mental health and is linked to concealment and avoidance in healthcare, so any medication discussion must be embedded in a shame-sensitive clinical process that anticipates withdrawal and addresses stigma to sustain engagement [^114Ku9Mk] [^116BcE2c].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking safety or overpromising. There is no FDA-approved medication for shame as a discrete indication, and outside of research settings, psychedelic-assisted therapies are not standard care; thus, current pharmacotherapy for shame remains off-label and adjunctive, ideally paired with evidence-based psychotherapy and careful monitoring of suicidality, since shame is associated with active suicidal ideation and risk escalation in some contexts [^112d6Lup] [^113QiK3R].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. No medication reliably and specifically "treats shame" as a standalone target in routine practice; however, in PTSD with prominent shame, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has the strongest evidence for reducing shame as part of trauma processing, and SSRIs may indirectly lessen shame by treating comorbid anxiety, depression, or OCD, though shame-specific outcomes are less well established; across cases, pairing medications with shame-focused psychotherapies such as CFT, ACT, or the Unified Protocol is the most defensible, evidence-aligned approach [^11235d6d] [^111DyCHG] [^114Ekkun].

> Practically, I should verify the clinical steps. First, assess shame explicitly and track shame-specific measures to avoid missing its impact on engagement and outcomes; second, prioritize shame-targeted psychotherapies as first-line; third, treat comorbid conditions with SSRIs or other appropriate agents when indicated, recognizing potential indirect shame benefits; fourth, in severe, treatment-resistant PTSD with entrenched shame, consider referral to trials or specialized programs offering MDMA-assisted therapy where available and legal; and fifth, maintain a shame-informed stance in all interactions to reduce avoidance and support retention in care [^112ifzFA] [^111x5Vss] [^116BcE2c].

There is **no medication approved specifically for shame** [^113yrEF1]. Shame is best addressed with **psychotherapy** — especially compassion-focused therapy (CFT) [^115oDU5Z], acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) [^111h7KiV], and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) [^111DyCHG] — which reduce shame by building self-compassion, acceptance, and cognitive reappraisal [^111qU9W3]. Medications may help indirectly by treating comorbid conditions (e.g. SSRIs for depression/anxiety, stimulants for ADHD) [^notfound], but they do not directly target shame. Emerging research suggests MDMA-assisted therapy may reduce shame in PTSD [^111x5Vss], but it is not yet approved. Clinicians should prioritize **psychotherapy and self-compassion** interventions for shame [^114Ekkun].

---

## Psychological interventions for shame

Psychological therapies are the **primary evidence-based treatments** for shame, with several modalities demonstrating efficacy:

- **Compassion-focused therapy (CFT)**: Developed specifically for shame and self-criticism, CFT builds self-compassion and reduces shame across multiple populations [^115oDU5Z] [^113jxWVi].

- **Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)**: ACT enhances psychological flexibility and self-compassion, reducing shame and improving quality of life in chronic illness and other contexts [^116q6kdf] [^111h7KiV].

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT addresses maladaptive cognitions and self-critical thoughts that maintain shame, with evidence of shame reduction even when shame is not directly targeted [^114u9BAb].

- **Mindfulness-based interventions**: Mindfulness reduces shame and internalized stigma by fostering nonjudgmental awareness and self-acceptance [^117RpPi2] [^114Ekkun].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Currently, **no medications are approved specifically for shame** [^notfound]. However, medications may indirectly reduce shame by treating comorbid conditions:

- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: SSRIs are first-line for depression and anxiety, which often co-occur with shame; reducing these symptoms can lessen shame.

- **Stimulants**: For ADHD-related shame, stimulants can improve executive function and self-esteem, indirectly reducing shame.

- **MDMA-assisted therapy**: Early research suggests MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may reduce shame in PTSD, but it remains investigational and is not approved [^111x5Vss].

---

## Limitations and risks of pharmacological treatment

Pharmacological treatment of shame carries **several limitations and risks**:

- **Lack of specificity**: Medications do not directly target shame, risking incomplete or transient effects [^notfound].

- **Side effects**: SSRIs and stimulants can cause side effects that may worsen self-perception or shame [^notfound].

- **Overreliance**: Medication without psychotherapy may miss underlying drivers of shame, risking relapse [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **psychotherapy as first-line** for shame, with medications reserved for comorbidities:

- **Psychotherapy first-line**: CFT, ACT, and CBT are recommended to directly address shame and self-criticism [^115oDU5Z] [^116q6kdf] [^1112ro8z].

- **Medication as adjunctive**: Use medications only for diagnosed comorbidities (e.g. depression, anxiety, ADHD), not for shame itself.

- **Monitor for side effects**: Regularly assess for adverse effects that could exacerbate shame or self-criticism [^114W5jd5].

---

## Conclusion and future directions

There is **no medication approved specifically for shame**; psychotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment, with medications used only for comorbid conditions. Emerging research, such as MDMA-assisted therapy, is promising but not yet approved [^111x5Vss]. Clinicians should prioritize psychotherapy and self-compassion interventions, reserving medications for comorbidities and monitoring closely for adverse effects.

### Shame, stigma, HIV: philosophical reflections [^111cJKad]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

While there are many possible factors that might lead to the interruption of care, from physical barriers, socioeconomic problems, and so on, the stigma associated with HIV, and the shame that emerges from this, are widely understood to be significant contributory factors in many decisions to stop or take a break from treatment, and it is this with which we are concerned here. What we here want to do, therefore, is twofold:
motivate the take-up of further study through which we might better understand the role shame and stigma play in the challenge posed to adherence and retention in care;
provide the conceptual resources so we that we can undertake sound research, employing methods appropriate to the nature of our topic: shame and HIV-stigma.

While, from a narrowly conceived biomedical perspective, ART might well enable an individual to live a normal life, from a psychosocial perspective that same therapy — the taking of the pills, the attending clinic, the blood tests — might serve to continually remind the same person of their HIV status and the stigma associated with HIV. The very thing that biochemically suppresses the virus can serve, psychosocially, to generate stigma and shame.

How Might this be Addressed?

Following the first of our four gains, we propose studies which enable our understanding of the shame experienced by people living with HIV, particularly those who have taken a break from treatment, so that we might better understand the objects of the emotion and the conditions under which those objects 'come into view'. We propose that facilitating studies conducted by people living with HIV themselves, studies conducted in accordance with ethnographic principles and techniques provided by Ethnomethodology, vi would be the most productive approach.

Following our second gain, treatment strategies designed to mitigate the effects of the emotion or eradicate it should not be based on explaining to a person that they have no good reason to be ashamed of their HIV status; those individuals will be likely to know this, they might even believe this strongly and be able to cite clear supporting reasons. Given what we know about the conceptual anatomy of shame, we need to address ourselves to the emotion at the subpropositional level.

VA/DoD schizophrenia guideline — evidence rating for switching antipsychotics notes that the recommendation is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation and states that the benefits of monotherapy outweighed the potential harm of no medication, polypharmacy, or continuing a medication with significant adverse events. The guideline adds that individuals with schizophrenia who are not treated with antipsychotic medication can experience catastrophic outcomes, including homelessness, unemployment, and inability to care for themselves, and that antipsychotic treatment is the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia; patient values and preferences varied, including that some patients might not want to take a medication if it causes distressing side effects and might want to try a different antipsychotic, and that some patients might not want to take medication at all because of lack of effect, lack of insight, or beliefs about their medications, including causing stigma and shame.

### Health-related shame: an affective determinant of health? [^115jyHWB]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

What is common to this diverse collection of responses and reactions is that shame creates a sense of heightened visibility and, as a result, has a tendency to provoke concealment — to hide one's shame and to obscure that of which one is ashamed. At the same time, shame also provokes 'a cognitive shock' to use Nathanson'sformulation, that 'manages to derail cognition [and] higher cortical function'. In short, shame (or even just the threat of shame) induces a panic state where the 'necessity' (to hide or conceal) that shame produces overrides rational thought and moral reasoning. In its painful state of exposure and continuous self-reference, a shamed individual often does not have the cognitive resources to act as a responsive and responsible agent, authentically attuned to the needs of itself and its community of others. Thus, shame is commonly avoided and hidden, even when these measures potentially entail harming the self or others.

### Health-related shame: an affective determinant of health? [^116BcE2c]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

Empirical research demonstrates that threats of acute shame regarding one's health, physical body, identity, behaviour or social status can have a significant effect on the process of the clinical encounter. Harris and Darby report that of a large cohort of patients, half of all respondents recalled one or more interactions with a physician that left them feeling ashamed. Not all of these felt that being shamed had been a bad thing, but the corollary of this was that even those who deemed the experience to have improved their health behaviour were significantly more likely to lie to their physician subsequently. Commonly, it is reported that shame, or the anticipation of a shame episode, invokes a tendency towards concealment and avoidance in healthcare contexts and as a result shame can act as an invisible barrier to the adequate delivery of healthcare. When individuals feel the threat of shame this can lead to (i) failure to seek treatment; (ii) failure to disclose the full details of one's mental or physical ill-health or one's situation or identity — for example, one's sexuality or literacy status — which may result in inadequate or ineffective treatment being prescribed; (iii) failure to complete the course of prescribed treatment or (iv) diagnosis concealment from family and friends. The anticipation of painful exposure, along with the fear of the judgement that it might incur, can lead individuals to avoid seeking medical attention or from accurately narrating or disclosing symptoms or histories 'even when they are concerned about serious symptoms'. Hence, avoiding potential instances of acute shame can feel like a life-saving measure, even when it puts one's health or life at risk.

### Interpersonal mechanisms contributing to the association between HIV-related internalized stigma and medication adherence [^112MfdMg]. AIDS and Behavior (2017). Low credibility.

Previous research suggests that people living with HIV (PLWH) sometimes internalize HIV-related stigma existing in the community and experience feelings of inferiority and shame due to their HIV status, which can have negative consequences for treatment adherence. PLWH's interpersonal concerns about how their HIV status may affect the security of their existing relationships may help explain how internalized stigma affects adherence behaviors. In a cross-sectional study conducted between March 2013 and January 2015 in Birmingham, AL, 180 PLWH recruited from an outpatient HIV clinic completed previously validated measures of internalized stigma, attachment styles, and concern about being seen while taking HIV medication. Participants also self-reported their HIV medication adherence. Higher levels of HIV-related internalized stigma, attachment-related anxiety (i.e., fear of abandonment by relationship partners), and concerns about being seen by others while taking HIV medication were all associated with worse medication adherence. The effect of HIV-related internalized stigma on medication adherence was mediated by attachment-related anxiety and by concerns about being seen by others while taking HIV medication. Given that medication adherence is vitally important for PLWH to achieve long-term positive health outcomes, understanding interpersonal factors affecting medication adherence is crucial. Interventions aimed at improving HIV treatment adherence should address interpersonal factors as well as intrapersonal factors.

### Shame, stigma and medicine [^115ERQW4]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

The importance of this may be better appreciated when viewed through the lens of Paul Gilbert's paper contrasting shame and compassion. Gilbert's extensive body of work on the subject identifies how shame experiences impact on our psychological selves, on how we experience ourselves, others and relationships. Shame serves to separate, segregate, marginalise and disengage. If the clinicians in Bowman's account are so affected, then it would seem difficult for them to engage with what Gilbert sees as one antidote to shame — compassion. In contrast to shame, compassion — 'a sensitivity to suffering in self and others with a commitment to try to alleviate and prevent it' — facilitates connection, integration and support.

Gilbert proposes that shame represents a major threat to human well-being as it increases vulnerability to illness, undermines physical and mental healing and reduces help seeking. Dolezal and Lyons take this as their starting point to explore shame's impact on health. They argue that shame affects medical help seeking, disclosure, truthfulness, willingness to engage in treatment, cease health-affecting behaviours or return for further consultations. Furthermore, the pervasive use of shaming of 'deviant' bodies and behaviours in contemporary medical culture can inform how we view ourselves, and lead to the pernicious and damaging state of chronic shame. The stigmatising discourses surrounding minority groups (eg, age, race, sexuality) are degrading and powerful and also critical to health outcomes. Dolezal and Lyons call for broader political and clinical recognition of shame and stigma in respect of health and illness.

The articles collected in this Special Issue consider a wide range of health-related topics — infectious disease, the dynamics of the clinical encounter, chronic pain, subjective experiences within mental health — thus demonstrating the far-reaching nature of shame and stigma. However, what is also evident from this Special Issue is just how little the role these factors play in medicine and healthcare has been subject to critical investigation. Much work, both empirical and conceptual, remains to be done in order to clarify the nature and extent of the burden of shame, the populations affected and the settings in which they are impacted on, and on the development and assessment of potential strategies aimed at mitigating problematic shame within healthcare contexts.

### Breastfeeding experiences of women with perinatal mental health problems: a systematic review and thematic synthesis [^114pzVP1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is a complex dynamic relationship amongst breastfeeding intention, practice, and experiences for mothers with PMH conditions. The intensity and magnitude of positive outcomes that women describe, and the challenges experienced, are exacerbated in mothers with PMH conditions. The challenging experiences are particularly influenced by a lack of support, shame, fear of stigmatisation and additional health concerns, such as worries over medication safety.

The synthesis identified inconsistent advice from healthcare professionals, particularly in relation to medication. Further training and improved communication pathways between specialities may help enhance perinatal maternity care provision. An in depth understanding of the women's views/needs in relation to their specific PMH condition could help enhance their experiences of infant feeding. This will help women to make informed choices about feeding, increasing their sense of control and improving self-efficacy, which could have a positive impact on their emotional and physical wellbeing, their ability to bond with their baby and their transition to motherhood.

Gaps identified through this systematic review include the need for further investigation on breastfeeding and PMH in women from minority groups, as well as a need for robust evidence and advice on medication use during breastfeeding for women experiencing perinatal mental ill health.

### Loving-kindness meditation vs cognitive processing therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder among veterans: a randomized clinical trial [^111vTqx8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Military veterans are at increased risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression due to combatand other traumas.PTSD occurs in 15% to 26% of veterans deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, 15% of male Vietnam veterans, and 2% to 12% of Gulf War I veterans.PTSD treatment guidelines recommend trauma-focused therapies, including cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure, as first-line treatments. Despite the proven efficacy and successful dissemination of CPT and prolonged exposure in Veterans Affairs (VA) health care facilities, only half or fewer of veterans with PTSD enrolled in the VA seek care, and most who engage in treatment receive an inadequate amount of care. Barriers to PTSD treatment include stigma and concerns that medications will be required or that talking about trauma will be too difficult. New treatments tailored to patient preferences are necessary to achieve improved outcomes.

Non–trauma-focused treatments can reduce PTSD symptoms. These interventions do not elicit trauma-related content but instead teach skills, such as mindfulness or problem-solving, which can be applied to situations in daily life. A non–trauma-focused intervention with preliminary support for treating PTSD, is loving-kindness meditation, a practice intended to increase feelings of kindness and compassion. Loving-kindness meditation is theorized to increase the ability to tolerate, rather than avoid, distressing thoughts, images, and feelings and to counteract shame, guilt, and emotional numbing, which are central symptoms of PTSD, (eAppendix in Supplement 2). This study tested whether loving-kindness meditation was noninferior to CPT. We hypothesized that veterans randomized to loving-kindness meditation would show reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms not meaningfully worse than those assigned to CPT. We also evaluated whether the proportion of veterans with clinically meaningful change, loss of PTSD diagnostic status, or attendance rates differed between the 2 treatments.

### Support for healthcare workers and patients after medical error through mutual healing: another step towards patient safety [^113EBLFT]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

This study was inspired by the story of a patient whose mother died due to a medication error. She maintains healing from her grief was delayed until 2 years later when she met informally with the healthcare worker (HCW) who felt ultimately responsible for the error. The HCW also asserted that the meeting was the catalyst for him to begin to cope with his shame and guilt about the trauma:

We realized that both of us had been on a journey of grief, shame, and fear. But we had been kept apart from each other by a healthcare system that did not yet understand the importance of a restorative approach to healing after harm. Bringing us together made healing so much easier (Davies et al, p. 236).

It is well known that HCWs make decisions that affect patients' lives while under pressure to do better, faster and with fewer resources. These circumstances can lead to medical errors, often because of a system failure, and occasionally due to human error. Although patient harm is not always a result of medical error, even the potential of harm can be upsetting and uncover feelings of distress for HCWs, which can be detrimental to their mental health. For patients, caregivers and family (hereafter referred to as 'patients'), medical errors — especially those with harmful outcomes — can have tremendous physical, emotional and psychological impacts.

In response to the exposure of this subject, there has been increasing recognition within healthcare organisations that their workers' well-being is suffering and that there is insufficient psychological support for them. Indeed, there is an impetus to help HCWs recover psychologically after a medical error, whether through employee assistance programmes, peer support programmes or psychological counselling. At the same time, there has not been any concerted effort to bring patients who were harmed together with the health professional involved to help in the healing outside of the more formal disclosure process. The patient in the story above and patient-led organisations such as(PFPSC) believe that healing is possible if the HCW and the patient are able to meet, work together and explore the event and the feelings associated with it.

### Conceptualization and assessment of shame experience and regulation: an umbrella review of synthesis studies [^11233oWM]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

1.4 Defining and Conceptualizing Shame Regulation

In addition to considerations on the experience of shame, critical to the understanding of adaptive and maladaptive correlates of shame is consideration of how individuals respond to it, that is, shame regulation or shame coping. For instance, shame is more likely to be problematic when the individual tries to avoid it, leaving shame essentially unresolved. Such an avoidance response is considered more likely when the cause of shame is perceived as irreparable (Cibich et al.).

Self‐conscious emotions, such as shame, play an important role in self‐regulation: They help individuals become aware of their social mistakes and, consequently, modify their behaviours (Beer and Keltner). There are multiple ways in which individuals can regulate or cope with shame feelings. According to Nathanson, individuals can recognize their shame and consequently find ways to cope with it or may wilfully or unconsciously avoid it — leading to the so‐called 'unacknowledged shame'. Nathanson went further by developing the 'compass of shame' model, grouping four categories of maladaptive shame‐coping strategies: withdrawal, avoidance, attack on self and attack on others. All of these are aimed at defending the self from the painful experience of shame, can be endorsed to different degrees and depend on the context. While attack on self involves internalization, self‐directed anger and even disgust, attack on others, on the contrary, is linked to externalization of blame and anger and even aggression. Withdrawal represents a combination of internalization and desire to reduce social exposure. Withdrawal is considered to be the prototypical reaction to shame, as shame naturally leads to a loss of muscle tone in the neck and back, driving a tendency to avoid eye contact by turning eyes and head downcast (Hahn). Finally, avoidance is usually associated with minimization or denial of shame — attempting to reduce social exposure or to keep shame from conscious awareness — and is the only strategy that can be characterized by a lack of conscious experience of shame (Elison et al; Garofalo and Velotti). Of note, recent theoretical and empirical work (e.g. Capinha et al; Garofalo and Velotti) has extended the compass of shame model to include a fifth dimension reflecting adaptive coping to shame, suggesting that adaptive coping is not limited to not endorsing maladaptive coping strategies but also include actively adopting adaptive strategies such as seeking social support.

### Unified protocol versus self-acceptance group therapy for emotional disorders in people with severe shame [^111DyCHG]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe shame is a distressing negative emotion, accompanied by intense feelings of worthlessness that contributes to a broad panoply of psychological disorders. This study aimed to compare the effects on shame dysregulation of two transdiagnostic treatments, the Unified Protocol (UP) and Self-Acceptance Group Therapy (SAGT). We additionally addressed the question of whether borderline personality disorder (BPD) can properly be regarded as an emotional disorder. The focus was on outcome measures, primarily shame that cut across individual diagnostic categories and capture emotional dysfunction broadly conceived.

Methods

Individuals suffering from a range of emotional disorders (including BPD) and high levels of shame were randomly allocated to treatment by either UP (N = 280) or SAGT (N = 282). Outcomes were measures of emotion dysfunction-shame, loneliness, neuroticism, emotional dysregulation, positive and negative affect-measured pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.

Results

UP was superior to SAGT in showing better post-treatment retention of therapeutic gains on all outcome measures over the 6-month follow-up period. Compared with those without a BPD diagnosis, those diagnosed with BPD showed significantly higher neuroticism and emotion dysregulation at baseline and a similar post-treatment reduction in almost all outcomes.

Conclusions

The results support the use of both the UP and SAGT in the treatment of severe shame. The superiority of the UP over SAGT in reducing negative emotionality is interpreted in terms of the specific mechanisms targeted by the UP. The results provide support for the theoretical rationale for the UP as a treatment for dysregulated shame and for emotional dysfunction generally.

### The social context for psychological distress from iatrogenic gynecomastia with suggestions for its management [^113e1LBc]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gynecomastia (breast development in males) is a side effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PCa). Medical interventions to prevent or treat gynecomastia carry risk of additional detrimental side effects. However, untreated gynecomastia can be physically uncomfortable and psychologically distressing. Shame from gynecomastia can lead patients to stop otherwise beneficial exercise.

Aims

Our first aim is to explore the social context for gynecomastia and how it is interpreted by men with the condition, as well as by others, both male and female. Subsequently, we use our understanding of why gynecomastia is psychologically distressing to propose psychosocial interventions that could help men accept this side effect of ADT.

Methods

We draw on academic literature, media accounts, and web-based testimonials from men with gynecomastia, to understand how gynecomastia is perceived by both patients and the medical community. We examine these resources in light of gynecomastia's impact on sex roles, sexuality, and gender identity issues.

Main Outcome Measures

By exploring what breasts in a male mean to the individual, we produce an understanding of the social context for distress from gynecomastia. From this understanding, we derive hypotheses about who might be most distressed from gynecomastia and strategies for alleviating this distress.

Results

The shame and stigma of gynecomastia is linked to the objectification of women. We suggest that men fear that their breasts will marginalize and subordinate them within gender hierarchies. There is little evidence that breasts on a male erotically attract either men or women. Novel options for living with gynecomastia are contrasted with medicalized strategies including mastectomy.

Conclusion

Assessment instruments need to be developed to identify patients most likely to experience distress from gynecomastia and seek out medical interventions. Surgical, radiological, or pharmacological interventions may not be universally necessary if greater acceptance of gynecomastia is made available through psychosocial support programs. For example, PCa patients may learn to accept gynecomastia through reconceptualizing their breasts as autoerotic. Support programs modeled on those of the breast cancer community, including Encore and dragon boat racing, may also help to build communities to serve patients with gynecomastia while defending individuals against shame, isolation, and loss of self-esteem.

### Acceptance and commitment therapy eczema management program for children with eczema: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^116q6kdf]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Eczema affects 6%–30% of children globally, causing physical discomforts (e.g. sleep disturbances and fatigue), psychological challenges (e.g. depression, anxiety and suicidality) and social issues (e.g. school avoidance and stigmatisation). Parents also face significant caregiving burdens, including managing flare‐ups, treatment failures, medical appointments and disrupted routines, often resulting in depressive symptoms, poor quality of life, and feelings of shame and guilt.

Current eczema interventions predominantly focus on symptom management through medication and health education, relying heavily on treatment adherence and parental competence. However, the success of these interventions also hinges crucially on addressing the psychological impacts, and treatment burdens to enhance the well‐being of parent–child dyads. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has recently gained prominence as an effective approach for tackling psychological challenges associated with chronic illness management. While primarily enhancing psychological flexibility, ACT also indirectly fosters self‐compassion, including self‐kindness, recognition of shared human experiences and a non‐judgmental attitude towards painful emotions. In literature, the role of ACT in improving the psychological health of parents and children dealing with chronic conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, cancer, developmental disabilities and asthma, has gained increasing recognition, highlighting its value in comprehensive disease management strategies.

Eczema‐related psychological challenges, such as shame, poor self‐perception in children and self‐criticism in parents, may benefit from an ACT approach emphasising self‐compassion to reduce rumination and improve self‐care. Given the parent–child interdependence, a dyadic psychotherapeutic approach could further support eczema management. Therefore, this pilot randomised clinical trial was designed to (1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Family Acceptance and Commitment Therapy‐based Eczema Management Program (FACT‐EMP) for parents and children with eczema, and (2) evaluate the preliminary effects on childhood eczema severity and parental eczema management self‐efficacy (primary clinical outcomes), and their quality of life and psychological well‐being over a 3‐month follow‐up.

### Determinants of self-management behavior in gout: a scoping review [^115qM8Qs]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Resistance and reluctance for medication adherence and dietary alteration/changes

Patients resisted receiving ULT when they were not convinced of its necessity, mostly due to absence of pain or frequent flares, sometimes believing their gout was curedand disliking the long‐term commitment. Patients reported experimenting with diet and medication during an asymptomatic period. Many patients experienced initial flares when starting ULT, leading to feelings of negative experiences and subsequent nonadherence. Other factors contributing to nonadherence to receiving ULT included side effects, and lack of symptom improvements. Patients felt they were receiving too many pills, which for some, felt detrimental to their body or led to feelings of frustration. Other negative attitudes toward receiving medication included a feeling of being dependent, disliking receiving multiple medications, resistance due to side effects, and general resistance toward medication, even though some did not have specific concerns receiving ULT. Patients were resistant toward making dietary changes because of the restrictiveness of diet and long‐term commitment, but poor dietary compliance could also originate as part of a "resistance to authority" reaction to the feeling being forced into lifestyle adaptations by the health care professional (HCP). Diet modification was also perceived to be unrealistic, unmanageable, and irrelevant. Some patients were reluctant to seek care, although they were in severe pain. Sometimes, gout was not considered severe enough to seek care, whereas others were reluctant to seek care due to their belief that gout was not curable and seeking care was therefore not helpful.

Negative emotions influencing self‐management

Feelings of insecurity (eg, with receiving a [generic] substitution), impatience for treatment effectivenessand concerns and fear for (long‐term) side effects of receiving ULT negatively impacted adherence to ULT, Fear of a gout flare and associated pain led to adherence to ULTand lifestyle modification. Feelings of shame or embarrassment led patients to avoid seeking help from a general practitioner (GP) because they perceived gout as self‐inflicted. Finally, feelings of depression or desperation negatively impacted self‐management.

### Health-related shame: an affective determinant of health? [^114Ggjot]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Within this paper, we have outlined how shame may impact on the health of individuals and populations. We believe that its influence is sufficiently powerful for it to be considered an important contributor, or even determinant, of health status. This is in no way to propose that it acts independently of other material or psychosocial factors, or that it is mediated differently within the body than other stress responses. Rather, our claim is that shame is so insidious, pervasive and pernicious, and so critical to clinical and political discourse around health, that it is imperative that its vital role in health, health-related behaviours and illness be recognised and assimilated into medical, social and political consciousness and practice.

However, there are many questions that yet remain unanswered, and so we will conclude with a proposal for a research agenda that aims to extend the state of knowledge, focusing on clarifying the nature of the burden, the populations affected and on the development and assessment of potential strategies aimed at mitigating problematic shame. The research agenda would address the following six broad aims:
Identify the determinants and indicators of shame and their practical implications for health policy.
Build on the limited research that outlines the responses of individuals to acute shame, identifying perceptual, disease specific, medical, cultural, institutional and sociopolitical factors that mediate reactions and outcomes.
Quantitatively and qualitatively assess the burden from stigma and acute shame associated with various health problems, both in terms of nature and magnitude.
Explore shame associated with different health problems and in different settings. It is important to determine whether and how shame-proneness for the same issue varies across the multiple sites identified by Viney et al.
Analyse the role of chronic shame in a variety of health and social environments, and its relationship with suffering and illness in response to acute episodes.
Improve knowledge about the functional impact of shaming, and the risk of furthering health problems through health policy and legislation that inadvertently or consciously promotes stigma and shame. Social policy needs to be informed by research, rather than being influenced by stereotype and prejudice.

Shame is an important subject for public health, and the health of the public. It merits serious assessment and discussion. It contributes to suffering, impairs health, interferes with health relationships and impacts on service provision. Emotion is important in social life, and while the social sciences and other disciplines have taken an 'affective turn', shame remains the elephant in the clinical room.

### Are improvements in shame and self-compassion early in eating disorders treatment associated with better patient outcomes? [^111qU9W3]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Compassion-focused therapy (CFT; Gilbert, 2005, 2009) is a transdiagnostic treatment approach focused on building self-compassion and reducing shame. It is based on the theory that feelings of shame contribute to the maintenance of psychopathology, whereas self-compassion contributes to the alleviation of shame and psychopathology. We sought to test this theory in a transdiagnostic sample of eating disorder patients by examining whether larger improvements in shame and self-compassion early in treatment would facilitate faster eating disorder symptom remission over 12 weeks. Participants were 97 patients with an eating disorder admitted to specialized day hospital or inpatient treatment. They completed the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire, Experiences of Shame Scale, and Self-Compassion Scale at intake, and again after weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Multilevel modeling revealed that patients who experienced greater decreases in their level of shame in the first 4 weeks of treatment had faster decreases in their eating disorder symptoms over 12 weeks of treatment. In addition, patients who had greater increases in their level of self-compassion early in treatment had faster decreases in their feelings of shame over 12 weeks, even when controlling for their early change in eating disorder symptoms. These results suggest that CFT theory may help to explain the maintenance of eating disorders. Clinically, findings suggest that intervening with shame early in treatment, perhaps by building patients' self-compassion, may promote better eating disorders treatment response.

### Health-related shame: an affective determinant of health? [^1123rgvK]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

Despite shame being recognised as a powerful force in the clinical encounter, it is underacknowledged, under-researched and undertheorised in the contexts of health and medicine. In this paper we make two claims. The first is that emotional or affective states, in particular shame, can have a significant impact on health, illness and health-related behaviours. We outline four possible processes through which this might occur: (1) acute shame avoidance behaviour; (2) chronic shame health-related behaviours; (3) stigma and social status threat and (4) biological mechanisms. Second, we postulate that shame's influence is so insidious, pervasive and pernicious, and so critical to clinical and political discourse around health, that it is imperative that its vital role in health, health-related behaviours and illness be recognised and assimilated into medical, social and political consciousness and practice. In essence, we argue that its impact is sufficiently powerful for it to be considered an affective determinant of health, and provide three justifications for this. We conclude with a proposal for a research agenda that aims to extend the state of knowledge of health-related shame.

### Obsessive-compulsive disorders and dermatologic disease [^111GWCPW]. Dermatologic Clinics (2005). Low credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders are often associated with dermatologic manifestations. The phenomenology is discussed and possible animal models explored. Treatment involves both pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy. Many of these patients experience considerable shame over their behavior and may be reluctant to acknowledge the existence of a psychiatric disorder. The dermatologist's approach to this patient is discussed.

### Serotonin depletion amplifies distinct human social emotions as a function of individual differences in personality [^112qeZfF]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Empathy was of central importance to our analysis. This was motivated by the observation that social behaviour in highly empathic participants was especially sensitive to single-dose SSRI administration: these individuals showed the greatest reduction in retaliatory behaviour to unfairness. Critically, we found that individuals high in trait empathy had a distinct profile of enhanced emotion: guilt was amplified. Empathy and guilt are consistently correlated, and guilt may even promote empathy. Feelings of guilt have been associated with real-life altruistic acts. Guilt has been proposed to restrain antisocial behaviour as modelled by laboratory tests: a diminished sense of guilt is thought to contribute to dysfunctional social behaviour following vmPFC damage, and is also a feature of psychopathy. The present observation that increased guilt in the highly empathic under ATD was driven by instances of unintentionally inflicting harm in a social setting is entirely consistent with these accounts.

Shame, furthermore, was highly correlated with empathy. This was true in both the placebo and depletion conditions, which could have led to a ceiling effect, leaving less room for further enhancement of shame by ATD in the highly empathic, on top of an already elevated baseline under placebo. Guilt and shame, moreover, clustered together in the PCA when the victim of harm, and this component was enhanced by serotonin depletion regardless of personality traits. Guilt and shame are distinguishable yet can overlap, which is also true of their neural correlates. While guilt and shame were correlated, the literature indicates that different events can be guilt-inducing or shame-inducing for different people. That different types of emotion were enhanced in tandem at the group level, furthermore, does not imply the quality of these emotions cannot be distinguished by the person experiencing them.

### Health-related shame: an affective determinant of health? [^115TPgyx]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

While shame signals a significant social threat, it also creates a bind for the person experiencing it, as revealing that one is experiencing shame is itself shameful. As a result, shame symptoms provoke a shame spiral or 'loop', in which, when shame arises it incites more shame. Shame, thus, is an iterated emotion; its occurrence leads to an intensification or multiplication of itself. Consequently, shame is an emotion that is usually fastidiously avoided (both individually and collectively) and if that is not possible, it is scrupulously ignored. Individuals go out of their way to avoid shame (or even mention past instances of shame), even when this avoidance means harming or hurting the self.

Beyond remaining silent or being scrupulously circumvented, shame is often an 'unidentified' or 'hidden' emotion which does not enter conscious awareness but is nonetheless frequently present. Although the experience remains available to consciousness, the person experiencing it is not able to, or perhaps simply will not, identify it as shame, and there is an intrinsic connection between shame and the mechanism of denial. In these cases, shame is 'by-passed' and other affects, such as anger, guilt, depression, doubt or excessive displays of pride through narcissism, take over. It is well theorised that when shame occurs, or even when it is merely anticipated, powerful 'scripts', or 'basic patterns of behaviour that govern our reactions' to it, are activated. While some of these scripts allow the shame experience to manifest, others use denial or bypassing as coping mechanisms. Nathansondescribes four basic shame scripts: shameful withdrawal, masochistic submission, narcissistic avoidance of shame and the rage of wounded pride. Through this schema of reaction patterns, a wide range of behavioural forms emerge that help one cope with the perceived threats to one's social bonds and one's identity that shame experiences, no matter how mild or intense, provoke.

### Shame and the vulnerable self in medical contexts: the compassionate solution [^111DmSYM]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

Shame is a powerful experience that plays a vital role in a whole range of aspects of the clinical encounter. Shame experiences can have an impact on our psychological and physiological state and on how we experience ourselves, others and our relationships. The medical encounter is an obvious arena for shame because we are presenting (aspects of) our bodies and minds that can be seen as unattractive and undesirable, diseased, decayed and injured with the various excretions that typically might invite disgust. In contrast, experiences of compassion of acceptance, validation and kindness and can increase approach, openness and preparedness to engage with painful difficult scenarios. While shame is an experience that separates, segregates, marginalises and disengages people, caring and compassion facilitate integration, (re)connection and support. Given the potential opposite impacts of these different types of social experience, this paper will outline their evolutionary origins and compare and contrast them with particular reference to the medical context.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^111x5Vss]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

It is intriguing to speculate that the pharmacological properties of MDMA, when combined with therapy, may produce a 'window of tolerance', in which participants are able to revisit and process traumatic content without becoming overwhelmed or encumbered by hyperarousal and dissociative symptoms. MDMA-assisted therapy may facilitate recall of negative or threatening memories with greater self-compassionand less PTSD-related shame and anger. Additionally, the acute prosocial and interpersonal effects of MDMA, may support the quality of the therapeutic alliance, a potentially important factor relating to PTSD treatment adherenceand outcome. Indeed, clinicians have suggested that "MDMA may catalyze therapeutic processing by allowing patients to stay emotionally engaged while revisiting traumatic experiences without becoming overwhelmed".

Given that PTSD is a strong predictor of disability in both veteran and community populations, it is promising to note that the robust reduction in PTSD and depressive symptoms identified here is complemented by a significant improvement in SDS score (for example, work and/or school, social and family functioning). Approximately 4.7 million US veterans report a service-related disability, costing the US government approximately $73 billion per year. Identification of a PTSD treatment that could improve social and family functioning and ameliorate impairment across a broad range of environmental contexts could provide major medical cost savings, in addition to improving the quality of life for veterans and others affected by this disorder.

### Health-related shame: an affective determinant of health? [^115Uofso]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although, shame has been identified as a powerful force in the clinical encounter, and the experience of illness, curiously it remains both undertheorised and commonly unacknowledged in the contexts of health and medicine. As Darby et al note, despite shame's 'frequent occurrence' within healthcare settings, there is 'a surprising lack of research' examining the effect of shame and other negative self-conscious emotions. Commenting on this apparent mismatch of clinical importance and medical disinterest, Davidoffdubbed shame the 'elephant in the room' in healthcare contexts. However, other disciplines (notably psychology, philosophy and the social sciences) have been less reticent in engaging in a more rigorous analysis of the causes and consequences of shame. Emerging literatures in these disciplines highlight that shame is often significant when considering an individual's health status.

Our aim in this paper is twofold. First, we propose to use insights from the aforementioned emerging literatures, and from the empirical work of others, to further the claim that emotional or affective states, in particular shame, can have an impact on health, illness and health-related behaviours. In so doing, we will contend that body or disease-related shame contributes to the burden of illness, and that shame may itself be a direct cause of ill-health. In order to underpin this claim, we will outline a number of processes or mechanisms through which shame may act on the health of individuals. We schematise these as follows: (1) acute shame avoidance behaviour; (2) chronic shame health-related behaviours; (3) stigma and social status threat and (4) biological mechanisms. These headings are simple descriptors and are not intended to convey the impression that they refer to stand-alone entities. Rather, all are substantially interlinked but have been individuated here in order to provide conceptual clarity.

### Rapid or immediate ART, HIV stigma, medical mistrust, and retention in care: an exploratory mixed methods pilot study [^112X7tqj]. AIDS and Behavior (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first mixed-methods study to explore the impact of iART on the important psychosocial constructs of stigma and medical trust/mistrust, as well as longitudinal HIV care engagement. This builds on recent studies examining barriers to and facilitators of rapid ART to further explore the impact of iART on newly diagnosed PWH.

This study demonstrates the importance of a mixed-methods approach. Electronic medical chart review is often inadequate in capturing important demographic variables when considering HIV care inequities and capturing the complex process from diagnosis to linkage to ongoing care. Our approach allowed us to triangulate our data to have the most accurate understanding of each participant's case. Furthermore, we contextualized our quantitative measures of levels of stigma and mistrust with qualitative data that illuminated the longitudinal psychosocial processes that occurred after ART initiation.

This study also begins to characterize HIV care trajectories based on timing of ART initiation. It illuminates the consequential role of HIV-related stigma for newly diagnosed PWH. For the group that started ART same-day or within 72 h, iART appeared to mitigate the development of anticipated or enacted stigma, and community stigma. Significant advancements in the effectiveness of ART empowered participants to feel they could avoid future stigmatizing experiences if they started ART immediately. Because this did not necessarily lead to greater mean visit adherence than other groups, other mediators or systemic factors were likely at play when it came to long-term HIV care engagement for this group.

For the 4–30 day group, iART helped alleviate internalized HIV stigma. Participants coming in feeling shame about their diagnosis were able to process their emotions through starting iART, providing an opportunity for coping with and reducing the internalized HIV stigma built up over time. This group also had the highest visit adherence, possibly suggesting that the active alleviation of these feelings made this group more comfortable keeping their appointments. Future iART implementation may include a stigma intervention along with other social determinants of health that are part of the iART package (e.g. housing, insurance).

### Health-related shame: an affective determinant of health? [^112yGjHZ]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

In order for an individual to cope with chronic shame, it is frequently bypassed for other experiences and powerful shame 'scripts' take effect as a protective measure in order to bypass or avoid the direct experience of shame which may itself be too painful or psychologically damaging. Through engaging in avoidance strategies, it has been demonstrated that chronic shame is directly implicated in a wide range of health relevant behaviours. There is a growing body of work that implicates chronic shame with risk behaviours such as alcoholism, addictionand eating disorders, conditions all of which act to 'numb' an individual against the pain of shame. Furthermore, avoidance scripts that bypass shame in favour of narcissism or rage responses have been shown to lead to antisocial behaviour such as violence, bullying and sexual assault. At the same time, withdrawal and avoidance scripts mean that chronic shame commonly leads to states such as stress and anxietyor depression, where an individual may not even be aware that they are experiencing shame and instead report other emotional troubles or psychopathological symptoms. As such, chronic shame is clearly linked to behaviours and psychological states that have a direct negative impact on health.

Of course, those burdened with chronic shame can experience episodes of acute shame. It seems reasonable to suggest that chronic shame may lead to an increased sensitivity to acute episodes — for example, a woman suffering chronic shame as a consequence of childhood sexual abuse might well experience a routine gynaecological examination as more traumatic or exposing than another woman who does not share a history of abuse. It does seem possible that chronic shame might expand the range of possible sources of acute shame, or even the depth or magnitude of shame experienced. However, the hypothesis that acute on chronic shame may be qualitatively or quantitatively different to acute shame arising de novo has not been particularly well examined to date, and thus remains a relatively unsupported theoretical consideration.

### A randomized controlled feasibility trial of online compassion-focused self-help for psoriasis [^114Ekkun]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

People with psoriasis can experience psychological distress that might be amenable to psychosocial self‐help.

Objectives

This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of two theoretically developed self‐help interventions designed to reduce feelings of shame and improve quality of life.

Methods

A randomized controlled feasibility trial was conducted comprising 130 participants with psoriasis who were randomly allocated to receive either compassion‐based self‐help (n = 65) or mindfulness‐based self‐help (n = 65), over a 4‐week period. Both interventions were provided online.

Results

The interventions were found to be acceptable, with over 70% of study completers reporting that they found the materials helpful. Of the 130 participants, 92 completed the study, with attrition at 29%. Both interventions showed modest yet statistically significant reductions in shame (Cohen's d = 0.20) and improvements in quality of life (Cohen's d = 0.40).

Conclusions

Self‐help based on compassion and mindfulness is acceptable to users, and can reduce feelings of shame and improve quality of life for people living with psoriasis.

What is already known about this topic?
Psoriasis can be associated with psychological distress.
Various forms of psychological intervention have been tested; however, few compassion based interventions have been developed or trialled.

What does this study add?
This study demonstrates that compassion‐based self‐help is acceptable to people with psoriasis.
This study provides provisional evidence of effectiveness of compassion based self‐help in reducing feelings of shame and improving quality of life for people living with psoriasis.

### Conceptualization and assessment of shame experience and regulation: an umbrella review of synthesis studies [^111h7KiV]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Other studies included in this review had different goals in relation to shame, such as the association between shame and dissociation [1]; associations among shame, guilt and self‐harm [2]; and the link between shame and psychosis continuum [12]. Shame was positively associated with all three of these constructs. One study provided support for the hypothesis that there is a correlation between shame and self‐esteem [13]; furthermore, one study reported associations between shame and obsessive–compulsive disorder symptoms [14]. Associations were found between shame and postnatal symptoms. In particular, one study argued that shame was associated with stress and depression in mothers and with stress, depression and anxiety in fathers [11]. Shame did not seem to be consistently linked to substance use, but among substance users, shame was related to greater substance‐related difficulties [16]. One study aimed to review self‐report measures of generalized shame [4] such as scenario‐based and experience‐based shame, suggesting that scenario‐based measures may be less ecologically valid to life events than experience‐based measures. Two studies have dealt, in different ways, with interventions that can reduce and address problems related to shame. In particular, it has been found that evidence‐based interventions can reduce shame [8] and 33 out of 37 studies have documented the reduction of shame post‐intervention. It has also emerged that mindfulness‐based and third wave cognitive–behavioural interventions can be beneficial in supporting individuals with shame problems and can have a positive impact on people's quality of life [7]. All main findings are summarized in Table 1.

### Evaluation and treatment of enuresis [^115zowSg]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Enuresis is defined as repeated, spontaneous voiding of urine during sleep in a child five years or older. It affects 5 to 7 million children in the United States. Primary nocturnal enuresis is caused by a disparity between bladder capacity and nocturnal urine production and failure of the child to awaken in response to a full bladder. Less commonly, enuresis is secondary to a medical, psychological, or behavioral problem. A diagnosis usually can be made with a history focusing on enuresis and a physical examination followed by urinalysis. Imaging and urodynamic studies generally are not needed unless specifically indicated (e.g., to exclude suspected neurologic or urologic disease). Primary nocturnal enuresis almost always resolves spontaneously over time. Treatment should be delayed until the child is able and willing to adhere to the treatment program; medications are rarely indicated in children younger than seven years. If the condition is not distressing to the child, treatment is not needed. However, parents should be reassured about their child's physical and emotional health and counseled about eliminating guilt, shame, and punishment. Enuresis alarms are effective in children with primary nocturnal enuresis and should be considered for older, motivated children from cooperative families when behavioral measures are unsuccessful. Desmopressin is most effective in children with nocturnal polyuria and normal bladder capacity. Patients respond to desmopressin more quickly than to alarm systems. Combined treatment is effective for resistant cases.

### Shame, stigma, HIV: philosophical reflections [^112pZMSn]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

Insisting it must be one or the other has consequences: if one holds that shame is always autonomous, then that will lead one to focus any attempt to alleviate shame solely on the psychology of the individuals who bear shame. Conversely, if one were to assume that shame is always heteronomous, then that will lead one to identify that which is in need of change as being the social norms of which the honour group (the shame-instantiating audience) are an embodiment. In this latter, heteronomous sense, addressing shame might be a political, cultural and social task, in addition to being a psychological task. This is our fourth gain.

4. We propose that addressing and treating shame can be, and often is, a political, cultural and psychological task.

### The contribution of shame to eating disorder treatment outcomes in a community mental health clinic [^114u9BAb]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Shame is a powerful self-conscious emotion that is often experienced by individuals with eating disorders (EDs). While the association between EDs and shame is well-established, there is limited research investigating the contribution of pre-treatment shame to clinical outcomes.

Method

Participants (N = 273) received outpatient cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED). We investigated pre-treatment shame as a predictor of dropout and as a moderator of change in ED psychopathology and clinical impairment from pre-treatment to post-treatment. We also explored the potentially moderating roles of body mass index, ED diagnostic category, and co-occurring anxiety and depression diagnoses.

Results

Shame improved substantially (d = 1.28) despite not being explicitly targeted in treatment. Pre-treatment shame did not predict treatment dropout. Individuals high in shame started and ended treatment with higher ED symptoms and impairment than those with low shame. The contribution of pre-treatment shame on the degree of change in symptoms/impairment depended critically on whether analyses controlled for pre-treatment symptoms/impairment. When those were controlled, high pre-treatment shame was associated with substantially less improvement in ED symptoms and impairment. There was some evidence that ED diagnosis and co-occurring depressive diagnoses may moderate the relationship between shame and treatment outcome. Changes in shame were positively associated with changes in ED symptoms and clinical impairment.

Discussion

A high level of shame at pre-treatment is not a contraindication for CBT-ED as good therapeutic outcomes can be achieved. However, outcomes may be enhanced among individuals high in shame by offering adjunctive interventions that explicitly target shame.

### Shame, stigma, HIV: philosophical reflections [^114cUShH]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

We have identified five ways in which shame might negatively impact upon attempts to combat and treat HIV, which emerge from the stigma HIV carries and STI-stigma in general.
Shame can prevent an individual from disclosing all the relevant facts about their sexual history to the clinician.
Shame can serve as a barrier to engaging with or being retained in care.
Shame can prevent individuals presenting at clinics for STI and HIV testing.
Shame can prevent an individual from disclosing their HIV (or STI) status to new sexual partners.
Shame makes people want to hide and withdraw from the world and others, it therefore makes the task of living with HIV a far more negative experience than it should, or needs to, be.

In concluding this paper, and by way of example, we will focus on No. 2. We will propose that our four insights, gained from philosophical work on emotions and shame, provide guidance for future study of the negative role shame might play for a person living with HIV engaging with or being retained in care.

### Shame, pride and eating disorders [^117C9AMq]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

This paper explores shame and shame-based responses in eating disorders. Research linking shame with eating disorders and the possible role of shame and pride in the onset and maintenance of eating disorders is reviewed. The experience of shame is likely to be complex, dynamic and variable. However, the key to identifying shame is often via the various coping strategies adopted, which in turn may form part of a maintenance cycle for eating disorder beliefs and behaviours. An outline model of shame and pride cycles in the maintenance of eating disorders is presented with clinical implications.

### Shame in anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders [^11235d6d]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Studies on the relations between shame and anxiety and obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) are reviewed, with a focus on recent work.

Recent Findings

Medium-sized positive correlations have been consistently found across anxiety disorders and OCRDs, suggesting that this relation is transdiagnostic. Most studies focused on shame-proneness and found similar relations across multiple types (e.g. internal, external) and domains (e.g. bodily, characterological, behavioural) of shame, with little variation between clinical and non-clinical populations and different age categories. However, most studies are cross-sectional and correlational and by separately studying clinical and non-clinical populations, they do not give a unitary dimensional view of the relation between shame and symptoms. Emerging findings suggest that shame may be a marker of the response to treatment in these disorders, and its relation with symptoms may be bidirectional. The consistent but medium-sized associations between shame and symptoms of anxiety and OCRDs warrant the future search for mediators and moderators.

### Attitudes toward long-term use of antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected pregnant women in moshi, tanzania: a longitudinal study [^114bWwz2]. AIDS and Behavior (2019). Medium credibility.

Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy and the postpartum period is necessary to prevent vertical HIV transmission and to secure the long-term health of an HIV-infected woman. Health behavior theory suggests that patients' attitudes towards medication can predict their medication-taking behaviour. This study sought to understand how women's attitudes towards ART changes between the pregnancy and postpartum periods, and the factors associated with these attitudes. The study enrolled 200 pregnant women living with HIV. Structured surveys were administered during pregnancy and at three and 6 months postpartum. Overall, attitudes towards ART were stable over time. More positive attitudes towards ART were associated with HIV acceptance, lower levels of depression, and lower levels of shame. Counselling interventions are needed to help HIV-infected women accept their status and reduce shameful emotions. Depression screening and treatment should be integrated into PMTCT services. This study emphasizes the importance of early attention to attitudes towards ART, in order to establish a trajectory of sustained care engagement.

### Temperamental contributions to the affect family of anxiety [^113B1ZfA]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The discovery of pharmacologic interventions that mute the intensity of anxiety and guilt in some individuals has been a benevolent gift to those who suffer from these disabling states. Although some commentators have wondered about the social consequences of large numbers of asymptomatic persons taking these drugs, few have questioned the advantages for the smaller group of anguished patients. It is likely, however, that, during the next century, scientists will discover a drug that eliminates the feeling components of guilt and remorse while leaving intact the semantic knowledge that certain acts are ethically improper. An individual who took this drug regularly would continue to know that deceiving a friend, lying to a client, and stealing from an employer are morally wrong but would be protected from the uncomfortable feeling of guilt or remorse that accompanies a violation of a personal moral standard. It is reasonable to wonder, therefore, whether our society would be changed in a major way if many citizens were protected from guilt and remorse. Most Western philosophers, especially Kant, made reason the bedrock of conscience. People acted properly, Kant believed, because they knew that the behavior was morally right. All individuals wish to regard the self as virtuous and try to avoid the uncertainty that follows detection of the inconsistency that is created when they behave in ways that are not in accord with their view of the self's desirable attributes. Kant believed that, although the moral emotions restrain asocial acts, they were not necessary for the conduct of a moral life. On the other hand, some philosophers, such as Peirce and Dewey, argued that anticipation of anxiety, shame, and guilt motivate a continued loyalty to one's ethical standards. A person who was certain that he or she was protected from these uncomfortable emotions would find it easier to ignore the moral imperatives acquired during childhood and adolescence. It is not obvious that a drug that blocks remorse also will eliminate the mutual social obligations that make a society habitable; nonetheless, a posture of vigilance that is appropriate for — unlike gorillas — humans can hold representations of envy, anger, and dislike toward people they have never met for a very long time. While we wait for future inquiry to resolve this issue, it is useful to acknowledge that a satisfying analysis of this problem will require a deeper appreciation of the differences between the representations of the biological events that are the foundation of an emotion and the representations that define the semantic networks for the concepts good and bad.

How to create therapeutic relationships free of shame.

Working with people who are experiencing homelessness is challenging because of the negative experiences they have repeatedly suffered in their lives. We must meet them where they are, realise our work is not about 'saving' them (the modern remnant of a colonial mentality), and recognise their autonomy, authority, and power in the patient–practitioner relationship. To successfully provide care to homeless and other vulnerable populations, we must understand the power structures in which we all live and work. Shameless medicine places patients' values and agency squarely within the clinical dialogues of medical care.

Why shameless medicine? Our job as clinicians is to understand patients' values and keep health challenges from getting in the way of those values. We must also build a caring relationship free of shame. Whatever patients do — use drugs, eat fast food or engage in prostitution — should not hurt that relationship. Our objective is to figure out how to make the system of healthcare work better for them.

Unlike many of the other relationships in homeless patients' lives, the partnership between physician and patient must establish an environment in which patients cannot fail. You must first establish ground rules: 'My role is to be the best doctor I can be, and this means always being the doctor you need'. Note that the needs of the patients should not conflict with our efforts to be the best doctors we can be. Agree to disagree with patients, if necessary, but focus on the positive: 'Are there behaviours that could help you feel better?'

The idea is to help patients realise they can succeed by working with us. Consider everything they try a success. When something does go wrong, that is not their fault — we hold our patients' shame at the same time we advocate, facilitate and help them do what they can to feel better.

### Shame, stigma, HIV: philosophical reflections [^112ym8Fn]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

It is a distinctive feature of HIV that its pathology cannot be adequately grasped separate from a number of psychosocial factors, and stigma is widely seen as the most prominent. We argue that it is equally important to have an adequate understanding of shame, as the emotional response to stigma. We have identified five ways shame might negatively impact upon attempts to combat and treat HIV, which emerge from the stigma HIV carries and STI-stigma in general. In this paper, we draw out four insights from philosophical work on emotions and shame which we propose will improve understanding of shame and stigma. We conclude by briefly discussing how these insights might shed light on the negative role shame can play for a person living with HIV engaging with, or being retained in, care. We conclude by proposing further study.

### "There is a lot of shame that comes with this": a qualitative study of patient experiences of isolation, embarrassment, and stigma associated with overactive bladder [^1164Cd4c]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Beyond causing physical discomfort, overactive bladder (OAB) is distressing to patients across a variety of psychosocial domains. In this qualitative component of a larger mixed methods study, we explore patients' lived experience with OAB to understand how this condition impacts individuals on a personal and social level, as well as their experiences interacting with the health care system.

Methods

A total of 20 patients and 12 physicians completed a questionnaire and semi-structured interview. The interview guide, developed in an iterative fashion by the authors, included questions about treatment decision making as well as experiences living with or treating OAB; this manuscript focuses on the questions probing lived experiences and interactions between patients and physicians. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and inductively coded and analyzed according to the principles of interpretive description to develop themes.

Results

Analysis of patient and physician interviews yielded five key themes: isolation due to OAB diagnosis, social stigma associated with noticeable OAB symptoms, embarrassment from interactions with the health care system, feeling invalidated and dismissed by physicians, and OAB patients as a "vulnerable" population with "desperation" for cure.

Conclusions

OAB causes patients marked distress beyond their physical symptoms; it causes feelings of isolation from friends and family and makes them feel embarrassed to discuss their condition with loved ones and physicians alike. Efforts to destigmatize OAB, validate patient experiences, and improve access to OAB care may help diminish the psychosocial burden of OAB.

### Hot and cold cognitive disturbances in antidepressant-free patients with major depressive disorder: a neuroPharm study [^115fiM91]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Social cognition

Feelings of excessive shame and guilt are common in MDD and critically contribute to low self-esteem and social withdrawal (Mills et al.). In the most severe cases they can even reach the threshold of psychosis (Lake). In particular contextual-maladaptive guilt (i.e. exaggerated guilt related to uncontrollable events) and generalised guilt (i.e.g.uilt divorced from concrete contexts) as well as external shame (i.e. shame based on beliefs about other people's opinions) are strongly associated with depressive symptoms (Kim, Thibodeau, & Jorgensen). Notably, in the ME task we observed most group differences between the depressed patients and the healthy controls in moral scenarios where the participants were asked to identify with the victim of harm (see Table 2). In fact, the level of shame and guilt reported by the patients appeared most pronounced when they were the victim of intentional rather than accidental harm, likely reflecting a disengaging of other-blaming schemata in favour of maladaptive self-blaming and internalising schemata. Clearly, this represents a critical target to address in psychotherapy, e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

Table 2.
Group differences between depressed patients and healthy controls on secondary cognitive outcomes

Recent evidence suggests that ToM, i.e. the ability to attribute mental states to other people, is impaired in MDD and linked to depressive symptom severity (Bora & Berk). While we did not have a direct measure ToM in the present study, the SIP task indexes the preference for choosing social information (thoughts or facial expression) over non-social information (facts) when interpreting socially ambiguous situations. We did not observe any differences between patients and healthy controls, suggesting that it is not a lack of attention towards or a preference away from social information that is causing the reported ToM deficits in MDD. This aligns with reports that dysphoria is associated with slightly increased sensitivity to social cues required for ToM (Harkness, Sabbagh, Jacobson, Chowdrey, & Chen). Our depressed patients did not exhibit negative bias in the interpretation of social situations. We speculate that this may partially be related to the task design; in several scenarios the negative interpretation had paranoid components (e.g. believing a colleague is poisoning a cup of tea) and might be too extreme to capture the more subtle negative biases in MDD.

### Conceptualization and assessment of shame experience and regulation: an umbrella review of synthesis studies [^1131LPCN]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Elison et al. examined Nathanson's model in correspondence to evolutionary‐based fight‐or‐flight responses, stressing the transdiagnostic relevance of maladaptive shame coping for various forms of psychopathology spanning internalizing and externalizing spectra. Notably, the four shame‐coping strategies described above are also used in an anticipatory fashion, to avoid the potential experience of shame; these kinds of preventive strategies are not strongly linked to shame‐proneness but rather to shame aversion (Elison et al.). Schoenleber and Berenbaum described various forms of preventive coping strategies for shame: achievement sabotage, dependence, fantasy, perfectionism and interpersonal avoidance. Achievement sabotage is the attitude to compromise one's performance as in, for example, the procrastination process that can help to avoid the possibility of shame by postponing actions further and further in time. Dependence consists of delegating one's duties to another person to avoid the onset of shame that could have been caused by one's actions. Through fantasy, people can portray themselves as having attractive characteristics that can lead them to desired consequences, shifting attention away from the shortcomings they actually think they have. Perfectionism entails aiming for unrealistic levels of results; individuals engaging in self‐promotion, non‐disclosure and/or non‐exposure will try to find a means of mitigating the anticipated psychological distress associated with the exposure of personal imperfections. Finally, interpersonal avoidance refers to behaviours aimed at avoiding social interactions that could prove to be a source of shame, somewhat akin to Nathanson's withdrawal, but enacted before a potentially shameful situation rather than after a shame‐eliciting situation.

### On shame and voice-hearing [^117ANtXe]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

One of the most widely cited definitions of shame comes from Michael Lewis'book Shame: The Exposed Self. Shame, he writes, is 'the feeling we have when we evaluate our actions, feelings, or behaviour, and conclude that we have done wrong. It encompasses the whole of our selves; it generates a wish to hide, to disappear, or even to die'. Alongside guilt, embarrassment and humiliation, shame has been historicallyand cross-culturallyunderstood as a negative emotion, although one that can serve positive social functions. It is distinguished from so-called basic emotionssuch as anger and fear by virtue of its structural complexity: shame is a self-conscious emotion, which requires, or at least implies, a high-order awareness of the self; indeed, it reveals, in Lewis'formulation, 'a self exposed to itself'. In this sense, shame is a self-reflective emotion but it is also considered a social one: as well as depending, in a basic sense, on a sophisticated awareness of others' mental states, the sense of exposure, which, for many, is at the core of shame strongly implies the presence of an interlocutor, whether in the form of specific individuals or society and social norms more broadly. If feelings of guilt often prompt us to seek out others for the purposes of atonement, absolution or reparation, shame by contrast has 'self-oriented action tendencies', meaning that it typically results in social withdrawal or retreat. While guilt and shame may share the same stimuli and even co-occur, feelings of guilt pertain to specific actions, behaviours, thoughts or responses, whereas in shame, the entire self, the core of one's subjectivity and identity, is felt to be devalued, diminished or otherwise degraded. Shame's effects, therefore, can be potentially devastating:

### Barriers to treatment and service utilization in an internet sample of individuals with obsessive-compulsive symptoms [^114CvRax]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the increasing dissemination of treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in the past decade, the majority of individuals with OCD are not receiving appropriate treatment. This study examined rates of treatment utilization and barriers to treatment in an internet sample of individuals with self-reported OCD.

Methods

One hundred and seventy-five participants completed an online survey examining OCD symptoms, psychosocial measures, barriers to treatment, and treatment utilization.

Results

Sixty percent of the sample reported receiving treatment for their OCD symptoms. The majority of participants who sought pharmacotherapy received SSRIs, whereas the majority who sought psychotherapeutic treatment received "talk therapy". The cost of treatment, lack of insurance coverage, shame, and doubt that treatment would be effective were the most commonly endorsed barriers to treatment among the sample.

Conclusions

Findings demonstrated relatively low treatment utilization rates among the sample, with many participants receiving treatments other than the gold-standard medication and psychotherapy treatments (i.e. SSRIs and cognitive behavioral therapy, respectively). Furthermore, a large portion of the sample endorsed many barriers to treatment seeking, such as logistic and financial barriers; stigma, shame, and discrimination barriers; and treatment perception and satisfaction barriers. This study highlights the need for more effective treatment dissemination in OCD.

### Health-related shame: an affective determinant of health? [^113yrEF1]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

Shame

Shame is regarded as being a negative emotion that arises when one is seen and judged by others (whether they are present, possible or imagined) to be flawed in some crucial way, or when some part of one's self is perceived to be inadequate, inappropriate or immoral. It is what is called a self-conscious emotion in that the object of shame is oneself and, furthermore, it involves an awareness of how other people view the self. Shame experiences are varied and multiple in their expression. As a result, 'shame' is often used as an umbrella term to indicate a whole 'family of emotions' ranging from 'the mildest twinge of embarrassment to the searing pain of mortification'. Hence, shame variants include a wide array of negative self-conscious experiences such as embarrassment, humiliation, chagrin, mortification, feelings of defectiveness or low self-worth. The intensity and expression of a shame experience depends on an extensive constellation of factors including one's culture, background, family experiences, personality and the immediate context. In general, shame is distinguished from guilt by a focus on the person rather than the act. Guilt arises where one feels bad about an action or something that one has done, shame is about the person that one is.

It is argued that because shame is linked to one's core identity, it is among the most powerful and significant affective experiences. In a moment of shame, one feels flawed or inferior, and feels as though others can see this also. As a result, shame is not just linked to threats to one's identity, but, significantly, it is linked to threats to social bonds. Shame can threaten one's feelings of belonging and acceptance within interpersonal contextsand socially and politically. Shame, as a result, is an alienating and isolating experience that is far from trivial, often deeply disturbing and a cause of significant distress. As Gehert Piers notes, 'behind the feeling of shame stands [the] fear of abandonment, the death by emotional starvation'. Northropechoes this claim contending that in cases of shame and stigma, 'social death and actual death are imminently convergent'. The threat of shame can feel worse than the threat of physical pain or even the risk of death.

### The experience of shame in older psychiatric patients: a preliminary enquiry [^114iQ1cr]. Aging & Mental Health (2005). Low credibility.

Shame is a complex set of attitudes, feelings and behaviours that tend to motivate hiding and, if provoked, can lead to conflict with others. It is also related to the exercise of power within the relationship of care and therefore may be a relevant factor if older adults are forced to accept increased dependency. There are no systematic enquiries into shame processes and older psychiatric patients. The experience of trait and situational shame and psychopathology was explored with 50 older psychiatric patients, using a range of questionnaire measures. As predicted, trait shame correlated significantly with anxiety and depression scores. There was preliminary evidence to suggest that being in need of others may be shame-provoking for some patients and may have a bearing on why some patients fear dependency, conceal symptoms and have conflicted relationships with carers.

### Lived experiences of people with chronic kidney disease on maintenance dialysis: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies [^115bAEmG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Personal beliefs and misconceptions

Certain personal beliefs and perceptions influenced the way people with CKD experienced their illness and sought treatment. Widespread misconceptions about the causes of kidney failure often led to a reluctance to seek conventional medical treatment, prompting many individuals to turn to traditional remedies and spiritual healers, particularly in the early stages of their illness. Beliefs in supernatural causes, including black magic, were also prevalent among them. It was also reported that people relied more on traditional medicines in order to avoid dialysis. Community members often persuaded them to use traditional remedies, claiming they had successfully cured similar conditions. These misperceptions about the illness and reliance on traditional remedies or spiritual healers often hindered the timely initiation of conventional treatment. This, in turn, resulted in delays in seeking appropriate medical care, negatively affecting their overall experience of the illness.

Feelings of shame and guilt

Feelings of shame and guilt among individuals undergoing dialysis had significant implications for their overall well-being. Self-blame was a common response among participants, attributing their kidney failure to neglecting underlying health conditions like hypertension and diabetes. Participants often expressed regret for the time spent on dialysis, as though they were wasting precious hours. Feelings of self-reproach were commonly observed for using family resources for dialysis, not adequately planning for the future, and feeling like a burden to their loved ones. This emotional burden was so intense that some individuals even contemplated suicide to alleviate the caregiving responsibilities of their family members. Their overwhelming sense of guilt often prevented them from pursuing transplant options, particularly receiving a kidney from family members.

Financial constraints

The economic burden of haemodialysis was a significant challenge for participants, impacting their daily lives and treatment routines, especially in LMICs. Both direct and indirect treatment expenses led to financial hardships, forcing participants to sell assets or take loans to afford medication and dialysis. The additional costs associated with traveling to dialysis centres, such as food, transportation, and lodging, further strained their finances, prompting some to skip their dialysis sessions. Study participants from LMICs often delayed initiation of dialysis and did not enrol for kidney transplants due to cost concerns In one particular study, financial strain of the illness and dialysis led some participants to describe their condition as a 'disease of poverty'.

### Conceptualization and assessment of shame experience and regulation: an umbrella review of synthesis studies [^117NYEJr]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Shame has been defined as the quintessential human emotion (Lewis) and as 'the master emotion of everyday life' (Scheff). Along these lines, Tangney et al. argued that shame is the most painful emotion of everyday life, leading to a sense of uselessness and impotence, as it hinges on evaluation of the deepest self rather than of mere behaviour. However, this description likely reflects the most intense and maladaptive declensions of shame experience; while consideration of milder — conscious or unconscious — forms of shame as well as forms of shame that are adaptive or functional call for more nuanced perspectives (Scheff; Elison et al.). At any rate, shame experience and regulation serve an important role in many aspects of psychological functioning (Schimmenti; Schimmenti and Caretti) and have been associated with several clinical problems (Schoenleber and Berenbaum; Goss and Allan). Different forms of psychopathology have repeatedly been linked to prolonged shame. Interpersonal traumatization and stress are more likely to be experienced when we embrace views of ourselves that are unacceptable; this can lead to depressive paralysis or narcissistic rage (Trumbull). Gaudet et al. found shame to be negatively correlated with psychological well‐being and considered it a risk factor that could lead to interpersonal violence, depression and post‐traumatic stress disorder. Other studies focused on the role of shame in obsessive–compulsive–related disorder and anxiety (Szentágotai‐Tătar et al.) as well as personality disorders characterized by high levels of trait anxiety (Schoenleber and Berenbaum). Further studies reported that shame may play an important role in the aetiology of, maintenance of and recovery from eating disorders (Goss and Allan; Manjrekar et al.). Several scholars have posited that shame may serve as a significant factor in the psychodynamic underpinnings of suicidal behaviour (Breed; Gaudet et al.). Notably, while depression is often considered a primary precursor to suicide, Breed suggested that shame can be a direct catalyst or an indirect consequence of inward‐directed anger. Seminal studies have also linked shame and narcissistic personality disorder. Specifically, Zaslav argued that in grandiose narcissism, individuals defensively deny shame, whereas in vulnerable narcissism, individuals exhibit excessive preoccupation with anticipated negative evaluation, demonstrating heightened sensitivity to perceived criticism or slight. Moral emotions like shame also play a key function in the development and manifestation of aggressive or otherwise antisocial behaviour (Elison et al; Maggi et al; Stuewig and Tangney; Velotti et al.).

### Do not conflate debates on regulating therapeutic use of psychotropic substances with those on the legalization of their non-therapeutic use [^111sPYQn]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic drugs might be marketed without robust evidence because of public pressure, as Andrews et al. emphasize. Premature marketing based on uncertain evidence certainly is problematic. However, the risks from blurring the boundaries between therapeutic and recreational use will persist even with stronger evidence.

One expression of this de‐scientization, which will persist, is the ominous tendency to adopt untested traditional rituals, like shamanistic practices, into therapy, which undermines credibility and risks patient safety. Involving non‐professionals, such as shamans or healers, also compromises the field's credibility. Additionally, public pressure on regulatory authorities can hinder or contradict the search for scientific evidence.

Moreover, the medicalization of recreational use of psychedelics risks bureaucratizing a civil rights issue. Recognizing the consumption of psychedelics as a civil right requires regulation rather than medicalization. Restricting access to the medical framework compromises individual freedom, creating financial and administrative barriers that exclude some people and leading to inequalities in access. Medical bureaucratization would finally also oversimplify psychedelic experiences, neglecting the diversity of individual motivations and cultural contexts. Finally, the scientific support for the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics cannot in itself be an argument for the legalization of non‐therapeutic use.

The current hype is certainly problematic, as emphasized by the authors, but again only to the extent that no distinction is made between the two domains and their two inherent logics. Hyping itself is not necessarily the problem, as long as it serves to dynamize research and does not substitute research with public pressure.

### Effectiveness of treatments for symptoms of post-trauma related guilt, shame and anger in military and civilian populations: a systematic review [^1112ro8z]. BMJ Military Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Individuals who have been exposed to a traumatic event can develop profound feelings of guilt, shame and anger. Yet, studies of treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have largely investigated changes in PTSD symptoms relating to a sense of ongoing fear or threat and the effectiveness of such treatments for post-trauma related guilt, shame or anger symptom reduction is comparatively not well understood.

Methods

This review systematically examined the effectiveness of existing treatment approaches for three symptoms associated with exposure to traumatic events: guilt, shame and anger. Studies included had to be published after 2010 with a sample size of n = 50 or greater to ensure stable treatment outcome estimates.

Results

15 studies were included, consisting of both civilian and (ex-) military population samples exposed to a wide range of traumatic events (eg, combat-related, sexual abuse). Findings indicated a moderate strength of evidence that both cognitive-based and exposure-based treatments are similarly effective in reducing symptoms. Cognitive-based treatments were found to effectively reduce post-trauma related guilt and anger, while exposure-based treatments appeared effective for post-trauma related guilt, shame and anger.

Conclusions

The findings suggest the importance of confronting and discussing the traumatic event during therapy, rather than using less directive treatments (eg, supportive counselling). Nonetheless, while these results are promising, firm conclusions regarding the comparative effectiveness and long-term impact of these treatments could not be drawn due to insufficient evidence. Further empirical research is needed to examine populations exposed to traumatic events and investigate which treatment approaches (or combination thereof) are more effective in the long-term.

### Quality of life and the patient journey in hidradenitis suppurativa [^1115s7Xb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa is a debilitating inflammatory disease with a profound impact on quality of life for affected patients and caregivers. The patient journey in hidradenitis begins with symptom onset and proceeds through diagnosis and treatment. It is fraught with misdiagnosis, lack of awareness, misinformation, and inappropriate treatments that lead to shame, blame, isolation, and medical mistrust. This review highlights the relationship between hidradenitis and quality of life, emphasizing the patient journey and opportunities to improve care along its tortuous course.

### How to discuss errors and adverse events with cancer patients [^11216x1e]. Current Oncology Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Medical error has been increasingly recognized as a source of harm. The risk of harm can be even greater in cancer care with its potentially life-limiting disease and toxic treatments. When errors and adverse events occur, patients have a right to be informed and consistently report a desire to know about events in their care. Disclosure of errors is difficult for physicians for several reasons, including guilt and shame, the fear of litigation, concerns about the impact on the physician-patient relationship, and concerns about the impact on their personal reputation. Despite these difficulties, the experience of disclosure of medical error to date has shown that it can strengthen relationships, reduce litigation and the associated costs, and be beneficial to both the patient and physician. Disclosure can be approached in many of the same ways as any other difficult communication situations, with training and preparation helping to improve the process.

### Medicine's shame problem [^1131VWYs]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Physician mental health is an increasingly discussed topic. Despite the progress made regarding the discussion of physician mental health, these issues remain concerning. In particular, the discussion as to why these issues are so problematic remains limited. Contributors can include bullying, the "hidden curriculum" of medicine, how the medical culture handles errors, and importantly, shame.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the literature on bullying and abuse in medicine, how abuse can exacerbate shame, how the handling of medical errors can exacerbate shame, how shame can negatively affect mental health, and how the medical community and leaders can mitigate these issues.

Discussion

Physician mental health remains an important issue. Job-related stressors, bullying, medicine's hidden curriculum, medical error, traumatic patient encounters, and perfectionism can contribute to physician depression and burnout. Shame may underlie these factors. Shame is a universal emotion that leads to poor self-esteem, depression, eating disorders, abuse, and addiction. However, shame can be addressed and overcome, especially via acknowledgment, vulnerability, and empathy. The medical community can provide some of these techniques by encouraging environments of kindness and respect, giving constructive rather than destructive feedback, providing empathy and support after a medical error, and encouraging mutual learning environments where questions are asked with respect in order to enhance learning. This is opposed to hierarchies and "pimping", where questions are asked with intimidation and disrespect.

Conclusions

Shame is likely a contributor to physician mental health issues. For shame resilience to occur, it must not be kept secret and mutual support should be provided. By addressing the possible causes behind physician mental health concerns, including shame, more solutions can be proposed.

### Acceptability of a randomized trial of anti-depressant medication or interpersonal therapy for treatment of perinatal depression in women with HIV [^114dY5Qb]. AIDS and Behavior (2024). Medium credibility.

Stigma surrounding HIV and mental health

Nearly all participants responded to the question about the presence of stigma present in their communities. Although participants were asked about stigma around mental illness, participants often conflated mental health and HIV-related stigma and seemed more comfortable addressing questions about stigma around HIV.

Social Stigma

Participants reported the existence of stigma in their communities and specifically talked about social stigma, including pervasive stereotypes, discrimination, and public disapproval of mental health conditions. These participants reported that stigma often incited fear, embarrassment, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among affected people in the community.

There are two people in our neighborhood who are [HIV] positive so it's a situation where you don't know who you tell someone not knowing they are not trustworthy then that person goes to tell someone else, and she gets to hear about it even if it's something small. So, it happens that because you have excessive thoughts, all you'll think of is killing yourself and for sure you can kill yourself. (IPT)

"Mmm… the stigma is there. Especially the embarrassment when they discover your status. The stigma is still there. When they've just discovered, just know you're not going to be free. Unless they don't know about your status". (ADM)

"We do hear; 3 quarters of those issues happen. You find that you are having excessive thoughts and there is no one to assist you to get over them. Instead, you find that person making things worse for you. So, in thinking too much, instead of you feeling better, things get worse because of the bad that that person is doing. (ADM)

Self-stigma

In addition to social stigma, an IPT arm participant reported struggling with internalized negative stereotypes, leading to shame and hopelessness, that prevented her from discussing her mental health issues with her family members.

Like uhh… it's very severe. Like a person… can you imagine I was unable to talk to my own siblings. Because I'm worried of what they will say, what they will think, there's a lot of stigma in the compounds. A lot of it. You know it takes a stick of matches to destroy the whole forest. That's how it takes an ignorant person to destroy somebody's concept of things.

### Conceptualization and assessment of shame experience and regulation: an umbrella review of synthesis studies [^112ifzFA]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Against the conceptual and empirical background reviewed above, the aims of the present review were to systematically review conceptualizations and measurements of shame and shame regulation. Specifically, we examined whether the constructs of shame and shame regulation have been defined mostly within a unidimensional or a multidimensional framework, whether methods of operationalizations of shame and shame regulation have been based on unidimensional or multidimensional measures and whether there is consistency within studies on how shame and shame regulation are conceptualized and measured. A further goal of this review was to provide an integrated perspective on consensual definitions of shame experience and regulation, as well as an overview of the measures most commonly used to assess them. Finally, a secondary goal of the review was to provide a meta‐synthesis of the main findings to emerge from the included reviews, with an emphasis on the links that shame and shame regulation have with psychopathology.

### Can psychedelics enhance group psychotherapy? A discussion on the therapeutic factors [^117ADJYP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Interpersonal learning

explains this complex therapeutic factor by dividing it into three main concepts. First, all members must understand the importance of interpersonal relationships for health and well-being. Second, patients should have corrective emotional experiences which disconfirm the pathogenic beliefs arising from negative memories of previous social interactions. Lastly, interpersonal learning experiences will develop into a social microcosm over time, in which group members will continuously become more comfortable with expressing themselves. As this occurs, they will begin to reveal more maladaptive interpersonal behaviour, which can then be addressed accordingly.

During PAGP, psychedelics may augment corrective emotional experiences. A recent clinical study of PAGP in patients with moderate-to-severe demoralization observed a significant reduction in attachment anxiety 3 months after psychedelic intervention. Other PAGP patients also reported overcoming previous emotional boundaries, resulting in new-found feelings of connectedness with other group members and loved ones during and after the psychedelic intervention. During the treatment and integrative therapy, nearly all participants recognized destructive unconscious habits and previously ineffective coping strategies. In semi-structured interviews, they described an augmented capacity to recognize these past patterns, and this awareness made them feel acceptance, forgiveness and relief. They also acquired a more flexible, multidimensional understanding of themselves and new self-narratives, which aided them in their interactions with other group members, as well as with loved ones.

Another study on PAGP also mentions the therapeutic potential of interpersonal learning, whereby processing shame (e.g. from being a victim of sexual abuse) in the group setting seemed more difficult for some participants. Validation from other members was reportedly helpful, and it both reduced the feeling of having a unique struggle and promoted learning experiences. Similarly, interpersonal support can be a powerful amplifier of therapeutic results during PAGP, positively affecting attachment security and giving instant opportunities to act on newly acquired insights, thereby deepening the learning process.found that PAGP can improve patients' psychedelic experiences, particularly during difficult moments in their sessions. These difficult moments may include the emergence of negative memories, strong emotions or changes in beliefs. PAGP provides a supportive community that can help individuals navigate these personal challenges and may also highlight commonalities in their unconscious conflicts and relationship dynamics. In this way, group members may experience both a network of supportive relationships and become a role model themselves.

### Shame, stigma and medicine [^115S7ZYR]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

"Yet even I cannot wholly conquer shame. We live in an atmosphere of shame. We are ashamed of everything that is real about us; ashamed of ourselves, of our relatives, of our incomes, of our accents, of our opinions, of our experience, just as we are ashamed of our naked skins".

The prevalence of shame in the medical clinic was identified by the physician Aaron Lazare around the same time as Nathanson's symposium. Lazare proposed that patients were at a high risk of humiliation and shame as a consequence of their illness, and their physical and psychological exposure in the doctor's office. However, doctors themselves are not immune to shame, and Lazare identified a number of circumstances (most notably medical failure) where clinicians may also be particularly vulnerable. However, with the exception of the field of psychology, little conceptual or empirical work has built on these foundations. One explanation for this deficit may lie in the marginal status emotional reactions have within Western medicine, and a consequent tendency to relegate and classify such responses as an irrational subtext. Danielle Ofri's analysis of the emotional dimension of medical practice argues that contemporary perspectives often reinforce the traditional image of the rational, unwavering doctor resolutely focused on investigation, diagnosis, prognosis, decision-making and treatment. This leaves little scope for exploration of the fear, anxiety, guilt, anger, compassion, empathy or shame that many patients and practitioners may routinely experience. It remains the case that a clinician exposing such an emotional inner self may be thought of as weak, or perhaps even unprofessional, notwithstanding the matter that what doctors feel might well impact on the kind or quality of medical care delivered, not least through the possible counter-humiliation of the patient by the shamed doctor.

### A case for integrating self-compassion interventions targeting shame and self-criticism into eating disorder treatment: commentary on paranjothy and wade [^115z3csL]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Paranjothy and Wade's (2024) meta-analysis revealed that disordered eating was robustly and consistently associated with greater self-criticism and lower self-compassion across samples. It is well known that even evidence-based treatments for eating disorders (EDs) do not produce long-lasting effects for many patients. Additionally, it is unclear whether existing "mainstream" evidence-based ED treatments effectively reduce shame and self-criticism and increase self-compassion, even when they intend to do so. In this commentary, we assert that Paranjothy and Wade's (2024) findings should inform the integration of self-compassion interventions within ED treatment. We argue that shame, a related but distinct construct, should be strongly considered as a primary intervention target in ED interventions that seek to reduce self-criticism and increase self-compassion. We hypothesize that directly addressing shame and bolstering self-compassion at the start of ED treatment may foster higher engagement and more durable effects. We introduce the potential for adjunctive self-compassion interventions to reduce shame and self-criticism, and enhance self-compassion, alongside or within existing ED treatments. Because self-criticism and shame are shared correlates of EDs and commonly co-occurring psychopathology, we contend with the possibility that self-compassion interventions may produce transdiagnostic effects. Shame, self-criticism, and self-compassion are important intervention targets to explore in future research.

### Metabolic, behavioral health, and disordered eating comorbidities associated with obesity in pediatric patients: an obesity medical association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^112pQRxx]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Binge eating disorder (BED) in adolescents — screening, diagnostic criteria, features, and treatment are outlined. Screening instruments include the Adolescent Binge Eating Questionnaire and the Sick, Control, One, Fat, Food (SCOFF) questionnaire, which "have high sensitivity for detecting BED in adolescents". Diagnostic criteria require episodes "occurring at least one time per week for at least three months", and binge episodes are associated with "more than three of the following", including fast paced eating, eating until uncomfortable, eating large amount of food in the absence of hunger, eating alone because embarrassed by portions, and feelings of guilt and shame after a BED episode. Risk factors include "weight-based teasing/bullying, sexual and gender minority youth, body dissatisfaction, and adverse childhood experiences", and obesity with BED is associated with "earlier onset over-weight, more severe obesity, early onset of dieting, anxiety, depression, and ADHD". Treatment options include "intensive psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy", and "SSRIs, and lisdexamfetamine) may also help with weight loss, and can be useful in treating BED as well as depression and ADHD if they co-exist in the patient with BED".

### Suffering in silence: medical error and its impact on health care providers [^116NTK8B]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

All humans are fallible. Because physicians are human, unintentional errors unfortunately occur. While unintentional medical errors have an impact on patients and their families, they may also contribute to adverse mental and emotional effects on the involved provider(s). These may include burnout, lack of concentration, poor work performance, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and even suicidality.

Objectives

The objectives of this article are to 1) discuss the impact medical error has on involved provider(s), 2) provide potential reasons why medical error can have a negative impact on provider mental health, and 3) suggest solutions for providers and health care organizations to recognize and mitigate the adverse effects medical error has on providers.

Discussion

Physicians and other providers may feel a variety of adverse emotions after medical error, including guilt, shame, anxiety, fear, and depression. It is thought that the pervasive culture of perfectionism and individual blame in medicine plays a considerable role toward these negative effects. In addition, studies have found that despite physicians' desire for support after medical error, many physicians feel a lack of personal and administrative support. This may further contribute to poor emotional well-being. Potential solutions in the literature are proposed, including provider counseling, learning from mistakes without fear of punishment, discussing mistakes with others, focusing on the system versus the individual, and emphasizing provider wellness. Much of the reviewed literature is limited in terms of an emergency medicine focus or even regarding physicians in general. In addition, most studies are survey- or interview-based, which limits objectivity. While additional, more objective research is needed in terms of mitigating the effects of error on physicians, this review may help provide insight and support for those who feel alone in their attempt to heal after being involved in an adverse medical event.

Conclusions

Unintentional medical error will likely always be a part of the medical system. However, by focusing on provider as well as patient health, we may be able to foster resilience in providers and improve care for patients in healthy, safe, and constructive environments.

### Auditory verbal hallucinations in persons with and without a need for care [^113FUtW9]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

What Are the Clinical Implications?

If transitions to clinical AVH and distress are influenced by cognitive processes, appraisals, and coping styles, then psychological interventions can target these factors (see Thomas et al 90), both to prevent or delay transition to clinical states and to promote recovery in those with AVH and need for care. Cognitive behavior therapy aims to reduce distress and empower the individual by modifying threatening appraisals and building up a normalizing view of voices. Similarly, acceptance and commitment therapy aims to reduce experiential avoidance of AVH and foster adaptive coping. Compassion-focused therapies for improving self-esteem and reducing shame associated with trauma can reduce the negative content of AVH. Emotion regulation strategies may be helpful if AVH are triggered by intense distress, together with formulating the emotional conflict. Reasoning trainingand metacognitive trainingare promising interventions for reducing cognitive biases such as JTC, and cognitive remediation can address various cognitive control and executive functions underlying AVH.

In addition to psychological factors, we can look to the cultural context (see Luhrmann et al 98) and how accepted AVH are in Western society. Reducing the stigma surrounding AVH would likely impact on how the person reacts emotionally and behaviorally to them. Furthermore, we should now be intervening to reduce the incidence and impact of childhood adversity, which is a key risk factor for AVH and other psychotic symptoms.

### 'Stuck in catch-22': a qualitative study of perceived work ability and decision-making about employment in severe asthma [^116hjXyU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact of asthma treatment and its perceived effectiveness

From the early stages of diagnosis, participants used strategies to help them cope with their SA symptoms. Patients' narratives conveyed a sense of confidence in treatment efficacy, as well as challenges met on their journey to finding the right medication regime and dealing with side effects. It was evident that not only asthma symptoms themelves but also steroid treatment had detrimental effects on patients' levels of productivity; " "My journey to actually find the medication that works and I'm not allergic to was a very bumpy one… and when I'm on the steroids, that makes me immensely tired, really tired. That's why I avoid those like the plague". (P10).

Whilst patients put a lot of trust in the multidisciplinary SA team, they also acknowledged the importance of personal investment, including good routine, looking after themselves and adherence to medication in order to keep their asthma under control; "every piece adds to staying in control, so I make sure I get seven hours sleep and make sure I'm not overtired, and I do keep on top of my weight because it did affect my asthma". (P7). Nevertheless, sticking to a routine was not always possible in roles that are unpredictable, such as a police officer. Having medication available at work was another factor contributing to staying in control of asthma. Nevertheless, feeling judged and shamed were some of the barriers to taking medication in public places; "Because you feel like you're being judged. I might not be, but in your head it's that sort of way because you meant to be strong". (P11). Being aware of the brittle clinical features of asthma, getting help and administering medication on time, as well as not downplaying symptoms by both staff and patients, seemed vital in avoiding serious asthma exacerbations.

Biologic injections and inhalers were also perceived as effective in managing asthma and improving physical fitness. Nevertheless, it was noticed that their effects can also wear off; "he tweaked my inhalers and that helped for a little bit. But then I don't know, it just started to go a bit haywire". (P8). Moreover, biological treatment required taking time off work fortnightly for administration, which for some meant reduced pay or arranging cover for their absence.

### Shame-and guilt-proneness: relationships with anxiety disorder symptoms in a clinical sample [^112W5FZR]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Researchers postulate that both shame and guilt are emotions important to anxiety disorders. Extant data, however, indicate that guilt-proneness shares non-significant relationships with psychopathology symptoms after controlling for shame-proneness. To further investigate the relevance of shame and guilt to the anxiety disorders domain, the current study examined associations between shame- and guilt-proneness and anxiety disorder symptoms using data from patients (N = 124) with primary anxiety disorder diagnoses. Results indicated that only symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) shared significant relations with shame-proneness after controlling for other types of anxiety disorder symptoms, depression symptoms, and guilt-proneness. Further, changes in shame-proneness during treatment were found to share significant relations with changes in obsessive-compulsive disorder, SAD, and GAD symptoms. The current results indicate that shame is more relevant to symptoms of the anxiety disorders domain than is guilt. The implications of these results for the conceptualization and treatment of anxiety disorders are discussed.

### The effects of self-compassion components on shame-proneness in individuals with depression: an exploratory study [^111uFSUD]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

To date, there is no evidence regarding how self-compassion's components, self-kindness, common humanity and mindfulness could work as distinct interventions. Thus, the main objective of the present study was exploring the effects that the three separate components of self-compassion would have on shame-proneness levels in individuals with clinical depression. All the participants (n = 122) with a diagnostic of Major Depressive Disorder were randomized in four experimental groups: the self-kindness exercises group, the mindfulness exercises group, the common humanity one and the control group. Results indicated that levels of depression and shame-proneness, as measured by BDI-II, TOSCA-3 and ESS decreased from baseline to post-intervention, but no significant differences were observed between groups. Therefore, we cannot conclude that one self-compassion component is more efficient than the others, but the present study does offer, though, a strong starting point for more complex, future studies.

### Psychotherapeutic benefits of compassion-focused therapy: an early systematic review [^115oDU5Z]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Origins of CFT

CFT uses a definition of compassion grounded in Buddhist tradition, which defines compassion as 'a sensitivity to suffering in self and others, with a commitment to try to alleviate and prevent it' (The Dalai Lama). CFT is part of a growing global movement that recognizes the potential of compassion to provide benefits in a range of sectors, from business, education and healthcare to science, research and the environment (Charter for Compassion;). CFT was founded by Paul Gilbert in response to the observation that many people, in particular those high in shame and self-criticism, were experiencing difficulties generating kind and self-supporting inner voices when engaging in traditional therapy. It was observed that although these individuals were able to engage with cognitive and behavioural tasks, they still responded poorly to therapy (Rector et al; Bulmarsh et al.). CFT was developed initially to help those individuals create affiliative feelings towards themselves, and to help them develop a more compassionate inner voice. CFT was based upon a growing body of neuroscientific evidence that demonstrated that affiliative motives and emotions can have a major impact on self and affect regulation (Cozolino; Depue & Morrone-Strupinsky). This research explores the interaction between three human affect regulation systems: threat protection, seeking and acquiring, and soothing. Gilbert proposes a framework of action for the biological mechanisms underpinning compassion that is based on the principles of evolutionary biology. A comprehensive overview of the theory and processes underpinning CFT is presented in Gilbert; a brief summary of salient issues is presented below.

### Shame, stigma and medicine [^117MehtH]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

The Shame and Medicine Project evolved from a conversation between the two editors of this Special Issue of Medical Humanities about the politics of shame and humiliation within healthcare. One is a philosopher with an academic focus in the phenomenology of the body, the other a clinician with an interest in medical training and regulation. Over the 2 years the project has run thus far, we have had the pleasure of hearing from scholars and practitioners from over 20 distinct and diverse disciplines — from theology and history to plastic surgery and contemporary visual culture. It has been a truly interdisciplinary engagement and one that has reflected shame's role as a commonplace social emotion, frequently 'underground' or hidden, but which has affected, and continues to impact on, many health-related interactions between individuals and society, patients and doctors, clinicians and regulators. Shame is the primary 'emotion of politics and conformity' particularly, as Myra Mendible points out in American Shame, 'for those who have the 'wrong' bodies or the 'wrong' desires'. Those who deviate from entrenched social norms are frequently subjected to stigma — 'a social process, experienced or anticipated, characterised by exclusion, rejection, blame or devaluation that results from experience, perception or reasonable anticipation of an adverse social judgement about a person or group'. Stigma, as many of the articles in this Special Issue demonstrate, is intimately bound up with shame. In moments of stigma, Goffman famously noted, 'shame becomes a central possibility'. Stigma is a social, emotional, political and clinical issue of enormous significance — the impact of social exclusion contributes substantially to the burden of illness, perhaps to the extent that in highly stigmatised disorders the suffering brought on by the disease process may be outweighed by the impact of stigma-induced social rejection.

### Shame and eating disorders symptoms: a meta-analysis [^115Rg9yS]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Numerous empirical studies and theoretical models posit that shame is a common experience among individuals across the eating disorder spectrum. In this study we aim to investigate the association between shame and eating disorders symptoms using a meta-analytical approach.

Method

In this meta-analysis, we synthesized findings from 195 studies to examine the proposed association between shame and eating disorders symptoms. We looked at the associations with both general eating disorders symptoms and with specific eating disorders symptoms (i.e., anorexic, bulimic, and binge-eating symptoms). Moderation analyses testing for the effect of type of shame, type of eating symptoms, clinical status, quality of the study, age, and gender were conducted.

Results

Shame was significantly associated with a medium to large effect size with all types of eating disorders symptoms (rs between .40 and .52). Body shame (r = .55) and shame around eating (r = .59) were more strongly related with eating disorders pathology. Type of eating disorders symptoms did not moderate the relationship between shame and disturbed eating.

Discussion

Overall, the magnitude of the effect size of the association between shame and eating disorders symptoms is a medium to large one. Body shame and shame around eating seem to be the types of shame most closely tied with eating disorders symptoms, suggesting that directly targeting them in interventions might be highly beneficial. Findings highlight current gaps in the literature (e.g., mostly correlational studies, low quality studies) with implications for future research.

### Perceived and preferred social support in patients experiencing weight regain after bariatric surgery-a qualitative study [^1156sqpZ]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Shame, Self-Blame, and Dysfunctional Coping Strategies

Although causal effects cannot be concluded from this exploratory study, participants themselves suggested that lack of, or unfavorable, support may have worsened their weight development. Their feelings of abandonment and self-accusations were aggravated by negative comments or misunderstandings. The psychological and emotional stress may have induced comfort eating, or deflated motivation to engage in lifestyle changes.

Participants were exposed to stigmatizing treatment, which is known to have a negative impact on mental health and self-esteem, and may amplify dysfunctional eating behaviors. Feelings of shame and guilt among persons with weight regain have been reported previously. Persons with weight regain may feel more stigma, because the shame of becoming obese and needing bariatric surgery, and subsequently the failure of postoperative weight loss maintenance.

Participants used social isolation and avoidance to minimize the risk of being judged by others. Consequently, they simultaneously deprived themselves from the possibility to get support from family and friends, and may have delayed getting professional help. Due to the presence of shame and weight stigma, education for healthcare providers may be needed to increase obesity knowledge and counteract stigmatization in order to minimize negative impact on patients. In addition, informing patients about the possibility of weight regain in a non-stigmatizing way, stressing both the fact that weight regain is a treatment failure (and not a personal failure) and that additional medical treatments exists, could reduce shame and lower the threshold for seeking professional help.

### Mindfulness-based stress reduction alleviates depression, anxiety, and internalized stigma compared with treatment-as-usual among head and neck cancer patients: findings from a randomized controlled trial [^117RpPi2]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Head and neck cancer (HNC) was the 7 th most prevalent cancer type globally in 2020, and by 2030, it is expected to rise at an alarming rate due to its causal relationship with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HNC patients are prone to facial disfigurement and various physical symptoms, such as loss of smell and taste, hearing difficulties, dyspnea, and challenges in swallowing, speaking, and social interaction. These physical challenges often lead to emotional turmoil, including depression and anxiety.

The prevalence of depression and anxiety among HNC patients ranges from 20% to 40%, which is higher compared to other types of cancer. Moreover, HNC complicated by depression and anxiety increases the risk of suicidal behavior. A systematic review and meta-analysis of HNC patients reported a pooled incidence of suicide at 161.16 per 100,000 individuals per year. Depression and anxiety contribute to several negative outcomes for HNC patients. These conditions lower their quality of life. Regarding survival outcomes, HNC patients diagnosed with depression both prior to and after their cancer diagnosis are more likely to die from cancer and other causes compared to those without depression. Therefore, it is crucial to study depression, anxiety, and effective psychological interventions for HNC patients.

In addition, stigma is a significant factor closely related to depression and anxiety in cancer patients. Stigma is defined as a negative perception experienced by an individual due to their perceived differences from others. Internalized stigma, in particular, is strongly associated with depression and anxiety. It refers to irrational feelings, sentiments, and behaviors directed toward oneself, accompanied by a belief that one is a devalued member of society due to the label associated with their illness. Stigma related to cancer has been linked not only to depression and anxiety but also to impaired physical health, psychological well-being, and social functioning, especially in HNC patients with facial disfigurement. These patients often experience devaluation of their social identity, leading to internalized stigma. Internalized stigma implies to the phenomenon in which cancer patients adopt the negative societal perception about cancer and apply these perceptions to themselves, resulting in feelings of shame, self-blame, and sense of worthlessness. Research also shows that the degree of internalized stigma tends to increase over time after treatment completion in HNC patients. Given its detrimental impact, internalized stigma warrants attention as a potential target for psychological interventions among cancer patients.

### Compassion-focused therapy for body weight shame: a mixed methods pilot trial [^113jxWVi]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Individuals with bigger bodies (body mass index greater than 30) often experience body weight shame and are at increased risk for mental health vulnerabilities such as depression and anxiety. To date, there have been no studies specifically designed and pilot tested to help with body weight shame for individuals with bigger bodies that do not have a diagnosed clinical condition. The aim of current study is to investigate the initial feasibility of compassion-focused therapy (CFT) as a 12-session group intervention for the reduction in body weight shame for individuals with bigger bodies. The study used a mixed method repeated measure design, with both quantitative and qualitative measures, to assess the initial feasibility of the CFT group-based intervention. Participants (N = 5) attended a 12-session/2-h group CFT programme aimed to directly target body weight shame by cultivating compassion. Measurements were conducted at three time points (pre-, post- and 3-month follow-up intervention). Results indicated that CFT had a positive impact on reducing body weight shame, increasing compassion and improving health-engaging behaviours. Qualitative feedback indicated the importance of the group dynamics to help with the de-shaming of body appearance for individuals. Results from this feasibility trial are promising, and future research using randomized controlled trial methodologies should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CFT as a treatment option for body weight shame for individuals with bigger bodies.

### How do prenatal people describe their experiences with anxiety? a qualitative analysis of blog content [^115ceted]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Perceived lack of control

Related to the aforementioned areas of uncertainty, many bloggers expressed a perceived lack of control over their privacy, their choices regarding labour and delivery procedures, the various changes happening to their bodies, and their anxiety during their pregnancy. Regardless of the cause, bloggers expressed that their perceived lack of control increased their prenatal anxiety. Concerning privacy, one blogger described feeling attacked in social interactions when asked intrusive questions about their pregnancy (Table 3, quote 18). Some bloggers expressed feeling a lack of control over their bodies, particularly over choices related to labour and delivery procedures (e.g. whether to have an unmedicated or medicated labour and delivery; Table 3, quote 19), the changes occurring to their bodies to support the developing fetus (Table 3, quote 20), and deciding whether to continue their pregnancy (Table 3, quote 21). Lastly, a few bloggers described feeling they lacked control over their anxiety during pregnancy, referring to it as negative and uncontrollable (Table 3, quote 22). For a few bloggers, their anxiety elicited such distress that they felt that termination of the pregnancy or suicide was their only option (Table 3, quote 23).

Guilt/shame for not having a "normal" pregnancy

A few bloggers elaborated on the stigma surrounding what emotions prenatal people 'should' feel during pregnancy (Table 3, quote 15). Bloggers described how experiencing negative emotions during pregnancy, rather than the expected positive emotions, triggered their anxiety. Many felt guilt and shame for not having a "normal" pregnancy filled with positive emotions (Table 3, 16). For a few bloggers, this guilt and shame led them to question whether they would be good mothers (Table 3, quote 17).

### Psychotherapeutic benefits of compassion-focused therapy: an early systematic review [^11697uhE]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background.

Compassion-focused therapy (CFT) is a relatively novel form of psychotherapy that was developed for people who have mental health problems primarily linked to high shame and self-criticism. The aim of this early systematic review was to draw together the current research evidence of the effectiveness of CFT as a psychotherapeutic intervention, and to provide recommendations that may inform the development of further trials.

Method.

A comprehensive search of electronic databases was undertaken to systematically identify literature relating to the effectiveness of CFT as a psychotherapeutic intervention. Reference lists of key journals were hand searched and contact with experts in the field was made to identify unpublished data.

Results.

Fourteen studies were included in the review, including three randomized controlled studies. The findings from the included studies were, in the most part, favourable to CFT, and in particular seemed to be effective for people who were high in self-criticism.

Conclusions.

CFT shows promise as an intervention for mood disorders, particularly those high in self-criticism. However, more large-scale, high-quality trials are needed before it can be considered evidence-based practice. The review highlights issues from the current evidence that may be used to inform such trials.

### Maladaptive blame-related action tendencies are associated with vulnerability to major depressive disorder [^114pJZyu]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Biases towards self-blaming emotions, such as self-contempt/disgust, were previously associated with vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD). Self-blaming emotions are thought to prompt specific action tendencies (e.g. "feeling like hiding"), which are likely to be more important for psychosocial functioning than the emotions themselves. Systematic investigations, however, of these action tendencies in MDD are lacking. Here, we investigated the role of blame-related action tendencies for MDD vulnerability and their relationship with blame-related emotions. 76 participants with medication-free remitted MDD and 44 healthy control (HC) participants without a history of MDD completed the value-related moral sentiment task, which measured their blame-related emotions during hypothetical social interactions and a novel task to assess their blame-related action tendencies (feeling like hiding, apologising, creating a distance from oneself, attacking oneself, creating a distance from other, attacking other, no action). As predicted, the MDD group showed a maladaptive profile of action tendencies: a higher proneness to feeling like hiding and creating a distance from themselves compared with the HC group. In contrast, feeling like apologising was less common in the MDD than the HC group. Apologising for one's wrongdoing was associated with all self-blaming emotions including shame, guilt, self-contempt/disgust and self-indignation. Hiding was associated with both shame and guilt. Our study shows that MDD vulnerability was associated with specific maladaptive action tendencies which were independent of the type of emotion, thus unveiling novel cognitive markers and neurocognitive treatment targets.

### Examining contemporaneous and temporal associations of real-time suicidal ideation using network analysis [^113QiK3R]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Our findings on the differential associations between suicide risk factors on one hand, and passive and active suicidal ideation as well as acquired capability on the other, have clinical relevance. First, we observed unique associations of hopelessness, loneliness, and burdensomeness with passive suicidal ideation, indicating that negative cognitive attributional styles may be more central for the foundational development of passive suicidal ideation. These factors may therefore represent important targets in the long-term therapeutic management of suicidality (Van Orden, Talbot, & King). However, our finding indicating that shame specifically was uniquely associated with active suicidal ideation, and further predicted short-term increases in acquired capability, indicates that for acute risk management, targeting other affective processes may be more crucial. Shame encompasses intense feelings of embarrassment and self-hatred (Lester,), and may therefore represent an especially aversive internal state that is more likely to lead to active thoughts and preparedness to 'escape' the shame-inducing experience (Baumeister). Our findings indicate that shame-reduction techniques (Goffnett, Liechty, & Kidder,) may also benefit the treatment of patients with suicidal ideation.

### The role of shame and self-critical thinking in the development and maintenance of current threat in post-traumatic stress disorder [^116dXCVG]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of emotions other than fear in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and recent research has looked at the role of shame. Cognitive theory suggests that PTSD is caused by traumatic experiences being processed in a way that causes ongoing current threat. In this paper we suggest that shame might contribute to the creation/maintenance of ongoing current threat as it attacks an individual's psychological integrity. A correlational design was used to investigate some of the factors that might contribute to a shame response within a PTSD sample. It was hypothesized that individuals with PTSD who report higher levels of shame would be more prone to engage in self-critical thinking and less prone to engage in self-reassuring thinking than individuals with PTSD who report lower levels of shame. Data were gathered using self-report questionnaires, and results supported the hypotheses. It is suggested therapy for shame-based PTSD needs to incorporate strategies to help individuals develop inner caring, compassion and self-reassurance.

### Lindane [^115Ghemk]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

What is Lindane Shampoo?

Lindane Shampoo is a medicine that is used to treat lice. It kills lice and their eggs. Lice are very small bugs that attach to the skin on your head or pubic (crotch) area and lay eggs called nits in your hair. Some people call crotch lice "crabs". Lice can cause severe itching. Lindane Shampoo gets into the lice and the nits and kills them. It also goes through your skin. Lindane Shampoo is used only after safer medicines have not made your lice go away. The only time Lindane Shampoo is used first is when someone cannot use safer medicines, which may include permethrin and crotamiton.

Lindane Shampoo is mainly for adults and children who weigh at least 110 pounds. If you weigh less than 110 pounds use Lindane Shampoo only if your doctor thinks it is really needed. People who weigh less than 110 pounds and the elderly have higher chances for side effects because more Lindane may go through their skin.

Who should not use Lindane Shampoo?

Do not use Lindane Shampoo:

if you do not have lice. Lindane Shampoo does not stop you from getting lice. Lindane Shampoo only kills the lice you already have.
if you have or have ever had seizures, also called convulsions, "fits" or epilepsy, especially if they have been hard to control.
if you have used Lindane Shampoo in the past few months. You should see your doctor if you think that you need another treatment.
unless it is the only medicine you can use for lice.
if you had a bad reaction to Lindane Shampoo before. Do not use Lindane Shampoo again.
if you have open sores or crusted (scabby) sores on the skin around your head and neck, or lots of broken skin.
if you need to treat a premature or young baby. More of the applied Lindane can go through the skin of babies and go to their brains where it can harm them.
if you have scabies. These need a different medicine that you use in a different way.
if you are allergic to Lindane Shampoo or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is lindane. See the end of this Medication Guide for a list of all the ingredients in Lindane Shampoo.
while you are breast-feeding. Lindane Shampoo can get in your milk and may be fed to your baby. Your baby may get sick. Ask your doctor for a safer medicine. If you use Lindane Shampoo, pump your breast milk and throw the milk away for at least 24 hours after using the medicine. During this time, feed your baby formula or breast milk that you stored from before you used Lindane Shampoo.

### "Medicine is awesome": a critical look at the factors that shape thinking about depression and its treatment [^113xDzvP]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

No longer are prolonged sadness and despondency, with their effects on day-to-day functioning, conceived of as a response to someone's internal world or external environment. Instead, the syndrome has been elevated to a medical disorder-depression-explained as a chemical imbalance in the nervous system that requires medication to rebalance these chemicals. How did we arrive at this modern state of affairs? While the answer to this question is complex and has been hotly debated, one thing is certain: This relatively new explanation of depression as a neurochemical imbalance leads to the current privileging of pharmacotherapy over other approaches to treatment. However, the pharmacologic effect of these treatments is still speculative. Numerous studies have failed to show a benefit to active treatment greater than that seen with placebo, and most patients will not achieve remission of symptoms despite treatment. This overreliance on medication may reflect a "medicine is awesome" stance that biases clinicians toward medical interventions. A more expansive understanding of depressed mood, one that can and should be discussed with patients, is to understand it as a reaction to one's psychosocial, political, economic, and physical environment. This more expansive understanding includes the neurobiological basis of mood, but it also allows for discussions of non-pharmaceutical treatments, ones that can be aligned with each patient's agenda. Medications may be an eventual option after a thorough explanation of limited benefit and possible harms. However, this reframing of depression facilitates a valuable, satisfying means of developing trust and helping people with depressed mood.

### For placebo effects in medicine, seeing is believing [^115kWKgg]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The gold standard for determining the efficacy of biomedical therapies is the detection of a significant difference between the therapeutic effects of an active pharmacological agent or procedure and a matched inert placebo in a randomized controlled trial. Detecting this difference has become a challenge for medicine, especially for outcomes that are based on patient self-rated scales. Yet factors that contribute to placebo responses have received scant attention. In this issue of Science Translational Medicine, Bingel et al. report on an example of how noninvasive whole-brain imaging contributes to our understanding of brain-based placebo effects. Here we highlight ways in which neuroimaging is catalyzing a revolution in society's perspective of placebo effects by providing a compelling visualization of how brain activities that reflect a person's thoughts, feelings, and past experiences can enhance or antagonize his or her response to a medical treatment.

### The rebirth of psychosocial importance in a drug-filled world [^112nGY8v]. The American Psychologist (2016). Low credibility.

In the United States, the public is heavily lobbied to accept medications as the main answer for dealing with mental maladies like depression. However, examination of the empirical evidence reveals that even when drugs are the primary treatments, findings of benefit are often more dependent on psychosocial, interpersonal factors than commonly believed. This article highlights the reemerging worth of psychotherapeutic relationships in quelling emotional discomfort. It also touches on the roles of business and research bias in overselling the idea of unique merits and specificity of gains derived purely from psychopharmacological solutions.

### Medical mistakes: a workshop on personal perspectives [^114poBwA]. The Oncologist (2001). Low credibility.

Shortly before his death in 1995, Kenneth B. Schwartz, a cancer patient at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), founded the Kenneth B. Schwartz Center at MGH. The Schwartz Center is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and advancing compassionate health care delivery, which provides hope to the patient, support to caregivers, and sustenance to the healing process. The center sponsors the Schwartz Center Rounds, a monthly multidisciplinary forum where caregivers reflect on important psychosocial issues faced by patients, their families, and their caregivers, and gain insight and support from fellow staff members. Medical errors are difficult to discuss. Significant medical errors occur in approximately 3% of hospitalizations. Two-thirds are preventable. Despite an entrenched belief that doctors should be infallible, errors are inevitable. Dr. Wendy Levinson of the University of Chicago facilitated a discussion of the impact medical errors have on staff. Staff broke into small groups to share their personal experience and then discussed common themes: the sense of shame and guilt, the punitive culture, guidelines for disclosure to patients and colleagues, and changes in medical practice that can prevent future mistakes. Auditing and improving systems has led to considerable improvements in the field of aviation safety. However, in medicine people are more important than the process. While we should never cease to aim for the very best in delivered care, we must acknowledge how prone we all are to mistakes and that we can learn from and prevent errors. Openly sharing experiences in a confidential setting, such as the Schwartz Rounds, helps defuse feelings of guilt and challenges the culture of shame and isolation that often surrounds medical errors.

### Serotonin depletion amplifies distinct human social emotions as a function of individual differences in personality [^111QgMFG]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Seventy-three participants completed the study: 37 underwent depletion (20 males), while the remaining 36 received placebo (19 males).

Effects of ATD on mood ratings

Mood ratings were unaffected by ATD. We collected rating data from 65 participants (n = 33 depletion) on how happy or sad they were feeling before the task, after depletion had taken effect, and these ratings did not differ from those of participants in the placebo group (t (63) = −0.727, p = 0.47). There were also no baseline differences in depressive symptoms (t (71) = −1.258, p = 0.212) using the Beck Depression Inventory-II.

How serotonin depletion modulates emotional ratings overall

We tested whether serotonin depletion potentiated emotions overall, irrespective of individual differences. To do this we performed repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) incorporating all four emotions measured. Serotonin status (ATD versus placebo) was the between-subjects factor, and the within-subjects factors were emotion (annoyance, guilt, shame, and feeling bad), agency (agent or victim of harm) and intentionality (intentional or unintentional harm). Indeed, serotonin depletion potentiated emotion overall (F (1,71) = 5.959, p = 0.017, ηp² = 0.077), shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1. There were highly significant main effects for emotion (F (2,155) = 171.744, p = 7.4 × 10⁻⁴², ηp² = 0.708), agency (F (1,71) = 630.212, p = 4.9 × 10⁻³⁷, ηp² = 0.899) and intentionality (F (1,71) = 11.799, p = 0.001, ηp² = 0.143), regardless of serotonergic status, which supports task validity and suggests individuals were attuned to the social context of the scenarios. Emotional ratings were significantly greater when imagining being the agent compared to the victim, and when the harm committed was intentional rather than unintentional. There were no interactions between serotonin status and agency or intentionality (all p > 0.05). Our core results in this study, however, came from analyses of how individual differences interacted with the serotonin-depleted state to modulate emotion, which now follow.

### Measuring shame and guilt by self-report questionnaires: a validation study [^116w7AQ5]. Psychiatry Research (2007). Low credibility.

Quantitative assessment of shame and guilt using self-report questionnaires can help to understand the role of these emotions in various mental disorders. However, shame and guilt measures have predominantly been tested among healthy subjects that usually show low levels of guilt and shame. Thus, little is known about the comparative validity of different shame and guilt questionnaires in a population of shame- and guilt-prone persons with mental illness as compared to healthy subjects. This study used the Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA-3), the Personal Feelings Questionnaire (PFQ-2) and the Experiential Shame Scale (ESS) among 60 women with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and 60 healthy women. Intercorrelations of shame-proneness, guilt-proneness and state shame as well as their correlations with self-efficacy, empowerment, state and trait-anxiety, experiential avoidance, depression, and general psychopathology were assessed. In both groups, shame-proneness was moderately related to guilt-proneness, both as assessed by the TOSCA-3 and the PFQ-2. For the TOSCA-3, among healthy subjects shame-proneness was significantly correlated with other constructs while guilt-proneness was not. This difference turned largely insignificant among women with BPD. For the PFQ-2, shame- and guilt-proneness showed similar correlational patterns with other constructs in both groups. The guilt-proneness scale of the TOSCA-3 showed poor internal consistency. State shame (ESS) was strongly related to state anxiety in both groups, and its correlations with other constructs were similar to state anxiety. The discriminant validity of the TOSCA-3 to distinguish between shame- and guilt-proneness may be diminished in clinical samples. The measure of state shame (ESS) showed a large overlap with state anxiety.

### The parent-child relationship and child shame and guilt: a meta-analytic systematic review [^114S4K1A]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

While shame and guilt emerge as immediate emotional states, both may become dispositional (Tignor & Colvin). Some individuals may frequently experience shame and guilt in ambivalent situations, reflecting these individuals' shame‐ or guilt‐proneness as relatively stable traits (Tangney). Shame and guilt may further become "internalized", where they are conceptualized as overarching feelings devoid of a specific context (Kim et al; for a critical notion see Leeming, and Boyle). The different underlying constructs inform their respective operationalization and cannot be used interchangeably without careful evaluation of potential differential effects. Against this backdrop, the current meta‐analysis distinguishes between studies that assessed guilt and shame at the trait versus state level and between different conceptualizations of these constructs (shame‐/guilt‐proneness, internalized shame/guilt).

In contrast to adaptive guilt, both shame‐proneness and maladaptive guilt are considered as risk factors for psychopathology (Levinson et al; Muris & Meesters,), but excessive shame and guilt can also represent psychopathological symptoms in themselves (Malti). The present review focuses solely on nonpathological shame and guilt to distinguish them from pathological aspects.

### The burden of premature ejaculation: the patient's perspective [^111Vg7XE]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Premature ejaculation (PE) remains an underdetected and under-treated condition, despite the advances in available treatment options. Men with PE often feel stigmatized by the condition and embarrassment is a key barrier to discussing the problem with healthcare professionals. Men with PE perceive themselves as having little control over ejaculation and this lack of control is mirrored in diminished satisfaction with sexual intercourse. The burden of PE is both emotional and physical. Premature ejaculation is associated with low self-esteem, anxiety, and feelings of shame and inferiority. In some studies there is an association with depression. Premature ejaculation places a significant burden on the patient-partner relationship and there is evidence to suggest that there is a higher prevalence of female sexual dysfunction associated with PE. Patients with PE often view the condition as purely psychological or as a problem that will resolve with time and many are unaware that medical treatment could be of benefit. This endorses the particularly important role of healthcare professionals in recognizing the barriers to patient diagnosis and promoting the view that PE is not only a common but also a treatable medical condition.

Shame and guilt: Adaptive and maladaptive manifestations

Shame and guilt are foremost internal, discrete, self‐conscious emotional reactions elicited by external stimuli to protect the social self (Dickerson et al; Tracy & Robins). One of the most established theories describes and distinguishes shame and guilt based on their attributions of felt defectiveness (Lewis). According to this framework, shame is felt when the whole self is judged to be flawed, whereas guilt is felt if an action is evaluated as faulty. As a consequence, shame is accompanied by feelings of worthlessness and exposure, whereas guilt is usually associated with regret (Tangney et al.). While both emotions are considered important for interpersonal processes (Dempsey,), within this definition, guilt is deemed a more adaptive response to social transgressions compared to shame, as it often leads to reparative actions and behavioral changes (Tignor & Colvin). However, if guilt extends beyond what is situationally appropriate and is overly strong, it can also become maladaptive (Carnì et al; Malti). Because these conceptualizations of guilt differ quite substantially, we distinguish adaptive and maladaptive guilt entirely for the present review. Shame, on the other hand, is perceived as more global and hurtful than guilt and thus less easily or not reparable (Tangney et al; Tracy & Robins). Consequently, shame may cause the actor to withdraw from the shameful situation, suppress the emotions, externalize the blame, or attack oneself or others for the purpose of protecting the self (Elison et al; Pivetti et al.). While occasional experience of shame might be normative (Dempsey,), on a trait‐like level, shame is considered a maladaptive emotion (Tignor & Colvin).

### Diabetes-related shame among people with type 2 diabetes: an internet-based cross-sectional study [^1123gryf]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Emerging evidence suggests that diabetes stigma may lead to lower quality of life (QOL) in people with diabetes. Stigma is explained as the situation of the individual who is disqualified from full social acceptance, which can impair the identity of the stigmatized person. Individuals with diabetes perceive negative social perceptions associated with diabetes, which can cause emotional distress such as shame, guilt, regret, and hopelessness. Among these emotional distresses, shame has been classified as one of the most painful and disabling human emotional experiencesand can be considered an emotion that requires careful attention by clinicians involved in diabetes care.

The American Psychological Association defines shame as a highly unpleasant self-conscious emotion arising from the sense of there being something dishonorable, immodest, or indecorous in one's conduct or circumstances. The experience of shame is crucially bound up in experience of health-related stigma. Studies have explained that individuals with stigma experience shame because their identity and social bonds are threatened. Previous qualitative studies of people with diabetes have reported the case of painful shame as in 'people with diabetes get blamed and shamed' in their relationships with those around them.

Shame affects health through various inter-related pathways. A qualitative study reported that people with type 2 diabetes who experience shame often experienced hopelessness and increased 'maladaptive behaviors (unhealthful behaviors)'. Similarly, cases have been reported in which shame affected diabetes-treatment behaviors. For example, people with type 2 diabetes intentionally choose unhealthy food because they do not want to refuse what is offered by others around them, or delay insulin dosing and blood glucose monitoring because they are concerned about the reactions of others. Unhealthful behaviors described above might be explained by the shame trait that shame tends to lead to self-protective responses such as hiding, unlike guilt, where it leads to restorative (ameliorative) behaviors. Qualitative studies have reported that the sense of shame may mask self-management status in communication with healthcare providers. Thus, shame can be considered an emotion that clinicians should pay attention to, not simply because it is the most painful emotion, but also from the perspective that diabetes-related shame may lead to concealment of self-management behaviors during counseling.

### Shame-proneness, guilt-proneness and anxiety symptoms: a meta-analysis [^111J7b6A]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

There is a growing body of investigations showing that shame and guilt are important features of various psychological problems including anxiety disorders. This study quantitatively summarized the magnitude of the associations of shame and guilt with anxiety symptoms. We looked both at the associations with broader categories of anxiety symptoms (i.e., undifferentiated anxiety symptoms, trait and state anxiety), but also with symptoms specific to individual anxiety disorders. In most cases, shame was more strongly associated with anxiety symptoms (in general medium effect sizes) than guilt (in general small effect sizes). When controlling for the shared variance of shame and guilt, in most cases only shame remained significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Moderation analyses testing for the effect of subtype of shame/guilt, type of measurement, clinical status, age and gender were conducted. Two types of guilt seem to be equally maladaptive as shame, generalized guilt (involving a free-floating guilt separated from specific contexts) and contextual-maladaptive guilt (involving an inappropriate or exaggerated feeling of responsibility). External shame (perceived negative evaluations of others) seems to be more strongly associated with social anxiety symptoms than internal shame (negative self-evaluations). Results for other moderators and implications are discussed in light of the existing theoretical and empirical data.

### Shame, stigma and medicine [^111HFQTY]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

"As a young physician in the mid-80s, caring for people who had contracted HIV, I lost two of my patients to suicide at a time when the virus was doing very little harm to them. I have always thought of them as having been killed by a metaphor, by the burden of secrecy and shame associated with the disease".

Abraham Verghese

When, in the late 1980s, the psychiatrist Donald Nathanson organised a symposium on the nature of shame, it turned out to be the first such event to deal with the subject in the history of psychiatry or psychoanalysis on either side of the Atlantic. It seems strange that such a ubiquitous emotion had excited so little academic interest to that point, but as Nathanson points out — shame makes us so uncomfortable that we will go to great lengths to avoid it. Yet, despite our efforts to ignore it, shame remains universal — there can be few of us who have not been seared by shame at some stage of our life. In fact, some philosophers argue that shame is inescapable in human experience, a fundamental part of child development that textures personal, social and political aspects of adolescent and adult life. As Tanner states (when responding to an accusation of impudence) in Shaw's Man and Superman:

### Shame, self-identification with having a mental illness, and willingness to seek help in northeast Germany [^114Ku9Mk]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

We examined a general population sample (n = 1330) from an epidemiological study (SHIP), investigating whether shame, social distance and reluctance to self-identify as having a mental illness interfere with willingness to seek help for mental health problems. Analyses were stratified for life-time diagnosis of any mental illness. Shame was the strongest negative predictor for willingness to seek help (beta = -0.183, p < .001). Structured Estimation Modelling showed shame being a full mediator of a negative association between social distance and willingness. Our results corroborate the important role of shame as an impediment to help-seeking for mental health problems in the general population.

### Burnout in Canadian physiatrists: a national cross-sectional survey [^111TEiyz]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

In this current study we found a prevalence of emotion dysregulation indicative of depression in 40% in Canadian physiatrists. Difficulties with emotion regulation was a significant predictor of burnout and moral injury; nonacceptance of one's emotional responses was the strongest single item predictor from the DERS, suggesting shame at one's emotional responses as responsible. Difficulties with emotion regulation were more likely among younger physiatrists, with less years of experience. Our data do not allow us to speculate on the cause of this finding, but the prevalence is notably higher than previous reports of depression in Canadian physicians. There is a well-developed literature on stigma surrounding physician mental health, with large scale efforts to address morbidity and suicide. Survey data suggests that physicians who are depressed are less productive, less satisfied with their work, and, worryingly, less likely to seek treatment and more likely to self-prescribe antidepressants. Teaching physicians' evidence-based emotion regulation skills, from an early stage, seems like common sense, but for unclear reasons is unfortunately not the norm, where most medical education focused on emotion is in relation to caring for patients, rather than self-care. Compassion-based interventions may be particularly helpful for those with a tendency to suppress emotionsor experience shame at oneself. Emotion regulation strategies with the most robust evidence include cognitive behavioral therapy and Mindfulness-based interventions, with reappraisal of emotional stimuli and perspective taking appearing the most effective skills.

- Buprenorphine and methadone relieve the withdrawal symptoms and psychological cravings experienced by patients addicted to opioids. 5
- Methadone to treat opioid addiction is dispensed only at specially licensed treatment centers.
- Methadone is marketed under the brand names Diskets, Dolophine, and Methadose, and also as generics. Methadone is available as a tablet, liquid, and wafer.
- A physician must complete training in order to be qualified to prescribe or dispense buprenorphine to treat addiction. 6Buprenorphine is dispensed by retail pharmacies and sometimes at opioid treatment centers.
- Buprenorphine, either alone or in combination with other medicines, is marketed under the brand names Bunavail, Probuphine, Suboxone, and Zubsolv, and also as generics. Buprenorphine is available as a tablet dissolved under the tongue, as a film dissolved under the tongue, as a film dissolved on the inside of the cheek, and as an implant inserted into the upper arm.
- Common side effects of buprenorphine and methadone include nausea, vomiting, constipation, muscle aches and cramps, and sleep problems.
- Current evidence does not support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine or methadone as a strategy to address benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant use in MAT-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine or methadone dosing, a health care professional should evaluate the cause of sedation. Omitting or decreasing the dose of buprenorphine or methadone may be appropriate. CNS depressants included benzodiazepines and three non-benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs. 4 Benzodiazepines included in the study were diazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, triazolam, midazolam, and clonazepam.

The non-benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs included in the study were zopiclone, zolpidem, and zaleplon.

Clinical Question Which medications are effective at decreasing agitation in patients with dementia. Evidence-Based Answer Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risperidone are moderately effective at decreasing agitation in all types of dementia. Olanzapine and risperidone reduce dementia-related agitation much longer than placebo. Dextromethorphan/quinidine may be effective at reducing agitation in patients with dementia.
