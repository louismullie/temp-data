## Question

Can nitrofurantoin be used to treat renal cell carcinoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nitrofurantoin can be used to treat renal cell carcinoma and, if not, why it should not be used for RCC. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what nitrofurantoin actually is, its labeled indications, and mechanism of action. Then, I should review standard-of-care treatments for RCC from major guidelines. Next, I need to check whether any guideline, trial, or mechanistic rationale connects nitrofurantoin to RCC therapy. After that, I should verify contraindications and toxicity that are especially relevant to RCC patients, many of whom have reduced renal function. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion that distinguishes treating UTIs in RCC patients from treating the malignancy itself and ensure the recommendations align with contemporary guideline-based oncology care.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacological identity and indications of nitrofurantoin. Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran-class antibacterial used for treatment and prophylaxis of uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible organisms; it is not an antineoplastic, immunotherapy, or targeted oncologic agent, and its mechanism involves bacterial enzyme-mediated generation of reactive intermediates that disrupt multiple bacterial macromolecular processes, becoming bactericidal in urine, without any established anti-tumor activity in humans [^1171fh9J] [^113dDvwq] [^113Qmcnu].

> Wait, let me verify its tissue distribution and site-of-action constraints, because that matters for any hypothetical anti-cancer application. Nitrofurantoin achieves high urinary concentrations but has limited systemic tissue distribution; in fact, the product label explicitly notes it lacks the broader tissue distribution of other UTI agents and is not indicated for pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses, which implies it will not reach solid renal tumors at therapeutic levels for oncologic effect [^1171fh9J] [^111YMvTh].

> Next, I should review what evidence-based RCC treatments are recommended. Contemporary RCC management relies on surgery for localized disease and on systemic targeted and immunotherapies for advanced disease, including VEGFR TKIs (e.g., sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib), mTOR inhibitors (everolimus, temsirolimus), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab), often in combination regimens per ESMO, NCCN, EAU, and ASCO guidelines, with RECORD-1 and TARGET among pivotal trials supporting mTOR and VEGF pathway inhibition respectively [^1138x2gG] [^1126nwWB] [^115WZYp8] [^112MEAvS] [^111KKmzK] [^114Svr7j].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any major guideline or trial even mentions nitrofurantoin in the RCC therapeutic pathway. Scanning ESMO 2024, NCCN 2022/2024, EAU 2025, and ASCO 2022/2023, there are no listings of nitrofurantoin for RCC diagnosis, adjuvant or metastatic treatment, sequencing, or special populations, underscoring the complete absence of a therapeutic role for this antibiotic in RCC management [^1138x2gG] [^113yyQqE] [^112MEAvS] [^112Kv7PU].

> I need to ensure I evaluate potential contraindications that are especially relevant in RCC patients. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in significant renal impairment, typically defined in labeling as creatinine clearance under 60 mL/min, due to impaired excretion and increased toxicity risk; many RCC patients have reduced renal function from tumor involvement, nephrectomy, or chronic kidney disease, making nitrofurantoin particularly unsuitable and potentially harmful in this population [^115PzKqu] [^116S2cxS] [^112XnjPh].

> Next, I should review key toxicities that would add unnecessary morbidity without oncologic benefit. Nitrofurantoin has well-described risks of acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions including interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis, serious hepatotoxicity including hepatic necrosis, and peripheral neuropathy, among other idiosyncratic events; exposing patients with cancer to these risks in the absence of anti-tumor efficacy is unjustified and could complicate oncologic care and supportive management [^114vo7DK] [^1143psB9] [^111G9vKj].

> But wait, what about scenarios where antibiotics are used around RCC care — I should clarify that to prevent misconceptions. Antibiotics may be needed to treat intercurrent UTIs in patients who have RCC, and perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis around nephrectomy has been studied with mixed necessity signals; however, these uses target infectious complications, not the malignancy itself, and they do not convert nitrofurantoin into an anti-cancer therapy for RCC [^1171fh9J] [^112mRaYY].

> Let me reconsider the overall picture and ensure alignment with guideline-concordant care. For RCC, clinicians should employ surgery for localized disease and evidence-based systemic regimens — such as ICI/TKI combinations in the first line and guideline-directed sequencing with agents like nivolumab, cabozantinib, lenvatinib-pembrolizumab, or everolimus — while explicitly avoiding off-label use of antibiotics like nitrofurantoin for cancer treatment given the lack of efficacy, potential harm in reduced renal function, and absence from all authoritative oncology guidelines [^1138x2gG] [^1126nwWB] [^113gfZWq].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my recommendation is unambiguous. Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic for UTIs with limited tissue distribution, no anti-neoplastic activity, and significant renal function–dependent safety constraints; it has no role in treating renal cell carcinoma, whereas RCC therapy should follow surgical, targeted, and immunotherapy pathways per contemporary ESMO, NCCN, EAU, and ASCO guidance [^1171fh9J] [^113yyQqE] [^112MEAvS] [^112Kv7PU].

Nitrofurantoin is **not indicated or effective** for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [^1171fh9J]. It is an antibacterial agent for uncomplicated UTIs [^113dDvwq] and has no proven anticancer activity in RCC [^113yyQqE]. Current RCC care relies on surgery, immunotherapy, and targeted agents [^1138x2gG]; nitrofurantoin is **not included in any RCC guideline or clinical trial**. Its use in RCC is unsupported [^1126nwWB] and **may cause harm**, especially in patients with impaired renal function [^115PzKqu] [^114vo7DK].

---

## Pharmacological properties of nitrofurantoin

Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran antibacterial with a **unique mechanism** whereby bacterial flavoproteins reduce it to reactive intermediates that inactivate ribosomal proteins and other macromolecules, thereby inhibiting protein, DNA, RNA, and cell wall synthesis [^113dDvwq]. It is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses [^113dDvwq] and is used to treat uncomplicated UTIs caused by susceptible organisms [^1171fh9J]. Pharmacokinetically, nitrofurantoin is rapidly absorbed, attains low systemic levels, and is rapidly excreted in urine, concentrating in the urinary tract [^111YMvTh]. This profile limits its distribution to other tissues, including the kidneys, thereby **restricting its use to lower UTIs** [^1171fh9J].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding nitrofurantoin in RCC

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting nitrofurantoin for RCC [^1138x2gG]. No trials, case reports, or preclinical studies demonstrate anticancer activity in RCC. Its mechanism and pharmacokinetics do not support antitumor effects in RCC [^111YMvTh]. Current RCC management includes surgery, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies; nitrofurantoin is **not included in any guideline or clinical trial for RCC** [^111RiGdG].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for RCC treatment

Current guidelines from ESMO, ASCO, and EAU **recommend**:

- **Localized RCC**: Partial or radical nephrectomy [^116gQMdU].
- **Advanced/metastatic RCC**: Immunotherapy (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and targeted therapy (e.g. sunitinib, cabozantinib) [^1138x2gG] [^111RiGdG] [^1126nwWB].
- **Non-clear cell RCC**: Tailored systemic therapy based on histology and molecular features [^111bmKik] [^116ooFv3].

Nitrofurantoin is not mentioned in RCC guidelines or **recommended for RCC treatment** [^113yyQqE] [^1138x2gG] [^111RiGdG].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of nitrofurantoin in RCC patients

Nitrofurantoin has **significant adverse effects**, particularly in patients with impaired renal function, which is common in RCC:

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Acute, subacute, or chronic reactions, including interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis [^114vo7DK] [^1143psB9].
- **Hepatotoxicity**: Hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis [^114vo7DK].
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Severe or irreversible neuropathy, especially with renal impairment [^114vo7DK].
- **Hemolytic anemia**: Risk in G6PD deficiency [^114vo7DK] [^116tU8TY].
- **Contraindications**: Anuria, oliguria, or significant renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min) [^115PzKqu] [^116S2cxS].

Given these risks and the lack of benefit, nitrofurantoin **should not be used** in patients with RCC.

---

## Ongoing research or clinical trials

There are **no ongoing trials** evaluating nitrofurantoin in RCC. Current research focuses on immunotherapy, targeted therapies, and novel agents, not on nitrofurantoin.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Nitrofurantoin is **not indicated or effective** for RCC [^1171fh9J]. It is an antibacterial for uncomplicated UTIs [^113dDvwq] with no anticancer activity in RCC [^113yyQqE]. Current RCC care relies on surgery, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies [^1138x2gG]; nitrofurantoin is **not included** in any guideline or trial. Its use in RCC is unsupported and may cause harm, especially in patients with impaired renal function [^115PzKqu] [^114vo7DK].

### Nitrofurantoin [^1171fh9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) are specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species. Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) and other antibacterial drugs, nitrofurantoin should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients treated with nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) may experience persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals), other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected.

### How to select amongst available options for the treatment of advanced RCC [^1113sSu6]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of renal cell carcinoma has dramatically changed in the past six years with the approval of seven new drugs since 2006. Although treatment algorithms have been reported and updated every year since 2006, the choice of targeted therapy is not always easy. Selecting a targeted agent in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) should take into account various parameters, including the status of the disease, the histology, the status of the patient, and finally, the availability of the drugs in each country. In addition, in front of every patient, the physician will need to raise important questions such as whether the patient should be treated, whether they should receive surgery, and also what their prognostic group is. The different options are described in this manuscript.

The NCCN guidelines for kidney cancer focus on the screening, diagnosis, staging, treatment, and management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Patients with relapsed or stage IV RCC typically undergo surgery and/or receive systemic therapy. Tumor histology and risk stratification of patients are important in therapy selection. The NCCN guidelines for kidney cancer stratify treatment recommendations by histology; recommendations for first-line treatment of ccRCC are also stratified by risk group. To further guide management of advanced RCC, the NCCN kidney cancer panel has categorized all systemic kidney cancer therapy regimens as "Preferred", "Other Recommended Regimens", or "Useful in Certain Circumstances". This categorization provides guidance on treatment selection by considering the efficacy, safety, evidence, and other factors that play a role in treatment selection. These factors include pre-existing comorbidities, nature of the disease, and in some cases, consideration of access to agents. This article summarizes surgical and systemic therapy recommendations for patients with relapsed or stage IV RCC.

### The role of antimicrobial prophylaxis in laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma [^1166Z6H1]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

There has been inadequate evidence on the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) for laparoscopic nephrectomy until now. Using large-scale Chinese patient data, our study found that the nonuse of AMP had an equivalent effect on postoperative infection compared to AMP use in patients receiving laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

We focused on a consecutive cohort undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy and found that 44.4% of patients received no AMP. The median duration of AMP was three days in the AMP group, similar to the Japanese Urological Association guideline recommendation. The overall infection rate was 4.6% in the whole cohort, similar to the infection rates reported in previous studies. Our analysis revealed that the infection rates of the AMP and non-AMP groups were similar, and AMP use had no effect on the occurrence of infection events, despite a lesser increase in pre- and post-operative WBC counts in the AMP group.

Subgroup analysis showed that AMP use did not decrease infection rates in patients undergoing either partial nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy, despite partial nephrectomy being a risk factor for the occurrence of infection events. Additionally, the addition and upgrade of antibiotics were adequate to control postoperative infection. Therefore, AMP may not be a necessary perioperative procedure in laparoscopic nephrectomy for RCC.

### Afinitordisperz [^111KKmzK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

An international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial (RECORD-1, NCT00410124) compared AFINITOR 10 mg once daily with a placebo, both in conjunction with best supportive care (BSC), in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. Prior therapy with bevacizumab, interleukin 2, or interferon-α was also permitted. Randomization was stratified according to prognostic score and prior anticancer therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure for the trial was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST, based on a blinded, independent, central radiologic review. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label AFINITOR. Other outcome measures included overall survival (OS).

In total, 416 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive AFINITOR (n = 277) or placebo (n = 139). Demographics were well balanced between the arms, with a median age of 61 years; 77% male, 88% white, 74% received prior sunitinib or sorafenib, and 26% received both sequentially.

AFINITOR was superior to placebo for PFS. The treatment effect was similar across prognostic scores and prior sunitinib and/or sorafenib treatments. Final OS results yielded a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.14), with no statistically significant difference between the arms. Planned cross-over from placebo due to disease progression to open-label AFINITOR occurred in 80% of the 139 patients and may have confounded the OS benefit.

### Nitrofurantoin [^115PzKqu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**: Anuria, oliguria, or significant impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance under 60 mL per minute or clinically significant elevated serum creatinine) are contraindications. Treatment in these patients carries an increased risk of toxicity because of impaired excretion of the drug.

	- Because of the possibility of hemolytic anemia due to immature erythrocyte enzyme systems (glutathione instability), the drug is contraindicated in pregnant patients at term (38 to 42 weeks' gestation), during labor and delivery, or when the onset of labor is imminent. For the same reason, the drug is contraindicated in neonates under one month of age.

	- Nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) are contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with nitrofurantoin. Nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) are also contraindicated in those patients with known hypersensitivity to nitrofurantoin.

### The changing face of renal-cell carcinoma [^115RWD5j]. Journal of Endourology (2010). Low credibility.

The present decade can be credited with the improved understanding of renal-cell carcinoma (RCC), its local and systemic management, and various controversies from diagnosis to types of various available interventions. The old paradigms and dogmas are no longer accepted as "the best way" without evidence, and many "old" principles are cautiously questioned. These notions have resulted in new knowledge, questions, arguments, and treatment options.

This article describes the "changing face of RCC" over the past several years and briefly summarizes the major changes and issues in the field of renal oncology. The discussed topics include improved molecular understanding of RCC, management of small renal masses, the safety and accuracy of renal mass biopsy, the emerging role of molecular imaging, the importance of maximal renal preservation, and the evolving role of laparoscopy, robotics, and ablation.

### Current clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma: A systematic review and critical evaluation [^1177Db3Y]. The Oncologist (2017). High credibility.

The landscape of local and systemic therapy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is rapidly changing. The increase in the incidental finding of small renal tumors has led to more frequent application of nephron-sparing procedures. Additionally, ten novel agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the mammalian target of rapamycin pathways, or inhibiting the interaction of the programmed death 1 receptor with its ligand, have been approved since 2006 and have significantly improved the prognosis of metastatic RCC (mRCC).

These rapid developments have resulted in continuous changes in the respective clinical practice guidelines and expert recommendations. We conducted a systematic review of the existing guidelines in MEDLINE, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses statement. Our goal was to identify areas of agreement and discrepancy among them and to evaluate the underlying reasons for these discrepancies.

- **Data synthesis**: Identified selection criteria for nonsurgical approaches in renal masses; the role of modern laparoscopic techniques in the context of partial nephrectomy; selection criteria for cytoreductive nephrectomy and metastasectomy in mRCC; systemic therapy of metastatic non-clear-cell renal cancers; and optimal sequence of available agents in mRCC relapsed after anti-VEGF therapy as the major areas of uncertainty.

Agreement or uncertainty was not always correlated with the availability of data from phase III randomized controlled trials. Our review suggests that the combination of systematic review and critical evaluation can define areas of consistency and highlight uncertainties in practice.

### Nitrofurantoin immune-mediated drug-induced liver injury: A serious complication of a commonly prescribed medication [^113zZpXo]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Nitrofurantoin is recommended as a first-line prophylaxis for urinary tract infections. Despite several side effects, it is increasingly prescribed due to its high efficacy, low cost, and minimal antimicrobial resistance. Nitrofurantoin-induced immune-mediated liver injury is a particularly serious complication, resulting in both acute hepatic failure and cirrhosis with continued use. We describe the course of two patients who recently presented to our hospital to highlight this issue.

### A network meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant therapy after nephrectomy in renal cell carcinoma [^116yfCpq]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The urinary system is commonly affected by renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a widespread malignant tumor. Locoregional disease is diagnosed in approximately 80% of patients. Nevertheless, even after undergoing a surgical procedure, numerous individuals encounter a relapse, with recurrence rates over a span of five years varying from 10% in patients with low risk to as high as 68% in patients with high risk. Either partial or radical nephrectomy is the typical approach for treating locoregional RCC. Although numerous advancements have been made in treating advanced diseases in recent years, the effectiveness of post-nephrectomy adjuvant therapy remains unclear.

In patients with advanced disease, sunitinib and sorafenib — vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors — have demonstrated the ability to improve progression-free survival. The prolonged utilization of these inhibitors in advanced stages has been noted to enhance the median overall survival period from 13 months to more than 29 months.

The probability of recurrence within the initial five years after the procedure was highest among patients who were considered free of disease following nephrectomy for RCC. Nearly all T4 patients experience relapse after nephrectomy, approximately 50% of T3 patients, and up to 26% of T2 patients, making the primary tumor stage a widely recognized prognostic indicator. Increased tumor nuclear grade and the existence of sarcomatoid characteristics have also been recognized as separate variables linked to an elevated possibility of disease recurrence.

### Nitrofurantoin [^114vo7DK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Pulmonary reactions**: Acute, subacute, or chronic pulmonary reactions have been observed in patients treated with nitrofurantoin. If these reactions occur, nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals) should be discontinued, and appropriate measures should be taken. Reports have cited pulmonary reactions as a contributing cause of death. Chronic pulmonary reactions, such as diffuse interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or both, can develop insidiously. These reactions occur rarely and generally in patients receiving therapy for six months or longer. Close monitoring of the pulmonary condition of patients receiving long-term therapy is warranted, requiring that the benefits of therapy be weighed against potential risks (see respiratory reactions).

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely. Fatalities have been reported. The onset of chronic active hepatitis may be insidious, and patients should be monitored periodically for changes in biochemical tests indicating liver injury. If hepatitis occurs, the drug should be withdrawn immediately and appropriate measures should be taken.

- **Neuropathy**: Peripheral neuropathy, which may become severe or irreversible, has occurred. Fatalities have been reported. Conditions such as renal impairment (creatinine clearance under 60 mL per minute or clinically significant elevated serum creatinine), anemia, diabetes mellitus, electrolyte imbalance, vitamin B deficiency, and debilitating disease may enhance the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy.

### Nitrofurantoin-induced agranulocytosis [^116qC6e7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced agranulocytosis is a rare, life-threatening adverse reaction characterized by an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500 cells/μL of blood. Nitrofurantoin has been associated with hematological adverse events, but few cases of agranulocytosis have been reported worldwide. We present a case of a 68-year-old woman who experienced fever and agranulocytosis following treatment with nitrofurantoin. An extensive workup for agranulocytosis, including a bone marrow aspirate, was unremarkable. Discontinuation of nitrofurantoin led to a complete recovery of the blood count. This case underscores the importance of monitoring treatments, as widely used drugs are not free from severe adverse reactions.

### Landmarks in the diagnosis and treatment of renal cell carcinoma [^114zvWbr]. Nature Reviews Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of renal cancer, originating from the renal parenchyma. Over the past two decades, the global incidence of RCC has risen by 2% annually. RCC is considered the most lethal among common urological cancers; despite advances in diagnostics, 20–30% of patients present with metastatic disease. A deeper understanding of the genetic basis of RCC has facilitated the development of immune-based and targeted therapies for this chemoresistant cancer. Although there have been promising results in treating advanced disease, overall response rates and durable complete responses remain infrequent. Surgery continues to be the primary treatment modality, particularly for organ-confined disease, with a selective role in managing advanced and metastatic disease. Smaller tumors are increasingly approached with biopsy, minimally invasive interventions, and surveillance. The future holds the promise of multimodal, integrated, and personalized treatment, as further insights into the disease are expected to lead to new therapeutic options.

### Emerging innovative treatment strategies for advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma [^112b23KQ]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common cancer in the United States, with estimates of over 81,000 new diagnoses in the year 2024. The vast majority (approximately 75%-80%) of patients with RCC are diagnosed with the clear cell (ccRCC) subtype. Most patients present with localized disease amenable to definitive nephrectomy; however, between 20% and 40% of patients have been shown to develop metastatic recurrence despite curative-intent local therapy. Additionally, approximately 20%-30% of patients present with advanced or metastatic disease at the time of initial diagnosis.

Over the last two decades, the management of metastatic ccRCC has evolved from cytokine-based therapy, such as interferon-alpha and interleukin-2 (IL-2), to the development of targeted approaches. In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic RCC, marking the first immunotherapeutic agent approved for the treatment of cancer. Although high-dose IL-2 provided a durable survival benefit in a small subset of patients with metastatic RCC, response rates were limited until the development of targeted agents. In 2005 and 2006, sorafenib and sunitinib became the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agents approved for targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, followed by subsequent VEGF and mTOR treatment therapy strategies in the refractory setting. Since 2018, the treatment paradigm has evolved with the introduction and approval of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combination therapies for first-line treatment.

### Screening for and identification of novel agents directed at renal cell carcinoma [^115VnAEB]. Clinical Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

We were interested in identifying novel agents for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) by screening for activities that model renal tumor biology. By searching for relative renal cell sensitivity and leukemia insensitivity among cytotoxicity profiles in the NCI Drug Screen database, we identified 16 potential agents with renal selectivity. We evaluated these agents in 10 RCC cell lines, both of primary and metastatic origin, which were isolated from five patients. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in these cell lines ranged from 0.019 ± 0.013 to 11.4 ± 0.55 μM and were comparable with values obtained with renal cell lines in the NCI Drug Screen panel. Because RCC are slowly growing tumors, we evaluated the compounds on rapidly (27% S phase) or slowly (6% S phase) growing cells.

In contrast to doxorubicin, where cytotoxicity was restricted to rapidly proliferating cells, three compounds (NSC 280074, 281613, and 281817) were more cytotoxic in slowly proliferating cells. NSC 72151 and 268965 were equitoxic for both populations, while NSC 94889, 638850, and 630938 were more cytotoxic in rapidly growing cells. During in vitro time exposure studies, four compounds, namely NSC 268965, 280074, 281613, and 281817, displayed maximum cytotoxicity with as little as 3 hours of exposure time. From an analysis comparing the p53 genotype of the 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Drug Screen with the cytotoxicity profiles for the 16 putative renal compounds, 13 compounds were classified as likely to be indifferent to p53 status. We also developed a panel specificity detection method for the NCI Drug Screen database.

### The evolving role of partial nephrectomy in the management of renal cell carcinoma [^1161CTJd]. Current Oncology Reports (2003). Low credibility.

The surgical management of renal cell carcinoma has undergone critical review over the past decade. Initially treated with radical nephrectomy, renal cell carcinoma is now approached with nephron-sparing surgical techniques. Improved imaging modalities have substantially increased the number of incidental renal tumors detected; with the increasing number of incidentally detected kidney tumors, a size and stage migration has occurred in renal cell carcinoma.

Early studies showed that disease-free survival rates were similar between cancers treated with radical and partial nephrectomy. The standard now is to offer partial nephrectomy as a surgical option to all patients with renal lesions measuring 4.0 cm or smaller, in the setting of a normal contralateral kidney. More recent issues regarding partial nephrectomy concern complication rates and management, renal cell carcinoma multifocality, margin status and distance to normal renal parenchyma, cost analysis, and the development of laparoscopic techniques that duplicate open partial nephrectomy.

The purpose of this review is to outline and analyze these more recent concerns regarding partial nephrectomy.

Dosage and administration: Nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) should be taken with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

- **Adults**: 50 mg to 100 mg four times a day, with the lower dosage level recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

- **Pediatric patients**: 5 to 7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated for those under one month of age.

Therapy should continue for one week or for at least 3 days after achieving sterility of the urine. If the infection persists, reevaluation is necessary.

- **Long-term suppressive therapy**:
	- For adults, a dosage reduction to 50–100 mg at bedtime may suffice.
	- For pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.

### Start of a new era: Management of non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma in 2022 [^114Zs4kZ]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Oncologists are anticipated to treat more patients with renal cell carcinoma now compared to previous generations of physicians. The American Cancer Society estimates that the incidence of renal cell carcinoma is increasing steadily, with an estimated 7.1 cases per 100,000 people in 1975 in contrast to an estimated 16.1 cases per 100,000 people in 2017. In contrast, some other cancers have noted decreasing trends such as colorectal, lung, and stomach cancers. Fortunately, there has been a significant expansion of our understanding of renal cell carcinoma and treatment paradigms for patients with renal cell carcinoma.

The most recent WHO classification system for renal cell carcinoma published in 2016 includes both aggressive and indolent cancers:

- **Aggressive cancers**: clear cell renal cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC), fumarate-hydratase deficient renal cell carcinoma (fhRCC), chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC), collecting duct carcinoma (CDC), renal medullary carcinoma (RMC), MiT family translocation renal cell carcinomas (tRCC), succinate dehydrogenase deficient renal cell carcinoma (SDDRCC), unclassified renal cell carcinoma (uRCC).

- **Indolent cancers**: multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential, mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma, tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma, acquired cystic disease–associated renal cell carcinoma, clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma, papillary adenoma, oncocytoma.

This review will focus on the more aggressive subtypes including PRCC, fhRCC, chRCC, CDC, RMC, tRCC, and uRCC.

### New drug toxicities in the onco-nephrology world [^112c9nzh]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

New anticancer medications are rapidly entering the clinical arena, offering patients with previously resistant cancers the promise of more effective therapies capable of extending their lives. However, adverse renal consequences develop in treated patients with underlying risk factors, requiring the nephrology community to be familiar with the nephrotoxic effects. The most common clinical nephrotoxic manifestations of these drugs include acute kidney injury, varying levels of proteinuria, hypertension, electrolyte disturbances, and at times chronic kidney disease. Thus, to practice competently in the 'onco-nephrology' arena, nephrologists will garner benefit from an update on older drugs with newly recognized nephrotoxic potential as well as newer agents, which may be associated with kidney injury. With that in mind, this brief update is meant to provide clinicians with the currently available evidence on the nephrotoxicity of a group of anticancer medications.

### Optimizing recent advances in metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^111YGrmY]. Current Oncology Reports (2009).

The past few years have seen dramatic advances in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Dissection of the molecular pathways that regulate proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis has led to the development of targeted therapies such as the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib, the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab, and a class of rapamycin analogues including everolimus and temsirolimus. Each of these agents has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with metastatic RCC. The challenge before us is to expand on these successes by identifying which patients will best respond to these targeted therapies. Additionally, optimizing the proper combination or sequence of available therapies, developing agents with improved side effect profiles, and identifying novel therapeutic targets are essential to expand our armamentarium in the treatment of RCC.

### Recommendations for the management of rare kidney cancers [^115J3kEw]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The European Association of Urology Renal Cell Carcinoma Guideline Panel recently conducted a systematic review of treatment options for patients with advanced non-clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), which showed a substantial lack of evidence for management recommendations.

To improve the outcomes of patients with rare kidney cancers (RKCs), we performed a subsequent unstructured review to determine treatment strategies and druggable pathways. This involved key stakeholders with a global perspective to generate recommendations.

Based on the systematic review, literature was queried in PubMed, Medline, and abstracts from proceedings of the European Society for Medical Oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology, in addition to consulting key opinion leaders and stakeholders. A conventional narrative review strategy was adopted to summarize the data.

The systematic review indicated an absence of evidence for treating RKCs, with data only supporting sunitinib or MET inhibitors for some specific subtypes. However, a growing body of evidence implicates druggable pathways in specific RKC subtypes. To test hypotheses, the small patient numbers in each subtype require coordinated multicenter efforts. Many RKC patients are currently excluded from studies or are not analyzed using subtype-specific parameters, despite their unmet medical need.

We recognize the need for additional multicenter studies and subtype-specific analyses; however, we present management recommendations based on the available data.

### Nitrofurantoin [^1143psB9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Respiratory reactions may be chronic, subacute, or acute:

- **Chronic pulmonary reactions**: These generally occur in patients who have received continuous treatment for six months or longer. Common manifestations include malaise, dyspnea on exertion, cough, and altered pulmonary function, which can develop insidiously. Radiologic and histologic findings often reveal diffuse interstitial pneumonitis or fibrosis, or both. While fever is rarely prominent, the severity of chronic pulmonary reactions and the degree of resolution appear to be related to the duration of therapy after the first clinical signs appear. Pulmonary function may be permanently impaired even after cessation of therapy, with greater risks when reactions are not recognized early.

- **Subacute pulmonary reactions**: Fever and eosinophilia are less common than in the acute form. Recovery may take several months after therapy cessation. Symptoms might worsen if not recognized as drug-related and nitrofurantoin therapy is not stopped.

- **Acute pulmonary reactions**: These are commonly manifested by fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltration with consolidation or pleural effusion visible on x-ray, and eosinophilia. Acute reactions usually occur within the first week of treatment and are reversible with the cessation of therapy. Resolution is often dramatic.

- **Cardiac impacts**: Changes in EKG, such as non-specific ST/T wave changes and bundle branch block, have been reported.

Defining rational follow-up guidelines for patients treated for cancer is important from both a medical and economic perspective. Renal-cell carcinoma is reputed to be unpredictable in its course, and only a few, often contradictory, follow-up guidelines exist for patients treated for nonmetastatic renal-cell carcinoma. Recent advances in tumor biology have contributed to a better understanding of this cancer and have indicated that personalized follow-up regimens, based on tumor and host molecular characteristics, might be possible in the near future.

### Furadantin [^111YMvTh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Nitrofurantoin is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Pharmacodynamic effects of Furadantin are unknown.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:

- **Absorption**: Orally administered Furadantin is readily absorbed. Blood concentrations at therapeutic dosage are usually low.

- **Effect of food**: The presence of food or agents delaying gastric emptying can increase the bioavailability of Furadantin.

- **Distribution**: Nitrofurantoin is highly soluble in urine. It lacks the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections.

- **Elimination**:
	- **Excretion**: Nitrofurantoin is rapidly excreted in urine, to which it may impart a brown color. Following a dose regimen of 100 mg four times a day for 7 days, average urinary drug recoveries (0 hour to 24 hours) on Day 1 and Day 7 were 42.7% and 43.6%. Nitrofurantoin is dialyzable.

- **Specific populations**: The pharmacokinetics of Furadantin are unknown for geriatric patients, pediatric patients, patients with hepatic impairment, or pregnant women. Differences between male and female patients, and racial or ethnic groups are unknown.

- **Patients with renal impairment**: The reported urinary recoveries of nitrofurantoin following a single 100 mg oral dose and 100 mg four times a day in patients with varying renal function showed an approximate linear relationship between the amount of nitrofurantoin recovered and creatinine clearance.

- **Drug interaction studies**:

### Treatment of renal cell carcinoma: Current status and future directions [^1149FLxB]. CA (2017). Low credibility.

Over the past 12 years, medical treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has transitioned from a nonspecific immune approach during the cytokine era to targeted therapy against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and now to novel immunotherapy agents. Multiple agents, including molecules targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and related receptors; inhibitors of other targets, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin and the MET and AXL tyrosine-protein kinase receptors; and an immune-checkpoint inhibitor, have been approved based on significant activity in patients with advanced RCC.

Despite these advances, important questions remain regarding biomarkers of efficacy, patient selection, and the optimal combination and sequencing of agents. The purpose of this review is to summarize present management and explore future directions in the treatment of metastatic RCC.

TARGET (NCT00073307) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who had received one prior systemic therapy. The primary study endpoints included overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS), with tumor response rate as a secondary endpoint. The PFS analysis comprised 769 patients stratified by MSKCC (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) prognostic risk category (low or intermediate) and country. Patients were randomized to receive NEXAVAR 400 mg twice daily (N = 384) or a placebo (N = 385).

- **Demographic and disease characteristics**: Table 11 summarizes the demographic and disease characteristics of the study population. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across both treatment groups. The median time from initial diagnosis of RCC to randomization was 1.6 years in the NEXAVAR arm and 1.9 years in the placebo arm.

- **Race data**: Race was not collected from the 186 patients enrolled in France due to local regulations, and race information was unavailable for 8 additional patients at the time of analysis.

- **Progression-free survival (PFS)**: PFS was defined as the time from randomization to either progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred earlier. This was evaluated through a blinded independent radiological review using RECIST criteria. Figure 2 illustrates the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS. The PFS analysis employed a two-sided Log-Rank test stratified by MSKCC prognostic risk category and country.

### Breaking through a plateau in renal cell carcinoma therapeutics: Development and incorporation of biomarkers [^117Wozn1]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

With the Food and Drug Administration approval of six novel targeted agents since December 2005 and limited comparative trials to discern relative efficacy, the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has become immensely complex. The research community must look to novel ways to identify appropriate candidates for targeted therapies; one potential strategy is the use of clinical and molecular biomarkers. A growing body of knowledge related to von Hippel Lindau-driven pathways in this disease has highlighted the potential role of hypoxia-inducible factor subtypes in distinguishing RCC patients clinically. Techniques applied in other malignancies, such as gene expression and proteomic profiling, may also allow for clinical stratification.

An emerging understanding of immunologic phenomena that may affect cancer progression, such as tumor infiltration by CD68 lymphocytes and memory T-cells, has unveiled several potential biomarkers of response. Several vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-directed therapies, classically thought to function as antiangiogenics, may also have complex effects on the tumor microenvironment, including the associated immune cell milieu. As such, immunologic parameters could potentially predict response to therapies. Finally, clinical biomarkers, such as hypertension, may predict the efficacy of several currently available targeted agents, although the implementation of such biomarkers remains challenging. Herein, the clinical relevance of putative RCC biomarkers is examined in detail.

### Renal cell carcinoma [^117JSwKK]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

The treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed greatly over the past 15 years. Progress in the surgical management of the primary tumor and increased understanding of the molecular biology and genomics of the disease have led to the development of new therapeutic agents. The management of the primary tumor has changed owing to the realization that clean margins around the primary lesion are sufficient to prevent local recurrence, as well as the development of more sophisticated tools and techniques that increase the safety of partial nephrectomy.

The management of advanced disease has altered even more dramatically as a result of new agents that target the tumor vasculature or that attenuate the activation of intracellular oncogenic pathways. This review summarizes data from prospective randomized phase III studies on the surgical management and systemic treatment of RCC, and provides an up-to-date summary of the histology, genomics, staging, and prognosis of RCC. It describes the management of the primary tumor and offers an overview of systemic agents that form the mainstay of treatment for advanced disease. The review concludes with an introduction to the exciting new class of immunomodulatory agents that are currently in clinical trials and may form the basis of a new therapeutic approach for patients with advanced RCC.

- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism by which nitrofurantoin acts is unusual among antibacterials. It is reduced by bacterial flavoproteins to reactive intermediates that inactivate or alter bacterial ribosomal proteins and other macromolecules. This leads to the inhibition of vital biochemical processes, including protein synthesis, aerobic energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell wall synthesis. At therapeutic doses, nitrofurantoin becomes bactericidal in urine. This broad-based mode of action may explain why acquired bacterial resistance to nitrofurantoin is rare, as the multiple and simultaneous mutations required would likely be lethal to the bacteria.

- **Interactions with other antibiotics**: Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between nitrofurantoin and quinolone antimicrobials; however, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

- **Development of resistance**: Since its introduction in 1953, resistance to nitrofurantoin has not been a significant issue. Cross-resistance with other antibiotics and sulfonamides has not been observed, and transferable resistance is extremely rare.

Nitrofurantoin has been shown to be active against most strains of certain bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections. Refer to the "Indications and Usage" section for more information on these microorganisms, including aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms like Staphylococcus aur.

### Targeted therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma [^114Etgv4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Advanced renal cell carcinoma has been resistant to drug therapy of different types, and new types of drug therapy are needed. Targeted agents inhibit known molecular pathways involved in cellular proliferation and neoangiogenesis, which is the induction by the tumor of host microvascular networks. Angiogenesis is of special interest in the clear cell histologic subtype of renal cancer because of its vascularity and constitutively activated hypoxia-inducible pathway in the majority of tumors.

- **Objectives**:
	1) To provide a systematic review of studies testing targeted agents.
	2) To identify the type and degree of clinical benefit, if any, of targeted agents over the prior standard of care, particularly any impact on overall survival.

- **Search strategy**:
	1) Electronic search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases.
	2) Hand search of international cancer meeting abstracts and other sources specified in the protocol.

- **Selection criteria**:
	- Randomized controlled studies of targeted agents in patients with advanced renal cell cancer reporting major remission rates or overall survival by allocation. Progression-free survival (PFS) was adopted as an additional outcome because PFS was a commonly chosen primary outcome and because several pivotal studies allowed crossover from the control to the investigational arm after closure to accrual, thereby making overall survival a problematic endpoint.

- **Data collection and analysis**:
	- Nineteen fully eligible studies tested ten different targeted agents. One additional study was excluded because no outcome data by allocation have been reported.

### Furadantin [^115wNxhf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **Antacids**: Antacids containing magnesium trisilicate, when administered concomitantly with nitrofurantoin, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption. The mechanism for this interaction is likely adsorption of nitrofurantoin onto the surface of magnesium trisilicate. If coadministration of Furadantin with antacids containing magnesium trisilicate cannot be avoided, monitor for lack of efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- **Uricosuric drugs**: Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin. The resulting increase in nitrofurantoin serum levels may elevate toxicity, while the decreased urinary levels could reduce its efficacy as a urinary tract antibacterial. Therefore, monitor for nitrofurantoin adverse reactions when co-administering Furadantin with uricosuric drugs.

- **Drug interference with laboratory tests**: The presence of nitrofurantoin can cause a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine when using Benedict's or Fehling's copper reduction reaction to determine the amount of reducing substances like glucose in the urine. Use glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions to detect glucose in the urine.

### The current role for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy in renal cell cancer [^1133H1pN]. Current Opinion in Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Here we explore the recent and relevant trials for the treatment of renal cell cancer (RCC) in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, as well as recent updates to the guidelines for RCC management.

- **Recent findings**: Most phase III studies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting have been negative. Notably, sunitinib received regulatory approval by the FDA after showing improved disease-free survival in high-risk populations. Recent improvements in the genetic classification and understanding of RCC molecular and genetic disorders will hopefully improve patient selection. Recent advances in metastatic RCC treatment, particularly with the combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, have given rise to hope that advances can be made by moving these treatment strategies forward to the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings.

- **Summary**: In the absence of a clinical trial, observation remains the standard of care. Based on the S-TRAC data, sunitinib is approved for use in the adjuvant setting and can be considered under select circumstances. Although there is optimism for checkpoint monotherapy and combination therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, ongoing studies will determine clinical benefit and tolerability in this setting. Therefore, for patients with a high risk of recurrence, clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitor therapy are viable options.

### Nitrofurantoin [^112XnjPh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Geriatric use:

Clinical studies of nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

Spontaneous reports suggest a higher proportion of pulmonary reactions, including fatalities, in elderly patients; these differences appear to be related to the higher proportion of elderly patients receiving long-term nitrofurantoin therapy. As in younger patients, chronic pulmonary reactions generally are observed in patients receiving therapy for six months or longer (see WARNINGS). Spontaneous reports also suggest an increased proportion of severe hepatic reactions, including fatalities, in elderly patients (see WARNINGS).

In general, the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy should be considered when prescribing nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals). This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Anuria, oliguria, or significant impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance under 60 mL per minute or clinically significant elevated serum creatinine) are contraindications (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma: How new biological insight may lead to new therapeutic modalities [^111uuAmr]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment for patients with metastatic non-clear cell renal cancer (RCC), who constitute 25% of all RCC patients, is largely undefined, and tested algorithms remain unsatisfactory. Response rates to targeted therapy are not as high as in patients with clear cell subtypes, but novel agents provide a clinically meaningful response in some individuals. The research leading to the characterization of the pathways involved in clear cell renal cancer has been recognized as a role model for the development of therapies based on genetic and molecular tumor characteristics. Similar research now provides increasing insight into signal transduction in non-clear cell subtypes.

- **Evidence of pathways**: This review will present and discuss the evidence of pathways involved in the most common non-clear cell subtypes. In addition, we will review how this may lead to the development of new treatment modalities. New targets and clinical trials will be highlighted.

### Renal cell carcinoma [^111nu4Rm]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

Considerable progress has been made in the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, with innovative surgical and systemic strategies revolutionizing the management of this disease. In localized disease, partial nephrectomy for small tumors and radical nephrectomy for large tumors continue to be the gold-standard treatments, with emphasis on approaches that have reduced invasiveness and preserve renal function. Additionally, cytoreductive nephrectomy is often indicated before the start of systemic treatment in patients with metastatic disease as part of an integrated management strategy. The effectiveness of immunotherapy, although previously widely used for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, is still controversial and is mainly reserved for patients with good prognostic factors. Development of treatments that target specific biological pathways has been the main advance in treatment. Targeted drugs, including inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways, have shown robust effectiveness and offer new therapeutic options for patients with metastatic disease.

### Emerging innovative treatment strategies for advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma [^1141hkXJ]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Biological discoveries in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have translated into the development of multiple treatment options. Over the past three decades, the treatment paradigm has dramatically shifted with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), now the cornerstone of metastatic RCC management either alone or in combination with targeted agents. Although these advances have revolutionized treatment options for metastatic RCC, questions remain on how to optimally approach management of relapsed or refractory disease. This article will explore the pivotal findings regarding the pathogenesis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and how these discoveries have influenced novel treatments for this disease.

### The role of antimicrobial prophylaxis in laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma [^114xtK6B]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The overall 30-day postoperative infection rate was 5.0% (28/556) in the antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) group and 4.1% (18/444) in the non-AMP group; this difference in infection rates was not significant (P = 0.461). In the AMP group, 3 patients experienced surgical site infections (SSI), and 25 patients had respiratory infections (RI). Similarly, in the non-AMP group, 3 patients underwent SSI, and 15 patients had RI. The detailed infection events are shown in Table 4.

In terms of secondary outcomes, the increase in pre- and post-operative white blood cell (WBC) counts was 85.5% (58.0%, 121.8%) in the AMP group, significantly lower than 97.0% (67.3%, 124.8%) in the non-AMP group (P = 0.004). The postoperative hospital stays were 5 (4, 6) days in both the AMP and non-AMP groups (P = 0.483). For patients in the non-AMP group, the unplanned addition of antibiotics occurred in 5.0% (22/444) of cases, with 2 patients undergoing SSI and 7 patients having RI. All infection events were well controlled by antibiotics. In the AMP group, antibiotics were upgraded to control infection events in 1 patient with SSI and 4 patients with RI.

### A methodology for determining dosing recommendations for anticancer drugs in patients with reduced kidney function [^114MTGqD]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

Defining the clinical questions

The key clinical questions and the drugs to be addressed in Part 2 were prioritized by the Content Development Working Group and the Guideline Development Team. Three questions were formulated according to the PI/ECO (Patient/Problem, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison or Control, Outcome) approach to aid in the development of specific recommendations:

1. Should elimination by the kidney versus no elimination by the kidney be used to direct dosing of this anticancer drug? This question was answered in the affirmative for drugs with > 30% elimination by the kidney, or where the drug had nephrotoxic potential and/or altered pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in reduced kidney function.

2. Should the KDIGO Chronic Kidney Disease categories be used in the dose adjustment of this anticancer drug in reduced kidney function?

3. Should full dose versus reduced dose of this anticancer drug be used in patients with reduced kidney function?

See Supplementary Material 2 for details on each PI/ECO question.

Identifying evidence

- **Strategy for literature search**: The key clinical questions provided the strategy for a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases, along with a grey literature search and investigation of registered drug product information (Australian, North American, and European) for 59 anticancer drugs [Supplementary Material 3, literature search strategy]. The searches were limited to studies in humans, with laboratory and animal studies excluded. Identified records were screened for eligibility and assessed against the defined clinical criteria.

### Nitrofurantoin [^115oTCmU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: Nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals) is a larger crystal form of nitrofurantoin. The absorption of nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals) is slower, and its excretion is somewhat less compared to nitrofurantoin. Blood concentrations at therapeutic dosages are usually low. It is highly soluble in urine, to which it may impart a brown color.

Following a dose regimen of 100 mg four times a day for 7 days, average urinary drug recoveries (0 to 24 hours) on day 1 and day 7 were 37.9% and 35.0% respectively.

Unlike many drugs, the presence of food or agents delaying gastric emptying can increase the bioavailability of nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals), presumably by allowing better dissolution in gastric juices.
