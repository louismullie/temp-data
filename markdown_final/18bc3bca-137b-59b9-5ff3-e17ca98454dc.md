## Question

How does the measurement of urine osmolality help in diagnosing diabetes insipidus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how urine osmolality helps in diagnosing diabetes insipidus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of diabetes insipidus and why urine osmolality is the right target metric. Then, I should verify the initial screening thresholds and the principle of inappropriately dilute urine in the face of hyperosmolality. Next, I will examine the water deprivation test and its diagnostic cutoffs, followed by the desmopressin response phase to distinguish central from nephrogenic disease. After that, I should review limitations and confounders, including primary polydipsia and partial forms, and consider how copeptin-based testing refines the differential. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and highlight special scenarios like postoperative DI and pediatrics, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality studies.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by impaired urine concentration due to either arginine vasopressin deficiency (central DI) or renal resistance to AVP (nephrogenic DI), resulting in large volumes of hypotonic urine and compensatory polydipsia; thus, urine osmolality directly reflects the kidney's concentrating capacity and the integrity of the AVP–V2–aquaporin-2 axis, which is exactly why we measure it diagnostically [^6d82e39b] [^5ba46e12].

> Wait, let me verify the initial screening principle before jumping to tests. In a patient with polyuria, if serum osmolality is high (generally ≥ 295–300 mOsm/kg) and urine osmolality is inappropriately low (< 300 mOsm/kg), that pattern supports DI and should prompt formal testing; conversely, if urine osmolality is high (approximately ≥ 600 mOsm/kg), that argues against clinically significant AVP deficiency or resistance, though I should double-check for confounders like primary polydipsia or partial forms before excluding DI outright [^3347c930] [^a1cc6ecb] [^7ec924a0].

> Next, I should review the water deprivation test, the historical gold standard. Hold on, I should verify the protocol and cutoffs. A supervised fluid restriction with serial measurements of urine and serum osmolality is performed, typically for about 8 hours, with termination if weight loss exceeds 3% or if safety thresholds are reached; failure to concentrate urine above 300 mOsm/kg during deprivation supports DI, whereas concentration above roughly 600–800 mOsm/kg makes significant AVP deficiency or resistance unlikely, though I need to remember that partial forms and primary polydipsia can blur this boundary [^f1d8b4a8] [^7ec924a0].

> I will now examine the desmopressin response phase to separate central from nephrogenic DI. After deprivation, administering desmopressin and tracking urine osmolality for several hours allows us to distinguish a > 50% rise in urine osmolality (consistent with AVP deficiency responding to exogenous hormone) from a blunted response (< 50% rise), which indicates renal resistance; I initially thought a post-DDAVP urine osmolality > 800 mOsm/kg defined central DI, but wait, I should correct that — the key discriminator is the relative increase from baseline rather than an absolute post-DDAVP value, even though many normals can exceed 800 mOsm/kg when maximally concentrated [^f1d8b4a8] [^7ec924a0].

> But wait, what if the patient has primary polydipsia or a partial defect. I need to ensure I acknowledge limitations. Primary polydipsia can blunt urine concentration due to medullary washout, causing overlap in the 300–800 mOsm/kg range and potentially misleading desmopressin responses; similarly, partial central DI and partial nephrogenic DI can show intermediate osmolalities, reducing test specificity and often necessitating repeat testing or adjunctive measures, which is why the classic test has only about 70–77% diagnostic accuracy in some series [^7ec924a0] [^eeeea1d3].

> Let me consider how copeptin testing refines this. Hypertonic saline–stimulated copeptin markedly improves differentiation between central DI and primary polydipsia, with a validated cutoff around 4.9 pmol/L providing about 96% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming the water deprivation test; baseline copeptin > 21.4 pmol/L can identify nephrogenic DI without any deprivation, which is a practical shortcut when available, though I should confirm assay access and safety protocols for hypertonic saline before recommending it routinely [^0197102c] [^5fa70f9f] [^b3a1b50c].

> Hold on, I should verify special contexts. In the immediate postoperative setting after pituitary surgery, polyuria with low urine osmolality and rising serum sodium or osmolality is sufficient to diagnose DI without a formal water deprivation test; a triphasic pattern is well described, and early desmopressin may be indicated while monitoring closely for transition phases, so I need to ensure frequent fluid balance checks and sodium surveillance in this window [^e1b6acbc] [^a3dbb422].

> I need to check pediatric nuances. In children, a simplified approach using paired urine and plasma osmolality after a few hours of fluid deprivation can be effective, and many centers still rely on supervised water deprivation with desmopressin response; infants and young children are at higher risk of dehydration, so safety monitoring is essential, and first-line therapy in neonates often uses thiazides and low-solute feeds to mitigate sodium swings until a definitive diagnosis and desmopressin dosing are established [^c9503441] [^8e15d9d9].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and make sure it aligns with evidence. Start with simultaneous serum and urine osmolality in a patient with polyuria; if serum osmolality is high and urine osmolality is inappropriately low, proceed to a supervised water deprivation test with desmopressin response, interpreting a > 50% rise in urine osmolality as central DI and a < 50% rise as nephrogenic DI; if results are equivocal or if differentiating partial central DI from primary polydipsia is critical, add hypertonic saline–stimulated copeptin using the 4.9 pmol/L threshold, recognizing that baseline copeptin > 21.4 pmol/L identifies nephrogenic DI without further testing; throughout, keep primary polydipsia and assay or protocol limitations in mind to avoid misclassification [^3347c930] [^f1d8b4a8] [^0197102c] [^5fa70f9f].

> Finally, I should confirm that urine osmolality remains indispensable even as copeptin gains ground. Urine osmolality is the direct clinical readout of renal concentrating ability and is central to both screening and dynamic testing; while copeptin improves diagnostic accuracy and can streamline the workup, it complements rather than replaces urine osmolality, and access or safety constraints mean many clinicians will still rely on carefully performed water deprivation testing with osmolality endpoints for the foreseeable future [^6d82e39b] [^0197102c] [^7ec924a0].

---

Urine osmolality is central to diagnosing diabetes insipidus (DI) because it reveals the kidney's inability to concentrate urine despite hyperosmolality [^6d82e39b]. In DI, urine osmolality is **inappropriately low (< 300 mOsm/kg)** during water deprivation, whereas normal individuals concentrate to > 800 mOsm/kg [^f1d8b4a8]. A **water deprivation test** distinguishes central DI (urine concentrates > 50% after desmopressin) from nephrogenic DI (no meaningful rise) [^f1d8b4a8]. Baseline copeptin > 21 pmol/L suggests nephrogenic DI, while stimulated copeptin > 4.9 pmol/L differentiates central DI from primary polydipsia with high accuracy [^5fa70f9f] [^0197102c]. Urine osmolality is the key parameter for confirming DI and guiding therapy [^3347c930].

## Physiological basis of urine osmolality in diabetes insipidus

Urine osmolality reflects the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, primarily governed by **vasopressin (AVP)** and aquaporin-2 water channels [^5ba46e12]. In DI, this process is impaired: central DI from AVP deficiency, and nephrogenic DI from renal resistance to AVP [^6d82e39b]. Normally, dehydration raises plasma osmolality, triggering AVP release and urine concentration to > 800 mOsm/kg; in DI, urine remains dilute (< 300 mOsm/kg) despite hyperosmolality [^f1d8b4a8].

---

## Diagnostic thresholds and interpretation

| **Condition** | **Urine osmolality (mosm/kg)** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal individuals | > 800 after dehydration | Normal concentrating ability |
| Central DI | < 300 during deprivation; > 50% rise after desmopressin | AVP deficiency |
| Nephrogenic DI | < 300 during deprivation; < 50% rise after desmopressin | Renal resistance to AVP |
| Primary polydipsia | 300–800 after deprivation; < 9% rise after desmopressin | Excess fluid intake blunts concentration |

---

These thresholds are the cornerstone of the **water deprivation test**, the traditional gold standard for DI diagnosis [^f1d8b4a8].

---

## Water deprivation test: clinical procedure and interpretation

The water deprivation test evaluates the kidney's response to fluid restriction and desmopressin:

- **Preparation**: Stop fluids overnight; monitor weight, serum/urine osmolality, and sodium.
- **Deprivation phase**: Restrict fluids 8–16 hours; stop if > 3% weight loss or unsafe hypernatremia.
- **Desmopressin phase**: Give 2 µg IM/IV desmopressin and track urine osmolality for 2–4 hours [^f1d8b4a8].

Interpretation: **urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg during deprivation with a > 50% rise after desmopressin indicates central DI**; **no meaningful rise indicates nephrogenic DI** [^f1d8b4a8].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Primary polydipsia**: Chronic high intake washes out the medullary gradient, causing partial concentration and false positives/negatives [^7ec924a0].
- **Partial DI**: Variable responses complicate interpretation, requiring repeat testing or copeptin [^7ec924a0].
- **Safety**: Prolonged deprivation risks hypernatremia and dehydration, especially in children or the elderly [^notfound].

---

## Role of copeptin in enhancing diagnostic accuracy

Copeptin, a stable AVP surrogate, improves diagnostic precision:

- **Baseline copeptin > 21 pmol/L**: Identifies nephrogenic DI with 100% sensitivity/specificity [^5fa70f9f].
- **Hypertonic saline–stimulated copeptin > 4.9 pmol/L**: Differentiates central DI from primary polydipsia with 96.5% accuracy, surpassing the water deprivation test [^0197102c].
- **Limitations**: Hypertonic saline requires close monitoring; copeptin is less reliable in SIADH and hyponatremia [^7974f917].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Confirming DI with urine osmolality guides therapy: **desmopressin for central DI** and **addressing the cause plus thiazides/AMILORIDE for nephrogenic DI** [^cc2b2c9f] [^5ba46e12]. Monitoring urine osmolality and volume helps titrate therapy and prevent complications such as hyponatremia or hypernatremia [^ce258b34].

---

Urine osmolality is the **key diagnostic marker** for DI, revealing impaired concentration and enabling differentiation of central versus nephrogenic causes when combined with the water deprivation test. Copeptin testing further refines the differential, especially in partial or ambiguous cases [^0197102c].

4 THE ROLE OF COPEPTIN IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF SIAD

4.1 Differential diagnosis of hyponatraemia

Hyponatraemia is defined as a plasma sodium level of <135 mmol/L and characterized by a relative excess of body water compared to total body sodium. 3 Although often neglected in clinical practice, hyponatraemia is an important condition as it is present in up to 30% of hospitalized patients 4, 58 and linked to increased morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. 59, 60, 61 Hyponatraemia is associated with a variety of underlying disorders and may be categorized according to extracellular fluid volume into hypervolemic (eg, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome), hypovolaemic and euvolemic hyponatraemia with SIAD as the most common cause. 62, 63 Main diagnostic criteria for SIAD include plasma osmolality <275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality >100 mOsm/kg and urine sodium concentration >30 mmol/L, euvolemia and absence of adrenal, thyroid or renal insufficiency. 62 Hyponatraemia may further be triggered by diuretic use, primary polydipsia or endocrine conditions (adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism). Discrimination between these pathophysiological categories is crucial as management differs considerably (eg, fluid restriction in SIAD vs intravenous fluid in hypovolaemia), and delayed treatment may lead to devastating consequences such as brain oedema, seizures and coma/death. 64 Unfortunately, the diagnostic approach to hyponatraemia is complex and time‐consuming; clinical signs and symptoms are variable and unspecific and fluid status is difficult to assess. 65, 66 According to current hyponatraemia Clinical Practice Guidelines, 62 laboratory measurements such as urine osmolality and urine sodium as well as the calculation of fractional uric acid excretion are proposed; however, in many cases accurate classification into pathophysiological categories remains cumbersome.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^315a11be]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, copeptin is a valuable and reliable diagnostic marker in the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome. In a patient with unclear polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome, determination of basal copeptin levels is recommended to exclude nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In patients with high suspicion of complete central diabetes insipidus, an overnight water deprivation test might confirm diagnosis provided urine osmolality remains below 300 mosm/kg and plasma sodium levels increase above 147 mmol/L. In all other patients, copeptin measurement after osmotic stimulation with 3% saline solution aiming at a plasma sodium level above 147 mmol/L is recommended (see diagnostic work flow in Figure 4).

The determination of copeptin on the first postoperative day after pituitary surgery is useful to predict the development of central diabetes insipidus.

3.2 Indirect water deprivation test

For decades, the standard diagnostic test for the evaluation of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome was the indirect water deprivation test. 40 Hereby, patients are required to stop any fluid intake from midnight onwards. During the water deprivation period, urinary excretion and urine osmolality as well as plasma sodium and osmolality are measured regularly. Fluid deprivation is continued for a maximum of 17 hours or until a plasma sodium concentration ≥150 mmol/L has been reached or until the patient has lost 3%‐5% of his initial body weight. At this time point, exogenous AVP is administered and the corresponding change in urine osmolality is analysed. Thus, insufficient AVP secretion or effect is indirectly diagnosed by urine osmolality, giving the test the name indirect measurement method. Interpretation of the test results is based on recommendations from Miller et al 40 according to the results of 29 patients with central diabetes insipidus (of whom 11 with a partial form), 2 patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and 5 patients with primary polydipsia. Patients showing a urinary osmolality below 300 mosm/kg during the water deprivation test are classified as complete central diabetes insipidus if the urinary osmolality increased >50% after exogenous AVP injection. Patients staying below this cut‐off are diagnosed with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients with partial central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia are expected to have a urinary osmolality between 300 and 800 mosm/kg upon thirsting. An increase in the urinary osmolality of >9% after AVP administration further differentiates patients with partial central diabetes insipidus from patients with primary polydipsia. However, the proposed cut‐off levels were post hoc derived on a small patient cohort, showed a wide overlap in urinary osmolalities and were never prospectively validated. 40

1 INTRODUCTION

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is the main regulating hormone of body fluid homeostasis. It is secreted from the posterior pituitary upon osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli, with the main osmotic stimulus being increased plasma osmolality and the main nonosmotic stimulus being hypovolaemia and promotes water reabsorption via V2 receptors in the kidney, thereby normalizing hypertonicity and vasomotor tone.

Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyper‐ and hypoosmolar circumstances: the classical hyperosmolar disorder (deficiency of body fluid relative to body solute 1) is diabetes insipidus, while the most common hypoosmolar disorder (excess of body fluid relative to body solute) is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD).

Diabetes insipidus belongs to the polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome and is characterized by a high urinary output of more than 50 ml per kg body weight per 24 hours, accompanied by polydipsia of more than 3 L a day. 2 After exclusion of osmotic diuresis (such as hyperglycaemia), the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome includes impaired AVP synthesis (central diabetes insipidus) or action (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) as well as primary polydipsia.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis is the predominant cause of hyponatraemia 3, 4 and is characterized by reduced free water excretion and secondary natriuresis, 5 mostly due to an imbalanced secretion of the antidiuretic hormone AVP. 6, 7

Arginine vasopressin measurement could theoretically help in the guidance of diagnosis and treatment of body fluid disorders. However, AVP is difficult to measure and unreliable, mainly due to complex pre‐analytical requirements. 8 Copeptin is the C‐terminal segment of the AVP precursor peptide and mirrors AVP concentrations. 9 It can easily be measured providing a reliable surrogate marker for AVP.

This review focuses on copeptin and its role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and SIAD.

Management of DI

In this section, we present the algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of postoperative DI that was reached consensus on at a local level to aid centers that do not have an operational protocol or are yet in the process of developing one. We would like to stress that the diagnostic and treatment process is complex and is both patient and situation dependent. Other centers might use different or adjusted protocols to satisfaction and with similar treatment results. Ideally, a consensus meeting between expert centers or within networks (as Endo-ERN) would be planned to take this further towards a general guideline for postoperative DI.

Diagnosis of postoperative DI (Fig. 1)

Fluid balance should continuously be monitored at six-hour intervals after surgery. A three-hour interval should be used in patients at high risk for DI or experiencing a current episode of DI (see Fig. 1). Specific attention should be given to the fluid balance during transfers between locations (e.g. from the operation room to the recovery room, recovery room to ward, intensive care unit to ward). Furthermore, unnecessary perioperative fluid administration of in the holding or operation room should be discouraged. As glucocorticoids suppress vasopressin release DI in patients with new adrenal insufficiency without glucocorticoid treatment may not become manifest and underestimated. Specific attention should be given to patients in which glucocorticoid treatment is initiated as an episode of DI may be “unmasked”.

These recommendations have led to the following assessment scheme for polyuria (> 300 mL for > 3 consecutive hours), which follows a step-wise approach:
Assessment of urine specific gravity in each urine portion (see Table 1)
If USG is < 1005, assess the presence of unquenchable thirst, preferably with the NRS and measure serum osmolality and/or serum sodium concentration.
In case of unquenchable thirst and/or an increased serum sodium concentration (> 145 mmol/L): diagnose postoperative DI, and treat accordingly (see next paragraph).
Repeat the assessment as stated above every 3 h until the urine production normalizes.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^379458d4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Copeptin is secreted in an equimolar amount to arginine vasopressin (AVP) but can easily be measured in plasma or serum with a sandwich immunoassay. The main stimuli for copeptin are similar to AVP, that is an increase in osmolality and a decrease in arterial blood volume and pressure. A high correlation between copeptin and AVP has been shown. Accordingly, copeptin mirrors the amount of AVP in the circulation. Copeptin has, therefore, been evaluated as diagnostic biomarker in vasopressin-dependent disorders of body fluid homeostasis. Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyper- and hypoosmolar circumstances: the classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus, while the most common hypoosmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Copeptin measurement has led to a "revival" of the direct test in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Baseline copeptin levels, without prior thirsting, unequivocally identify patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In contrast, for the difficult differentiation between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia, a stimulated copeptin level of 4.9 pmol/L upon hypertonic saline infusion differentiates these two entities with a high diagnostic accuracy and is clearly superior to the classical water deprivation test. On the contrary, in the SIAD, copeptin measurement is of only little diagnostic value. Copeptin levels widely overlap in patients with hyponatraemia and emphasize the heterogeneity of the disease. Additionally, a variety of factors lead to unspecific copeptin elevations in the acute setting further complicating its interpretation. The broad use of copeptin as diagnostic marker in hyponatraemia and specifically to detect cancer-related disease in SIADH patients can, therefore, not be recommended.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: how to define and grade this complication? [^a2e5bdc0]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although transient diabetes insipidus (DI) is the most common complication of pituitary surgery, there is no consensus on its definition. Polyuria is the most overt symptoms of DI, but can also reflect several physiological adaptive mechanisms in the postoperative phase. These may be difficult to distinguish from and might coincide with DI. The difficulty to distinguish DI from other causes of postoperative polyuria might explain the high variation in incidence rates. This limits interpretation of outcomes, in particular complication rates between centers, and may lead to unnecessary treatment. Aim of this review is to determine a pathophysiologically sound and practical definition of DI for uniform outcome evaluations and treatment recommendations.

Methods

This study incorporates actual data and the experience of our center and combines this with a review of literature on pathophysiological mechanisms and definitions used in clinical studies reporting of postoperative DI.

Results

The occurrence of excessive thirst and/or hyperosmolality or hypernatremia are the best indicators to discriminate between pathophysiological symptoms and signs of DI and other causes. Urine osmolality distinguishes DI from osmotic diuresis.

Conclusions

To improve reliability and comparability we propose the following definition for postoperative DI: polyuria (urine production>300 ml/hour for 3 h) accompanied by a urine specific gravity (USG)<1.005, and at least one of the following symptoms: excessive thirst, serum osmolality>300 mosmol/kg, or serum sodium>145 mmol/L. To prevent unnecessary treatment with desmopressin, we present an algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative DI.

### Diabetes insipidus in children [^59898e2d]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is one of the common disorders affecting sodium and water homeostasis, and results when ADH is either inadequately produced, or unable to negotiate its actions on the renal collecting tubules through aquaporins. The diagnostic algorithm starts with exclusion of other causes of polyuria and establishing low urine osmolality in the presence of high serum osmolality. In this paper, we have reviewed the diagnosis, etiology and management of DI in children, with special emphasis on recent advances in the field.

### Diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus for the internist: an update [^cc2b2c9f]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Four entities have to be differentiated: central diabetes insipidus resulting from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus resulting from resistance to AVP in the kidneys, gestational diabetes insipidus resulting from an increase in placental vasopressinase and finally primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Distinguishing between the different types of diabetes insipidus can be challenging. A detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to detect the aetiology of diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between the various forms of hypotonic polyuria is then done by the classical water deprivation test or the more recently developed hypertonic saline or arginine stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. In patients with idiopathic central DI, a close follow-up is needed since central DI can be the first sign of an underlying pathology. Treatment of diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. This review will discuss issues and newest developments in diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment, with a focus on central diabetes insipidus.

Abstract

Copeptin is secreted in an equimolar amount to arginine vasopressin (AVP) but can easily be measured in plasma or serum with a sandwich immunoassay. The main stimuli for copeptin are similar to AVP, that is an increase in osmolality and a decrease in arterial blood volume and pressure. A high correlation between copeptin and AVP has been shown. Accordingly, copeptin mirrors the amount of AVP in the circulation. Copeptin has, therefore, been evaluated as diagnostic biomarker in vasopressin‐dependent disorders of body fluid homeostasis. Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyper‐ and hypoosmolar circumstances: the classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus, while the most common hypoosmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Copeptin measurement has led to a “revival” of the direct test in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Baseline copeptin levels, without prior thirsting, unequivocally identify patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

3.3 Direct AVP measurements

Consequently, a recent evaluation of 156 patients with polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome 46 pointed out the problems with this diagnostic test, by reaching a diagnostic accuracy (the percentage of correctly diagnosed patients) of only 77% (sensitivity 86%, specificity 70%).

Already in 1981, Zerbe et al 51 described a different approach including measurement of plasma AVP upon osmotic stimulation into the diagnostic evaluation (thus called the direct measurement method). In their work, AVP levels were evaluated in relation to the area of normality describing the physiological relationship between AVP release and plasma osmolality. Plasma AVP levels above the area of normality were defined as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, levels below as central diabetes insipidus and levels in the normal range were defined as primary polydipsia. 43, 51 Although the study showed that direct measurement of plasma AVP substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy, it failed to be adopted in clinical practice mainly due to the above‐mentioned inherent assay problems. 2, 52

### Diabetes insipidus [^6d82e39b]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Central DI results from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, whereas nephrogenic DI results from resistance to AVP in the kidneys. Central and nephrogenic DI are usually acquired, but genetic causes must be evaluated, especially if symptoms occur in early childhood. Central or nephrogenic DI must be differentiated from primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Primary polydipsia is most common in psychiatric patients and health enthusiasts but the polydipsia in a small subgroup of patients seems to be due to an abnormally low thirst threshold, a condition termed dipsogenic DI. Distinguishing between the different types of DI can be challenging and is done either by a water deprivation test or by hypertonic saline stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. Furthermore, a detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to ensure an accurate DI diagnosis. Treatment of DI or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central DI, nephrogenic DI and primary polydipsia.

Utility of Copeptin Measurement in the Differential Diagnosis of Diabetes Insipidus

Differential Diagnoses of Polyuria–Polydipsia Syndrome

As discussed above, AVP is the main regulatory hormone for salt-water homeostasis. Stimulated by an increase in plasma osmolality or hypovolemia, AVP induces water reabsorption via V2 receptors in the kidneys. Impairment of this process leads to diabetes insipidus, characterized by polyuria of more than 50 mL per kg body weight per 24 hours of hypotonic urine and polydipsia of more than 3 L a day. Diabetes insipidus is further divided into a central and a nephrogenic origin. While the first cause is due to impaired AVP production or secretion upon osmotic or nonosmotic stimulation, the second cause results from renal resistance to AVP.

Central diabetes insipidus is mainly caused by destruction of the producing or secreting cells, leading to a partial or complete form. The main causes are accordingly pituitary surgery, head trauma, and infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis or metastases ; inflammatory or autoimmune disorders such as hypophysitis and familial forms due to a genetic defect leading to impaired AVP synthesis are also known. A rare form, gestational diabetes insipidus, manifests during pregnancy and is caused by increased AVP metabolism due to the placental enzyme vasopressinase.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is mainly secondary to adverse drug effects (lithium), electrolyte disturbances (hypercalemia or hypokalemia) or kidney diseases, resulting in renal insensitivity to AVP and corresponding lack of aquaporin 2–mediated water reabsorption. If discovered early on, these secondary forms are often reversible in contrast to rare congenital forms due to mutations in the AVPR2 or the AQP2 genes.

An important differential diagnosis to central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is primary polydipsia. Here, polyuria–polydipsia occurs despite intact AVP secretion and renal sensitivity. As a result of this chronic excessive fluid intake, the concentration gradient in the renal medulla is continuously reduced with a downregulation of aquaporin 2 channels. Chronic central AVP suppression may also play a role. These factors lead to the excretion of hypotonic urine, making it difficult to distinguish it from diabetes insipidus. Primary polydipsia has been increasingly observed in health conscious people who aim for a high daily water intake; other possible triggers are dependency disorders or a reduced thirst threshold. Severe polydipsia has primarily been described in psychiatric patients.

3 THE ROLE OF COPEPTIN IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES INSIPIDUS

3.1 Polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome

Polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome is a common problem in clinical practice with the main entities being central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. 38

While central diabetes insipidus is characterized by a complete (complete central diabetes insipidus) or partial (partial central diabetes insipidus) insufficient vasopressin (AVP) secretion from the pituitary, 39, 40 nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from an AVP resistance of the kidneys 41 both leading to hypotonic polyuria with compensatory polydipsia. Central diabetes insipidus can result from various conditions affecting the hypothalamic‐neurohypophyseal system such as trauma resulting from surgery or accident, local tumours or metastases, inflammatory/autoimmune or granulomatous diseases. 1, 42 Several reports also described genetic defects in the AVP synthesis leading to inherited forms of central diabetes insipidus. 20, 43 The most challenging form of central diabetes insipidus involves an impairment of the thirst perception and consecutive hypodipsia, which can result in severe hypernatremia. 38, 44

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from a lack of aquaporin 2 (AQP2)‐mediated water reabsorption in the collecting duct. This is either a consequence of gene mutations in the key proteins vasopressin V2 receptor or AQP2, is secondarily triggered by electrolyte disorders or is induced by certain drugs especially lithium. 41

The pathomechanism of primary polydipsia, which is characterized by excessive fluid intake, is less clear. An analysis of 23 patients with profound hyponatraemia due to primary polydipsia revealed an increased prevalence for psychiatric diagnoses such as dependency disorders (43%) and depression (35%). 45 Another prospective study with 156 patients with polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome however showed a similar rate (around 30%) of psychiatric disorders in patients with primary polydipsia and patients with central diabetes insipidus. 46 As chronic excessive fluid intake in patients with primary polydipsia leads to a down‐regulation of the AQP2 channels in the kidneys, the renal medullary concentration gradient is reduced, making any diagnostic evaluation of the urine osmolality and urinary output difficult. 47

Differentiation between the three mentioned entities is important since treatment strategies vary and application of the wrong treatment can be dangerous. 48 However, reliable differentiation is often difficult to achieve, 49 especially in patients with primary polydipsia or partial forms of diabetes insipidus. 2, 50

### The value of urine specific gravity in detecting diabetes insipidus in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus: urine specific gravity in differential diagnosis [^ad6fea31]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

When a patient with diabetes mellitus presents with worsening polyuria and polydipsia, what is a sensible, cost-effective approach? We report the unique coincidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. A 46-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes complained of polyuria with a daily output of 5 L. Although urinalysis demonstrated significant glucosuria, diabetes insipidus was suspected owing to a low urine specific gravity (1.008). The low specific gravity persisted during a water deprivation test. Ultimately, diabetes insipidus was confirmed when urine specific gravity and urine osmolality normalized following desmopressin administration. This case emphasizes the importance of accurately interpreting the urine specific gravity in patients with polyuria and diabetes mellitus to detect diabetes insipidus.

### New developments and concepts in the diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus (AVP-deficiency and resistance) [^2c8a430c]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterised by the excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine, with a prevalence of 1 per 25,000 population. Central DI (CDI), better now referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficiency, is the most common form of DI resulting from deficiency of the hormone AVP from the pituitary. The less common nephrogenic DI (NDI) or AVP-resistance develops secondary to AVP resistance in the kidneys. The majority of causes of DI are acquired, with CDI developing when more than 80% of AVP-secreting neurons are damaged. Inherited/familial CDI causes account for approximately 1% of cases. Although the pathogenesis of NDI is unclear, more than 280 disease-causing mutations affecting the AVP2 protein or AVP V2 receptor, as well as in aquaporin 2 (AQP2), have been described. Although the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway remains the major regulatory pathway of AVP/AQP2 action, in vitro data have also revealed additional cAMP independent pathways of NDI pathogenesis. Diagnosing partial forms of DI, and distinguishing them from primary polydipsia, can be challenging, previously necessitating the use of the water deprivation test. However, measurements of circulating copeptin levels, especially after stimulation, are increasingly replacing the classical tests in clinical practice because of their ease of use and high sensitivity and specificity. The treatment of CDI relies on desmopressin administration, whereas NDI requires the management of any underlying diseases, removal of offending drugs and, in some cases, administration of diuretics. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of DI has led to novel evolving therapeutic agents that are under clinical trial.

3.5 Hypertonic saline‐stimulated copeptin measurements

The osmotically stimulated copeptin cut‐off level was recently validated in an international multicenter trial including 156 patients with diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia. 46 In contrast to the studies described above, the test protocol was simplified in using only the 3% saline infusion test without prior thirsting. Hypertonic saline was initially given as a bolus dose of 250 mL over 10‐15 minutes, followed by a slower infusion rate of 0.15 mL/kg/min. Plasma sodium and osmolality were measured every 30 minutes, and the infusion was terminated once the plasma sodium was ≥150 mmol/L. At this point, copeptin was measured and the patient was asked to drink water at 30 mL/kg within 30 minutes followed by an intravenous infusion of 5% glucose at 500 mL/h for 1 hour. Plasma sodium was once more measured after completing the 5% glucose infusion to ensure its return to normal values. The diagnostic accuracy of the 3% saline infusion stimulated copeptin measurements was compared to the indirect water deprivation test according to the protocol of Miller et al. 40 Further end‐points included the evaluation of copeptin measurements during the water deprivation test.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, copeptin is a reliable surrogate parameter of AVP. In contrast to AVP, it is stable and can be measured easily with a sandwich immunoassay in serum or plasma. Copeptin is a promising new parameter clearly simplifying the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome. Here, high baseline levels unequivocally indicate nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and hypertonic saline‐stimulated copeptin levels differentiate between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia with a high sensitivity and specificity. Consequently, hypertonic saline infusion plus copeptin measurement could replace the indirect water deprivation test in the routine evaluation of patients with hypotonic polyuria.

In contrast, in SIAD, copeptin measurement is of only little diagnostic value. Copeptin levels widely overlap in patients with hyponatraemia and emphasize the heterogeneity of the disease. Additionally, a variety of factors leads to unspecific copeptin elevations in the acute setting further complicating its interpretation. The broad use of copeptin as diagnostic marker in hyponatraemia and specifically to detect cancer‐related disease in SIAD patients can, therefore, not be recommended. Nevertheless, extreme values point to a specific underlying pathophysiology: copeptin levels above 84 pmol/L indicate hypovolaemic hyponatraemia and the need for fluid infusion while low levels <3.9 pmol/L are associated with primary polydipsia. Hyponatraemic patients presenting with undetectable copeptin levels and low free water clearance should be investigated for nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis.

### Vasopressin-dependent disorders: what is new in children? [^4e5785b0]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP)-mediated osmoregulatory disorders, such as diabetes insipidus (DI) and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) are common in the differential diagnosis for children with hypo- and hypernatremia and require timely recognition and treatment. DI is caused by a failure to concentrate urine secondary to impaired production of or response to AVP, resulting in hypernatremia. Newer methods of diagnosing DI include measuring copeptin levels; copeptin is AVP's chaperone protein and serves as a surrogate biomarker of AVP secretion. Intraoperative copeptin levels may also help predict the risk for developing DI after neurosurgical procedures. Copeptin levels hold diagnostic promise in other pediatric conditions, too. Recently, expanded genotype and phenotype correlations in inherited DI disorders have been described and may better predict the clinical course in affected children and infants. Similarly, newer formulations of synthetic AVP may improve pediatric DI treatment. In contrast to DI, SIADH, characterized by inappropriate AVP secretion, commonly leads to severe hyponatremia. Contemporary methods aid clinicians in distinguishing SIADH from other hyponatremic conditions, particularly cerebral salt wasting. Further research on the efficacy of therapies for pediatric SIADH is needed, although some adult treatments hold promise for pediatrics. Lastly, expansion of home point-of-care sodium testing may transform management of SIADH and DI in children. In this article, we review recent developments in the understanding of pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment of better outcomes and quality of life for children with these challenging disorders.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^fcd2d852]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Contrary to the study of Fenske described above, the proposed copeptin‐sodium ratio did not improve diagnostic accuracy of the water deprivation test, 50 resulting in a diagnostic accuracy of only 44%. 46 The proposed copeptin cut‐off level of <2.6 pmol/L after an overnight water deprivation test to diagnose complete central diabetes insipidus had a diagnostic accuracy of 78%. The fact that the determination of copeptin after water deprivation alone does not lead to an improved diagnostic accuracy is most likely due to the inadequate osmotic stimulation. Indeed, most patients in the study did not reach hyperosmotic plasma sodium levels during the classical water deprivation test.

Accordingly, osmotic stimulation by hypertonic saline solution is needed to obtain reliable copeptin measurements. It is however important to note that hypertonic saline infusion requires close monitoring of sodium levels to ensure increase in plasma sodium levels into the hyperosmotic range 22, 39 while preventing osmotic overstimulation. 46 It might therefore be prudent for clinical practice to aim at a plasma sodium level >147 mmol/L instead of 150 mmol/L. Also, rapid normalization of sodium levels after the osmotic stimulation is crucial to guarantee the safety of the test. 46

Based on these results, the hypertonic saline test plus copeptin measurement might now replace the indirect water deprivation test in the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome 55 ; the recommended new diagnostic workflow algorithm is displayed in Figure 4. Not included in this algorithm are the special cases of diabetes insipidus patients with osmoreceptor dysfunction where thirst is also impaired, and hypodipsia can result in serious complications associated with hyperosmolality. These patients usually develop hypernatremia as they fail to increase their daily fluid intake and therefore do not require additional osmotic stimulation. Copeptin levels can be measured directly to differentiate between central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^5ba46e12]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Healthy kidneys maintain fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis by adjusting urine volume and composition according to physiological needs. The final urine composition is determined in the last tubular segment: the collecting duct. Water permeability in the collecting duct is regulated by arginine vasopressin (AVP). Secretion of AVP from the neurohypophysis is regulated by a complex signalling network that involves osmosensors, barosensors and volume sensors. AVP facilitates aquaporin (AQP)-mediated water reabsorption via activation of the vasopressin V2 receptor (AVPR2) in the collecting duct, thus enabling concentration of urine. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), inability of the kidneys to respond to AVP results in functional AQP deficiency. Consequently, affected patients have constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. Primary forms of NDI result from mutations in the genes that encode the key proteins AVPR2 and AQP2, whereas secondary forms are associated with biochemical abnormalities, obstructive uropathy or the use of certain medications, particularly lithium. Treatment of the disease is informed by identification of the underlying cause. Here we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various aetiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments.

### Differential diagnosis of polyuric / polydipsic syndromes with the aid of urinary vasopressin measurement in adults [^448159db]. Clinical Endocrinology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

A water deprivation test or a hypertonic saline infusion test with the measurement of plasma osmolality and plasma vasopressin are the gold standard tests in the differential diagnosis of polyuric syndromes. Because commercially available vasopressin kits are too insensitive for this approach, and the concentration of vasopressin in urine is much higher than in plasma, urinary vasopressin measurements may be an alternative to the more difficult plasma vasopressin measurement.

Design

The diagnostic value of the measurement of urinary vasopressin with a rather insensitive commercially available vasopressin kit was compared with plasma vasopressin measurement by a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA).

Patients and Methods

Thirteen normal subjects and 27 patients with polyuria/polydipsia were examined by an 8-h fluid deprivation test. In all blood samples (0800 h, 1200 h, 1400 h and 1600 h) and in all urine collections (2-hourly fractions), osmolality as well as vasopressin were measured.

Results

Using plasma vasopressin measurement with a highly sensitive RIA as gold standard test, nine patients were classified as having primary polydipsia, whereas 18 had partial or complete cranial diabetes insipidus. Whereas the substitution of plasma vasopressin measurement by urinary vasopressin measurement alone did not provide 100% separation between both groups, the product of urinary vasopressin and urinary osmolality related to plasma osmolality completely separated the patients with primary polydipsia from those with diabetes insipidus. Urinary measurement of vasopressin and osmolality alone, which was recommended as a noninvasive diagnostic procedure in children, was too insensitive for exact differential diagnosis in our adult patients.

Conclusions

The simultaneous measurement of plasma vasopressin and plasma osmolality in a dehydration test is the most powerful diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of polyuria/polydipsia. However, if highly sensitive assays for plasma vasopressin measurements are not available, the measurement of urinary vasopressin with commercially available, less sensitive RIAs may be a diagnostic alternative, which showed nearly the same sensitivity as plasma vasopressin measurement in our study population.

3.4 Direct copeptin measurements

With the development of the copeptin assay, 9, 13, 53 interest in the direct measurement arose again. In a first study, Fenske et al aimed to increase the diagnostic accuracy of the water deprivation test by combining it with copeptin measurements. 50 In their cohort of 50 patients with polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome, baseline plasma copeptin levels >20 pmol/L diagnosed patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, while levels <2.6 pmol/L after an overnight water deprivation test indicated central diabetes insipidus. A ratio of the Δplasma copeptin levels (before and after the water deprivation phase) to the plasma sodium level at the end of the test showed a high diagnostic accuracy of 94% in differentiating patients with central diabetes insipidus from patients with primary polydipsia. 50

In an evaluation of 55 patients with nephrogenic or central diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia, Timper et al 54 described copeptin further as a promising new tool for the diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome. This study confirmed in a larger patient number that patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be easily diagnosed by using a single baseline copeptin level of >21.4 pmol/L without prior thirsting. Baseline copeptin values in the other entities (ie, central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia) however largely overlapped. Further, the study showed that osmotically stimulated copeptin levels of >4.9 pmol/L differentiated patients with central diabetes insipidus from patients with primary polydipsia with a high diagnostic accuracy of 96%. Osmotic stimulation was reached by water deprivation and if needed by additional 3% saline infusion aiming at an increase in plasma sodium levels above 147 mmol/L. The evaluation of osmotically stimulated AVP instead of copeptin measurement showed a lower overall diagnostic accuracy of only 80%, and the accuracy was especially low for differentiation between partial central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia (44%).

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^cde7ec53]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impairment of AVP secretion from the posterior pituitary. In clinical practice, it needs to be distinguished from renal resistance to the antidiuretic effects of AVP (nephrogenic DI), and abnormalities of thirst appreciation (primary polydipsia). As nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is rare in adults, unless they are treated with lithium salts, the practical challenge is how to differentiate between CDI and clinical disorders of excess thirst. The differential diagnosis is usually straight forward, but the recommended gold standard test, the water deprivation test, is not without interpretative pitfalls. The addition of the measurement of plasma AVP concentrations improves diagnostic accuracy, but the radioimmunoassay for AVP is technically difficult, and is only available in a few specialized centres. More recently, the measurement of plasma copeptin concentrations has been claimed to provide a reliable alternative to measurement of plasma AVP, without the sampling handling challenges. In addition, the measurement of thirst ratings can help the differentiation between CDI and primary polydipsia. Once the diagnosis of CDI is biochemically certain, investigations to determine the cause of AVP deficiency are needed. In this review, we will outline the diagnostic approach to polyuria, revisit the caveats of the water deprivation test and review recent data on value of adding AVP/copeptin measurement. We will also discuss treatment strategies for CDI, with analysis of potential complications of treatment.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^a879f874]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In a prospective, multicenter, observational study including 92 hospitalized patients with severe hypernatremia (>155 mmol/L), copeptin reliably identified 5 patients with central diabetes insipidus. Copeptin values were very low in this group and a cut-off value of ≤4.4 pmol/L showed very high sensitivity and specificity (100% and 99% respectively). In patients with dehydration (n = 65), salt overload (n = 20), and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, (n = 2) copeptin values were high. The highest values were observed in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus patients (up to 78 pmol/L), but no discrimination between these 3 groups was possible (median [IQR] copeptin values in dehydration and salt overload groups were 55 [35-72] and 53 [34-86], respectively) (Fig. 3). Other commonly used parameters in the differential diagnosis of hypernatremia are volume status and urine osmolality. For the distinction of the hypernatremia categories dehydration vs salt overload the volume status performed well (area under curve 0.88; 95% CI 0.97-1.00). However, no further differentiation between hypovolemic patients with dehydration or diabetes insipidus was possible. Urine osmolality was a good marker to differentiate between (both central and nephrogenic) diabetes insipidus (inadequate low levels: median [IQR] 284 mosm/kg [209-306]) and dehydration or salt overload (adequate high levels: median [IQR] 546 mosm/kg [463-647], and 510 mosm/L [462-819]. The utility of urine osmolality was, however, limited by the fact that urine samples were collected only in 41% of patients. In summary, copeptin, together with urine osmolality, is a reliable measure in hypernatremia patients and identifies patients with central diabetes insipidus in need of prompt desmopressin treatment with high diagnostic accuracy.

### Copeptin in the diagnosis of vasopressin-dependent disorders of fluid homeostasis [^b3a1b50c]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Copeptin and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are derived from a common precursor molecule and have equimolar secretion and response to osmotic, haemodynamic and stress-related stimuli. Plasma concentrations of copeptin and AVP in relation to serum osmolality are highly correlated. The physiological functions of AVP with respect to homeostasis of fluid balance, vascular tonus and regulation of the endocrine stress response are well known, but the exact function of copeptin is undetermined. Quantification of AVP can be difficult, but copeptin is stable in plasma and can be easily measured with a sandwich immunoassay. For this reason, copeptin has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of AVP-dependent fluid disorders. Copeptin measurements can enable differentiation between various conditions within the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome. In the absence of prior fluid deprivation, baseline copeptin levels >20 pmol/l identify patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Conversely, copeptin levels measured upon osmotic stimulation differentiate primary polydipsia from partial central diabetes insipidus. In patients with hyponatraemia, low levels of copeptin together with low urine osmolality identify patients with primary polydipsia, and the ratio of copeptin to urinary sodium can distinguish the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion from other AVP-dependent forms of hyponatraemia.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with central diabetes insipidus, SE 2018 guidelines recommend to administer IV or IM vasopressin 1-2 mcg in patients with known central diabetes insipidus and excessive, inappropriately dilute urine output, with close observation of the clinical and biochemical response. Consider administering further doses of desmopressin when production of higher volumes of dilute (100 mosmol/kg) urine returns to avoid the development of overly rapid correction of hypernatremia through the combination of high fluid loads together with the obligate antidiuresis of exogenous desmopressin.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^bebc64b7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

It is common for endocrinologists to receive referred patients who have polyuria and polydipsia that need investigation. When initial investigations reveal the urine to be hypotonic, differentiating between the 3 main causes is essential, as the management differs for each. Over the past 2 years, due to concerns about patient safety and in response to patient feedback, the causes of hypotonic polyuria have been renamed as arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), while the name of the third cause is retained as primary polydipsia (PP), in which excess fluid intake suppresses AVP secretion. In a survey of more than one thousand patients with AVP-D, the large majority had experienced confusion of their condition by health care workers with diabetes mellitus, resulting in delays in availability of desmopressin and unnecessary capillary glucose monitoring when hospitalized, and 85% favored changing the name. The new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and clearly identifies the patients’ condition as different from diabetes mellitus, and now has been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) taxonomy hierarchy codes for electronic patient records. In parallel, the last several years have seen improvements in the diagnostic tools used for the investigation of hypotonic polyuria, with a particular emphasis on the use of measurement of plasma copeptin. This Approach to the Patient review presents the use of this copeptin-based approach in 3 specific cases, and places each in the context of the revised nomenclature. We then describe the overall approach to the patient presenting with hypotonic polyuria, itemize the causes, and discuss when and how testing should be performed (Fig. 1), highlighting specific areas that frequently cause diagnostic and management difficulties.

### Urine osmolality (...) [^1d0463ef]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine is regarded as a sensitive indicator of renal function. 1 Since concentration tests are easily done, they enjoy wide clinical use. This renal activity is usually studied by measuring urine specific gravity, i. e. the ratio of the weight of urine to an equal volume of water. The specific gravity of a solution is dependent upon the weight of the particles making up the solution. However, specific gravity will afford only a rough index of renal concentrating ability since the kidney, in the maintenance of water and electrolyte balance, responds to changes in the osmolality of body fluids, not the specific gravity. 2 This information is only slowly penetrating clinical medicine. There have been some studies relating maximum urine osmolality to the hypertensive state, diabetes mellitus, rheumatic heart disease, 2, 3 and sicklemia. 4 Some relationships between urine osmolality and urine specific gravity.

### Enhancing diagnostic tools for vasopressin deficiency: insights from a single-center cohort study [^c3503680]. Pituitary (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polyuria polydipsia syndrome with low urinary osmolarity (UOsm) can result from primary polydipsia (PP) or diabetes insipidus; the latter may be caused by either arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) or resistance (AVP-R). Diabetes insipidus may have various causes, both congenital and acquired. Copeptin is a stable and easy-to-measure surrogate marker for AVP levels which can aid in making a more accurate diagnosis. In the presence of polyuria, elevated unstimulated copeptin levels (> 21.4 pmol/L) can effectively identify AVP-R. Differential diagnosis between AVP-D and PP may be straightforward based on abnormal sodium (Na) and/or plasma osmolarity (POsm) : hyponatremia (< 135 mmol/L) or low POsm (< 280 mOsm/kg) strongly suggest PP, whereas hypernatremia (≥ 147 mmol/L) or elevated POsm (> 300 mOsm/kg) indicate AVP-D. Of note, following pituitary surgery, Na levels of 145–147 mmol/L or higher are generally sufficient for AVP-D diagnosis. However, many patients present with intermediate Na values, requiring additional testing. In recent years copeptin based tests, namely the hypertonic saline test and the arginine stimulation test (AST) have been proposed to differentiate AVP-D and PP with reported better diagnostic accuracy compared to the water deprivation test (WDT). The former is based on an osmotic trigger to the AVP secretion, while the latter relies on arginine as a non-osmotic stimulus, the mechanisms of which are not fully elucidated yet. Glucagon stimulated copeptin also showed promising results, but studies on large cohorts are missing to date. A recent head-to-head multicenter trial demonstrated the superiority of hypertonic saline-stimulated copeptin over the AST in diagnosing AVP-D. Although these data point towards the hypertonic saline as the current gold standard to diagnose AVP-D, this test has notable drawbacks, including the requirement for rapid sodium monitoring, medical supervision and stringent safety measures to avoid adverse effects such as seizures. Conversely, arginine-stimulated copeptin is easier to perform, less costly and better tolerated. Consequently, it has been suggested that the AST could serve as a potential first-line diagnostic tool, providing accurate diagnoses (specificity > 90%) for copeptin values ≤ 3 pmol/L indicating AVP-D and for values > 5.2 pmol/L identifying PP. Thus, hypertonic saline test would be necessary only in case of copeptin concentrations between these values. Of note, these novel cut-offs for arginine-stimulated copeptin have not been validated in other cohorts yet.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Central Diabetes Insipidus

Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality.

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis

Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention.

### SGLT2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^177d6d23]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit sodium and glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to glycosuria and natriuresis, both of which can affect urine osmolality and contribute to osmotic diuresis. Vasopressin acts on V2 receptor (V2R) in the collecting duct, facilitating water reabsorption via aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channels. Dysregulation of the vasopressin-V2R-AQP2 axis is central to both CDI and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Studies in diabetic rats have shown that empagliflozin downregulates AQP2 expression in the kidney. In CDI, the lack of vasopressin release impairs urine concentration, and SGLT2 inhibitors may exacerbate this defect by further downregulation of AQP2. In this patient, the marked increase in polydipsia following dapagliflozin administration supports this hypothesis.

A limitation should be considered in the interpretation of our case. The inability to routinely measure AVP and copeptin levels at our institution, due to both technical limitations and existing clinical protocols, represents a key constraint. This lack of quantitative neuroendocrine data restricts our capacity to establish precise correlation between observed clinical manifestations and their underlying biochemical mechanisms.

In conclusion, CDI should be considered in T2DM patients with persistent hypernatremia following resolution of HHS. SGLT2 inhibitors may complicate the diagnosis and management of CDI by masking hypotonic polyuria and altering urine osmolality. Discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended when evaluating patients with suspected of CDI to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

### Approach to the pediatric patient: central diabetes insipidus [^e21ccd91]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a complex disorder in which large volumes of dilute urine are excreted due to arginine-vasopressin deficiency, and it is caused by a variety of disorders affecting the hypothalamic-posterior pituitary network. The differential diagnosis is challenging and requires a detailed medical history, physical examination, biochemical approach, imaging studies, and, in some cases, histological confirmation. Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard method for evaluating congenital or acquired cerebral and pituitary stalk lesions. Pituitary stalk size at presentation could be normal, but it may change over time, depending on the underlying condition, while other brain areas or organs may become involved during follow-up. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to avoid central nervous system damage and germ cell tumor dissemination and to minimize complications of multiple pituitary hormone defects. We provide a practical update on the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI and highlight several pitfalls that may complicate the differential diagnosis of conditions presenting with polyuria and polydipsia. The need for a careful and close follow-up of patients with apparently idiopathic CDI is particularly emphasized because the underlying condition may be recognized over time. The clinical scenario that we outline at the beginning of this article represents the basis for the discussion about how the etiological diagnosis of CDI can be overlooked and demonstrates how a water intake and urine output improvement can be a sign of progressive damage of both hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland with associated pituitary hormonal deficiencies.

### Use of copeptin in interpretation of the water deprivation test [^a4446d5d]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Different units use variations of the test with variations in the period of water deprivation. The period of water deprivation used in our unit is shorter than in some previous publications. The exact length of fluid deprivation is a balance between ensuring an adequate stress while avoiding unnecessary risk to the individual. There is also the practical consideration of performing the test within a single day and avoiding the need for admission to a hospital bed. Fenske and colleaguespublished the results of copeptin measurement in a similar cohort measuring baseline and stimulated copeptin following water deprivation. There were some differences in the water deprivation protocol (with longer fluid restriction for a proportion). There were also some differences in the osmolality cut‐offs defining the diagnoses. The conclusions of the study were broadly similar; adding copeptin produces a modest improvement in diagnostic accuracy. Their cohort did not produce any examples of unexpectedly high copeptin measurement in individuals with a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus or partial diabetes insipidus. Subsequent studies have shown that the test could be improved by the addition of water deprivation with hypertonic saline.Since then, this has developed into hypertonic saline stimulation alone or, more recently, arginine stimulation.Both new tests look very promising with significantly improved diagnostic accuracy although the tests may not be suitable for all patients.

One of the strengths of these data is that they represent real‐world data with a relatively long period of follow‐up for most subjects after the test. The test of time helps in ensuring that the final diagnosis is secure.

A limitation of this study is the lack of information about urine volumes or change in weight over the length of the test. This information would have been available to the clinicians when interpreting the results and have been factored into the presumptive diagnosis but are not available to include in this paper. A further difficulty with using any test to diagnose ADH deficiency is that it appears to be a hormone axis where we see more variation in function with time. It is common to see transient diabetes insipidus after surgery that recovers in a few days.Similarly with pituitary haemorrhage or infarction, DI may be transient over a longer period.With inflammatory pituitary or hypothalamic lesions, DI may fluctuate with periods of recovery and then recurrence.This can make the final diagnosis more elusive as it possible that it may change after the diagnostic test has been performed.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^f1d8b4a8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Dynamic tests for diagnosing suspected hypopituitarism—antidiuretic hormone (ADH) evaluation via the water deprivation test provides stepwise procedures and diagnostic thresholds. The procedure states to initiate fluid deprivation for 8h (starting from 8 AM), weigh the patient at the beginning of testing, measure plasma and urine osmolality every 2–3 h, and at 4 pm administer DDAVP 2 µg im; notes specify that if plasma osmolality >305 mOsm/kg or if 3% loss of body weight with plasma osmolality >305 mOsm/kg, proceed to DDAVP earlier, continue measuring urine osmolality hourly for the next 4 h after DDAVP administration, and stop the test if >3% weight loss occurs. Interpretation indicates that plasma osmolality >295 mOsm/L with inappropriately hypotonic urine (urine osmolality/plasma osmolality ratio <2) during fluid deprivation confirms DI; after DDAVP, urine concentrates >800 mOsm/kg with central DI and <300 mOsm/kg with nephrogenic DI; with partial DI or primary polydipsia, urine concentrates partially during the water deprivation test (300–800 mOsm/kg), and further investigation is required including a prolonged water deprivation test or DDAVP therapeutic trial.

### Advanced age, altered level of consciousness and a new diagnosis of diabetes are independently associated with hypernatreamia in hyperglycaemic crisis [^bd002146]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations of study

The limitations of this study include its retrospective design and determination of serum osmolality by calculation rather than laboratory measurement. We may have underestimated serum osmolality where osmotically active substances other than glucose and sodium are present in the serum as we calculated rather than measured the serum osmolality. Another limitation is that results of urine osmolality, urine specific gravity and urine electrolytes concentrations were not provided as these are not routinely done in our practice.

### American association of clinical endocrinology disease state clinical review: evaluation and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated endocrinopathies: a practical case-based clinical approach [^56a0e4f8]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced hypophysitis—diagnostic features, laboratory utility, and epidemiology across agents are outlined as follows: In ipilimumab (Ipi)–associated cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows diffuse enlargement of the pituitary with variable stalk enlargement, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency tends to be permanent (75%). Compared with Ipi, anti–programmed death 1 (PD-1) or anti–PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) cases have fewer headaches and a smaller proportion with MRI-detected pituitary enlargement (28% vs 98% with Ipi). In nivolumab (Nivo) monotherapy for lung cancer, asymptomatic secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) developed in approximately 11%, with 25% treated with glucocorticoids; another retrospective multicenter study of Nivo or pembrolizumab (Pembro) reported a 0.5% prevalence of hypophysitis with later onset (a median of 26 weeks of treatment), and PD-1 inhibitors are typically dosed every 2-6 weeks depending on the agent and dose. For pituitary axes testing in the acute phase, the diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism can be made with low free T4 and inappropriately normal or decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and the diagnosis of AI is initially reliant on cortisol because the ACTH stimulation test is not reliable during acute presentation. The utility of measuring follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, or growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 is limited; active malignancy is a contraindication for growth hormone replacement and these measurements are of low clinical relevance. Although exceedingly rare, diabetes insipidus (DI) has been reported; the possibility of DI should be considered in patients with new increased thirst and frequent urination, confirmed with serum and urine osmolality, and if DI is confirmed, pituitary infiltration by malignancy should be excluded, which may require MRI of the sella.

### Copeptin levels and commonly used laboratory parameters in hospitalised patients with severe hypernatraemia-the "Co-MED study" [^be60569e]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, Palevsky et al. showed that factors responsible for the development of severe hypernatraemia in non-ICU patients are increased insensible and enteral losses and urinary concentration defects, in addition to inadequate fluid management. Similarly, in another study, ICU patients developed hypernatraemia because of the underlying disease or renal water loss and, most importantly, incorrect or inefficient treatment. In our study, patients with hypernatraemia were frail and had various underlying pathologies promoting the development of hypernatraemia, such as heart failure, chronic kidney disease, sepsis, neurologic impairment and multiple medications. Interestingly, 63% of our patients developed hypernatraemia during hospitalisation, which is in line with the observations of Palevsky et al. and Hoorn et al. These results reflect the importance of rapidly identifying the correct differential diagnosis of hypernatraemia and initiating the appropriate therapy.

Unfortunately, in clinical practice the correct differential diagnosis of hypernatraemia, which is usually based on urine osmolality and volaemic status, might be difficult, and delayed treatment may have devastating clinical consequences, leading to higher mortality rates [,,–,]. In our study, urine osmolality was able to identify patients with either central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nevertheless, urine sampling was not performed routinely in all patients, and only 41% had complete urine samples before treatment initiation. This low number reflects the general lack of urine sampling in clinical practice in patients with dysnatraemia. A large retrospective study assessing the diagnostic and therapeutic management of hyponatraemic patients showed considerable deficiencies in urine testing, confirming the results of previous small studies. To our knowledge, to date, performance of urine collection in patients with hypernatraemia has not been assessed in a larger cohort, but according to our results, urine collection remains challenging in the hospital setting. Nevertheless, our results indicate that urine osmolality, which is inexpensive and usually routinely available, is a reliable marker for diagnosing either central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and should therefore be measured systematically in all patients with electrolyte disorders.

### Non-functioning pituitary adenomas: indications for pituitary surgery and post-surgical management [^e1b6acbc]. Pituitary (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus

DI occurs in 18–31% of patients after pituitary surgery. Several factors are associated with the increased risk of postoperative DI, including male sex, young age, large pituitary mass, CSF leak, and administration of high perioperative glucocorticoid doses. In most patients, the disease is transient, being caused by the temporary dysfunction of ADH-secreting neurons. It usually occurs 24–48 h postoperatively and resolves when ADH-secreting cells recover their normal function.

Triphasic DI occurs in 3–4% of patients. The first phase is characterized by DI (usually 5–7 days) due to a partial or complete posterior pituitary dysfunction. The second phase is caused by an uncontrolled release of ADH leading to SIADH, which usually lasts 2–14 days. Finally, the last phase occurs if > 80–90% of the ADH-secreting cells have degenerated, which leads to permanent DI.

Postoperative DI should be suspected if polyuria (≥ 3 L per day) and polydipsia occur in combination with low urine osmolality. Serum hyperosmolality and hypernatremia strongly support the diagnosis of DI. In this clinical context, a water deprivation test is not needed. A urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg and subsequent positive response to ADH confirms the diagnosis of central DI.

In patients who are able to drink in response to thirst and when sodium levels remain within the normal range, no treatment is needed. In other cases, treatment with desmopressin may be required. In treated patients, urine output and osmolality, as well as serum sodium levels, should be monitored regularly to avoid hyponatremia. Because postoperative DI can be transient, each dose of desmopressin should be administered after the recurrence of polyuria and thirst. This approach allows recognition of restored ADH secretion and transient DI in the early and late postoperative phases.

### Use of copeptin in interpretation of the water deprivation test [^61cdf1a4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Currently, the water deprivation test remains the standard method for distinguishing primary polydipsia (PP) from cranial diabetes insipidus (cDI) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (nDI). There is increasing interest in a direct estimate of antidiuretic hormone using plasma copeptin as a stable and reliable surrogate marker. We present our experience of measuring copeptin during the water deprivation test.

Methods

Forty‐seven people (17 men) underwent a standard water deprivation test between 2013 and 2021. Plasma copeptin was measured at the start of the test and at the end of the period of water deprivation (maximum osmotic stimulation). Results were classified using prespecified diagnostic criteria. As it is known that a significant proportion of tests will reveal indeterminate results, a final diagnosis was obtained by including relevant pre‐ and post‐test clinical criteria. This diagnosis was then used to plan individual treatment.

Results

Basal and stimulated copeptin were significantly higher in the nephrogenic DI group than other categories (p <.001). There was no significant difference in basal or stimulated copeptin between PP, cDI or partial DI. Nine results were indeterminate where the serum and urine osmolality did not give a unified diagnosis. Stimulated copeptin was helpful in reclassifying these patients into the final diagnostic groups.

Conclusion

Plasma copeptin has additional clinical utility in interpretation of the water deprivation test and may continue to have a place alongside newer stimulation tests.

### Redefining diagnostic cut-offs for the indirect water deprivation test [^932e088a]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Whilst using a serum osmolality cut‐off value of ≥ 308 mOsm/kg also demonstrates 100% specificity, the reduced inherent variability of measuring serum sodium means there is a lower likelihood of exceeding the cut‐off value due to random variation. This study demonstrates that a serum sodium cut‐off of ≥ 148 mmol/L can be used as a reliable marker of AVP‐D and AVP‐R with a specificity of 100%. Although serum osmolality has a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy independently (Table 1), its use is limited by increased variation, combined with reduced availability and higher turn‐around times.

Using the derived urine osmolality cut‐offs of < 383 mOsm/kg (to diagnose complete AVP‐D and AVP‐R) and > 630 mOsm/kg (to diagnose PP) in tandem with a serum sodium cut‐off of ≥ 148 mmol/L reduced the number of false negative diagnoses to zero. Within this study cohort, use of these cut‐off values allows a diagnosis of AVP‐D, AVP‐R and PP with 100% specificity and sensitivity. These results also suggest that a WDT may be avoided if a patient has a serum sodium value of greater than 148 mmol/L or a urine osmolality of greater than 630 mOsm/kg if water deprivation has coincidentally occurred.

Similarly, when evaluating the change in urine osmolality following desmopressin for the entire sample, 100% specificity is achieved with using a greater than 53.40% rise in urine osmolality. Within those patients with a positive diagnosis of AVP‐D and AVP‐R (including partial cases of both), 100% specificity for AVP‐D patients is achieved with at least a 54% increase in urine osmolality, consistent with an expected value of > 50%. Figure 4 summarises these findings in a diagnostic approach.

Summarised diagnostic approach in a patient presenting with polydipsia and polyuria.

In the future, newer methods such as the stimulated copeptin test (with arginine or hypertonic saline) to differentiate between PP and AVP‐D may come into clinical use, both independently and in conjugation with the WDT. However, studies have highlighted several challenges associated with their implementation into widespread clinical use that has limited their accuracy and application. Since the WDT remains the gold standard for diagnosis, this study aimed to improve the currently used cut‐off values; a comparison with copeptin‐based tests was outside the scope of this study.

Utility of Copeptin Measurement in Hyper- and Hyponatremia

Copeptin Measurement in Hypernatremia

While hypernatremia is a rare finding in outpatients, it is much more common in hospitalized patients showing a prevalence of 2% to 3%. Hypernatremia results from a free water deficit due to renal (central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, glycosuria) or extrarenal water loss or from iatrogenic sodium overload (eg, uncontrolled saline infusion, tube feeding). In the majority of hospitalized hypernatremia patients, the electrolyte imbalance is not present at admission, but develops during hospitalization. Besides iatrogenic issues, many other factors and comorbidities such as heart failure, chronic kidney disease, sepsis, neurological impairment with impaired thirst perception, or inability to drink may promote the development of hypernatremia in the acute setting. Hypernatremia is therefore also a marker of disease severity and, unsurprisingly, studies consistently report increased mortality rates in patients with hypernatremia.

The most important measure to correct hypernatremia is to increase the free water supply, such as by intravenous hypotonic infusion. Additionally, in salt-overloaded patients iatrogenic action has to be stopped and diabetes insipidus patients need timely treatment with desmopressin.

The high rate of hospital-acquired hypernatremia underpins insufficient hypernatremia awareness in hospitalized patients, with the result of inadequate treatment and worse outcome. Specifically, for hospitalized patients with diabetes insipidus, a retrospective audit showed that desmopressin treatment was delayed in 88% of patients at admission, putting them at risk of hypernatremia. This prompted the Society for Endocrinology to publish guidelines on in-hospital management of central diabetes insipidus in 2018. For patients with undiagnosed diabetes insipidus who are also at need for early desmopressin treatment, copeptin has been proposed as a readily available diagnostic marker in the acute setting.

### Copeptin role in polyuria-polydipsia syndrome differential diagnosis and reference range in paediatric age [^79e8c13b]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Plasma arginine-vasopressin (AVP) analysis can help in the differential diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome (PPS), even if such investigation is hampered by technical difficulties, conversely to its surrogate copeptin. This study aims to enlarge the existing data on normal copeptin levels in childhood, to evaluate the correlation between copeptin, serum sodium and plasma and urine osmolality, and to assess the utility of the copeptin analysis in the diagnostic work-up of PPS in the paediatric age.

Patients and Methods

Plasma copeptin levels were evaluated in 53 children without AVP disorders (control population), in 12 hypopituitaric children and in 15 patients with PPS after water deprivation test (WDT).

Results

Mean basal copeptin levels were 5.2 ± 1.56 (range 2.4-8.6 pmol/L) in the control population, 2.61 ± 0.49 pmol/L in the hypopituitaric children with complete diabetes insipidus (CDI) (P = .04) and 6.21 ± 1.17 pmol/L in the hypopituitaric patients without DI (P = .02). After WDT, among 15 naïve polyuric/polydipsic children, copeptin values greater than 20 pmol/L allowed to identify nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), concentrations below 2.2 pmol/L complete central DI (CCDI) and between 5 and 20 pmol/L primary polydipsia (PP). Copeptin cut-off level of 3.5 pmol/L distinguished CDI from PP, with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 83.3%, respectively.

Conclusion

Copeptin evaluation holds promises as a diagnostic tool in paediatric PPS; its interpretation might be useful to promptly distinguish NDI, even avoiding the WDT need.

### Simplifying the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus in children (...) [^c9503441]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

• We simplified the procedure for identifying children with diabetes insipidus by using the relationship between urine and plasma osmolality. We defined the normal Uosm-Posm relationship as the area within the 95% confidence regions for pairs of osmolality measurements obtained from normal children during periods of free access to fluids and after oral hydration. In 13 patients with diabetes insipidus, Uosm-Posm coordinates were outside these regions in 50 of 64 pairs during periods of free access to fluids. After three hours of fluid deprivation, the Uosm-Posm relationship was abnormal in 12 patients; the 13th was unable to void. For those with a normal Posm, and Uosm less than Posm, another pair of osmolality measurements after three hours of fluid restriction should determine the diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^840eee58]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a clinical syndrome which results from loss or impaired function of vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/posterior pituitary, resulting in impaired synthesis and/or secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP deficiency leads to the inability to concentrate urine and excessive renal water losses, resulting in a clinical syndrome of hypotonic polyuria with compensatory thirst. CDI is caused by diverse etiologies, although it typically develops due to neoplastic, traumatic, or autoimmune destruction of AVP-synthesizing/secreting neurons. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of CDI, providing insights into the physiological disturbances underpinning the syndrome. Recent developments in diagnostic techniques, particularly the development of the copeptin assay, have improved accuracy and acceptability of the diagnostic approach to the hypotonic polyuria syndrome. We discuss the management of CDI with particular emphasis on management of fluid intake and pharmacological replacement of AVP. Specific clinical syndromes such as adipsic diabetes insipidus and diabetes insipidus in pregnancy as well as management of the perioperative patient with diabetes insipidus are also discussed.

### Clinical laboratory evaluation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [^61417f49]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hypotonicity. Although the differential diagnosis with other causes of hypotonicity such as salt depletion is sometimes challenging, some simple and readily available biologic parameters can be helpful in the diagnosis of SIADH. In SIADH, urea is typically low; this is less specific for elderly patients, for whom lower clearance of urea accounts for higher values. Low levels of uric acid are more often seen in SIADH (70%) compared with salt-depleted patients (40%). Typically, patients with SIADH will show a lower anion gap with nearly normal total CO2 and serum potassium, this despite dilution. In patients with hyponatremia secondary to hypocorticism, total CO2 is usually lower than in nonendocrine SIADH despite low urea and uric acid levels. Urine biology can also be helpful in diagnosis of SIADH because patients with SIADH have high urine sodium (Na; >30 mEq/L), and most of them will have a high fractional excretion of Na (>0.5% in 70% of cases), reflecting salt intake. Conversely, low urine Na in patients with SIADH and poor alimentation is not rare. Finally, measurement of urine osmolality is useful for the diagnosis of polydipsia and reset osmostat and could further help in the choice of therapeutic strategy because patients with low urine osmolality will benefit from water restriction or urea, whereas those with high urine osmolality (>600 mOsm/kg) would be good candidates for V2 antagonist.

### Use of copeptin in interpretation of the water deprivation test [^0d8db273]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

For many years, the water deprivation test has been the standard method for differentiating between the causes of the polyuria/ polydipsia syndrome.The test will distinguish between diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of primary polydipsia (PP). With cranial diabetes insipidus (cDI), there is a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin (AVP) following damage to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary, resulting in an inability to retain water and concentrate urine. With PP, there is an urge to drink excessively that results in high urine output. It is recognized that there may be partial deficiency of ADH—partial cranial diabetes insipidus (pDI) resulting in abnormal but not total inability to concentrate urine. There are a smaller group of people who develop resistance to the action of antidiuretic hormone at the level of the kidney (nephrogenic DI). It is important to distinguish between PP and cDI as the management of the two conditions is significantly different.The major difference between the two conditions is the ability to release ADH in response to osmotic stimulation but the assay is time‐consuming.In the absence of a significant increase in serum osmolality, measured concentrations are often very low. The water deprivation test involves a medically supervised period of water restriction where the individual's weight, urine output, serum and urine osmolalities are measured. For a significant proportion of people, the test will be equivocal with some concentration of the urine but not achieving the established cut‐off for normality. This may be because there is partial impairment of ADH production or because large volumes of dilute urine associated with polydipsia will degrade the ability of kidney to produce concentrated urine by reducing the renal medullary concentration gradient.Although the test is widely used, it has significant drawbacks and is an indirect way of diagnosing ADH deficiency.

### The diagnostic performance of copeptin in clinical practice: a prospective study [^00d76e24]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Plasma copeptin is a relatively new biomarker for evaluation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion. The aim of this study was to test the diagnostic performance of copeptin in patients with polyuria-polydipsia syndrome.

Design, Patients and Measurements

This was a prospective study where 88 patients with polyuria-polydipsia syndrome were evaluated with a water deprivation test (WDT). Weight, urine osmolality, urine specific gravity, and plasma copeptin were collected at baseline, after 8h, and at termination of the WDT when one of the following had been reached: (i) >3% weight reduction, (ii) urine specific gravity >1.017 or urine osmolality >600mOsm/kg, or (iii) intolerable adverse symptoms.

Results

Of 88 patients (57 women), 21 (24%) were diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus (cDI), 5 (6%) with nephrogenic DI (nDI), and 62 (71%) with primary polydipsia (PP). Median (interquartile range) copeptin at baseline was 1.7 (1.4-2.5) pmol/L in cDI, 22 (18-65) pmol/L in nDI, and 2.7 (2-4) pmol/L in PP. After 8h of WDT, the highest copeptin in patients with cDI was 4.0pmol/L. In patients with PP: (i) 41 had urine osmolality <600mOsm/kg, 7 (17%) of these had copeptin >4.0pmol/L, (ii) 21 had urine osmolality ≥600mOsm/kg, 14 (67%) of these had copeptin >4.0pmol/L.

Conclusions

Copeptin >4.0pmol/L after an overnight WDT can be used to rule out cDI and copeptin ≥21pmol/L at baseline to diagnose nDI. The diagnostic performance of copeptin in the context of the WDT is otherwise limited in the diagnostic work-up of patients with polyuria-polydipsia syndrome.

### Redefining diagnostic cut-offs for the indirect water deprivation test [^f1c6e509]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

The water deprivation test is the current gold‐standard to diagnose AVP‐D and AVP‐R. This study sought to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the test and demonstrated that a serum sodium cut‐off in tandem with urine osmolality, may yield an improved diagnostic accuracy compared to using the current serum osmolality cut‐off. We recommend that serum sodium be measured in addition to serum osmolality in all indirect water deprivation tests, owing to its reduced variability.

Conclusions

Patients hospitalised with severe hypernatraemia are usually elderly and frail with several co-morbidities and show a variety of different, mostly neurological symptoms. Our results indicated that copeptin as well as urea levels identify patients with central diabetes insipidus with high specificity and sensitivity among patients with severe hypernatraemia, but both markers are not helpful in the differential diagnosis between dehydration-induced hypernatraemia and salt overload. Urine osmolality reliably identified patients with central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, but overall urine collection before treatment initiation was poor.

Dysnatraemias are common in-hospital electrolyte disturbances and are related to inequalities in water homeostasis. Mild hypernatraemia, defined as a serum sodium value > 145 mmol/L occurs in about 1–3% of hospitalised patients, whereas more severe hypernatraemia (i.e. > 155 mmol/L) is rarer. Mortality rates in patients with hypernatraemia are clearly increased up to 37–55%.

Mostly, hypernatraemia represents a free water deficit in relation to the body’s sodium stores and can result from a free water loss (i.e. gastrointestinal losses, osmotic diuresis and diabetes insipidus) or a gain of sodium, typically resulting from iatrogenic sodium load. The differential diagnosis of the underlying cause of hypernatraemia is based mostly first on the measurement of urine osmolality and second on the assessment of extracellular fluid volume status. Recently, a study showed insufficient urine sampling in hospitalised patients with hyponatraemia, which indicated low urine collection rates in hospitalised patients. To date, urine collection rates for patients with hypernatraemia have not been reported, but in clinical practice urine sampling seems to be neglected in patients with life-threatening conditions. Furthermore, the assessment of the extracellular fluid volume status in clinical practice remains challenging and can be misleading. Several studies show that in clinical practice correction of hypernatraemia is inadequate, and delayed treatment may have morbid clinical consequences. Therefore, a readily available diagnostic marker for the differential diagnosis of hypernatraemia would be of major clinical importance, especially for identification of patients with central diabetes insipidus, who need prompt treatment with desmopressin (DDAVP).

The most important hormone for the regulation of water homeostasis is arginine vasopressin (AVP). The measurement of AVP is cumbersome, but copeptin is produced in equimolar amounts to AVP, and recent data show that copeptin levels mirror AVP levels during disorders of water balance. Copeptin is stable in plasma and serum and can be readily determined. In the present study, we therefore aimed to investigate whether, compared with usual biomarkers and clinical signs, copeptin measurement improves the differential diagnosis in patients with severe hypernatraemia.

### A copeptin-based approach in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus [^0197102c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

The indirect water-deprivation test is the current reference standard for the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. However, it is technically cumbersome to administer, and the results are often inaccurate. The current study compared the indirect water-deprivation test with direct detection of plasma copeptin, a precursor-derived surrogate of arginine vasopressin.

Methods

From 2013 to 2017, we recruited 156 patients with hypotonic polyuria at 11 medical centers to undergo both water-deprivation and hypertonic saline infusion tests. In the latter test, plasma copeptin was measured when the plasma sodium level had increased to at least 150 mmol per liter after infusion of hypertonic saline. The primary outcome was the overall diagnostic accuracy of each test as compared with the final reference diagnosis, which was determined on the basis of medical history, test results, and treatment response, with copeptin levels masked.

Results

A total of 144 patients underwent both tests. The final diagnosis was primary polydipsia in 82 patients (57%), central diabetes insipidus in 59 (41%), and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in 3 (2%). Overall, among the 141 patients included in the analysis, the indirect water-deprivation test determined the correct diagnosis in 108 patients (diagnostic accuracy, 76.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 68.9 to 83.2), and the hypertonic saline infusion test (with a copeptin cutoff level of >4.9 pmol per liter) determined the correct diagnosis in 136 patients (96.5%; 95% CI, 92.1 to 98.6; P<0.001). The indirect water-deprivation test correctly distinguished primary polydipsia from partial central diabetes insipidus in 77 of 105 patients (73.3%; 95% CI, 63.9 to 81.2), and the hypertonic saline infusion test distinguished between the two conditions in 99 of 104 patients (95.2%; 95% CI, 89.4 to 98.1; adjusted P<0.001). One serious adverse event (desmopressin-induced hyponatremia that resulted in hospitalization) occurred during the water-deprivation test.

Conclusions

The direct measurement of hypertonic saline-stimulated plasma copeptin had greater diagnostic accuracy than the water-deprivation test in patients with hypotonic polyuria. (Funded by the Swiss National Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01940614 .).

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^fd1fa3f5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Copeptin derives from the same precursor peptide preprovasopressin as arginine vasopressin (AVP). The secretion of both peptides is stimulated by similar physiological processes, such as osmotic stimulation, hypovolemia, or stress. AVP is difficult to measure due to complex preanalytical requirements and due to technical difficulties. In the last years, copeptin was found to be a stable, sensitive, and simple to measure surrogate marker of AVP release. Different immunoassays exist to measure copeptin. The 2 assays which have most often be used in clinical studies are the original sandwich immunoluminometric assay and its automated immunofluorescent successor. In addition, various enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay have been developed. With the availability of the copeptin assay, the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was recently revisited. The goal for this article is therefore to first review the physiology of copeptin, and second to describe its use as marker for the differential diagnosis of vasopressin-dependent fluid disorders, mainly diabetes insipidus but also hyper- and hyponatremia. Furthermore, we highlight the role of copeptin as prognostic marker in other acute and chronic diseases.

### A combined outpatient and inpatient overnight water deprivation test is effective and safe in diagnosing patients with polyuria-polydipsia syndrome [^d56d7f0b]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The water deprivation test (WDT) is widely used for the differential diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome (PPS). However, it is inconvenient and may not always be precise in differentiating partial forms of diabetes insipidus (DI) from primary polydipsia (PP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a combined outpatient and inpatient overnight WDT protocol that included an overnight unsupervised period concerning its feasibility and safety.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data and laboratory results of 52 patients with PPS undergoing WDT at a single center.

Results

PP was the most frequent diagnosis, followed by complete central DI (cCDI), partial central DI (pCDI), and nephrogenic DI (NDI). Over 90% of the patients showed an expected increase in serum osmolality at the end of the dehydration period. There were no reports of complications during the overnight deprivation period. Post-dehydration urine osmolality and urine-to-serum osmolality ratio significantly differentiated all the groups ( P<.05), except for cCDI and NDI, which could be differentiated by basal and post-dehydration vasopressin (AVP) levels ( P<.05 for both). Although these measurements were useful for differentiating patients according to their allocation groups, results from WDT and direct AVP levels may often require a comprehensive diagnostic approach, particularly in the challenging groups of PP and pCDI.

Conclusion

A combined outpatient and inpatient overnight WDT protocol is safe and feasible when the test is performed with special care at experienced centers. Newer diagnostic tools are expected to improve the accuracy of PPS diagnosis.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^7974f917]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

No role for measuring arginine vasopressin or copeptin

Investigations that have not been proven useful in the differential diagnosis of hypotonic hyponatremia so far include measurement of AVP, which rapidly degrades ex vivo, and copeptin, the more stable cleavage product of AVP that is a biochemical surrogate for AVP action. Both AVP and copeptin are elevated in most cases of hyponatremia, including SIAD (“inappropriately”) as well as in hypovolemia (“appropriately,” in response to reduced effective circulatory blood volume), hence measurement does not assist in discriminating between these causes. Hyponatremia due to primary polydipsia, or profoundly low solute intake reducing renal electrolyte-free water excretory capacity, has been shown to have a low copeptin, reflecting the AVP-independent pathophysiology. Nephrogenic SIAD, caused by an activating mutation in the vasopressin V2 receptor, will also lead to suppressed AVP and copeptin. Identifying this rare differential may be an exception where copeptin testing in hyponatremia could be useful - a low copeptin result (without evidence of polydipsia) can be followed by confirmatory AVPR2 gene testing. A recent study investigating copeptin as a marker of response to hypertonic saline therapy in 100 hyponatremic patients found that a lower copeptin was associated with higher rate of overcorrection; however, this is may be due to resolution of the underlying cause of SIAD by the time copeptin was measured, which would be more readily reflected in increased urine output with lower urine osmolality. Urine osmolality is generally a fairly good surrogate indicator of AVP activity (provided that renal function is not markedly impaired) that is more readily accessible, hence low urine osmolality is often sufficient to raise suspicion of differentials such as polydipsia or low solute intake.

### Water deprivation test in children with polyuria [^0b2db07c]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Polyuria is an uncommon clinical presentation in paediatric practice. When diabetes mellitus has been excluded by history taking and preliminary investigations and impaired renal concentrating ability is confirmed, water deprivation test (WDT) is necessary to differentiate among central diabetes insipidus (CDI), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, or primary polydipsia. Traditionally, responsiveness to desmopressin injection is defined as urine osmolality >750 mOsm/kg. However, that level could not be reached in the review of our patients. We discuss how to arrive at the diagnosis of CDI in WDT. An approach to polyuria and WDT will also be discussed.

Neurosurgery—brain (applies only to neurosurgery with potential to affect the hypothalamic-pituitary axis)—diabetes insipidus follow-up identifies diabetes insipidus as a potential late effect and specifies periodic evaluation via history with assessment of excessive thirst/polyuria yearly. Health links note hypopituitarism. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include Na, K, Cl, CO2, serum osmolality, and urine osmolality as clinically indicated if history is consistent with excessive thirst and/or polyuria; evaluation for other central endocrinopathies, including growth hormone (GH) deficiency, central hypothyroidism, central adrenal insufficiency, precocious puberty, and gonadotropin deficiency; and referral to endocrine to manage hormonal dysfunction. Diabetes insipidus is described as unlikely to occur as a late effect past two years from therapeutic exposure, and other causes should be considered if symptoms are present. The pathway is tagged as SYSTEM = Endocrine/Metabolic with SCORE = 1. Additional information advises considering patient and cancer/treatment factors, including craniopharyngioma, extension of tumor into hypothalamus, surgery in supra-sellar region, and reoperation for recurrent tumor.

### Diabetes insipidus as a complication after pituitary surgery [^a3dbb422]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

A 28-year-old woman presented with new-onset vertigo and diplopia that had started 2 weeks previously. An MRI scan of the brain revealed an 11 x 9 x 9 mm sellar mass that extended into the suprasellar region. Evaluation of pituitary function showed mild central hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal insufficiency. The patient underwent trans-sphenoidal resection of the mass without any significant intraoperative complications. On postoperative day 1 she abruptly developed polyuria, hypernatremia and urine hypo-osmolality.

Investigations

Measurements of plasma and urine osmolality, urine specific gravity, and serum sodium levels.

Diagnosis

Postoperative diabetes insipidus with a triphasic pattern.

Management

The patient's diabetes insipidus was initially treated with intravenous desmopressin, and her fluid status, serum sodium levels, and serum and urine osmolality were carefully monitored. During the second, antidiuretic phase, desmopressin was discontinued and the patient's fluid intake was restricted. After recurrence of diabetes insipidus during the third phase, the patient was treated with intranasal desmopressin and was discharged. She remains on desmopressin therapy for chronic diabetes insipidus.

Urine osmolality and biomarkers during tolvaptan therapy in ADPKD—no specific biomarkers have sufficient specificity or sensitivity to verify the effectiveness of tolvaptan use on disease progression, and although urine osmolality from a spot urine test provides initial indirect verification of vasopressin blockade, serial measurement during tolvaptan therapy probably has limited clinical utility. In a post hoc analysis of the TEMPO 3:4 trial, ~81% of participants receiving tolvaptan achieved a urine osmolality <300 mOsm/kg, and no additional benefit occurred to disease progression when decreasing to <250 mOsmol/kg.

### Copeptin levels and commonly used laboratory parameters in hospitalised patients with severe hypernatraemia-the "Co-MED study" [^9caf9e6e]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest study involving prospective evaluation of symptoms and characteristics of patients with severe hypernatraemia and assessment of the value of copeptin and other laboratory parameters in the differential diagnosis of severe hypernatraemia. Our data reveal five key findings. First, patients with severe hypernatraemia had a variety of non-specific symptoms, and notably, only a few patients reported thirst. Furthermore, most patients had several co-morbidities and were treated with numerous drugs promoting the development of hypernatraemia. Second, urine osmolality could identify patients with either central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, but it did not differ between these two differential diagnoses. Third, copeptin levels were lowest in patients with central diabetes insipidus-induced hypernatraemia with a cut-off of 4.4 pmol/L, thus identifying patients with central diabetes insipidus with a very high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, low urine osmolality and high copeptin levels were diagnostic for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Fourth, low urea levels were found in patients with central diabetes insipidus, and levels < 5.05 mmol/L were equally specific and sensitive for the diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus. Fifth, no differentiation was possible between patients with dehydration-induced hypernatraemia and salt overload with both markers.

Our cohort is comparable to other cohorts described in the literature, including mostly elderly, general medical and typical ICU patients. Symptoms were diffuse, and the most common recorded signs were neurological symptoms (i.e. somnolence, disorientation and falls), which is in line with a previously published retrospective study describing patients with severe hypernatraemia. Interestingly, only one-fourth of our patients reported thirst sensation. One reason for this might be the high number of neurological symptoms and co-morbidities, reflecting the difficulty for patients to report thirst. However, absence of thirst is a well-known phenomenon in elderly patients, which might have had a high impact on developing hypernatraemia in this elderly population. Furthermore, with advanced age, renal volume and the number of functioning nephrons decrease progressively, and the capacity to concentrate urine diminishes. Additionally, the response of renal tubules to AVP might be impaired. These changes in the aging kidney can lead to reduced water retention and sodium excretion capacity, promoting the development of hypernatraemia in elderly patients.

Child with suspected diabetes insipidus—testing and infant therapy guidance states that a water deprivation test should only be performed under close supervision by a specialist for confirmation of this diagnosis as patients can have cardiovascular collapse if not properly monitored. For infants with DI, first-line management is diet plus thiazide: first line of therapy in neonates and infants with DI is using expressed breast milk or a low solute formula like PM 60/40 and hydrochlorothiazide, as their diet consists mainly of liquids, and hydrochlorothiazide has been proven to be a safe and effective way to treat mild to moderate DI while avoiding the sodium fluctuations often seen with desmopressin treatment in infants.

### Copeptin levels and commonly used laboratory parameters in hospitalised patients with severe hypernatraemia-the "Co-MED study" [^4d55f6b4]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Median urea values were different in patients with central diabetes insipidus, salt overload and dehydration-induced hypernatraemia (P = 0.003). In a post hoc comparison, median urea values in patients with central diabetes insipidus (4 mmol/L, IQR 3.1–3.7) were lower than in patients with salt overload (19.8 mmol/L, IQR 15.8–34.3) or dehydration-induced hypernatraemia (18.1 mmol/L, 12.2–30.1) (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). Of note, urea values were similar in patients with dehydration-induced hypernatraemia and salt overload (P = 0.27). Patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus showed high median urea levels (15.3 mmol/L) (see Fig. 2). The AUC for urea levels in diagnosing central diabetes insipidus was 0.98 (95% CI 0.96–1.0). A cut-off value of < 5.05 mmol/L showed a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of 100% for the diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus. When only patients hospitalised at the ICU (n = 50) were included, the results were similar to those for the whole patient cohort (data not shown).

Fig. 2 
Urea levels in the differential diagnosis of hypernatraemia

Overall, urine samples collected before treatment initiation were available only for 3 patients with central diabetes insipidus, 2 patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, 7 patients with salt overload and 26 patients with dehydration-induced hypernatraemia. Taken together, patients with central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus had a lower urine osmolality (284 mmol/kg, IQR 209–306) than patients with dehydration-induced hypernatraemia (546 mmol/kg, IQR 463–647) or salt overload (510 mmol/kg, IQR 462–819) (P = 0.006). A urine osmolality < 329 mOsm/kg revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for identifying patients with either central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. We found no differences between the various differential diagnoses for uric acid (P = 0.1) and urine sodium values (P = 0.47).

Copeptin Based Tests to Differentiate Diabetes Insipidus From Primary Polydipsia

Given the different etiologies of these disorders, there are major differences in treatment. For example, while central diabetes insipidus is mainly treated with exogenous AVP (desmopressin), patients with primary polydipsia are advised to slowly reduce their fluid intake. Therefore, a diagnostic test with high diagnostic accuracy is crucial to avoid wrong treatment decisions. While the standard water deprivation test as described for our patient has been the diagnostic gold standard for decades despite its low diagnostic accuracy of only 70%, recent evaluations showed improved diagnostic accuracy for copeptin based tests.

The easiest etiology to diagnose is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, since copeptin measurements of these patients revealed consistently high levels. In fact, it has been shown that using an unstimulated copeptin cut-off of >21.4 pmol/L had a 100% sensitivity and specificity to diagnose nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Accordingly, no further evaluations than a random copeptin measurement are needed in these patients.

Peak (A) serum, (B) urine osmolality during the water deprivation test for each diagnostic group. Graph of baseline copeptin measurement against the final diagnosis for each patient. P for difference between Nephrogenic DI and others p <.001. No other significant differences between groups.

Eighteen individuals proceeded to desmopressin administration following the period of water deprivation. None of the pp group achieved a 50% rise in urine osmolality. All of cDI group except one achieved a 50% rise, in that individual the serum osmolality had climbed to 305 with water restriction and normalized with desmopressin and drinking. The pDI group showed a variable response to desmopressin with a range of 18–200% increase.

Figure 2 shows the individual values of copeptin measured before the period of water deprivation. There is a clinically and statistically significant difference between copeptin values for nephrogenic DI and the other groups (p <.001); otherwise, there were no significant differences between groups. Figure 2B shows the individual copeptin values following a period of water deprivation. As the values of copeptin are so much higher for the nephrogenic DI group, they have been omitted from the figure to emphasize the differences between the other three diagnoses. Again, there is no significant difference between groups. The groups that do get more dehydrated (cDI and pDI) are those with defects in copeptin release and also do not show a significant rise. There are two individuals (one in the cDI group and one in the pDI group) who show an unexpected rise in copeptin despite having a confirmed diagnosis of presumptive antidiuretic hormone deficiency. These two cases are discussed further below. Figure 3 displays the stimulated copeptin measurements by the diagnosis for individuals based solely on the water deprivation test. Individuals can either meet the required diagnostic criteria based on serum and urine osmolalities to make a specific diagnosis or are otherwise classified as indeterminate if the results are discrepant. Each individual is then labelled by the final diagnosis achieved based on clinical context and further clinical review. Copeptin cut‐offs at 2.6 and 4.8 pmol/L have been added (derived from previous publications).There is a wide spread of copeptin values within the PP group, but each individual had already achieved a firm diagnosis based on serum and urine osmolality changes. Most patients with a final diagnosis of cDI achieved a clear diagnosis during the water deprivation test although two individuals would have been classified as pDI based solely on the test. The addition of copeptin would have helped to clarify the diagnosis for one of these two but the individual labelled as Case 1 achieved a stimulated copeptin outside of the suggested range for a diagnosis of cDI.

### A history of diabetes insipidus: paving the road to internal water balance [^d68caa9e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is an ancient disease considered under the rubric of diabetes, the Greek descriptive term for polyuria, which was unrecognized even after the sweetness of urine was reported as a characteristic of diabetes mellitus in the 17th century. It would be another century before diabetes insipidus was identified from the insipid rather than saccharine taste of urine in cases of polyuria. After its increased recognition, pathologic observations and experimental studies connected diabetes insipidus to the pituitary gland in the opening decades of the 20th century. Simultaneously, posterior pituitary lobe extracts were shown to be vasoconstrictive (vasopressin) and antidiuretic (antidiuretic hormone). As vasopressin was purified and synthesized and its assay became available, it was shown to be released in response to both osmotic and volume stimuli that are integrated in the hypothalamus, and vasopressin thereby was essential to maintaining internal water balance. The antidiuretic properties of vasopressin to treat the rare cases of diabetes insipidus were of limited clinical utility until its vasoconstrictive effects were resuscitated in the 1970s, with the consequent increasing wider use of vasopressin for the treatment of compromised hemodynamic states. In addition, the discovery of antidiuretic hormone receptor blockers has led to their increasing use in managing hypo-osmolar states.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^00a97e15]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Back to Patient Presentation

Although the water deprivation test initially indicated partial diabetes insipidus, the further course of the disease under desmopressin treatment was suspicious for primary polydipsia. Therefore, our patient underwent the hypertonic saline infusion test for further evaluation. During osmotic stimulation to a plasma sodium level of 150 mmol/L, his copeptin level rose to 16 pmol/L. Accordingly, the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was revised to primary polydipsia and the patient referred to our colleagues from the psychosomatic department. With their help, the patient was able to slowly decrease his daily fluid intake to 3 L per day. During the last follow-up, the sodium levels remained stable and the patient reported wellbeing. Occasionally, he felt an increased sense of thirst, but he learned to deal with it.

This case illustrates that clinical signs and symptoms, such as severe polyuria–polydipsia with a high daily fluid intake or nocturia that are sometimes described as characteristic of diabetes insipidus, are unspecific. Similarly, the magnetic resonance imaging finding “absence of posterior pituitary bright spot” is not specific for central diabetes insipidus as the bright spot is also invisible in up to 40% of primary polydipsia patients (compared to 70% of patients with central diabetes insipidus).

Several observations during the water deprivation test wrongly led to the diagnosis of partial diabetes insipidus: high amount of polyuria and loss of body weight, moderate increase of urine osmolality during test period and good urine osmolality response to desmopressin. At this point it must be mentioned that the diagnostic criteria of the water deprivation test were based on data from only 36 patients and, unsurprisingly, the overall diagnostic accuracy of this test is very poor (diagnostic accuracy 70%). Moreover, to reliably interpret AVP action or urine concentration capacity, a hypernatremic state has to be reached. This is often not the case during the water deprivation test, as exemplified by our case. With the hypertonic saline test, a hypernatremic state is ensured and the measurement of stimulated copeptin values increases the diagnostic accuracy of the test to 97%.

Case 1 presented in pregnancy with presumed hypophisitis. Her water deprivation test at that point was diagnostic of cDI, and she was replaced with desmopressin with resolution of her symptoms. Her water deprivation test was repeated 7 years later to look for improvement, on this occasion copeptin was included. This again clearly showed cDI with a peak serum osmolality of 309 mmol/kg and a peak urine osmolality of 472 mmol/kg. The urine concentrated to 701 mmol/kg with desmopressin. This fulfils the criteria for cDI with the implication being that she is deficient in antidiuretic hormone but her copeptin result at 4.3 pmol/L suggested at least some residual antidiuretic hormone production.

Case 2 was an 88‐year‐old man who had presented with pituitary apoplexy and diabetes insipidus. He had been started on anterior pituitary hormone replacement and desmopressin as an inpatient. Following water deprivation, there was no change in the serum osmolality but also no change in the urine osmolality with a peak urine osmolality of 115 mmol/Kg. Following desmopressin, the urine concentrated to 402 mmol/Kg. His stimulated copeptin was comfortably normal at 6.5 pmol/L despite not seeing a significant change in his serum concentration. He was discharged on a continuing dose of desmopressin and unfortunately readmitted to hospital 3 months later with a dilutional hyponatraemia that responded to a reduction in desmopressin dose. He had responded to desmopressin treatment, but had normal copeptin suggesting relative deficiency together with some resistance to hormone action.

### Copeptin levels and commonly used laboratory parameters in hospitalised patients with severe hypernatraemia-the "Co-MED study" [^b8973006]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypernatraemia is common in inpatients and is associated with substantial morbidity. Its differential diagnosis is challenging, and delayed treatment may have devastating consequences. The most important hormone for the regulation of water homeostasis is arginine vasopressin, and copeptin, the C-terminal portion of the precursor peptide of arginine vasopressin, might be a reliable new parameter with which to assess the underlying cause of hypernatraemia.

Methods

In this prospective, multicentre, observational study conducted in two tertiary referral centres in Switzerland, 92 patients with severe hyperosmolar hypernatraemia (Na + >155 mmol/L) were included. After a standardised diagnostic evaluation, the underlying cause of hypernatraemia was identified and copeptin levels were measured.

Results

The most common aetiology of hypernatraemia was dehydration (DH) (n=65 [71%]), followed by salt overload (SO) (n=20 [22%]), central diabetes insipidus (CDI) (n=5 [5%]) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) (n=2 [2%]). Low urine osmolality was indicative for patients with CDI and NDI (P<0.01). Patients with CDI had lower copeptin levels than patients with DH or SO (both P<0.01) or those with NDI. Copeptin identified CDI with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-1.00), and a cut-off value≤4.4pmol/L showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99% to predict CDI. Similarly, urea values were lower in CDI than in DH or SO (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively) or NDI. The AUC for diagnosing CDI was 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00), and a cut-off value<5.05 mmol/L showed high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of CDI (98% and 100%, respectively). Copeptin and urea could not differentiate hypernatraemia induced by DH from that induced by SO (P=0.66 and P=0.30, respectively).

Conclusions

Copeptin and urea reliably identify patients with CDI and are therefore helpful tools for therapeutic management in patients with severe hypernatraemia.

### Child with suspected diabetes insipidus [^a0db4242]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected diabetes insipidus—differential diagnosis of polyuria includes psychogenic polydipsia causing wash out of the medullary concentration gradient; diabetes mellitus associated with increased urine glucose excretion and elevated blood glucose; central diabetes insipidus (defect in antidiuretic hormone [ADH] production) due to genetic causes, trauma, neurosurgical intervention, radiation, congenital anatomic defects, neoplasms, infiltrative, autoimmune and infectious causes where Langerhans cell histiocytosis is the most common type of infiltrative disorder causing diabetes insipidus, and drugs; and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (defect in ADH action) that can be genetic or acquired, with acquired forms more common from drugs, ureteral obstruction, polycystic kidney disease, medullary cystic disease, or primary polydipsia with wash out of the medullary concentrating gradient.

### Redefining diagnostic cut-offs for the indirect water deprivation test [^01d106c0]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods and Materials

This was a retrospective study of all water deprivation tests performed in adults at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT) London over a 9‐year period. Clinical and biochemical data from the water deprivation test protocol, including periodic measurements of urine volume, urine osmolality, serum osmolality, serum sodium and body weight were obtained from patient electronic records. Consistent with departmental protocol, patients with an inconclusive result underwent a prolonged water deprivation test.

The procedures for the standard and the prolonged water deprivation test were carried out according to published protocols. In brief, during the first phase of water deprivation, four serum (P 1 to P 4) and urine (U 1 to U 4) samples were collected at regular intervals. Following this, intramuscular desmopressin was administered, after which four additional urine samples (U 5 to U 8) were collected. Serum samples were used to measure serum osmolality and sodium, and urine samples were used to measure urine osmolality.

During the prolonged test, monitoring was carried out as described above for the standard test. Urine samples were collected and measured hourly, with serum samples collected and measured every 2 h. Water deprivation was continued until three consecutive urine osmolality measurements increased by less than 30 mOsm/kg. Intramuscular desmopressin was then given, with four consecutive urine measurements collected at hourly intervals. For safety, both the standard and prolonged tests were stopped in the event of greater than 3% weight loss, significant changes in blood pressure, or other systemic signs.

The final diagnosis was confirmed following a comprehensive clinical review by a panel of endocrinologists based on the WDT and clinical history of patients. All patients were followed‐up for at least 4 months. Patients were classified as positive (i.e. a diagnosis of AVP‐D and AVP‐R), and negative in those without disorders of vasopressin (normal and PP). Partial cases generally constituted patients whose urine osmolality was between 300 and 750 mOsm/kg with plasma osmolalities less than 300 mOsm/kg, alongside those who fell within this subtype based on clinical monitoring of symptoms and treatment needs. In cases where results were equivocal, repeat testing was performed. In further equivocal cases where repeat tests remained ambiguous, clinical review with desmopressin replacement was conducted. Patients who remained well without requiring desmopressin were considered healthy. Patients who required desmopressin replacement, were classified as having AVP‐D or AVP‐R (including partial cases). This study was completed as a registered service evaluation within ICHNT (ref: END_027).

1 Introduction

The indirect water deprivation test is the gold standard to differentiate between arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP‐D), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP‐R), and psychogenic polydipsia (PP) in patients with polydipsia‐polyuria syndrome. During this investigation, the patient is deprived of fluids for 8–10 h, with regular measurements of urine volume, and urine and serum osmolality.

In healthy individuals, urine osmolality is expected to rise to (and above) 750 mOsm/kg during the fluid deprivation phase, with little to no increase following desmopressin administration. In patients with complete AVP‐D, urine osmolality is expected to stay below 300 mOsm/kg for the fluid deprivation phase but is expected to rise by greater than 50% following desmopressin. For patients with AVP‐R, urine osmolality also remains below 300 mOsm/kg for the fluid deprivation phase but does not rise by more than 50% following desmopressin, owing to renal resistance.

Measurement of serum osmolality in the first phase of the indirect water deprivation test aims to identify the ability to maintain osmotic balance within physiological limits. Serum osmolality levels of less than 280 mOsm/kg are indicative of PP whereas an osmolality of greater than 300 mOsm/kg is diagnostic of AVP‐D or AVP‐R. The test is stopped if the patient loses more than 3% of baseline body weight as excessive dehydration can be dangerous, and this amount of weight loss is indicative of a positive test.

Osmolality is measured by freezing point depression, but can also be estimated from measured sodium, potassium, urea, and glucose. The latter three change very little, so the major influence on serum osmolality is serum sodium. Hence, we hypothesised that serum sodium would be a more reproducible measurement than serum osmolality. This study therefore aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the ≥ 300 mOsm/kg serum osmolality cut‐off in comparison to serum sodium, particularly in differentiating AVP‐D and AVP‐R from patients with physiologically normal AVP and/or renal function.

Use of Water Deprivation Tests

The indirect water deprivation test was first described in 1970 and remained the diagnostic gold standard for many decades. This test relies on the concept that the concentration of urine over a 16-hour period of fluid restriction is an indirect assessment of AVP secretion. In addition, the ability to concentrate urine in response to the synthetic V2 receptor-specific AVP analogue, desmopressin, is assessed at the end of the test. In patients where the urinary osmolality stays below 300 mOsm/kg during fluid deprivation but increases over 50% upon desmopressin administration the diagnosis of complete AVP-D can be made. Patients with a persistent low urinary osmolality and no response to desmopressin are diagnosed with AVP-R. Urinary concentration in patients with partial AVP and PP is expected to increase to levels above 300 mOsm/kg, while remaining below 800 mOsm/kg, with further increases in osmolality seen upon desmopressin injection of more than 9% in patients with partial AVP-D and less than 9% in patients with PP.

If reliable copeptin assays are not easily available, the water deprivation test remains a valid diagnostic test. A shorter version, that is, an overnight water deprivation test is often done as first diagnostic approach in clinical practice and is safe unless there is a high index of suspicion for complete AVP-D (in which case any restriction of fluid intake should be supervised). Published criteria to exclude AVP-D require morning fasted urine osmolality to be greater than 800 mOsm/kg. However, in practice, levels > 600 mOsm/kg generally exclude clinically significant AVP-D.

It is, however, important to be aware of the limitations in interpretation of the classically described test. First, the osmolality cutoffs described above were derived from a single study involving only 36 patients with post hoc assessment that has never been prospectively validated. Second, the test results can be misleading in PP patients with a reduced renal medullary concentration gradient or partial AVP-R patients with sensitive response to desmopressin administration. Accordingly, 2 prospective studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the indirect water deprivation test found it to be only 70% to 77%, with especially low accuracy in the differentiation between partial AVP-D and PP patients. Finally, a large multicenter international study showed that two-thirds of the patients with PP who underwent a water deprivation test concentrated urine above 10% after desmopressin administration, leading to misclassification.

### Enhancing diagnostic tools for vasopressin deficiency: insights from a single-center cohort study [^2248ff79]. Pituitary (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

A recent multicenter trial confirmed that hypertonic saline-stimulated copeptin is superior to the arginine stimulation test (AST) for diagnosing vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D). The latter, though less accurate, is cheaper, better tolerated, and easier to perform. We aimed to improve AST diagnostic accuracy by incorporating additional parameters alongside copeptin.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed ASTs from patients evaluated for suspected AVP-D. Final diagnosis was defined based on clinical, biochemical, radiological and follow-up data. We evaluated the test diagnostic accuracy based on either literature reported or ROC-based thresholds of several variables even in combination.

Results

Nineteen patients were included and 8 were diagnosed with AVP-D. Copeptin response to AST was flat in AVP-D compared to primary polydipsia (PP) but showed limited discriminatory power with the maximal accuracy for copeptin-based parameters reaching 73.7%. AVP-D patients had lower urinary osmolarity (UOsm) and higher plasma osmolarity and serum sodium (Na) at AST end. Na at AST end was the best predictor of AVP-D (≥141 mmol/L: sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 100%, accuracy 94.7%, AUC 0.989). A multistep approach initially assessing Na at AST end and, in dubious cases (140-142 mmol/l), also either copeptin peak (≤4.1 pmol/L), UOsm (≤428 mOsm/kg), or absent posterior pituitary hyperintense signal achieved 100% diagnostic accuracy. Logistic regression using Na at AST end values combined with any of these aforementioned additional variables also reached complete discrimination between AVP-D and PP.

Discussion

Combining multiple parameters after AST improved diagnostic accuracy, even without measuring copeptin. Despite the study's retrospective design, small sample, and absence of hypertonic saline testing, findings support the potential utility of a multivariable approach to AST interpretation.

### A patient with partial central diabetes insipidus: clarifying pathophysiology and designing treatment [^233ab9c8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Studies were undertaken in a 32-year-old man who developed polyuria (4 L/d) a few days after a basal skull fracture; the condition persisted 1 year after the accident. The other major features were thirst, a plasma sodium of 143 mmol/L, 24-hour urine osmolality of 221 mOsm/kg H(2)O, and levels of vasopressin in plasma that were less than 0.5 pg/mL on 20 separate occasions. The 24-hour urine volume implied that the diagnosis was partial rather than complete central diabetes insipidus; however, several random urine samples had a much higher osmolality. An infusion of hypertonic saline led to the release of vasopressin and the excretion of concentrated urine. We propose that the basis for the lesion may be the transection of some, but not all, of the fibers connecting the osmostat and vasopressin release center. This partial transection could permit vasopressin to be secreted in response to a larger rise in plasma sodium concentration. This pathophysiologic analysis provided the basis for therapy to minimize the degree of polyuria.

### Use of copeptin in interpretation of the water deprivation test [^a6c8f7ad]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSION

We have studied the utility of adding copeptin measurement at baseline and following water deprivation as an addition. Nephrogenic diabetes has significantly higher copeptin measurements on both baseline and stimulated samples. This diagnosis can be confirmed on a baseline blood test, and water deprivation may not be required. To distinguish between cDI, pDI and PP, the water deprivation test showed significant differences in both serum and urine osmolality between groups and specifically between pDI and PP. Stimulated or baseline copeptin, however, did not show a significant difference between groups (excluding nephrogenic DI). This does not imply that adding copeptin does not have some clinical utility when added to the water deprivation test. It has previously been established that a significant proportion of test results will be indeterminateand this was true for this cohort. For the indeterminate group in this cohort, the final clinical diagnosis for the majority was primary polydipsia with a smaller number being diagnosed with partial DI. The copeptin measurements for all but one person were below the suggested cut‐off for diagnosing pDI. The copeptin measurement was therefore helpful in these cases in confirming the final diagnosis. There was one patient (Case 2) in the indeterminate group where the diagnosis of pDI was strongly suspected based on the clinical picture and measured osmolalities (and had resolved with desmopressin therapy), but the copeptin measure was unexpectedly high. In this case, the significance of the unusually high copeptin is not clear. In retrospect close follow‐up of this unusual result might have prevented his subsequent development of dilutional hyponatraemia. A second case with a diagnosis of partial DI based solely on the water deprivation test had a final diagnosis of cDI based on the clinical picture and remained on life‐long desmopressin therapy despite a copeptin measurement significantly above the suggested cut‐off for this condition. Copeptin stimulation tests using hypertonic saline or arginine may have misdiagnosed these cases and emphasizes the importance of interpreting the results in the clinical context.

### Use of copeptin in interpretation of the water deprivation test [^dfa1d416]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

This was a retrospective single centre‐based study involving 47 people who underwent a standardized water deprivation test between 2013 and 2021. All patients had been referred for investigation of polyuria/ polydipsia with the differential diagnosis including diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia. Prior to the test, other causes such as diabetes mellitus, hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency or other electrolyte disturbance had been excluded.

The patients were admitted to the endocrine investigation unit at 08.00 on the morning of the test. The protocol is summarized below: fluid was not restricted before arrival in the unit. Consumption of any liquids during the test was prohibited, and patients were not allowed to leave the ward. Body weight, serum and urine osmolality, electrolytes and copeptin were measured at the start of the test. Serum and urine osmolality and urine volume were recorded every 90 minutes. Copeptin was repeated at the end of 6 h of water restriction, at which point a decision was made, based on the serum and urine osmolality and urine volumes, whether to proceed with desmopressin. Weight was measured every 2 h. If desmopressin was administered, serum and urine osmolality were followed hourly for the next 4 h. The test was concluded if, at any point, body weight fell by >5% or the urine osmolality exceeded 700 mmol/kg (at which point serum and urine osmolality, weight and electrolytes were measured).

2.1	Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring

Diabetes Insipidus

Prior to treatment with DDAVP, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality.

Hemophilia A

Prior to treatment with DDAVP Injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try DDAVP in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored.

von Willebrand's Disease (Type I)

Prior to treatment with DDAVP Injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand's disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen.

During treatment with DDAVP Injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved.

For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia.

Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with DDAVP Injection.

### A water deprivation test for the differential diagnosis of polyuria (...) [^eaf1aff0]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A relatively simple, standardized 6 1/2 hour water deprivation test is described which adequately differentiates disorders of the neurohypophyseal-hypothalamic system from primary polydipsia. Normal subjects are characterized by an initial serum osmolality between 273 and 293 milliosmoles per kilogram by remarkable constancy of the serum osmolality throughout the 6 1/2 hours and by a urine-to-serum osmolality ratio of 1. 9 or greater. Individuals with diabetes insipidus show loss of this homeostatic mechanism to a variable degree. All patients with diabetes insipidus demonstrate defective urinary concentrating capacity. Those patients with diabetes insipidus severe enough to require vasopressin therapy invariably show serum osmolar concentrations of 300 mOsm/kg or greater by the end of the test.

Individuals with primary polydipsia demonstrate stability of serum osmolality at normal or slightly below normal levels, while urinary osmolality at the end of the test period is within normal limits.

### Redefining diagnostic cut-offs for the indirect water deprivation test [^ac3fc2b1]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4 Updated Cut‐Off Values

Increasing the serum osmolality cut‐off to > 307.5 mOsm/kg demonstrates 100% specificity with 28.57% sensitivity (Table 1). This reduces the number of false positives from 23 (with the osmolality cut‐off) to zero and increases the number of true negative individuals (healthy patients being correctly identified) by 41.8% (55 individuals using a cut‐off of > 300 mOsm/kg compared to 78 using a cut‐off value of > 307.5 mOsm/kg).

Table 1 
Sensitivity and specificity cut‐offs for serum osmolality, sodium, and urine osmolality.

The cut‐offs for peak serum sodium are < 137.0 mmol/L (100% sensitivity) and > 147.5 mmol/L (100% specificity). The cut‐offs for peak urine osmolality are > 630.0 mOsm/kg (100% sensitivity) and < 383.0 mOsm/kg (100% specificity).

The ROC analysis of the percent‐change in urine osmolality following desmopressin also reveals distinct cut‐offs. In both patient groups (positive and negative patients), a reduction of 2% or more in urine osmolality demonstrates 100% sensitivity in differentiating AVP‐D and AVP‐R from PP; whilst an increase of greater than 53.4% demonstrates 100% specificity when considering AVP‐D and AVP‐R as the positives (Table 2).

Of the 120 patients, six (5%) did not meet both the serum sodium cut‐off value of ≥ 148 mmol/L and < 137 mmol/L, and a urine osmolality cut‐off value > 630 mOsm/kg and < 383 mOsm/kg. All equivocal cases underwent repeat testing, which was conclusive in four of the six cases. The remaining two patients were clinically reviewed based on their symptomatic benefit with desmopressin to make a diagnosis. Across these six patients, four patients were identified as having PP, and two patients were identified as having partial AVP‐D.

### Copeptin in the differential diagnosis of the polydipsia-polyuria syndrome – revisiting the direct and indirect water deprivation tests [^f1fffe9c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The water deprivation test (WDT) with direct or indirect measurement of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) is the method of choice for the differential diagnosis of the polydipsia-polyuria syndrome. In theory, direct measurement of AVP is highly attractive but is hampered by technical difficulties.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of copeptin, a surrogate of AVP secretion, in the diagnostic work-up of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome and to compare its performance with the current diagnostic standard.

Setting and Design

In two tertiary referral centers, 20 healthy subjects and 50 patients with polydipsia-polyuria syndrome underwent WDT with measurements of both plasma AVP and copeptin levels. The reference diagnosis was based on clinical information and treatment response.

Results

Twenty-two patients (44%) were diagnosed with primary polydipsia, 17 (34%) with partial central diabetes insipidus (DI), nine (18%) with complete central DI, and two (4%) with nephrogenic DI. The indirect WDT led to a correct diagnosis in 35 of 50 patients (70%). The direct WDT with AVP or copeptin measurement correctly diagnosed 23 patients (46%) or 36 patients (72%), respectively. Baseline copeptin values greater than 20 pmol/liter identified patients with nephrogenic DI, and concentrations below 2.6 pmol/liter indicated complete central DI. The ratio between Δ copeptin (0800 to 1600 h) and serum sodium concentration at 1600 h yielded optimal diagnostic accuracy, allowing us to also discern partial central DI from primary polydipsia (sensitivity 86%, and specificity 100%).

Conclusion

Copeptin holds promise as a diagnostic tool in the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome, improving significantly the diagnostic accuracy of the direct WDT.

### Child with suspected diabetes insipidus [^fd30940d]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected diabetes insipidus—desmopressin (DDAVP) is often used for control of significant polyuria/polydipsia; it is a synthetic long acting analog of vasopressin and is available in oral tablets and melts, intranasal and subcutaneous form. There is a risk of sodium fluctuations and hyponatremia with DDAVP treatment; care should be taken during treatment as inadvertent large doses may lead to severe hyponatremia and seizures, and ensuring “breakthrough” voiding close to the next dose can be helpful to limit risk of hyponatremia. In some older children with diabetes insipidus and intact thirst mechanism, increasing fluid intake to match urine output and avoid hypernatremia can be sufficient treatment; children with intact thirst mechanism can usually self-regulate to increase their water intake to avoid dehydration, and avoiding pharmacological therapy can prevent sodium fluctuations and risk for hyponatremia.

Abbreviations: AVP-D, arginine vasopressin deficiency; AVP-R, arginine vasopressin resistance; PP, primary polydipsia. 1 AVP measurement validated in some countries; 2 Water deprivation test an alternative; 3 Actual cutoff depends on reference range of serum Na+; 4 Nonosmotic stimulation—for example—acutely unwell/syncope may cause an elevated level. Interpretation of water deprivation test: If copeptin is not available, the indirect water deprivation test can be performed as described by Miller et al. Usually, the concentration of urine over a 16-hour period of fluid restriction is assessed, followed by interpretation of the ability to concentrate urine in response to the synthetic V2 receptor-specific AVP analogue, desmopressin at the end of the test. In patients where the urinary osmolality stays below 300 mOsm/kg during fluid deprivation but increases over 50% upon desmopressin administration, the diagnosis of complete AVP-D can be made. Patients with a persistent low urinary osmolality and no response to desmopressin are diagnosed with AVP-R. Urinary concentration in patients with partial AVP and primary polydipsia is expected to increase to levels above 300 mOsm/kg, whilst remaining below 800 mOsm/kg, with further increases in osmolality seen upon desmopressin injection of more than 9% in partial AVP patients and less than 9% in primary polydipsic patients.

### Diagnostic accuracy of copeptin in the differential diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome: a prospective multicenter study [^5fa70f9f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

The polyuria-polydipsia syndrome comprises primary polydipsia (PP) and central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI). Correctly discriminating these entities is mandatory, given that inadequate treatment causes serious complications. The diagnostic "gold standard" is the water deprivation test with assessment of arginine vasopressin (AVP) activity. However, test interpretation and AVP measurement are challenging.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the accuracy of copeptin, a stable peptide stoichiometrically cosecreted with AVP, in the differential diagnosis of polyuria-polydipsia syndrome.

Design, Setting, and Patients

This was a prospective multicenter observational cohort study from four Swiss or German tertiary referral centers of adults >18 years old with the history of polyuria and polydipsia.

Measurements

A standardized combined water deprivation/3% saline infusion test was performed and terminated when serum sodium exceeded 147 mmol/L. Circulating copeptin and AVP levels were measured regularly throughout the test. Final diagnosis was based on the water deprivation/saline infusion test results, clinical information, and the treatment response.

Results

Fifty-five patients were enrolled (11 with complete central DI, 16 with partial central DI, 18 with PP, and 10 with nephrogenic DI). Without prior thirsting, a single baseline copeptin level >21.4 pmol/L differentiated nephrogenic DI from other etiologies with a 100% sensitivity and specificity, rendering a water deprivation testing unnecessary in such cases. A stimulated copeptin >4.9 pmol/L (at sodium levels >147 mmol/L) differentiated between patients with PP and patients with partial central DI with a 94.0% specificity and a 94.4% sensitivity. A stimulated AVP >1.8 pg/mL differentiated between the same categories with a 93.0% specificity and a 83.0% sensitivity.

Limitation

This study was limited by incorporation bias from including AVP levels as a diagnostic criterion.

Conclusion

Copeptin is a promising new tool in the differential diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome, and a valid surrogate marker for AVP. Primary Funding Sources: Swiss National Science Foundation, University of Basel.

Water deprivation test of case patient

At the 3-month follow-up visit, the patient was happy with the desmopressin treatment, under which his thirst sensation had decreased and he had normalized his fluid intake. Repeated plasma sodium levels were between 140 and 142 mmol/L.

Six months after starting desmopressin treatment, the patient presented as an emergency with severely reduced wellbeing with constant headache, vertigo, tiredness, and nausea. Due to a renewed increase in thirst with subsequent increased fluid intake of up to 7 L per day, he had doubled his desmopressin dose. Laboratory analyses showed hypotonic hyponatremia with plasma sodium of 126 mmol/L and plasma osmolality of 256 mosm/kg. After stopping desmopressin, the symptoms ameliorated quickly and sodium levels normalized. Two weeks later, however, the patient wanted to resume desmopressin treatment because he experienced a severe feeling of thirst with accompanying polyuria and polydipsia. What is the patient’s diagnosis now? Should desmopressin be resumed? Are there additional tests to address these questions? The following mini-review will address these and other questions. The patient’s subsequent course will be described at the end.

### SGLT2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^81e48591]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

CDI is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impaired vasopressin physiology often accompanied by hypernatremia and hyperosmolality if fluid losses are not adequately replaced. Discriminating CDI from primary polydipsia can be challenging. A water deprivation test remains a valuable tool for differential diagnosis. In this case, polyuria was not initially associated with hypotonic urine (maximum specific urine gravity: 1.018) while the patient was on dapagliflozin. However, two days after discontinuing dapagliflozin, hypotonic polyuria became evident, and a water deprivation test confirmed CDI, showing an increase in urine specific gravity from 1.005 to 1.010 and urine osmolality from 19 to 86 mOsm/kg.

Several intriguing features were observed in this patient. During her second admission, she presented with hypernatremia without thirst, but by her third admission, she developed significant polydipsia (up to 10 L/day). This transient adipsia may have resulted from temporary damage to thirst-regulating neurons and osmoreceptors due to hypovolemia, which resolved over time. Additionally, the osmotic diuresis caused by poorly controlled diabetes and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors likely exacerbated her polydipsia and polyuria. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, contributing to osmotic diuresis. A similar case was reported in a patient with adipsic CDI following traumatic brain injury, where empagliflozin obscured low urine osmolality (a relatively high urine osmolality: 529mOsm/kg) and partially attenuated the antidiuretic effect of desmopressin. Five days after discontinuing empagliflozin, a second desmopressin test exhibited a significant reduction in urine volume. Refardt et al. also demonstrated that empagliflozin increased urinary excretion (total urinary excretion of 579 ml ± 194.8 ml in empagliflozin treatment for 8 h versus 367 ml ± 158.8 ml in the placebo group, p = 0.017.) in healthy volunteers with artificially induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion by administration of desmopressin. These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors can influence urine osmolality and may slightly reduce the efficacy of desmopressin. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued when evaluating urine osmolality to differentiate polyuria.
