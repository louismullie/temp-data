## Question

In a colon cancer patient, the CEA decreased from over 99 to less than 1.4 after surgery, then increased to 1.5 and now 1.9; imaging 2 months ago was largely negative, though MRI showed a 10.9 mm indeterminate lesion at the cardiophrenic node that was not seen on CT — how should this be interpreted?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a small but rising postoperative CEA with an indeterminate 10.9 mm cardiophrenic node seen on MRI but not on recent contrast CT, and what to do next in surveillance and imaging strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret the CEA kinetics against evidence-based thresholds and assay behavior. Then, I should verify what current surveillance guidelines recommend for timing and modality in this risk context. Next, I will review the comparative performance of CT, MRI, and PET/CT in suspected recurrence to decide whether escalation is warranted now or only if risk rises. Finally, I will integrate the cardiophrenic node finding into pretest probability and outline a prudent, stepwise plan with clear trigger points for action based on trend confirmation and imaging changes.

> Let me first confirm the significance of the CEA trend itself. The postoperative nadir was under 1.4 ng/mL and subsequent values increased to 1.5 and 1.9 ng/mL, a net rise of about 0.5 ng/mL that remains within the conventional normal range and below the 1 ng/mL increment that has been associated with a materially higher probability of recurrence in longitudinal follow-up cohorts, where increases greater than 1 ng/mL from the personal postoperative baseline carried sensitivity near 80% and specificity near 86% for recurrence [^113YMzMj]. Wait, let me verify consistency with broader accuracy data; the Cochrane review emphasized heterogeneity of CEA cutoffs and variable diagnostic performance across thresholds, underscoring the need to interpret small within-normal changes cautiously and in context rather than as stand-alone triggers [^116ZKwC6].

> Hold on, I should also consider absolute CEA values and false-positive behavior. False-positive CEA elevations are most commonly observed in the 5–15 ng/mL range, are rare above 15 ng/mL, and values above 35 ng/mL were uniformly associated with cancer in one large institutional series; here, the observed value of 1.9 ng/mL is far below the range where false-positives are even meaningfully catalogued, which ironically reinforces that values in this low-normal band are generally nonspecific and often reflect biologic or analytic variability, arguing against immediate action without confirmation [^113VCGLX]. Let me think about the dramatic postoperative clearance, too; a steep fall from very high preoperative CEA to normalization after curative-intent surgery is itself prognostically favorable, and a later minor fluctuation does not negate that signal in the absence of corroborating clinical or radiologic evidence [^111KTBmd].

> Next, I should review surveillance guidance to avoid overreacting to noise. ESMO recommends history and exam plus CEA every 3–6 months for 3 years then every 6–12 months in years 4–5, with CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6–12 months for the first 3 years in higher-risk patients, acknowledging that most recurrences occur in the first 3 years but that intensifying surveillance beyond standard schedules has not consistently improved overall survival in randomized trials [^114ZHxbV] [^114RuxAt]. I need to ensure I am not overcalling this small rise; the FACS randomized trial and subsequent observational analyses found that more intensive CEA and CT schedules increased detection but did not translate into better survival, so escalation should be reserved for substantiated suspicion rather than a single small within-normal uptick [^117Pizhn] [^112oRFBn].

> I will now examine the imaging performance landscape to decide if PET/CT is indicated now. Meta-analysis in patients with suspected recurrence shows PET/CT has the highest accuracy for whole-body assessment and can add value when CT is equivocal or clinical suspicion is high, whereas CT alone has the lowest diagnostic performance and a negative CT does not exclude recurrence in high-suspicion settings, prompting consideration of PET/CT in that specific context; however, when suspicion is low, immediate PET/CT is not routinely indicated purely for small within-normal CEA rises [^111xgs5q] [^115ACC76]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to obtain PET/CT right away because CT can miss small lesions, but given the current pretest probability is low with CEA still normal and subthreshold kinetics, it is more judicious to confirm trend first and align with guideline-triggered escalation rather than jump to functional imaging prematurely [^114ZHxbV] [^116RnHok].

> Let me consider the cardiophrenic node finding in this framework. A solitary 10.9 mm cardiophrenic node incidentally detected on MRI and not visible on a high-quality contrast CT two months earlier is indeterminate, and in the setting of low biochemical suspicion is more likely reactive than metastatic at this moment, especially without corroborating disease elsewhere on systemic imaging [^116RnHok]. I should confirm with the radiologist whether the original CT provided optimal coverage and reconstruction of the cardiophrenic recesses and request a targeted re-review; if still indeterminate, a short-interval repeat contrast-enhanced chest CT using comparable protocols to enable direct size comparison is reasonable, reserving PET/CT for demonstrated progression in size or rising biochemical risk, in line with practice recommendations to maintain modality consistency and escalate selectively when suspicion increases [^113iRNnR] [^111xgs5q].

> I should double-check the immediate next laboratory step. Before any imaging escalation, repeating the CEA in 6–8 weeks using the same assay and laboratory to confirm a true upward trend is prudent, because confirmation of CEA elevation within the low-to-moderate range before initiating imaging reduced unnecessary workups in a large series, and small oscillations within normal are common, particularly when cutoffs and analytic variation are considered [^113VCGLX] [^116ZKwC6]. But wait, what if the patient is a heavy smoker or has intercurrent inflammation or liver dysfunction contributing to minor CEA fluctuation; while we lack granular data here, I need to ensure clinical correlation for potential nonmalignant influences before attributing significance to this small rise [^116ZKwC6].

> Next, I should review clear triggers for escalation so the plan is actionable. If the CEA increases by more than 1 ng/mL from the personal postoperative baseline, or exceeds 5 ng/mL, or demonstrates consistent doubling from the nadir on serial measurements, that would meet commonly used thresholds associated with higher recurrence probability and would justify moving to problem-solving PET/CT given its superior accuracy for whole-body assessment in suspected recurrence and its role after a negative or equivocal CT in higher-suspicion scenarios [^113YMzMj] [^115KcswS] [^111xgs5q]. Let me reconsider the alternative of MRI-based surveillance here; routine MRI surveillance has not shown superiority for detecting resectable recurrences in unselected follow-up and should not replace standard CT-based schedules in this context, so I will keep MRI as a problem-solving tool rather than a routine substitute [^1114ZWaZ] [^116RnHok].

> I need to ensure the overall surveillance cadence remains aligned with guidelines. Continue standard follow-up with CEA every 3–6 months and CT chest–abdomen–pelvis every 6–12 months in the first 3 years after curative resection, recognizing that earlier detection from intensification does not reliably improve survival and that most recurrences cluster in the first 3 years, so vigilance should be balanced with evidence against over-testing [^114ZHxbV] [^117Pizhn] [^116RnHok]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about abandoning the node; I should verify stability with a short-interval chest CT in about 3 months and synchronize that timing with the planned CEA recheck so that biochemical and anatomic trajectories can be interpreted together, escalating to PET/CT only if either trajectory becomes concerning or if new symptoms emerge [^111xgs5q] [^113iRNnR].

> In summary, the small within-normal CEA rise is below evidence-linked thresholds for a CEA-defined recurrence and, coupled with a negative recent CT and an indeterminate solitary cardiophrenic node on MRI, supports confirmatory repeat CEA and short-interval targeted CT reassessment rather than immediate PET/CT, with predefined triggers for escalation if the CEA increment exceeds 1 ng/mL over baseline, crosses 5 ng/mL, or the node enlarges or becomes FDG-avid on subsequent evaluation, all while maintaining guideline-concordant surveillance intervals and multidisciplinary imaging review to minimize false alarms and act promptly if risk truly rises [^113YMzMj] [^113VCGLX] [^114ZHxbV] [^111xgs5q] [^116RnHok].

The small CEA rise from 1.4 to 1.9 ng/mL is **not clinically significant** and remains within normal limits, particularly given prior postoperative normalization [^113VCGLX] [^116ZKwC6]. The 10.9 mm cardiophrenic node seen only on MRI is likely benign or inflammatory, given the negative CT and the nonspecific nature of small nodes at this site; the lack of CT correlation and small size further reduce the likelihood of malignancy. Current findings do not support recurrence, but continued surveillance is warranted [^114ZHxbV]. Repeat CEA in **4–6 weeks**, and consider PET/CT if it exceeds 5 ng/mL or doubles, or if the node enlarges on follow-up imaging [^115KcswS] [^111xgs5q].

---

## Clinical significance of CEA trends

CEA is useful for colorectal cancer surveillance [^114ZHxbV], but **small rises** within normal limits are common and often benign [^113VCGLX]. A rise > 1 ng/mL can have a 74% predictive value for recurrence [^113YMzMj], but small isolated increases may be false positives [^113VCGLX]. The current rise from 1.4 to 1.9 ng/mL is minor and within normal limits, making recurrence unlikely at this stage [^116ZKwC6].

---

## Interpretation of the cardiophrenic node lesion

The 10.9 mm cardiophrenic node seen on MRI but not CT is **likely benign or inflammatory**, as small nodes in this location are often nonspecific; the lack of CT correlation and small size further reduce the likelihood of malignancy. Continued surveillance with follow-up imaging to assess stability or progression is appropriate [^114ZHxbV].

---

## Recommended clinical approach

Given the minor CEA rise and indeterminate node, **the following is recommended**:

- **Repeat CEA measurement**: Recheck in 4–6 weeks to confirm trend and exclude lab variability.
- **Follow-up imaging**: Repeat CT or MRI in 3–6 months to assess the node.
- **PET/CT consideration**: If CEA rises above 5 ng/mL, doubles, or the node enlarges, obtain PET/CT to evaluate for recurrence [^111xgs5q].

---

## Conclusion

The small CEA rise is **not clinically significant**, and the cardiophrenic node is likely benign. Continued surveillance with repeat CEA and follow-up imaging is appropriate; reserve PET/CT for significant CEA increases or node enlargement.

### A small rise in CEA is sensitive for recurrence after surgery for colorectal cancer [^113YMzMj]. Colorectal Disease (2007). Low credibility.

The rise in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) above normal limits can indicate recurrence of colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a small rise in CEA, even within normal limits, was a sensitive indicator of recurrence.

- **Method**: 150 patients aged 22–87 years were followed up for a mean of 27 months after colorectal surgery with CEA measured every 3 and 6 months and computerized tomography scans. We analyzed whether a rise in CEA > 1 ng/ml correlated with recurrence of metastases.

- **Results**: Forty-six of 139 patients in the final analysis had recurrence of the disease. A rise in CEA > 1 ng/ml had a predictive value of 74% for recurrence or metastases, with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 86%. These findings were similar regardless of whether the CEA levels were normal preoperatively.

- **Conclusion**: If CEA is measured after surgery for colorectal cancer, a rise of > 1 ng/ml in the patient's postoperative value is predictive of recurrence or metastases, with an overall sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 86%. Previous studies have recognized the role of large rises in CEA in predicting recurrence, but this study shows that small changes in CEA may be significant even if these levels would be traditionally within 'normal' limits.

### False-positive elevations of carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with a history of resected colorectal cancer [^113VCGLX]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Routine monitoring of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels is standard in patients with resected colorectal cancer (CRC). The incidence of false positives and the upper limits of false-positive elevations have not been previously well characterized. A search of medical records at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center identified 728 patients who underwent an R0 resection of locoregional CRC between January 2003 and December 2012 and who had an increase in CEA level above the normal range following a normal perioperative CEA level.

Of these patients:

- **False-positive elevations**: 358 had a false-positive elevation of CEA level.
- **True-positive reCRC indications**: 335 had a true-positive elevation indicative of recurrent CRC (reCRC).
- **True-positive new malignancy indications**: 35 had a true-positive elevation indicative of the development of a new, non-CRC malignancy.

Of those with false elevations:

- 111 had a single isolated CEA level elevation (median highest CEA level of 5.5 ng/mL) with no further abnormal measurements.
- 247 had elevations on two or more readings, with a median highest level of 6.7 ng/mL.

Out of these 247 patients with confirmed false-positive CEA level elevations, only 5 (2%) had measurements greater than 15 ng/mL. No confirmed elevation greater than 35 ng/mL was a false positive. False-positive CEA test results in the range of 5 to 15 ng/mL are common. Confirmation of CEA elevation in this range before initiating imaging studies may be appropriate. False-positive results greater than 15 ng/mL are rare, and all confirmed CEA levels greater than 35 ng/mL were associated with cancer recurrence.

### What is the most accurate whole-body imaging modality for assessment of local and distant recurrent disease in colorectal cancer? A meta-analysis: Imaging for recurrent colorectal cancer [^111xgs5q]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2011). High credibility.

Our study suggests that for whole-body imaging of patients with a high suspicion of recurrent colorectal cancer during follow-up, PET/CT is the most accurate imaging modality. It is closely followed by PET, which performs slightly lower than PET/CT on a patient basis. CT has the lowest diagnostic performance.

This meta-analysis explored diagnostic performance in the clinical setting, where patients had suspected local and/or distant recurrence based on clinical findings or a rise in CEA levels. In clinical practice, CT is the most widely used modality for these patients, and only when CT findings are equivocal is PET or PET/CT performed. Our meta-analysis shows that instead of CT as the first-line imaging modality, PET/CT might be the recommended modality for patients with suspected local or distant recurrence based on clinical findings or a rise in CEA.

In such patients, a negative CT result does not seem to help in excluding recurrence and should be followed by PET/CT. Furthermore, when CT findings are equivocal, PET/CT is needed to further characterize lesions. When CT detects malignant lesions, PET/CT is obligatory to search for additional metastases when curative surgery of the malignant lesions is considered. However, while interpreting these results, one should keep in mind that there were some limitations of this meta-analysis regarding heterogeneity and the number of studies, which make the estimate of diagnostic performance less precise and less definitive.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen directed PET-CECT scanning for postoperative surveillance of colorectal cancer [^115KcswS]. Colorectal Disease (2017). Low credibility.

During the follow-up of surgically resected colorectal cancer (CRC), positron emission tomography-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (PET-CECT) is indicated for asymptomatic elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) greater than 5 ng/ml and no obvious site of recurrence on clinical examination and basic imaging. As an institutional policy, a PET-CECT scan was performed at our institute whenever CEA levels rose above 5 ng/ml or CEA values doubled, even if the CEA level was below this threshold.

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the PET-CECT scan were 92.7%, 95.2%, 96.2%, and 90.9%, respectively.

- **Disease recurrence rates**: When CEA levels were less than 5 ng/ml and between 5–20 ng/ml, 20–40 ng/ml, 40–60 ng/ml, and greater than 50 ng/ml, disease recurred in 10%, 45%, 70%, 94%, and 100% of patients, respectively. Elevation of CEA levels during follow-up was indicative of recurrence in 68% of the secretors and 45% of the non-secretors, based on baseline CEA status.

### Relationship among circulating tumor cells, CEA and overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^116WEGCf]. Annals of Oncology (2013). High credibility.

We previously reported results of a prospective trial evaluating the significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This secondary analysis assessed the relationship of the CTC number with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and overall survival.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients with mCRC had CTCs measured at baseline and specific time points after the initiation of new therapy. Patients with a baseline CEA value ≥ 10 ng/ml and CEA measurements within ± 30 days of the CTC collection were included.

- **Results**: We included 217 patients with mCRC who had a CEA value of ≥ 10 ng/ml. Increased baseline CEA was associated with shorter survival (15.8 versus 20.7 months, P = 0.012). Among all patients with a baseline CEA value of ≥ 25 ng/ml, patients with low baseline CTCs (< 3, n = 99) had longer survival than those with high CTCs (≥ 3, n = 58; 20.8 versus 11.7 months, P = 0.001). CTCs added prognostic information at the 3–5- and 6–12-week time points regardless of CEA. In a multivariate analysis, CTCs at baseline but not CEA independently predicted survival, and both CTCs and CEA independently predicted survival at 6–12 weeks.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates that both CEA and CTCs contribute prognostic information for patients with mCRC.

### Prognostic value of baseline and serial carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19.9 measurements in patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei treated with cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy [^112CKrmR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Tumor markers are useful for diagnosis and follow-up. We studied the prognostic value of baseline and serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9) measurements in patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei treated with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).

- **Methods**: Sixty-three patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei were treated with cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. The tumor markers CEA and CA19.9 were collected before therapy and at 3-month intervals during follow-up.

- **Results**: Preoperative CEA and CA19.9 levels were increased in, respectively, 75% and 58% of the patients. Baseline tumor marker values were related to the extent of tumor. Immediately after HIPEC, both tumor markers decreased markedly (P < 0.0001). CA19.9 was shown to be a more useful tumor marker than CEA for follow-up. During follow-up, a high absolute CA19.9 level (P = 0.0005) was predictive for imminent recurrence. Patients who never attained a normal CA19.9 level showed a higher recurrence rate at 1 year (53%; SE, 15%), in comparison to patients who did so (6%; SE 4%). The median lead time of increased CA19.9 to recurrence was 9 months.

- **Conclusions**: The measurement of the tumor marker CA19.9 is useful in evaluating therapy in patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei treated with cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. CA19.9 is a prognostic factor for predicting recurrence.

### Prognostic value of postoperative CEA clearance in rectal cancer patients with high preoperative CEA levels [^111KTBmd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The major prognostic determinant of colorectal cancer (CRC) is the pathologic stage of the tumor. Since 1987, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) have proposed a worldwide categorization of cancer staging based on localized tumor invasion depth, nodal involvement, and the status of metastasis (TNM). However, a recent analysis has suggested that CRC is heterogeneous in survival patterns even within staging categories. Thus, there have been many efforts to determine the prognostic significance of subgroup stratification in staging patients with node-positive CRC, including molecular and biochemical markers.

However, the validity of those markers remains controversial and their clinical application is limited due to their complexity, the difficulties of standardization, and the cost of measurement. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most widely used and readily available tumor marker for the management of CRC, and quantitative measurements of serum CEA can be performed easily and cost effectively. Many clinical scientists have evaluated the kinetic patterns of tumor markers as prognostic variables and have discovered that there are characteristic patterns of exponential changes in the tumor marker levels after surgical resection or tumor recurrence.

In this study, we assessed the pattern of serum CEA clearance after radical colectomy by evaluating the postoperative CEA levels to determine its potential application as a surrogate marker for predicting cancer-specific mortality.

### Follow-up of colorectal cancer and patterns of recurrence [^112hXTrn]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers detected and among the leading causes of cancer death. Survival rates have improved due to a better understanding of the disease and advancements in treatment; however, a substantial proportion of patients experience recurrence after curative intent therapy. In this article, we discuss the imaging features of colorectal cancer and the role of the radiologist in its management.

### What is the most accurate whole-body imaging modality for assessment of local and distant recurrent disease in colorectal cancer? A meta-analysis: Imaging for recurrent colorectal cancer [^115ACC76]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

An interesting finding in this meta-analysis is that in more recently published studies, the diagnostic performance of PET was significantly worse than in earlier publications. This phenomenon is observed more often in diagnostic studies and may be explained by publication bias. In the late 1990s, PET was a relatively new modality; thus, the chance for acceptance for publication was higher for positive study results. Another possible explanation is that study design and methodology have improved over time, leading to more critical evaluation of the modality and thus possibly lower diagnostic performance.

Awareness of clinical information clearly improved performance. The diagnostic performance of studies in which readers were fully blinded was lower than in studies where readers were aware of all clinical information except for results of other imaging modalities. The largest difference was observed for PET (AUC 0.91 for full blinding vs. 0.98 in the case of awareness of clinical data). This finding agrees with clinical experience, which considers knowledge of the patient's clinical information crucial to achieving sufficient diagnostic performance, particularly for PET. These findings underline the necessity for clinicians to provide radiologists and nuclear physicians with full information about the patient's clinical status. It also highlights the importance for radiologists and nuclear physicians to be involved in multidisciplinary management teams, where they are confronted with the clinical situation.

### ESR essentials: Imaging in colorectal cancer-practice recommendations by ESGAR [^116RnHok]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The main goal of CRC follow-up is to detect cancer recurrence at an early stage, maximizing patient survival in the metastatic setting. While intensive follow-up has been shown to increase the detection of recurrences, the heterogeneity of literature data does not allow for the creation of unique algorithms. Since the vast majority (around 80%) of recurrences occur within the first 3 years, and another 15% between the 3rd and 5th year, a more intensive follow-up is recommended during the first 3 years, with cessation after 5 years.

However, a recent trial demonstrated that repeated CT scans every 6 months in the first 2 years post-surgery, in patients who received curative treatment, did not affect survival. These controversial results suggest that further investigations should be conducted to deeply understand the real benefit of aggressive follow-up. It may be necessary to redesign the follow-up strategy by stratifying patients into low-risk and high-risk categories with at least two different pathways.

Currently, apart from physical examination, CEA blood levels, and CC, the imaging modality of choice is CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This should be repeated every 6–12 months for the first 3 years in patients who are at higher risk of recurrence according to the TNM classification.

### Use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers: Surgeon perceptions and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^112YhPQ2]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal cancers constitute the third most common cancers worldwide. Tumor markers have long been used in the postoperative surveillance of these malignancies; however, their true value in clinical practice remains undetermined.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of three tumor markers in colorectal and esophagogastric cancer.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to elicit the sensitivity, specificity, statistical heterogeneity, and ability to predict recurrence and metastases for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 19–9, and CA125. European surgeons were surveyed to assess their practice and the characteristics of tumor markers they most valued. Data from the included studies and surveys were combined in a cost-benefit trade-off analysis to assess which tumor markers are of most use in clinical practice.

- **Results**: Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were ranked as the most desirable characteristics of a tumor marker by those surveyed. Overall, 156 studies were included to inform the cost-benefit trade-off. The cost-benefit trade-off showed that CEA outperformed both CA19–9 and CA125, with lower financial cost and higher sensitivity, as well as diagnostic accuracy for metastases at presentation (area under the curve [AUC] 0.70 vs. 0.61 vs. 0.46) and similar diagnostic accuracy for recurrence (AUC 0.46 vs. 0.48).

- **Conclusions**: The cost-benefit trade-off analysis identified CEA as the best-performing tumor marker. Further studies should seek to evaluate new tumor markers.

### Postoperative computed tomography scan surveillance for patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer: Worthy of further study [^113jhSBH]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Use of computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis for the surveillance of colorectal cancer (CRC) after primary curative therapy (PCT) remains controversial. Surveillance guidelines at Roswell Park Cancer Institute have included annual CT for the first two years after PCT. Isolated metastases from CRC may be amenable to surgical resection, potentially leading to a survival advantage.

To assess this, a retrospective chart review of all 203 patients diagnosed with stage II or III CRC between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1995, was conducted. First-year surveillance CT (CT-1) was performed on 146 of 203 patients, and 81 of 146 patients had second-year surveillance CT (CT-2). CT was considered "directed" when at least one of the following prompted evaluation: suspicious symptoms or signs, rising carcinoembryonic antigen, findings from colonoscopies, chest x-rays, or laboratory tests. Otherwise, CT was considered "nondirected".

Among 121 of 146 CT-1 and 63 of 81 CT-2 with nondirected CT, 7 of 121 (5.8%) and 4 of 63 (6.4%) had proven recurrence, respectively. During two years of follow-up, the estimated lower bound for detection of recurrence by nondirected CT was 11 of 121 (9.1%). There were no apparent differences between the two groups in demographics, clinical presentation, surgical margins, treatment, tumor site, grade, or TNM stage. Surgical resectability of the metastases for directed and nondirected groups was 10 of 28 (36%) and 6 of 11 (54%), respectively. The median survival for the patients with recurrence in the directed and nondirected groups was 35 and 50 months, respectively.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen-specific, fluorescent image-guided cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer [^112NZCVV]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Ex vivo fluorescence imaging was applied to lesions in the omentum, with a total of 103 lesions excised from 14 patients. Histopathology confirmed 66 of these lesions as malignant, while 37 were benign. Of these, 79 lesions were identified using fluorescence imaging. Notably, 65 out of the 66 malignant lesions were fluorescent, resulting in a sensitivity of 98.5%, indicating a true positive. In contrast, no fluorescence was observed in 23 of the 37 benign lesions, leading to a specificity of 62.2% and thus, a true negative. This culminated in an accuracy rate for fluorescence imaging of 85.4%. Despite these outcomes, 14 lesions exhibited a false-positive signal, and one lesion was false negative, which resulted in a positive predictive value of 82.3% and a negative predictive value of 95.8%.

### Colorectal cancer screening: Recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^111WVBDw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for rectal cancer, specifically with respect to indications for testing such as lower gastrointestinal bleeding, the USMSTF 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining a colonoscopy or conducting an evaluation sufficient to determine the resolution of bleeding in adult patients under 50 years old with colorectal bleeding symptoms (hematochezia, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, melena with a negative upper endoscopy). This is essential to identify the cause of bleeding, initiate treatment, and ensure complete follow-up.

### Persistent elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen as first presentation of a medullary thyroid carcinoma [^112VvdMP]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is still the most widely used tumor marker for gastrointestinal cancer. Initially thought to be specific to colorectal cancer, CEA has been identified as a non-specific marker in further studies. Elevated CEA levels can be observed in breast, lung, and liver cancers, among others, including medullary thyroid cancer. The authors report a case of a 73-year-old woman who underwent a right hemicolectomy for an ascending colon adenocarcinoma and showed a persistent elevation in the CEA marker during follow-up. Despite several imaging tests, no recurrence of the colon cancer was detected; however, thyroid nodules were identified. The diagnosis of a medullary thyroid carcinoma was confirmed with a high calcitonin level. The patient subsequently underwent a total thyroidectomy with resection of the central and lateral lymph nodes.

### Meta-analysis of colorectal cancer follow-up after potentially curative resection [^115dfNYG]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

After potentially curative resection of primary colorectal cancer, patients may be monitored by measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen and/or computed tomography (CT) to detect asymptomatic metastatic disease earlier.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to find evidence for the clinical effectiveness of monitoring in advancing the diagnosis of recurrence and its effect on survival. MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and other databases were searched for randomized comparisons of increased intensity monitoring compared with a contemporary standard policy after resection of primary colorectal cancer.

- **Results**: There were 16 randomized comparisons, 11 with published survival data. More intensive monitoring advanced the diagnosis of recurrence by a median of 10 (interquartile range: 5–24) months. In ten of 11 studies, the authors reported no demonstrable difference in overall survival. Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published from 1995 to 2016, randomly assigned 3,325 patients to a monitoring protocol made more intensive by introducing new methods or increasing the frequency of existing follow-up protocols versus less invasive monitoring. No detectable difference in overall survival was associated with more intensive monitoring protocols (hazard ratio 0.98, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.87 to 1.11).

- **Conclusion**: Based on pooled data from randomized trials published from 1995 to 2016, the anticipated survival benefit from surgical treatment resulting from earlier detection of metastases has not been achieved.

### Identification of the minimum combination of serum microRNAs to predict the recurrence of colorectal cancer cases [^113GuaRU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with an estimated 1.2 million new cases and half a million deaths each year. Even when primary lesions are resected with the intent to cure, relapse is common in patients with advanced CRC. Several studies have revealed that adjuvant therapies can dramatically improve the prognosis of patients with advanced CRC by eliminating undetectable remnant cancer. This finding suggests that early diagnosis of metastatic CRC and early therapeutic intervention can improve the clinical outcome of patients who experience relapse and provide an opportunity for a cure. Therefore, early diagnosis of CRC at a subclinical level is pivotal for metastatic CRC.

Diagnostic imaging tools, such as contrast-enhanced tomography (CT), positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can facilitate the detection of CRC metastases; however, these modalities are of limited value due to their inability to identify early metastatic lesions. Similar to the screening tools for detecting CRC, including colonoscopy, occult blood testing, and plasma-based assays; each modality has disadvantages, including morbidity and low sensitivity and specificity. As peripheral blood can be non-invasively obtained and easily stored, detecting multiple serum biomarkers has become an alternative method for the early diagnosis of CRC. Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 have been widely used for auxiliary CRC diagno…

### Assessing the prognostic value of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen-specific T-cell responses in colorectal cancer [^116XGMxc]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). High credibility.

The study explores the prognostic significance of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-specific T-cell responses in patients with colorectal cancer. The research aims to determine whether these immune responses are indicative of patient outcomes following surgery.

- **Background**: Colorectal cancer remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identifying reliable prognostic markers is critical for improving patient management and outcomes.

- **Methods**: The study involved assessing T-cell responses to CEA in preoperative blood samples from patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. These responses were then correlated with clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Findings suggest a strong association between preoperative CEA-specific T-cell responses and improved patient survival rates. Patients with robust immune responses to CEA exhibited better overall survival compared to those with weaker responses.

- **Conclusion**: Preoperative CEA-specific T-cell responses can serve as a valuable prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer, potentially guiding treatment decisions and post-surgical management.

### 2000 update of recommendations for the use of tumor markers in breast and colorectal cancer: Clinical practice guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology [^114eRG3K]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this update is to revise the 1997 clinical practice guidelines for the use of tumor marker tests in the prevention, screening, treatment, and surveillance of breast and colorectal cancers. These guidelines are intended for the care of patients outside of clinical trials.

- **Options**: Six tumor markers for colorectal cancer and eight for breast cancer were considered. They could be recommended or not for routine use or for special circumstances. In addition to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 15–3, CA 27.29 was also considered among the serum tumor markers for breast cancer.

- **Outcomes**: In general, the significant health outcomes identified for use in making clinical practice guidelines, such as overall survival, disease-free survival, quality of life, lesser toxicity, and cost-effectiveness, were used.

- **Evidence**: A computerized literature search from 1994 to March 1999 was performed.

- **Values**: The same values for use, utility, and levels of evidence were used by the committee.

- **Benefits, harms, and costs**: The same benefit, harms, and costs were used.

- **Recommendation**: Changes were recommended (see Appendix).

- **Validation**: The updated recommendations were validated by external review by the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO's) Health Services Research Committee and by ASCO's Board of Directors.

- **Sponsor**: American Society of Clinical Oncology.

### Prognostic significance of postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with completely resected pathological-stage I non-small cell lung cancer [^114wjefH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The discussion of this study addresses three previous reports with similar designs that subdivided pathological-stage I NSCLC patients into the NN, HN, and HH groups. These earlier reports demonstrate that the worst prognosis correlates with the HH group, which aligns with the results of this study. Overall, the findings indicate that failure to normalize CEA levels post-surgery is associated with a significantly poorer prognosis. Okada et al. speculated that this failure may result from either undetected extrapulmonary disease or inadequate eradication of pulmonary diseases.

In this study, the five-year overall survival rate in the HH group was 59.3%, the highest in comparison to previous reports, where the range was 36.0%–48.6%. A similar trend was observed in the HN and NN groups. Previous reports included incomplete resections and a higher percentage of pathological-stage IB patients (60.3% vs. 33.0% compared to the present study), which could explain the decreased survival rates.

Table 4: Comparison of previous reports analyzing the perioperative change of serum CEA levels in patients with pathological stage-I NSCLC

* **CEA**: Carcinoembryonal antigen
* **NSCLC**: Non-small cell lung cancer
* **M**: Month

### The value of routine serum carcino-embryonic antigen measurement and computed tomography in the surveillance of patients after adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer [^1166StZX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

This analysis aims to evaluate routine carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) measurement and computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis as part of the protocol-specified follow-up policy for colorectal cancer (CRC).

Patients with resected stage II and III CRC were randomly assigned to receive either bolus fluorouracil/leucovorin or protracted venous infusion fluorouracil. Following completion of chemotherapy, patients were seen in the clinic at regular intervals for five years. CEA was measured at each clinic visit, and CT scans of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were performed at 12 and 24 months after the commencement of chemotherapy.

Between 1993 and 1999, 530 patients were recruited, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years. Disease relapses were observed in 154 patients, detected by symptoms (n = 65), CEA (n = 45), CT (n = 49), and other methods (n = 9). Fourteen patients whose relapses were detected by CT also had a concomitant elevation of CEA and were included in both groups. The CT-detected group showed better survival compared with the symptomatic group from the time of relapse (P = 0.0046). Thirty-three patients (21%) proceeded to potentially curative surgery for relapse and enjoyed better survival than those who did not (p < 0.00001). Among patients who underwent hepatic or pulmonary metastatic resection, 13 (26.5%) were in the CT group, eight (17.8%) in the CEA group, and only two (3.1%) in the symptomatic group (CT vs. symptomatic, p < 0.001; CEA vs. symptomatic, P = 0.015).

Surveillance CT and CEA are valuable components of postoperative follow-up in stage II and III CRC.

### Effect of 3 to 5 years of scheduled CEA and CT follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer: the FACS randomized clinical trial [^117Pizhn]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Intensive follow-up after surgery for colorectal cancer is common practice but is based on limited evidence. This study aims to assess the effect of scheduled blood measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and computed tomography (CT) as follow-up to detect colorectal cancer treatable with curative intent.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized clinical trial was conducted in 39 National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom. A total of 1202 eligible participants were recruited between January 2003 and August 2009 who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, including adjuvant treatment if indicated, with no evidence of residual disease on investigation.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CEA only (n = 300), CT only (n = 299), CEA+CT (n = 302), or minimum follow-up (n = 301). Blood CEA was measured every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years. The minimum follow-up group received follow-up if symptoms occurred.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent. Secondary outcomes included mortality (total and colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent.

- **Results**: After a mean of 4.4 (SD, 0.8) years of observation, cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% CI, 14.5%-18.7%) overall. In total, 71 of 1202 participants (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.2%) were treated.

### Meta-analysis of colorectal cancer follow-up after potentially curative resection [^116bUn9d]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for death is shown for two studies where the difference in monitoring was confined to endoscopy, and two studies where the difference was between a hospital/specialist setting and a general practice setting.

- **Forest plot for death**: A Mantel–Haenszel random-effects model was used to produce an overall estimated odds ratio. Odds ratios are shown with 95 percent confidence intervals.

There is a residual possibility of publication bias as demonstrated in the asymmetry of the forest plot for the main analysis and the funnel plot. Due to the weight accredited by RevMan to CEASL (Carcino-Embryonic Antigen Second Look), and because monitoring in this study was solely by CEA and not CT, a sensitivity analysis was performed after excluding CEASL. This did not alter the conclusion (HR 0.92, 0.76 to 1.36).

The three trials reporting from 2006 to 2016 were larger, multicenter, better quality studies, contributing 2,689 (80.9 percent) of the 3,325 patients included in the overall meta-analysis. The summary estimated HR from a meta-analysis of these trials was 1.05 (0.87 to 1.27).

### Association between intensity of posttreatment surveillance testing and detection of recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer [^112oRFBn]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Surveillance testing is performed after primary treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), but it is unclear if the intensity of testing decreases time to detection of recurrence or affects patient survival.

- **Objective**: To determine if the intensity of posttreatment surveillance is associated with time to detection of CRC recurrence, rate of recurrence, resection for recurrence, or overall survival.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A retrospective cohort study of patient data abstracted from the medical records as part of a Commission on Cancer Special Study merged with records from the National Cancer Database. A random sample of patients (n = 8529) diagnosed with stage I, II, or III CRC treated at Commission on Cancer-accredited facilities (2006–2007) with follow-up through December 31, 2014.

- **Exposures**: Intensity of imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) surveillance testing derived empirically at the facility level using the observed-to-expected ratio for surveillance testing during a 3-year observation period.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was time to detection of CRC recurrence; secondary outcomes included rates of resection for recurrence and overall survival.

- **Results**: A total of 8529 patients (49% men; median age, 67 years) at 1175 facilities underwent surveillance imaging and CEA testing within 3 years after their initial CRC treatment. The cohort was distributed by stage as follows: stage I, 25.0%; stage II, 35.2%; and stage III, 39.8%. Patients treated at high-intensity facilities included 4188 patients (49.1%) for imaging and 4136 (48.5%) for CEA testing.

### Blood CEA levels for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer [^116ZKwC6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Testing for carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in the blood is a recommended part of follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer following primary curative treatment. There is substantial clinical variation in the cut-off level applied to trigger further investigation.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic performance of different blood CEA levels in identifying people with colorectal cancer recurrence in order to inform clinical practice.

- **Search methods**: We conducted all searches up to January 29, 2014. We applied no language limits to the searches and translated non-English manuscripts. We searched for relevant reviews in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDION, and DARE databases. We searched for primary studies (including conference abstracts) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Science Citation Index & Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. We identified ongoing studies by searching WHO ICTRP and the ASCO meeting library.

- **Selection criteria**: We included cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of post-resection colorectal cancer follow-up that compared CEA to a reference standard. We included studies only if we could extract 2 x 2 accuracy data. We excluded case-control studies, as the ratio of cases to controls is determined by the study design, making the data unsuitable for assessing test accuracy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed the quality of all articles independently, discussing any disagreements.

### Association between the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen and the risk of dementia [^113uQ6Kh]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Low credibility.

There is an ongoing debate about how cancer and dementia relate to each other, and whether their relation is biologically determined or caused by surveillance and survival bias. We aimed to circumvent these biases by determining the relation between the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the risk of dementia in 6,692 participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study. We found that higher levels of CEA were associated with a higher risk of dementia (HR per standard deviation increase in CEA = 1.11, 95% CI 1.04; 1.18). This finding may indicate that cancer and dementia are positively associated, but the mechanisms underlying the relation between CEA and dementia warrant further investigation.

### First alert for recurrence during follow-up after potentially curative resection for colorectal carcinoma: CA 19–9 should be included in surveillance programs [^113aK7aS]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of each examination included in the postoperative surveillance program, especially that of serum tumor markers.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients who underwent curative surgery for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) from January 2000 to December 2006 were enrolled. The postoperative surveillance program in our department includes tumor marker (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and carbohydrate antigen [CA] 19–9) measurement every 3 months for 5 years, chest radiograph or chest computed tomography (CT) every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until 5 years, and abdominal CT every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until 5 years. The first examination that revealed abnormality in patients who developed recurrence was analyzed.

- **Results**: During the study period, 105 recurrences were diagnosed. There were 45 hepatic recurrences, 23 local recurrences, 20 pulmonary recurrences, 16 lymph node recurrences, and 10 peritoneal recurrences. Computed tomography, CEA, and CA 19–9 were the first abnormal examinations in 77, 23, and 26 patients, respectively. Tumor markers detected the recurrence earlier than did CT in 27% of patients. CEA and CA 19–9 equally contributed to detection with respect to the number of patients, while the sites of detected recurrences differed.

- **Conclusion**: For early detection of occult recurrence of CRC, CT was the most reliable modality. On the other hand, tumor markers were also relevant. Given the recent advances in multimodal approaches for advanced CRC, the combination of CT, CEA, and CA 19–9 should be considered for effective surveillance.

### Prediction models of colorectal cancer prognosis incorporating perioperative longitudinal serum tumor markers: a retrospective longitudinal cohort study [^113gRWek]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, early colorectal cancer is mainly treated by radical resection, and clinicians formulate postoperative monitoring strategies based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging. However, patients with the same AJCC stage have been reported to have heterogeneous survival outcomes. Therefore, for a more precise identification of high-risk patients with poor prognoses, individualized prognostic prediction is needed.

Recently, prediction models utilizing serum tumor markers, along with demographic and clinicopathological variables, have been widely constructed for the prognosis prediction of CRC. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a recognized tumor marker in CRC, has been included in prognostic models. In addition to CEA, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) have been reported to be associated with the prognosis of CRC. However, whether and to what extent the further inclusion of CA19–9 and CA125 can improve the performance of the prediction model with CEA has not yet been clarified.

Prognostic prediction models of CRC have traditionally included only the preoperative measurement of tumor markers, while available repeated postoperative measurements of these markers have been underutilized. Studies have shown that longitudinal changing patterns of markers are prognostic factors independent of preoperative levels. Therefore, it is posited that including the longitudinal measurements of tumor markers could improve the prediction accuracy of the prognostic model.

### 18f-FDG PET/CT superior to serum CEA in detection of colorectal cancer and its recurrence [^1146hiyw]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine whether positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) can detect more cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) than serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), both at initial staging and during surveillance for recurrence. A retrospective review of 639 CRC patients imaged with PET/CT was performed. PET/CT was found to be superior to serum CEA in detecting CRC, identifying 2.5 times as many CRC cases at initial staging compared to serum CEA and 1.5 times as many CRC recurrences. The guideline recommendations of utilizing PET/CT only in the context of a rising serum CEA will miss more than one third of all CRC recurrences.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of metastatic colorectal cancer: A consensus statement of the Hellenic Society of Medical Oncologists (HESMO) [^113iRNnR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Patient follow-up depends on the stage of the disease, quality of surgery, and amenability for intervention with either resection of recurrent disease or consideration of further systemic therapy. Four recent meta-analyses have shown that intensive follow-up improves overall survival by 7–13% and is now considered standard. Generally, valid assessments include clinical visits every 3 months for the first three years, followed by visits every 6 months for the next two years, encompassing clinical examination, evaluation of long-term toxicities (such as polyneuropathy after oxaliplatin), and CEA testing.

Complete colonoscopy must be performed at initial diagnosis, three years after, and subsequently every five years. If the diagnostic colonoscopy was incomplete, this should be repeated 6 months after surgery. If follow-up colonoscopy shows an advanced adenoma that was successfully and completely excised, it should be repeated in one year.

In patients with high-risk disease, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen every 6–12 months could be considered. However, such close follow-up should be confined to patients possibly amenable to resection of hepatic or pulmonary recurrence. Follow-up CT scans should be conducted with the same imaging protocols and contrast phases of enhancement. If MRI was used for the initial staging, MRI should also be used for follow-up, because CT images cannot be compared to MRI images due to different sensitivity and specificity. Liver contrast-enhanced ultrasound could substitute for abdominal CT scans regarding the follow-up of liver metastases, particularly in young patients.

### Positron emission tomography for the evaluation of patients with colorectal cancer [^1174EyVf]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Approximately 40% of patients treated with curative intent for colorectal carcinoma eventually experience recurrence. In about one-third of these patients, the lesion is localized and potentially resectable. Typically, recurrence is characterized by findings on diagnostic imaging studies and may be accompanied by a rise in serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. However, in a few patients, the asymptomatic rise in CEA is not accompanied by diagnostic findings on computed tomography (CT).

We report a case of a patient with rising CEA levels, noted one year after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive colorectal cancer. Both CT and laparoscopic exploration were nondiagnostic. To further evaluate the rise in CEA, positron emission tomography (PET) was performed. PET revealed an area of increased uptake in the right lobe of the liver. Resection of the metastatic liver lesion resulted in a subsequent drop in CEA levels.

### A general cutoff level combined with personalized dynamic change of serum carcinoembryonic antigen can suggest timely use of FDG PET for early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer [^1114uqmn]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

FDG PET has been effective for diagnosing asymptomatic colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence in patients with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. However, no universal reference level of CEA rise suggests the necessity of a PET study. The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify the high-risk group of CRC recurrence through an examination of the dynamics of the CEA level rise as a recurrence indicator.

Between July 2002 and May 2010, 112 patients (59 men, 53 women; age 18–87 years) underwent FDG PET for suspicious CRC recurrence indicated by elevated CEA levels. We reviewed the PET results and medical records for recurrence verification and calculated the ratio of increase and the velocity of change in CEA levels for risk stratification.

The patient-based sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET are 96.6%, 91.3%, and 95.5%, respectively. The probability of recurrence positively correlated with the CEA level rise and the newly diagnosed disease stage. Carcinoembryonic antigen levels greater than 13 ng/mL indicated significantly higher risks of recurrence. In patients with a CEA level rise of 13 ng/mL or less, an increase to over 3.34 times the individualized baseline also indicated high risks of recurrence.

A posttreatment CEA level rise to greater than 13 ng/mL suggests the optimal use of FDG PET, as does a mild increase below 13 ng/mL at an increase rate over 3.34.

### Tumor marker evolution: Comparison with imaging for assessment of response to chemotherapy in patients with colorectal liver metastases [^114Dnp6g]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic resection is still considered the most effective treatment for patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). Unfortunately, only 10–20% of patients are directly amenable to surgery. In the remaining patients, complete metastatic resection would result in a too small volume of remnant functional liver parenchyma. However, due to major improvements in chemotherapy regimens, 13–54% of initially unresectable patients can now be switched to resectability. Besides this, systemic chemotherapy is increasingly being used in a neoadjuvant setting (i.e. in initially resectable patients) with the aim of facilitating hepatic resection and improving long-term outcome.

To determine the efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy, computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard. Imaging studies are necessary to determine resectability. Furthermore, the best surgical candidates can be identified, as disease progression while on preoperative chemotherapy is associated with poor outcome. Besides CT imaging, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and/or carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9) are widely used to monitor patients while on chemotherapy. Although the prognostic significance of increased preoperative CEA and CA19.9 levels has been well established in large series, the clinical significance of tumor marker evolution regarding correlation with imaging studies and impact on long-term outcome is still unclear. At the time of writing, only limited data is available suggesting a correlation between CEA evolution and chemotherapy response at CT imaging in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. As patient selection often…

### Use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers: Surgeon perceptions and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^117XYzn6]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

In contrast to colorectal cancer, there remains no consensus for the use of tumor markers in esophagogastric cancer. Despite this, they appear widely used in clinical practice, with CEA and CA19–9 the most often employed, and monitoring for recurrence the most common indication. In as many as 20% of cases, surgeons admitted to using tumor markers for diagnostic investigation. While CEA again outperformed CA19–9 and CA125 overall, all three tumor markers were found to have low diagnostic accuracy, as determined by the AUC. Unlike in colorectal cancer, all three were also found to have a low capacity to predict recurrence, which should preclude their use in widespread clinical practice.

Discrepancy with the use of tumor markers in esophagogastric cancer suggests further prospective evaluation is warranted, with a degree of discrimination with respect to their clinical interpretation. Given the sensitivity of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy of 95%, the capacity for histological evaluation, and surveillance for Barrett's esophagus, the pragmatic value of traditional tumor markers for esophagogastric cancer is restricted.

This study also highlighted the importance of a holistic evaluation of tumor markers prior to incorporating them into clinical practice. While benefits such as diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are key characteristics, as seen by their relative importance denoted in the survey, there must be an appreciation of costs. A marker that has high sensitivity but a high financial cost or requires excessive processing time may be less advantageous.

### Transient carcinoembryonic antigen elevations during adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer reflect the burden of residual micrometastatic disease [^1175dxJM]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing is routinely used to monitor the progress of patients with advanced cancer on treatment or to detect relapse during follow-up, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although CEA levels have been reported to rise during adjuvant drug therapies, the mechanism of such 'surges' is not clear. This study was conducted to clarify the clinical significance of this phenomenon.

- **Patients and methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of CEA levels in 88 consecutive patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in our center: 39 patients with primary CRC and a comparison cohort of 49 patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. In the event of two serial CEA increases, endoscopic and/or imaging investigations were performed to exclude recurrence. Subset analyses were based on nodal status and primary tumor type.

- **Results**: Primary resection was associated with significant CEA decline in patients with CRC but not in those with breast cancer. Forty-three patients (48.9%) experienced CEA fluctuations exceeding 0.5 ng/mL during adjuvant chemotherapy; CEA increases indicated true recurrence in two patients (4.7%). Adjuvant CEA surges occurred both more often and more extensively in disease associated with ≥ 4 positive nodes in patients with CRC but not in patients with breast cancer (P < .05).

- **Conclusion**: Both the frequency and extent of CEA surges during adjuvant chemotherapy parallel the severity of preoperative nodal involvement in CRC but not in breast cancer, suggesting that such surges reflect tumor lytic effects.

### Use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers: Surgeon perceptions and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^111TpAH3]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal cancers constitute the third most common cancers worldwide. Tumor markers have long since been used in the postoperative surveillance of these malignancies; however, the true value in clinical practice remains undetermined.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of three tumor markers in colorectal and esophagogastric cancer.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to elicit the sensitivity, specificity, statistical heterogeneity, and ability to predict recurrence and metastases for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 19–9, and CA125. European surgeons were surveyed to assess their practice and the characteristics of tumor markers they most valued. Data from the included studies and the survey were combined in a cost-benefit trade-off analysis to assess which tumor markers are of most use in clinical practice.

- **Results**: Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were ranked as the most desirable characteristics of a tumor marker by those surveyed. Overall, 156 studies were included to inform the cost-benefit trade-off. The cost-benefit trade-off showed that CEA outperformed both CA19–9 and CA125, with lower financial cost and higher sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy for metastases at presentation (area under the curve [AUC] 0.70 vs. 0.61 vs. 0.46), as well as similar diagnostic accuracy for recurrence (AUC 0.46 vs. 0.48).

- **Conclusions**: Cost-benefit trade-off analysis identified CEA to be the best performing tumor marker. Further studies should seek to evaluate new tumor markers.

### What is the most accurate whole-body imaging modality for assessment of local and distant recurrent disease in colorectal cancer? A meta-analysis: Imaging for recurrent colorectal cancer [^117HqnbT]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Individual study characteristics are presented in Table 2. Of the 14 articles included, 3 studied a single modality, and 11 compared two or three different modalities. Grouping the articles according to investigated imaging modality, 12 articles studied the performance of PET, 7 articles studied the performance of CT, 5 articles studied the performance of PET/CT, and 1 article studied the performance of MRI. In two studies which evaluated both PET and CT, only part of the thorax and abdomen was imaged with CT. Therefore, only the results for PET were included from these studies, resulting in a total of five studies available for CT. All CT studies used intravenous contrast. The number of patients ranged from 24 to 115 patients per study, with a total of 861 patients evaluated in all included studies. The percentage of male patients varied from 46% to 71%, and the mean or median age ranged from 58 to 68 years. All studies used histopathology or a combination of histopathology, clinical and radiological follow-up, conventional diagnostic modalities (X-ray, endoscopy, ultrasound), and surgical exploration as the reference method. The indication for whole-body imaging was suspected local or distant recurrence based on clinical symptoms, a rise in CEA levels, endoscopy findings, or findings from other imaging methods in all studies for all or the majority of patients.

### Fgd-pet in the follow-up of recurrent colorectal cancer [^117SBSby]. Colorectal Disease (2003). Low credibility.

The methods of detection for colorectal cancer recurrence after surgical treatment are often inaccurate using conventional imaging. This study aimed to detect early recurrence by means of PET in patients treated surgically for colorectal cancer by curative resection.

- **Methods**: Thirty-one disease-free patients were recruited and underwent FDG-PET. The results were verified by clinical, surgical, and radiological follow-up and/or biopsy to evaluate the accuracy for detecting recurrence.

- **Results**: PET detected six sites of increased activity in five patients. Three of these underwent surgery. One was a false positive with no evident tumor, and two underwent hepatic resection with removal of an omental metastasis. The sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 83.3%. Clinical management was altered in two cases (6.4%).

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates that PET is more accurate than conventional imaging for the evaluation of recurrence in colorectal cancer patients. FDG-PET should be considered in the follow-up of patients after treatment for colorectal cancer, in addition to other imaging methods.

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^115KsWqi]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Carcinoembryonic antigen was first described in 1965 by Gold and Freedman, when they identified an antigen that was present in both fetal colon and colon adenocarcinoma but was absent from the healthy adult colon, hence its name, carcinoembryonic antigen. Subsequent work showed that CEA was also present in certain healthy tissues, although concentrations in tumors were on average 60-fold higher than in the nonmalignant tissues. Now, the CEA gene is classified as a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family.

Carcinoembryonic antigen is the most widely used tumor marker worldwide and certainly the most frequently used marker in CRC. It could be detected and measured both in serum and in CRC tissue. The prognostic role of increased CEA levels in serum and tumor tissue of CRC patients remains unknown.

### Use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers: Surgeon perceptions and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^113TQF6a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Tumor markers have long been utilized in the monitoring of gastrointestinal cancers, with variable success. While traditional markers have a use in colorectal cancer surveillance, their use in esophagogastric malignancies is somewhat less defined and requires clarification. In both cases, there appears to be a need for a tumor marker with higher diagnostic accuracy. This suggests that further areas of research should focus on the search for new novel biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.

### CA11–19: A tumor marker for the detection of colorectal cancer [^1167L52S]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second most frequent cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Blood tests using tumor-related antigens aid in diagnosing CRC. However, higher sensitivity and specificity are needed before an acceptable tumor antigen blood test for CRC is clinically useful. This study describes the diagnostic accuracy of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the CA11–19 serologic tumor antigen for the detection of CRC.

- **Methods**: Serum specimens were obtained from 522 colonoscopy-confirmed subjects in institutional review board-approved studies. Specimens were blind coded. CA11–19 levels were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. The results were tabulated for categories of normal, hyperplastic polyps, benign gastrointestinal diseases (GI), adenomatous polyps, and CRC based on their final diagnosis.

- **Results**: When a cutoff of 6.4 units/mL for normal is used, the CA11–19 level was elevated in 128 of 131 CRC subjects, for an observed sensitivity of 98% (95% confidence interval, 93.1%-99.5%). Normal levels were found in 87% of normal subjects (90/103) and 83% of those with benign GI diseases (185/223). When combined, this yields an observed specificity of 84% (95% confidence interval, 80.0%-87.9%).

- **Conclusion**: CA11–19 is a serologic tumor marker for the diagnosis of CRC with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 84%. This high sensitivity means that this test will detect 43 of 44 cases of CRC presented. For those older than 50 years of age, it has a positive predictive value of 3.6% and a negative predictive value of 99.98%.

### Prognostic value of the postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level in colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis [^111jbo5F]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the commonly used preoperative biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC), but no meta-analysis has evaluated the findings of all recently published studies to determine whether its postoperative level can serve as a prognostic indicator.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic search for eligible literature from the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases in October 2023. Studies that investigated the relationship between postoperative serum CEA levels and prognosis in CRC patients were included. Outcome indicators, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS), were analyzed using a fixed-effects or random-effects model. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as effective values.

- **Results**: This meta-analysis included 20 eligible studies involving 10,114 CRC patients from East Asian and Western countries. A comprehensive analysis revealed that elevated postoperative CEA levels were associated with low OS (HR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.36–3.62, and p < 0.000), DFS (HR: 2.81, 95% CI: 2.01–3.94, and p < 0.000), and RFS/PFS (HR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.75–3.62, p < 0.000). A subgroup analysis by region, analysis type, distant metastasis, HR obtain method, sample size, postoperative measurement date, and study design demonstrated that the negative correlation observed between high serum CEA levels after surgery and poor prognosis was not significantly different between the subgroups.

In conclusion, when CEA levels are found to be elevated following surgery, they could potentially serve as a negative prognostic indicator in CRC patients.

### Routine follow-up by magnetic resonance imaging does not improve detection of resectable local recurrences from colorectal cancer [^1114ZWaZ]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

To determine if routine follow-up by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves the detection of resectable local recurrences from colorectal cancer, surgical treatment offers the best prospect of survival for patients with colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, most cases are often diagnosed at an unresectable stage when traditional follow-up methods are used. The impact of MRI surveillance on the early diagnosis of local recurrences has yet to be ascertained.

Patients who underwent curative surgery for rectal and left-sided colon tumors were included in a program of pelvic surveillance by routine MRI, in addition to the standard follow-up protocol. Cases were then analyzed for mode of diagnosis, resectability, and overall survival.

Pelvic recurrence was found in 30 (13%) of the 226 patients studied. MRI detected 26 of 30 (87%) and missed 4 of 30 (13%) cases with local recurrence; of the latter, 3 were anastomotic recurrences. In 28 (14%) patients, local recurrence was suspected by an initial MR scan but cleared by subsequent MRI or CT-guided biopsy. Pelvic cancer was diagnosed by MRI with 87% sensitivity and 86% specificity. In 19 (63%) cases, CEA was abnormally elevated, and 9 patients (30%) were symptomatic. Surgical resection was possible in only 6 patients (20%). There was no difference between MRI and conventional follow-up tests in their ability to detect cases suitable for surgery.

The conclusion is that pelvic surveillance by MRI is not justified as part of the routine follow-up following a curative resection.

### Does serum CA19–9 play a practical role in the management of patients with colorectal cancer [^111mEt6h]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

CA19–9 is often used in combination with carcinoembryonic antigen to manage patients with colorectal cancer, even though there is insufficient evidence to support this use of CA19–9. Carcinoembryonic antigen, by contrast, has been regarded as a better indicator of poor prognosis and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether CA19–9 is, in fact, a useful marker in the management of colorectal cancer patients by comparing it with carcinoembryonic antigen.

- **Methods**: A retrospective investigation was done for a consecutive series of 155 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent potentially curative surgery between 1995 and 1999. Excluded were patients with postoperative assays performed less than three times for either carcinoembryonic antigen or CA19–9 and those who had developed secondary cancers. Data from 118 patients were analyzed in terms of prediction of prognosis and detection of recurrences.

- **Results**: The sensitivities of preoperative CA19–9 and carcinoembryonic antigen were 29.8% and 45.3%, respectively. In the univariate analysis of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19–9 assays in 114 patients, high carcinoembryonic antigen level was significantly associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.0090) by log-rank test. We could not find a significant association between preoperative CA19–9 abnormality and survival (P = 0.12). Multivariate analysis of preoperative factors indicated significance in TNM stage (P = 0.0094) and tumor location (P = 0.036) but in neither carcinoembryonic antigen (P = 0.061) nor CA19–9.

### Imaging techniques contribute to increased surgical rescue of relapse in the follow-up of colorectal cancer [^113RvfiH]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

This study analyzes the results of a follow-up policy in colorectal cancer at our institution and evaluates the possible benefit provided by each test performed.

- **Patients and methods**: Six hundred nineteen patients who had radical surgery and adjuvant treatment for colorectal cancer were followed up with a protocol that included carcinoembryonic antigen testing and clinical examination every three months for the first two years, every four months in the third year, and every six months in the fourth and fifth years. Chest X-ray and colonoscopy were performed yearly for five years, and abdominal ultrasound was done every six months for the first three years and yearly afterward. Abdominopelvic computerized tomography was performed yearly for the first two years in cases with rectal cancer. If relapse was detected, all operable cases underwent surgery if possible.

- **Results**: Between 1993 and 1999, 619 patients were followed-up. The mean follow-up was 66.9 months. Two hundred eight relapses were detected, 83.6 percent in the first three years, and 73 (35.1 percent) underwent surgical resection. Carcinoembryonic antigen testing detected 44.2 percent of recurrences and 31.9 percent of them were operated on. Imaging techniques detected a lower percentage of recurrences (18.7 percent) but were more often resectable: 52 percent and 60 percent of the recurrences detected by computerized tomography and chest X-ray, respectively, underwent surgery. Median overall survival of patients with resected relapse was 62 months, significantly higher than those who were not operable (12.4 months).

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions: Recommendations by the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^116sUSP7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for colorectal polyps, particularly in managing recurrence, the USMSTF 2020 guidelines recommend considering endoscopic resection using repeat endoscopic mucosal resection, snare, or avulsion methods in cases of suspected local recurrence during surveillance. Ablation of the perimeter of the post-treatment site should also be considered. Subsequent examinations should be obtained at 6–12 month intervals until there is no local recurrence. Following a confirmed clear resection site by endoscopic assessment and histology, the next follow-ups should be at 1-year and then 3-year intervals.

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^114BmLSk]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumor types worldwide, with approximately 400,000 deaths annually. In the United States, despite a slight decrease in incidence and mortality over the past two decades, CRC remains the third most common cancer. It affects around 140,000 people and accounts for 50,000 cancer-related deaths each year. In China, where the incidence rate was initially low, the CRC rate is increasing by 4.2% annually due to changes in lifestyle and nutritional habits.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most commonly used tumor marker for the diagnosis of CRC and the evaluation of prognosis or recurrence after treatment. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines indicate that for T2 or greater lesions, a CEA test is recommended at baseline and every 3 months for 2 years. CEA can be detected and quantitatively measured in the serum and the tumor tissue of CRC patients; however, their role in the prognosis of CRC remains controversial. The objective of this study was to compare the prognostic value of CEA in both tumor tissue and serum of patients with CRC.

### Colorectal cancer (CRC) monitoring by 6-monthly 18FDG-PET/CT: an open-label multicentre randomised trial [^11411njc]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

This study was designed under the hypothesis that adding 18 FDG-PET/CT to a standard intensive monitoring strategy for patients at high risk for CRC recurrence would diminish the treatment failure rate, defined as death or unresectable recurrence, by detecting recurrences earlier. Although recurrences were indeed detected earlier in the 18 FDG-PET/CT arm, this earlier detection did not translate into a lower treatment failure rate. Also, neither overall survival (OS) nor disease-free survival (DFS) was better in the intervention arm. While the study was powered to detect a 15% absolute risk reduction (ARR) in the intervention group, a non-significant 5.5% absolute risk increase was found. Therefore, our negative result cannot be ascribed to underpowering. The intervention resulted in higher costs compared with the control strategy. Thus, our findings argue against adding 18 FDG-PET/CT to our standard monitoring strategy.

Whether intensifying monitoring strategies improves the outcomes of patients with CRC is controversial. Considerable heterogeneity across studies may explain the discrepancies in results. An intensive monitoring strategy was compared with less intensive investigations in some studies and to no follow-up at all in others. The investigations used in the intensive and control arms varied widely. The absence of benefits from intensified monitoring in older studies may be attributed to the poorer performance of CT at the time, compared with contemporary performance. Seven studies found earlier detection of recurrences with intensified follow-up but no effect on survival, a finding contradicted by a meta-analysis of randomized trials.

### CA 19–9 as a marker in addition to CEA to monitor colorectal cancer [^115wLMnK]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the commonly used tumor marker in patients with colorectal cancer, and CA 19–9 might serve as an additional marker. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether CA 19–9 levels can be used to monitor the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer who had no elevated CEA levels. The secondary aim was to determine if preoperative increased levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were associated with mortality.

- **Materials and methods**: Two sets of data from patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer were included in a single-center study. First, patients with a minimum of three serial measurements of CA 19–9 and CEA tumor markers were related to the clinical course of their disease. Second, patients with preoperative levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were related to survival.

- **Results**: In patients with colorectal cancer and three serial measurements of tumor markers, 7.3% had only increased CA 19–9 levels without increased CEA levels, and 55.4% of the patients had an increase in both CA 19–9 and CEA levels. In patients with available preoperative markers, those with only an increase in CA 19–9 had a significantly decreased 5-year survival compared to patients with an increase of only CEA (P = 0.013).

- **Conclusion**: CA 19–9 can be used as an additional marker to follow the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer without an increase in the CEA level. Patients with preoperative increased CA 19–9 levels had a poorer 5-year survival than patients with preoperative increased CEA levels.

### Dose-finding study of a CEA-targeting agent, SGM-101, for intraoperative fluorescence imaging of colorectal cancer [^115sAEGN]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), making it an optimal target for fluorescence imaging. A phase I/II study was designed to determine the optimal imaging dose of SGM-101 for intraoperative fluorescence imaging of primary and reCRC.

- **Methods**: Patients were included and received a single dose of SGM-101 at least 24 hours before surgery. Patients who received routine anticancer therapy (i.e. radiotherapy or chemotherapy) were also eligible. A dedicated near-infrared imaging system was used for real-time fluorescence imaging during surgery. Safety assessments were performed, and SGM-101 efficacy was evaluated per dose level to determine the most optimal imaging dose.

- **Results**: Thirty-seven patients with CRC were included in the analysis. Fluorescence was visible in all primary and recurrent tumors. In seven patients, no fluorescence was seen; all were confirmed as pathological complete responses after neoadjuvant therapy. Two tumors showed false-positive fluorescence. In the 37 patients, a total of 97 lesions were excised. The highest mean intraoperative tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) of 1.9 (p = 0.019) was seen in the 10-mg dose. This dose showed a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 63%, and negative predictive value of 94%. Nine patients (24%) had a surgical plan alteration based on fluorescence, with additional malignant lesions detected in six patients.

- **Conclusions**: The optimal imaging dose was established at 10 mg 4 days before surgery. The results accentuate the potential of SGM-101 and provide a promising base for future studies.

### Use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers: Surgeon perceptions and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^1163GQzp]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

As only a few studies assessed the use of CA19–9 and CA125 for the prediction of recurrence or metastases, there were insufficient data to undertake the analyses, and an assumption was therefore required, with the marker scoring zero for that performance characteristic. This would lead to CEA spuriously appearing to have higher benefits, simply as a product of it being more extensively investigated.

The trade-off analysis is also informed by the survey, which would only represent the views of members of the European society who responded. This suggests some positive selection bias, especially given the response rate of approximately 8%.

### Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen and sarcoidosis masquerading as metastatic colon cancer [^113R8xuK]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

When patients with colorectal cancer are monitored after the resection of primary or metastatic disease, an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is usually considered an indicator of recurrence. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are often used to locate the site of recurrences when computed tomography scans do not show the presence of disease. This case highlights an important cause of a falsely elevated CEA with abnormal PET imaging.

### Incidence of recurrence and time to recurrence in stage I to III colorectal cancer: A nationwide Danish cohort study [^114RuxAt]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Detection through screening was associated with a lower T category within each UICC stage, which contributed to the lower stage-specific recurrence rates observed for patients with screening-detected colorectal cancer (CRC). An advanced T category is a known factor associated with CRC recurrence, and the T category-specific recurrence rates were also lower in patients with screening-detected versus non-screening-detected CRC. The persistent lower recurrence rate in those with screening-detected CRC could result from a further downstaging of tumor burden beyond the T category, such as tumor size, or distinct differences in biological characteristics like growth rate. Further studies are needed to address this finding.

- **Surveillance protocols**: The main goal of follow-up protocols is to detect recurrence early to maximize patient survival. The European Society for Medical Oncology recommends a combination of clinical assessments, regular measurements of carcinoembryonic antigen levels, computed tomography (CT), and colonoscopy, with higher frequencies for the first 3 years after curative surgery and for a total duration of 5 years in patients with non-metastatic CRC. However, substantial variation has been found between national surveillance guidelines, and a Cochrane Review found no benefit of intensified surveillance on overall survival. Denmark participated in the international multicenter randomized clinical trial COLOFOL, which did not show improved 5-year overall survival or CRC-specific survival associated with more frequent CT scans and carcinoembryonic antigen measurement.

### Localised colon cancer: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^114ZHxbV]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for colon cancer, specifically with respect to surveillance after curative-intent therapy, clinical assessment and laboratory tests, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend to elicit a history, perform a physical examination, and obtain CEA levels every 3–6 months for 3 years and every 6–12 months at years 4 and 5 after surgery in patients with localized colon cancer.
