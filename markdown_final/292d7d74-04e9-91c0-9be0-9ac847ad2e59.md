## Question

Genetically altering microbes in the lab so that they do things that are useful for people?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about genetically altering microbes in the lab so that they do things that are useful for people. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core concept and why it matters. Then, I should verify the main application domains and concrete examples. Next, I will examine the enabling technologies and engineering principles. After that, I need to assess safety, biocontainment, and regulatory hurdles. Finally, I will synthesize current limitations and future directions, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence and cite appropriately.

> Let me first confirm the core concept. Genetically altering microbes in the lab to make them useful for people is the essence of synthetic microbiology, where we reprogram microorganisms to perform defined tasks such as producing chemicals, sensing disease, delivering therapeutics, or remediating the environment, leveraging the fact that microbes can be engineered as living factories or smart agents that respond to specific signals in complex settings [^79b664d6] [^feb7e8af].

> I will now examine the major application domains to ensure I'm not missing anything critical. The most prominent areas are medicine, sustainability and the environment, and industrial biomanufacturing, with medicine including diagnostics and therapeutics, sustainability including bioremediation and carbon capture, and industry including biofuels, specialty chemicals, and biomaterials; these domains are repeatedly emphasized in high-level reviews and perspectives, and I should double-check that I'm aligning examples with those categories [^feb7e8af] [^6ffc273a] [^3e43ba40].

> Next, I should review concrete medical examples to ground this. Engineered bacteria can detect tumor DNA in the gut and, in principle, deliver therapies on-site, representing a closed-loop diagnostic-therapeutic platform; this is an active research frontier with promising preclinical signals but still requires optimization for human use and safety, so I need to be careful not to overstate readiness [^2c14c497]. Living bacterial therapeutics are being designed to sense disease biomarkers and produce therapeutic effectors with spatiotemporal control, and several candidates are entering clinical development, though no recombinant live bacterial therapeutic has been approved yet, which I should explicitly note to avoid overstating clinical impact [^f3804937] [^e2f1f08c]. Beyond oncology, engineered microbes are being explored for metabolic disorders, infectious disease, and immunomodulation, reflecting the broader therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions [^bc4cadb7] [^ae2ae0d9].

> Hold on, I should verify environmental and sustainability examples to balance the narrative. Engineered microbes are being developed for pollutant detection and degradation, greenhouse gas sequestration, and conversion of waste streams to value-added products, with real-world deployment constrained by ecological risk and performance variability; nonetheless, proof-of-concept studies and early pilots show feasibility across soil, water, and atmospheric applications [^835f149f] [^6ffc273a]. In agriculture, synthetic biology has enabled nitrogen-fixing bacteria that associate with cereal crops, such as Pivot Bio's PROVEN, which reduced chemical nitrogen use and increased yields in field deployments, illustrating a commercially viable environmental application with measurable impact [^d216decb]. I should also note that bioremediation consortia for hydrocarbons and other contaminants have been used successfully, though persistence and ecological compatibility remain key considerations [^8e8cc2f0].

> Let me consider industrial biomanufacturing next. Microbes have long been engineered to produce biofuels, and advanced drop-in fuels require optimization of both host physiology and metabolic pathways to reach commercial titers and productivities; this remains challenging but has seen meaningful progress over the past decade [^3e43ba40]. Plant natural products that are hard to extract or synthesize chemically, such as certain pharmaceuticals, flavors, and fragrances, are increasingly produced in microbial chassis using synthetic biology, with protein engineering and biosensor-guided strain selection accelerating development cycles [^bcca312e] [^8c542cec]. Living biomaterials and polymer precursors are an emerging area where microbes function as factories for sustainable materials with tunable properties, though scale-up and cost-competitiveness are ongoing hurdles [^8b9cdc53].

> I need to check the enabling technologies that make these applications possible. CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized precision genome editing across microbial hosts, enabling targeted insertions, deletions, and regulatory rewiring with unprecedented ease and scalability, which is foundational to modern synthetic microbiology [^0edffdd7]. Standardized genetic parts, modular circuit design, and design-build-test-learn cycles borrowed from engineering disciplines allow iterative optimization of microbial function, while advances in DNA synthesis and assembly enable construction of large pathways and even synthetic genomes [^7ddd7966] [^36d4b9d3]. For environmental and therapeutic applications, optogenetic control and other inducible systems provide spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression, which is crucial for safety and efficacy in complex environments [^fd71ab1d].

> Wait, let me verify the safety and biocontainment landscape, because this is where overconfidence can lead to errors. Intrinsic biocontainment strategies such as auxotrophy, kill switches, and genetic code expansion are being developed to limit survival and gene flow of engineered microbes outside intended niches, but escape frequencies are not yet consistently at levels demanded by regulators, and real-world testing remains limited, so I should not imply these are solved problems [^31a73ac6] [^0ffbb28c]. Horizontal gene transfer to native microbiota is a persistent concern, and current risk assessment frameworks often lag behind the sophistication of modern genetic engineering, complicating approval pathways for environmental release [^dea9b214] [^5047e43b]. I should also emphasize that public acceptance and governance considerations extend beyond technical safety to equity, access, and trust, which materially shape deployment prospects [^783e6f16].

> I should double-check the regulatory status to avoid misstatements. No recombinant live bacterial therapeutic has been approved by the FDA, though guidance exists and several candidates are in clinical trials, so the field is at a pivotal juncture for proving clinical benefit and safety [^31a73ac6]. Environmental release of genetically modified microbes remains tightly regulated in many jurisdictions, with only a handful of consents granted in the UK since 2011, underscoring the need for clearer, harmonized frameworks that account for modern engineering biology while maintaining rigorous risk assessment [^db34c401]. Efforts are underway to differentiate precision breeding and gene editing from legacy GMO regulations, which could streamline approvals for certain applications, but this is still evolving and geographically variable [^e6eea3ae].

> Let me synthesize current limitations and future directions, and I should confirm each point against the literature. Key bottlenecks include genetic stability under selective pressure, ecological competitiveness in complex microbiomes, scalable manufacturing with consistent potency, and validated preclinical models that predict human outcomes; addressing these will require better chassis selection, burden-minimized circuit design, and standardized testing pipelines [^25f60ef2] [^527bef40]. Advances in synthetic ecology, defined microbial consortia, and machine learning are expected to improve predictability and control in medical and environmental settings, while continued development of biocontainment and biosafety standards will be essential for responsible deployment [^2d4d3f6f] [^77172d29]. I should also note that public engagement and equitable access must be integrated early in design to ensure societal benefit and mitigate resistance to innovation [^783e6f16].

> In conclusion, genetically altering microbes in the lab to do useful things for people is a rapidly maturing field with transformative potential across medicine, sustainability, and industry, enabled by CRISPR, synthetic biology, and systems engineering. However, realizing that potential hinges on solving safety, containment, and regulatory challenges, and on demonstrating clear clinical or environmental benefit in rigorously controlled studies, so I need to ensure my optimism is balanced with the current evidence base and acknowledged uncertainties [^79b664d6] [^feb7e8af] [^0edffdd7].

### New considerations in infectious disease outbreaks: the threat of genetically modified microbes [^17f96e3a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Genetically altered microbes are used widely in the conduct of scientific study and have facilitated the development of new medical therapies, preventive strategies, and diagnostic tools. Unfortunately, such organisms may also cause infectious disease outbreaks as a result of accidental or intentional transmission to humans. The unique microbial properties of genetically altered pathogens and the clinical symptoms exhibited by persons infected with them may impede the usual diagnostic and clinical evaluations or preventive strategies. Practicing physicians and clinicians at microbiology laboratories, who would be the first to observe such infections, must consider the broad clinical possibilities of illnesses caused by deliberately altered microorganisms and the potential difficulty in confirming a diagnosis.

Although the availability of results and potential monitoring are especially important in a biomedical context for all experiments and assays conducted in human cells, and especially in any ex vivo or in vivo trials with humans, relevant and useful information (to the human context and/or affecting humans) can also be gleaned from the results of experiments with non-human animals and even plants. Furthermore, as clearly explained by Caplan et al. gene editing in insects, plants and non-human animals are currently taking place and may have very concrete and important impacts on human health long before any gene editing experiments are used in any regular way in the health-care setting. As such, while keeping a focus on human use, there should also be monitoring of the results in non-human and non-model organism experiments and potential applications. Effects might include change of the ecosystem, of microbial environment, (including the microbiome, of parasites and zoonosis, which can involve new combinations with some disappearing, and/or new unexpected ones appearing), change to vegetation, which has a reflection on our vegetal food and on animals' food and natural niche. All this will have an impact on the environment, and consequently on organisms (including humans) who are exposed to this altered environment, hence the monitoring of risks and benefits is very important. Especially with gene editing of organisms for human consumption (in essence, genetically modified organisms), it will be important to note that the absence of obvious harms does not mean that there are no harms. Proper studies must be conducted and information regarding these should be made readily available.

### Engineering bacteria for diagnostic and therapeutic applications [^79b664d6]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Our ability to generate bacterial strains with unique and increasingly complex functions has rapidly expanded in recent times. The capacity for DNA synthesis is increasing and costing less; new tools are being developed for fast, large-scale genetic manipulation; and more tested genetic parts are available for use, as is the knowledge of how to use them effectively. These advances promise to unlock an exciting array of 'smart' bacteria for clinical use but will also challenge scientists to better optimize preclinical testing regimes for early identification and validation of promising strains and strategies. Here, we review recent advances in the development and testing of engineered bacterial diagnostics and therapeutics. We highlight new technologies that will assist the development of more complex, robust and reliable engineered bacteria for future clinical applications, and we discuss approaches to more efficiently evaluate engineered strains throughout their preclinical development.

Introduction

Synthetic biology and its applications hold great promise for addressing global humanitarian needs including the goals of sustainable development, zero hunger, health and well-being, reduced inequality, and improved access to responsibly produced goods and services. Advances in recent years have demonstrated the potential for synthetic biology to revolutionize technologies across disparate applications including biocomputing, living materials, electronic interfacing, therapeutic genome editing, multiplexed diagnostics, and cellular recording, third-generation biorefineries, and living biotherapeutics. Perhaps the most immediately recognized and advanced application of synthetic biology is the ability to alter metabolism to produce high-value products for applications ranging from biofuels and plant natural products, to polymer precursors and bio-inspired materials. In this regard, the ability to transform microorganisms into chemical factories that compete with organic chemical synthesis is ushering in a new era of biomanufacturing.

Despite these great advances, most current developments are not immediately translatable to "outside-the-lab" application spaces, which are quite diverse and variable compared to the well-controlled conditions available in laboratory settings. We posit that outside-the-lab scenarios encompass three main settings with respect to available resources: (1) resource-accessible, (2) resource-limited, and (3) off-the-grid. Resource-accessible settings include situations whereby technology is deployed with essentially unlimited access to resources and experienced personnel. Such situations (for which large-scale industrial biotechnology settings are a great example), typically entail technology transfer of lab-scale results followed by iterative process optimizations/scale-up and biological re-design cycles. However, successful deployment (even in these most resource-accessible conditions) is not a guarantee due to a number of factors including genetic stability, economics, feasibility, and other technical challenges. Resource-limited settings include scenarios marked by technology deployment in more remote settings that include more limited (but nonzero) access to resources and/or expertise, such as remote military and space missions. The most extreme condition, off-the-grid settings, include situations with minimal or no access to resources, electrical power, communication infrastructure, and expertise, such as deployment in remote areas on the planet or even within the gut microbiome. These applications necessitate that deployed technologies operate autonomously without external resources or intervention.

### Cas9-assisted biological containment of a genetically engineered human commensal bacterium and genetic elements [^72f2682a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The microbiome has recently become a point of focus for biomedical research. Altered microbial communities have been associated with a multitude of diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases, liver disease, metabolic disorders, and cancer, as well as responses to COVID-19and other infections. Synthetic biology offers powerful tools for manipulating the microbiome and elucidating the functions of its various components. Genetically engineered bacteria and sophisticated genetic circuits provide the means to investigate the exchange of biological signals between human and microbial cells and to eventually gain control over processes that can shield the body from diseases or overcome diseases at their onset.

Stringent regulations limit the use of genetically engineered bacteria to prevent them from being unintentionally released into the environment. The potential benefit of these organisms can be realized only once we have found ways to comply with these regulations. Thus, before the tools of synthetic biology can be applied, for example, to produce a useful protein in situ, to stimulate immunity in response to cancer, or to destroy a harmful virus in a host, technologies are needed to contain the genetically modified organisms and the genetic material they carry, which could find its way into other cells and alter the microbiome in unpredictable ways.

### Engineered bacteria can detect tumor DNA-NCI… [^2c14c497]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

There's also the potential to use the engineered bacteria to deliver treatments to tumors in the gut when and where they're detected, said one of the study's senior investigators, Daniel Worthley, M. D. Ph. D., of the Colonoscopy Clinic in Brisbane, Australia. In other words, "to unite diagnosis and therapy, " Dr. Worthley said. One thing is clear, the research team and experts not involved in the study agreed: More work is needed to develop and fine-tune the new technology for possible use in cancer care. That will include adapting the system for use with types of bacteria that are better suited for human use, such as those that are able to live in the human gut, and developing a way to deliver the bacteria by mouth. It also means further engineering and testing the system to ensure it's safe. One advantage of this "modular" genetic engineering technique, Dr.

Cooper explained, is that "we can easily tell the bacteria to look for other bits of DNA, " and to respond in different ways once cancer is detected. For example, he continued, the bacteria might be engineered to produce a compound that is easily detected in a urine or blood sample instead of becoming resistant to an antibiotic. Another potential advantage of the new approach compared with other tests that screen for cancer, Daschner said, is that "the bacteria can detect the mutated DNA where it is, when the mutation happens. " DNA is often destroyed by enzymes in the gut, "so unless there's a lot of tumor DNA, other tests, such as stool-based tests, might not detect it in a sample, " he continued. Envisioning a wide range of possible clinical uses For Dr. Worthley, the real long-term promise of the engineered bacteria is as a form of targeted therapy, not just as a way to look for cancer.

Because the bacteria "can respond directly at the time and place of disease detection, " he explained, they could be used to deliver treatments on the spot once cancer — or even a precancerous lesion — is detected. Instead of a tissue biopsy, which may involve a large needle or surgery, they said, engineered bacteria could someday be used to "sample" tumor DNA from the gut — and perhaps also tumors in other parts of the body — and deliver the DNA for genetic analysis. This could potentially revolutionize cancer biopsy and diagnosis, Dr. Rasooly said.

### A bumpy road ahead for genetic biocontainment [^9c047e8b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Recommendations

We envision several opportunities to bolster capacity building and deepen the conversation around evaluation and deployment of biocontainment technologies in real-world settings. First, funders can dedicate more resources to efforts to develop rigorous protocols and standards for testing intrinsic biocontainment in laboratory and field trial settings. A few programs — such as the USDA's Biotechnology Risk Assessment Grants program — are explicitly investing in biocontainment efforts, but more is needed. Alongside increased investment in developing biocontainment technologies, projects like the Department of Energy's Secure Engineered Ecosystem Design provide support for building environmental monitoring and biosensing infrastructure that is crucial for tracing the spread of engineered microbes. Such infrastructure should be funded, developed, and maintained in tandem with biocontainment technologies. These projects could be strengthened by collaborations with researchers outside the engineering biology community — for example, from soil ecology and environmental toxicology — who have expertise assessing risk from an environmental perspective.

Second, training on intrinsic biocontainment could be made a requirement for institutional biosafety committees. This could provide greater institutional support and supplemental guidance for researchers developing synthetic organisms and testing different biocontainment strategies on microbes, plants, and animals.

Third, while many within the research community frame intrinsic biocontainment as desirable and important for future innovations, perspectives from policy practitioners, industry representatives, and members of the public are currently less visible. Initiatives that bring together stakeholders from different sectors are needed to think through the scientific challenges, regulatory uncertainties, and broader societal dimensions of intrinsic biocontainment. Such cross-sectoral dialogue and collaboration could build capacity around a suite of interrelated questions including:
What standards should apply to testing of biocontainment strategies in laboratory and field settings? How should successful biocontainment be defined in different environmental contexts?
How might regulatory agencies best evaluate intrinsic biocontainment features in genetically modified organisms?
Would companies design intrinsic biocontainment features if there were clear and accessible regulatory pathways?
Is there a role for public engagement in the design, implementation and regulation of genetic biocontainment strategies?

### Guidelines for biosafety laboratory competency: CDC and the association of public health laboratories [^ed839e2d]. MMWR Supplements (2011). Medium credibility.

Appendix A — terms used in these guidelines defines key hazard and material concepts for biosafety laboratories, including aerosolization, biohazardous materials, biologic agents, biologic materials, and biologic waste. Aerosolization is the generation of liquid droplets or particles, 5 microns in diameter or less, that can be inhaled and retained in the lungs. Biohazardous materials are infectious agents or hazardous biologic materials that present a risk or potential risk to the health of humans, animals, or the environment and include certain types of recombinant DNA, organisms and viruses infectious to humans, animals, or plants and biologically active agents that can cause disease in other living organisms or cause significant impact to the environment or community. Biologic agents are any microorganism (including, but not limited to, bacteria, viruses, fungi, rickettsiae, or protozoa), infectious substance or any naturally occurring, bioengineered, or synthesized component of any such microorganism or infectious substance capable of causing death, disease, or other biologic malfunction in a human, an animal, a plant, or another living organism; deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or material of any kind; or deleterious alteration of the environment. Biologic materials are any biologically derived materials or materials that contain biologic species, including bacteria, viruses, microorganisms, genetically modified organisms or microorganisms, or prions, and biologic materials are not necessarily pathogenic or hazardous. Biologic waste is any biohazardous or nonbiohazardous waste containing biologic material.

### Applications, challenges, and needs for employing synthetic biology beyond the lab [^31a73ac6]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Biocontainment is another important ongoing issue in the context of delivering engineered cells to humans and agricultural settings. Auxotrophy-based strategies are useful for both limiting the use of antibiotic resistance markers in proximity to other bacteria, as well as potentially confining the survival of engineered hosts to the regions in which they are built to function. Implementation of kill switches, in which cells are programmed to die under specific conditions, can promote increased biocontainment control, but have yet to be demonstrated to have escape frequencies permissible by NIH recommendations. The development of more effective kill switches that are applicable for the organisms used for microbiome/internal drug delivery (probiotics and mammalian cells) is necessary to enable the deployment of these systems. In addition, strain engineering efforts aimed to decrease the potential for genetic variation once deployed in the gut or soil microbiome are necessary to ensure cell-based solutions are safe and efficacious once deployed(strategies for reducing genetic heterogeneity can be found elsewhere). Furthermore, while there is precedent for FDA approval of human cell-based therapies, no live microbial therapeutic has been approved by the FDA (although guidance on their manufacturing and evaluation has been devleoped). Progression from proof-of-concept microbial therapeutic studies to deployment outside-the-lab has many additional challenges including the potential for highly variable microbial behavior in different patient microbiomes, the need for milder large-scale pharmaceutical processes than used for more robust drug products, and potential for loss of microbial viability when traversing the harsh gastric environment.

### Special issue on the human microbiome: from symbiosis to therapy [^4a8b0806]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Probiotics as a food supplement or nutraceutical are naturally meant to be used in a healthy population. Owing to the long-term consumption of various food-derived commensals, they are considered safe. However, the concern for safety and toxicity of such preparations increases manyfold once they are intended for use as a prophylactic or therapeutic "drug" in vulnerable subjects. In the final article of this series, Cordaillat-Simmons et al.systematically discussed various aspects of the regulatory framework suggested by the "International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use". They propose several recommendations for developers of living biotherapeutic products (LBPs) so that they can successfully navigate their products through the clinical approval process. All LBPs must demonstrate a positive benefit-risk balance by ensuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of the products. For microbial therapeutics, quality must be ensured during the manufacturing process, which includes upscaling and batch-to-batch manufacturing. In addition, demonstration of stability both in terms of potency and genetic stability for the intended duration of storage is mandated. The authors discuss, in detail, the identification of critical parameters that can influence these factors. Early establishment of potency testing based on the mechanism of action can help in controlling the quality of the product during its evolution and upscaling. Furthermore, affirmation of safety for LBPs is different from chemical drug development processes, as once in the gut, microbes can produce metabolites that can affect host functions and present unintended consequences, expanding the scope of toxicological screenings. This necessitates that the safety of these products should be ensured from the very start of the development process. Unlike for new chemical entities, there are no established GLP safety assays for LBPs; thus, the authors suggest employing a spectrum of preclinical research models to generate a global safety profile of the product for the intended target population. Similarly, there are practical difficulties with demonstrating the efficacy of LBPs in clinical settings, as various environmental and host-related factors can affect the outcome. The authors also suggest designing "bridging" trials for extrapolation of data from one region to another if the LBP is being developed for international usage.

### Developing a new class of engineered live bacterial therapeutics to treat human diseases [^f3804937]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A complex interplay of metabolic and immunological mechanisms underlies many diseases that represent a substantial unmet medical need. There is an increasing appreciation of the role microbes play in human health and disease, and evidence is accumulating that a new class of live biotherapeutics comprised of engineered microbes could address specific mechanisms of disease. Using the tools of synthetic biology, nonpathogenic bacteria can be designed to sense and respond to environmental signals in order to consume harmful compounds and deliver therapeutic effectors. In this perspective, we describe considerations for the design and development of engineered live biotherapeutics to achieve regulatory and patient acceptance.

### Developing a new class of engineered live bacterial therapeutics to treat human diseases [^25f60ef2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The scale of manufacturing that is necessary for bacterial therapeutics will be determined largely by dosing requirements, and the efficacious dose of an engineered bacterial strain, in turn, is likely to be dependent on both its encoded mechanism of action and its route of administration. For example, metabolic conversions in the gastrointestinal tract may require a larger dose of engineered cells than immunomodulatory mechanisms expressed by intratumorally injected strains. This suggests that there will not be a "one size fits all" solution for the manufacture of engineered live bacterial therapeutics.

An additional aspect that is unique to engineered bacterial drug products is the need to ensure genetic stability during the production of bacterial biomass. The inclusion of engineered genetic circuits encoding novel effector functions may come at a cost to bacterial fitness and/or growth rates, and this can lead to selective pressure for strain variants that have lost the engineered function and its associated fitness costs. To minimize this risk, engineered components can be placed under tight regulatory control to ensure that the engineered gene expression is stably maintained in an "off" state until activation is desired during the preparation of biomass. Robust assays can also be implemented to ensure that engineered circuit function is retained in the drug product.

### Live biotherapeutic products as cancer treatments [^ad5868b3]. Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Almost every aspect of cancer can be influenced by microbiota including tumor onset, progression, and response to therapy. The increasing evidence of the role of microbiota in human health and disease has reinvigorated the interest in designing microbial products that can affect cancer outcomes. Researchers have made numerous attempts to develop safe, engineered biotherapeutic products for cancer treatment using synthetic biology tools. Despite the progress, only Bacillus Calmette-Guérin is approved for human use. Here, we highlight the recent advances and current challenges in using live bacteria as cancer therapeutics.

### Synthesizing microbial biodiversity [^8b85d502]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The diversity of microbial ecosystems is linked to crucial ecological processes and functions. Despite its significance, the ecological mechanisms responsible for the initiation and maintenance of microbiome diversity are still not fully understood. The primary challenge lies in the difficulty of isolating, monitoring, and manipulating the complex and interrelated ecological processes that modulate the diversity of microbial communities in their natural habitats. Synthetic ecology experiments provide a suitable alternative for investigating the mechanisms behind microbial biodiversity in controlled laboratory settings, as the environment can be systematically and modularly manipulated by adding and removing components. This enables the testing of hypotheses and the advancement of predictive theories. In this review, we present an overview of recent progress toward achieving this goal.

### A bumpy road ahead for genetic biocontainment [^0ffbb28c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Laboratory research and testing challenges

The potential efficacy of intrinsic biocontainment technologies faces several uncertainties. First, there are limited test data and metrics available for evaluating efficacy in the laboratory. The most consistently used measurement is escape frequency, which quantifies the persistence of engineered microorganisms on non-permissive growth media. However, variations in what is considered acceptable detection limits, together with a lack of standardized test conditions for evaluating escape frequency across different environments, decreases the reliability of this metric. The possibility of horizontal gene transfer from engineered organisms to wild-type organisms has also not been consistently tested in laboratory or field studies, therefore little is known about its risk potential.

Second, limited testing of intrinsic biocontainment mechanisms has been done under real-world conditions. The variety of possible real-world contexts (soils, ponds, oceans, etc.) and application purposes (bioremediation, biosensing, etc.) complicates the development of simple, standardized tests. Models can be used to simulate efficacy in real-world environments, but testing methods developed in the laboratory are difficult and potentially costly to translate into complex, real-world environments. This may reinforce academic incentives that favor publishing high-profile, novel biocontainment proposals over developing more resource-intensive field trials and longitudinal evaluation studies of possible ecological effects.

### Bottlenecks and opportunities for synthetic biology biosafety standards [^c36686c0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Why does biosafety need standardization?

Thinking about safety with respect to biological agents broadly, biosecurity frequently comes first to mind. And this is understandable, given that biosecurity as a field aims to prevent intended harm to people or the environment. Biosafety, in contrast, is a field focused on "containment principles, technologies and practices that are implemented to prevent unintentional exposure to biological agents or their inadvertent release", as defined by the WHO.

Biosafety guidelines are composed of policies, rules, and procedures to handle microorganisms and microbiological products. Implementing these biosafety guidelines requires suitable infrastructures (lab design and facilities), proper personal protection equipment, and sufficient staff training and surveillance (collectively called biocontainment as defined by the US Department of Health and Human Services). A key challenge, however, is extending the concept of biocontainment. In addition to the physical and design features noted in many definitions, containment that is engineered into the organism and that provides specific safety features after an (intentional) environmental release (e.g. restriction of horizontal gene flow, auxotrophy) is now included as well in biocontainment definitions –. The purpose of biocontainment, whether by laboratory or equipment design, or by constructing organisms intended for release, is identical in both cases: essentially, reducing potential hazards.

### Sharing whole genome sequencing… [^e05a7b16]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The FDA has been a leader in spreading the use of this technology in government labs at the state, federal, and international levels. In 2012, the agency started GenomeTrakr, a network of laboratories that use WGS to identify pathogens. The sequence data are housed in a publically available database and the network now includes FDA's federal and state public health partners. Since bacteria develop genetic traits in response to their specific geographic environment, it is now possible to obtain hints about their origin through sequencing. So to have this tool in our hands now and to localize contamination to specific parts of the world very quickly really goes a long way to help the inspectors that we have out in the field at any given time. Q: What are other uses for WGS beyond food safety. Allard: There are other FDA programs that could benefit from this technology.

For example, we are working with FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine to use WGS to monitor for the presence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics as part of FDA's work with the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System. And, it isn't just foodborne pathogens that are being collected and compared on a daily basis. NIH has a much broader mandate and they are comparing any pathogen that affects human health. So the basic tools that were set up for food safety are also now being used for global surveillance of human infectious diseases. Q: What's ahead in 2017 for WGS. Brown: Most importantly, we want to continue to serve our own agency in its mission to protect consumers against contaminated food and bring whole genome sequencing around to the front line users like the people in compliance and our people in the outbreak response units, so that they can have these tools at their desktop.

From my perspective, it's been good to see how whole genome sequencing can serve as a single microbiological workflow tool that displaces numerous other separate tests that each cost a lot of money and take a long time. If we wanted to know about the virulence of a pathogen, if we wanted to know its serotype, if we wanted to know its drug-resistances, all of those were separate tests and very expensive. But genomics is providing one avenue, one workflow, so that with that sequence we can tell you if a bacterium has the genes for drug resistance to various antibiotics, what virulence factors and serotype it has, and how we should classify it.

### A bumpy road ahead for genetic biocontainment [^aa3a1d42]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Intrinsic biocontainment technologies.

This schematic presents a variety of intrinsic biocontainment technologies that have been proposed and/or developed, grouped according to different core strategies (e.g. preventing organism growth or limiting gene transfer). References (indicated in square brackets on the figure) offer illustrative examples of the indicated technology –. Note this figure and associated references are not intended to convey an exhaustive list of intrinsic biocontainment technologies; we anticipate them to evolve as additional biocontainment strategies and technologies are developed.

Yet in practice, very few biotechnology products deployed in real-world settings have thus far incorporated intrinsic biocontainment mechanisms. Here, we explore key challenges facing the implementation of engineered intrinsic biocontainment outside of closed environments. In addition to identifying challenges around testing capacity and regulatory uncertainty, we suggest expanding the framing of biocontainment to attend to issues beyond human and environmental safety risks. We offer some recommendations for action in the US and beyond.

### Engineering microbial systems for the production and functionalization of biomaterials [^8b9cdc53]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

A new trend in biomaterials synthesis is harnessing the production of microorganisms, owing to the low cost and sustainability. Because microorganisms use DNA as a production code, it is possible for humans to reprogram these cells and thus build living factories for the production of biomaterials. Over the past decade, advances in genetic engineering have enabled the development of various intriguing biomaterials with useful properties, with commercially available biomaterials representing only a few of these. In this review, we discuss the common strategies for the production of bulk and commodity biogenic polymers, and highlight several notable approaches such as modular protein engineering and pathway optimization in achieving these goals. We finally investigate the available synthetic biology tools that allow engineering of living materials, and discuss how this emerging class of materials has expanded the application scope of biomaterials.

### Design and regulation of engineered bacteria for environmental release [^dea9b214]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Emerging products of biotechnology involve the release of living genetically modified microbes (GMMs) into the environment. However, regulatory challenges limit their use. So far, GMMs have mainly been tested in agriculture and environmental cleanup, with few approved for commercial purposes. Current government regulations do not sufficiently address modern genetic engineering and limit the potential of new applications, including living therapeutics, engineered living materials, self-healing infrastructure, anticorrosion coatings and consumer products. Here, based on 47 global studies on soil-released GMMs and laboratory microcosm experiments, we discuss the environmental behaviour of released bacteria and offer engineering strategies to help improve performance, control persistence and reduce risk. Furthermore, advanced technologies that improve GMM function and control, but lead to increases in regulatory scrutiny, are reviewed. Finally, we propose a new regulatory framework informed by recent data to maximize the benefits of GMMs and address risks.

### Developing a new class of engineered live bacterial therapeutics to treat human diseases [^bc4cadb7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The human body is host to diverse microbial communities, and the complex interactions between the host and its microbial counterparts play a key role in human health and disease. Notably, members of the microbial community inhabiting the human gastrointestinal tract (termed the gut microbiota) contribute to several metabolic and immune-mediated diseases, including obesity, malnutrition, intestinal inflammatory disease, as well as to anti-cancer immunity. The discovery of these host–microbe interactions presents the opportunity to address disease by modulating the structure and function of the gut microbiota. The field of synthetic biology applies the principles of molecular biology and metabolic engineering to design biological circuits that can be applied to medicine. A wide array of tools has been developed for several microbial host organisms, or chassis, that enable investigators to engineer mechanisms to address disease. Engineered bacterial strains can be designed to sense and respond to environmental signals within the body, including those in the gastrointestinal tract or in the microenvironment of solid tumors. In this Perspective, we describe the opportunities for and challenges facing the application of synthetic biology tools to the development of therapeutics for human disease. We explore regulatory considerations for the development of engineered live biotherapeutic organisms as medicines and discuss strategies for how these therapeutics can be evaluated for their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Lastly, we address considerations for manufacturability of engineered microbes to enable production at scale, as well as formulations and presentations that support the needs of patients.

### Developing a new class of engineered live bacterial therapeutics to treat human diseases [^e2f1d08c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Perspective and future developments

Engineered LBPs have the potential for delivering a living medicine that can sense signals within the patient, respond at the site of disease, and alleviate concerns of systemic exposure and toxicity. In other words, engineered microbes could act as biological thermostats and synthesize therapeutic effectors only as needed. To realize this vision, engineered circuits will require validated, disease-specific sensors, tight regulation of engineered genetic circuits, and optimization for maximal potency in order to minimize the required dose of bacterial cells to a patient. The convergence of the tools of molecular biology, low-cost DNA synthesis, and access to various 'omics databases will enable synthetic biologists to build diverse strain libraries, but identifying the most potent constructs will also require high throughput and predictive testing strategies to support the selection of clinical candidates.

As with any new therapeutic modality, patient acceptance of engineered bacterial therapeutics will need to be established. While there has been concern over the use of genetically modified organisms in foods, the use of these organisms in medicines will likely be more acceptable, particularly for treating serious conditions. Indeed, several recombinant bacterial therapeutics are currently being explored clinically (Table 1), and patients are actively enrolling in these trials and accepting the associated risks. Developers of engineered bacterial therapeutics have a responsibility to educate patients, physicians, and the public on their benefits and safety as well as to allay concerns about environmental impacts. As societal awareness of these therapies grows, the public must be assured that the live engineered organisms are contained and cannot disseminate in the environment or undergo further recombination.

Since no recombinant LBPs have been approved for use in humans, the field will be greatly advanced by the first proof of concept demonstration of an engineered bacterial therapeutic delivering a clinically meaningful impact on disease in patients. There will be both successes and failures along the path that will serve as useful lessons to guide the field. Several engineered live bacterial therapeutics are currently entering early or mid-stage clinical development and are poised to deliver the proof of concept needed to unlock the potential for this new class of therapeutics. Once this milestone has been reached, engineered bacterial therapeutics will be rapidly used to combine favorable safety profiles, convenient routes of administration, broad combinations of therapeutic effectors, and scalable manufacturing to create a new category of drugs and, more importantly, to address the significant unmet needs of patients.

### The age of next-generation therapeutic-microbe discovery: exploiting microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions for disease prevention [^6f0ec03b]. Infection and Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

Humans are considered "superorganisms", harboring a diverse microbial collective that outnumbers human cells 10 to 1. Complex and gravely understudied host- and microbe-microbe interactions-the product of millions of years of host-microbe coevolution-govern the superorganism in almost every aspect of life functions and overall well-being. Abruptly disrupting these interactions via extrinsic factors has undesirable consequences for the host. On the other hand, supplementing commensal or beneficial microbes may mitigate perturbed interactions or enhance the interactive relationships that ultimately benefit all parties. Hence, immense efforts have focused on dissecting the innumerable host- and microbe-microbe relationships to characterize if a "positive" or "negative" interaction is at play and to exploit such behavior for broader implications. For example, microbiome research has worked to identify and isolate naturally antipathogenic microbes that may offer therapeutic potential either in a direct, one-on-one application or by leveraging its unique metabolic properties. However, the discovery and isolation of such desired therapeutic microbes from complex microbiota have proven challenging. Currently, there is no conventional technique to universally and functionally screen for these microbes. With this said, we first describe in this review the historical (probiotics) and current (fecal microbiota or defined consortia) perspectives on therapeutic microbes, present the discoveries of therapeutic microbes through exploiting microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions, and detail our team's efforts in discovering therapeutic microbes via our novel microbiome screening platform. We conclude this minireview by briefly discussing challenges and possible solutions with therapeutic microbes' applications and paths ahead for discovery.

### Engineering biology applications for environmental solutions: potential and challenges [^ade7f12f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Key changes in regulatory definitions are beginning to be developed around the terms 'precision breeding', 'gene editing', 'GMO' and 'NGTs'. In the UK and USA, there are provisions for different regulatory treatment of some GMOs, which are known as 'precision bred' or 'gene edited', that do not involve the introduction of foreign DNA, or that could be deemed to have substantial equivalence to 'natural' products. In the EU, similar changes are in discussion to adjust the regulatory approach towards organisms produced through NGTs. Some argue these recent regulatory shifts simplify previous regimes and reflect a better understanding of the scientific landscape. Some consider such regulatory change to be based on fresh assessments of the risks of GMOs, including long-term risks that many expected when precautionary regulation was implemented, but are deemed not to have come to fruition in a global landscape of varying GM cultivation and use. Others, however, challenge the jump from lab-based risk assessment methodologies to biological, ecological and toxicology claims, arguing that the push for revised regulatory frameworks is driven primarily by commercial interests.

Overall, the field would benefit from shared terminologies and less disjointed regulatory process across geographies. This will facilitate the progression of discoveries and innovations at low technological readiness level toward deployable products and services, which today face lengthy GMO/engineering biology regulatory processes that need to be replicated across jurisdictions in the pursuit of wider markets.

### Road MAPs to engineer host microbiomes [^762fe582]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Microbiomes contribute directly or indirectly to host health and fitness. Thus far, investigations into these emergent traits, referred to here as microbiome-associated phenotypes (MAPs), have been primarily qualitative and taxonomy-driven rather than quantitative and trait-based. We present the MAPs-first approach, a theoretical and experimental roadmap that involves quantitative profiling of MAPs across genetically variable hosts and subsequent identification of the underlying mechanisms. We outline strategies for developing 'modular microbiomes'-synthetic microbial consortia that are engineered in concert with the host genotype to confer different but mutually compatible MAPs to a single host or host population. By integrating host and microbial traits, these strategies will facilitate targeted engineering of microbiomes to the benefit of agriculture, human/animal health and biotechnology.

### Harnessing the power of microbial metabolism [^98db2ce2]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Microorganisms are rich repositories of genetic material encoding many activities of potential interest. Recent advances make identifying and exploiting the metabolic treasures of uncultured microbes an easier proposition. Improved expression vectors and metagenomic screening techniques make it easier to identify activities of interest. Synthetic biology and efficient genome editing techniques allow microbial genomes to be modified almost without restriction. Computational approaches based on organism-wide analysis of transcription, protein synthesis and metabolic fluxes make it possible to accurately predict the outcome of the metabolic processes and modifications required for optimization. Together these advances represent a major breakthrough in microbial biotechnology that is expected to yield new generations of tailor-made biocatalysts suitable for multiple biotechnological applications.

### Toward rational design of bacterial genomes [^36d4b9d3]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

The advent of genetic engineering-the ability to edit and insert DNA into living organisms-in the latter half of the 20th century created visions of a new era of synthetic biology, where novel biological functions could be designed and implemented for useful purposes. We are witnessing an exciting revolution of scale, wherein technical progresses allow for the manipulation of genetic material at the whole genome level. This will enable the manufacture of increasingly complex genetic designs to solve pressing challenges in health, energy and the environment-if and when such designs can be specified. We argue that the organized development of key common application organisms, engineered for engineerability, and attendant libraries of parts, pathways and standardized manufacturing are necessary for this genome-scale technology to realize its promise.

### One small edit for humans, one giant edit for humankind? Points and questions to consider for a responsible way forward for gene editing in humans [^fb112720]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gene editing, which allows for specific location(s) in the genome to be targeted and changed by deleting, adding or substituting nucleotides, is currently the subject of much academic, industry and policy discussions. While not new per se, gene editing has become a particularly salient topic primarily due to a relatively novel tool called CRISPR-Cas9. This specific tool distinguishes itself from its counterparts, (e.g. zinc-finger nucleases and TAL effector nucleases (TALENs)) due to a mixture of increased efficiency (number of sites altered), specificity (at the exact location targeted), ease of use and accessibility for researchers (e.g. commercially available kits), as well as a relatively affordable price. These attributes make CRISPR-Cas9 an extremely useful and powerful tool that can (and has) been used in research in order to alter the genes in cells from a large range of different organisms, including plants, non-human animals and microorganisms, as well as in human cells. Ultimately, CRISPR-Cas9 is becoming increasingly available to a larger number of scientists, who have used it, or intend to use it for a myriad of reasons in many different research domains. When such powerful and potentially disruptive technologies or tools (begin to) show a tendency to become widely used, it is common for debate and discussion to erupt. Germane to this debate is the fact that with the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 and other similar tools (e.g. CRISPR Cpf1), the possibility of using the technique of gene editing in a potentially safe and effective manner in humans — whether for somatic or germ line/heritable 1 gene editing — has become feasible in the near to medium future.

### Bottlenecks and opportunities for synthetic biology biosafety standards [^694f8459]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The growing research on engineering microorganisms, especially by practitioners in the area of synthetic biology, for industrial, medical, and environmental applications brings up new challenges for biosafety. There have been studies dedicated to addressing these challenges by developing new approaches to confine the engineered organisms to reduce the risks of unintentional exposure or to limit horizontal gene transfer for those organisms that would be released into the environment for medical or environmental applications. Meanwhile, in addition to technical solutions to enhance biosafety, the research community has proposed other solutions, such as promoting the concept of 'safety by design' in biological studies, and promoting a biosafety-focused culture.

The goal to define standards for synthetic biology also includes standards for biosafety, as real-world applications need not only to be effective and, preferably, inexpensive, but obviously also "safe enough". Setting up comprehensive biosafety standards is a critical prerequisite (although not a sufficient one) for synthetic biology products and processes to successfully go through a regulatory risk assessment and be approved for the market. From an industrial and regulatory perspective, proper deployment of biosafety standards could make it easier to conduct the risk assessment. Compared to conventional environmental risk assessment, a qualified presumption of the safety of an organism could even be granted a fast track evaluation.

### Synthetic microbiology in sustainability applications [^6ffc273a]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Microorganisms are a promising means to address many societal sustainability challenges owing to their ability to thrive in diverse environments and interface with the microscale chemical world via diverse metabolic capacities. Synthetic biology can engineer microorganisms by rewiring their regulatory networks or introducing new functionalities, enhancing their utility for target applications. In this Review, we provide a broad, high-level overview of various research efforts addressing sustainability challenges through synthetic biology, emphasizing foundational microbiological research questions that can accelerate the development of these efforts. We introduce an organizational framework that categorizes these efforts along three domains - factory, farm and field - that are defined by the extent to which the engineered microorganisms interface with the natural external environment. Different application areas within the same domain share many fundamental challenges, highlighting productive opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaborations between researchers working in historically disparate fields.

### Engineering biology applications for environmental solutions: potential and challenges [^835f149f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Addressing environmental challenges arising from growing, increasingly industrialised global populations and urbanisation will rely on various technologies, including engineering biology. Engineering biology is applicable to the detection and degradation of pollutants, greenhouse gas sequestration, and conversion of waste streams, especially recalcitrant and non-biodegradable ones, to value-added product generation and replacement of fossil fuel-derived production with biological alternatives. The UK government defines engineering biology as 'the design, scaling, and commercialisation of biology-derived products and services that can transform sectors or produce existing products more sustainably' and has designated the field as one of five critical technologies. Engineering biology is sometimes synonymous with synthetic biology or biological engineering, although in this case, the goal is to take synthetic biology concepts and translate them into practical solutions to address real-world issues and markets and, at the same time, create value chains out of them. Combined private and public investment in the synthetic biology sector totalled US$16.35 billion in 2023, with the market size expected to reach approximately US$148 billion by 2033.

This article focuses on the potential applications, considerations and challenges of utilising and engineering microbes for environmental applications, which we term environmental biotechnology. We do not focus on the synthetic biology tools, except where they impact environmental implementation, biocontainment, biosafety, or regulatory requirements. There are significant obstacles that need to be overcome to fully realise the potential of environmental biotechnology. Scaling-up these engineered systems and their digital twins to real-world applications needs better understanding to bridge the gap between lab conditions and complex environments. Developing suitable standardsand addressing ethical, regulatory, and societal dimensions, play significant roles in deploying synthetic biology applications. These considerations will be discussed in greater detail in the following sections with relevant examples provided.

### Applications, challenges, and needs for employing synthetic biology beyond the lab [^61d8c580]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Ongoing challenges and needs

The majority of platforms so far have served as proof-of-concept systems with limited field-deployment. In the case of closed-loop platforms intended for deployment within the human body (engineered probiotics and mammalian cells for pathogenic and non-pathogenic disease treatment) tight control over genetic circuit activation is essential to prevent premature treatment release. Furthermore, implementation of release mechanisms to inactivate devices/engineered cells in the event of complications is essential to assure patient safety (possibly via programmable electronic device integration or use of antibiotic-triggered release mechanisms in the case of mammalian cells). The development of increasingly sophisticated circuits, as demonstrated in proof-of-concept platforms in the above sections, certainly demonstrated progress toward this functionality, but extensive in vivo testing and validation will be required before these technologies can realistically be deployed in humans. Overall, further efforts to engineer organisms least likely to trigger adverse immune responses (such as mammalian cells, probiotics, and even autologous cells from patients) will likely be needed to ensure these treatments are both efficacious and safe.

In terms of external wound healing applications, several of the works described above discuss long-term storage capacity under metabolically inactive conditions. An additional key feature for these systems is the timeline for survival under ambient conditions (exposed to a patient's skin and the air without access to media) in which wound healing would occur. More detailed knowledge of these timelines could inform further engineering efforts to develop more robust strains as well as yield timelines for swapping of wound dressings in a field setting. Expansion of systems to a broader range of health biomarkers could expand usability as well. For instance, the ingestible bacterial-electronic sensing system described earlieris an example of an option for the sensing of gut microbiome biomarkers relevant to patient health, which could ideally be coupled with additional 'response' circuits to create a closed-loop platform. The possibility for oral administration is also an attractive feature compared to implantation requirements of many other systems.

### Exploring the emerging role of the microbiome in cancer immunotherapy [^f3587b8a]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Alternatively, beneficial or immune-potentiating bacteria could be prepared as a probiotic and provided as an immunotherapy adjuvant. Once molecular mechanisms are determined, genetic manipulation of the selected bacteria could be utilized to maximize beneficial effects. Historically, certain bacterial species have been some of the most amenable organisms to genetic manipulation, and the breadth of tools available to study and modify bacteria continues to expand. This technology allows the modification of a bacterium's existing function or the introduction of completely novel genes. For example, a Bacteroides strain modified to carry a gene cluster to utilize porphyran stabilized its engraftment into mice fed a porphyran-supplemented diet. This strategy effectively creates a unique metabolic niche for the exogenous microbe and presents a potential means to facilitate probiotic efficacy. Bacteria may also be genetically modified to drive expression of a metabolite of interest. For well-characterized bacteria such as Escherichia coli, genetic manipulation is routine, but for many human commensals, incomplete genomic information leaves fewer tools available for these strategies currently. To circumvent this limitation, it is possible to express bacterial genes of interest heterologously in common laboratory hosts such as E. coli or Bacillus subtilis. An alternative approach to adding beneficial bacteria to the microbiota is selective depletion of harmful species from the community. Bacteriophages are viruses that can infect and kill bacteria and are naturally present in the microbiome where they play a key role in preserving community equilibrium. Some phages have been used preclinically to decrease pathogenic bacteria while leaving the commensal community intact, and could be further engineered to target certain bacterial species or strains.

Finally, if a bacterial metabolic pathway is identified along with defined metabolic products that mediate improved anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy, then small molecule entities could be tested as candidate immune-potentiating drugs. In all cases, appropriately controlled clinical trials will be required to validate any potential microbiome-based therapy and to assess benefits and risks. Clinical trials to evaluate the impact of fecal microbiome transplant and probiotic administration with checkpoint inhibitors are already underway.

### Gene synthesis allows biologists to source genes from farther away in the tree of life [^3947c346]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

A particularly apt setting for our approach is agricultural risk. For decades, through the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has had oversight of genetically engineered organisms that may pose agricultural risk. However, genetically modified organism (GMO) detection in agriculture has been limited to PCR-based methods with primers designed to target known genes associated with GMOs, which are most commonly synthetic transgenes. Detection of GMO crops or food ingredients is of heightened interest in the European Union given stricter regulation. While state of the art methods for GMO detection in the EU have featured more extensive databases, they remain associated with PCR methodology. The Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission constructed the GMOMETHODS database which contained 118 different PCR methods allowing identification of 51 single GM events and 18 taxon-specific genes in a sample as of 2012. In 2015, the JRC followed up with a database specifically aimed at storing GMO-related sequences called JRC GMO-Amplicons. Though the database name refers to amplicons, the authors note that the availability of an updated GMO sequence databases has increased relevance after the advent of next-generation sequencing. When coupled with next-generation sequencing, our classification method should provide a more general and complementary approach to comparisons against known GMO-associated sequences because it can identify uncatalogued synthetic transgenes, such as those not intended for crop enhancement. In addition to agriculturally oriented agencies, public health, environmental, and biosecurity agencies would benefit from the ability to screen for untargeted genes in organisms to identify unusual risks. Engineered organisms containing synthetic genes are of particular interest because in academic settings they have been demonstrated to produce non-native illicit substances, to express non-native toxins, or to execute complex programs designed to alter human cell fates. Furthermore, engineered microbes released into the environment can persist for years. Because the RefSeq reference genome collection includes pathogen genomes, our classification approach can also be used to identify gene transfers into known pathogens.

### Classifying compounds as prebiotics-scientific perspectives and recommendations [^31a33386]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Microbiomes provide key contributions to health and potentially important therapeutic targets. Conceived nearly 30 years ago, the prebiotic concept posits that targeted modulation of host microbial communities through the provision of selectively utilized growth substrates provides an effective approach to improving health. Although the basic tenets of this concept remain the same, it is timely to address certain challenges pertaining to prebiotics, including establishing that prebiotic-induced microbiota modulation causes the health outcome, determining which members within a complex microbial community directly utilize specific substrates in vivo and when those microbial effects sufficiently satisfy selectivity requirements, and clarification of the scientific principles on which the term 'prebiotic' is predicated to inspire proper use. In this Expert Recommendation, we provide a framework for the classification of compounds as prebiotics. We discuss ecological principles by which substrates modulate microbiomes and methodologies useful for characterizing such changes. We then propose statistical approaches that can be used to establish causal links between selective effects on the microbiome and health effects on the host, which can help address existing challenges. We use this information to provide the minimum criteria needed to classify compounds as prebiotics. Furthermore, communications to consumers and regulatory approaches to prebiotics worldwide are discussed.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^0acee09e]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

Pneumonia models — development and selection considerations emphasize defining the specific research question, with methodological rigor and careful attention to factors so models provide relevant and reliable data, including the organisms, host factors, specific methodology, and outcome measures. Choice of organism and model type, including selection of an appropriate animal species that recapitulates human lung physiology and immune response, is important, and each animal species has unique immune and respiratory features with relevance to human infection. For ethical or cost reasons, in vitro models and in silico models can be useful, and human-derived lung organoids or cell coculture systems provide insights into human-specific host–pathogen interactions without animal use. Inoculation method and technical details such as intranasal versus intratracheal inoculation can vary across laboratories, and options include simulation of natural routes such as aerosolized infections. Consistency in key factors is paramount, including bacterial preparation, mouse age and environment, acclimatization, and anesthesia type, and recent publications outline standardized methods; consistency in animal husbandry also mitigates microbiota-related variations in pulmonary response. Host factors and immune responses can be assessed using genetically modified animals or animals with induced comorbidities, and measuring immune cell recruitment, cytokine levels, and markers of lung injury provides insights.

### Engineering biology applications for environmental solutions: potential and challenges [^5047e43b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The current state of biosafety and biosecurity standards related to environmental biotechnology both overlaps with and leaves gaps in relation to other regulations. Well-established guidelines exist for traditional biotechnological applications (contained use). For most application types, the risk assessment for genetically modified or edited organisms will account for the nature of the intended modification and will assess the relative risk to the environment, and animal or human health (e.g. hazards, severity, likelihoods, etc.). Containment level (BSL1 to BSL4), safeguards, control measures, and assignment of GM Activity Class require consideration. However, as we venture into more advanced areas like synthetic biology and gene editing, existing frameworks often fall short, especially when considering the potential of these technologies to bring solutions that may require deliberate release.

### Engineering living therapeutics with synthetic biology [^2b37bac4]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2021). High credibility.

The steadfast advance of the synthetic biology field has enabled scientists to use genetically engineered cells, instead of small molecules or biologics, as the basis for the development of novel therapeutics. Cells endowed with synthetic gene circuits can control the localization, timing and dosage of therapeutic activities in response to specific disease biomarkers and thus represent a powerful new weapon in the fight against disease. Here, we conceptualize how synthetic biology approaches can be applied to programme living cells with therapeutic functions and discuss the advantages that they offer over conventional therapies in terms of flexibility, specificity and predictability, as well as challenges for their development. We present notable advances in the creation of engineered cells that harbour synthetic gene circuits capable of biological sensing and computation of signals derived from intracellular or extracellular biomarkers. We categorize and describe these developments based on the cell scaffold (human or microbial) and the site at which the engineered cell exerts its therapeutic function within its human host. The design of cell-based therapeutics with synthetic biology is a rapidly growing strategy in medicine that holds great promise for the development of effective treatments for a wide variety of human diseases.

### A bumpy road ahead for genetic biocontainment [^783e6f16]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In keeping with these examples, public concerns around biotechnologies often extend beyond questions of health and safety. For example, questions relating to corporate concentration of economic and political power, inequalities in access and ownership, trust in regulatory bodies, and ethical concerns regarding the intrinsic value of life are routinely raised in public discussions of genetically modified organisms. There is a tendency within the research community to invoke biocontainment as a way to promote public trust, but addressing the kinds of concerns raised in public debates about the control of engineered organisms takes more than assurance of human health and environmental safety.

Genetically engineered organisms introduced into the environment enter complex biological and social worlds. While it's tempting to think of biocontainment as a straightforward technological fix, we suggest that more holistic evaluation of biocontainment proposals is needed. This would include attending to their legal, economic, regulatory, and social dimensions in addition to evaluating biosafety.

### Reevaluating synthesis by biology [^8fc663d2]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

The two cornerstones of synthetic biology are the introduction of the new technology of chemical DNA synthesis and its subsequent emphasis on the use of standardized biological parts in the construction of genetic systems aimed at eliciting of desired cellular behavior. A number of high-impact applications have been proposed for this technology, notable among them being the biological synthesis of valuable compounds for chemical or pharmaceutical use. To this end, synthetic biologists propose assembling metabolic pathways in toto by combining genes isolated from a variety of sources. While pathway construction is similar to approaches established long ago by Metabolic Engineering, the two methods deviate significantly when it comes to pathway optimization. Synthetic biologists opt for gene-combinatorial methods whereby large numbers of pathways, comprising several combinations of genes from different sources, and their mutants, are evaluated in search for an optimal pathway configuration. Metabolic engineering, on the contrary, aims to optimize pathways by tuning the activity of the intermediate reaction steps. Both, rational methods based on kinetics and regulation, as well as combinatorial methods, typically in this order, are used to this end. We argue that a systematic approach consisting of fine-tuning the properties of individual pathway components, prominently enzymes, is a superior strategy to searches spanning large genetic spaces in engineering optimal microbes for the production of chemical and pharmaceutical products.

### Psychobiotics and the need for better interventional data [^2ce29691]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Gut microbiota composition has been associated with multiple health outcomes: various studies employing predictive genetic studies and randomised controlled trials suggest this is the case. More specifically, it has long been postulated that the direct connections between the central nervous system and the gut may make the contents of the intestines a key regulator in a variety of central nervous system disorders. Probiotics comprise live bacteria and yeasts ingested as food supplements. Whilst the interest in and availability of probiotics for a range of disorders grows every year, the evidence to support such interventions is unclear. With the rise of "psychobiotics", where does the clinical utility of interventions into gut microbiota as a treatment for neurological disorders currently sit?

Interventions targeting the gut microbiota including either probiotics (live bacteria or yeasts as food supplements) or FMT (faecal microbiota transplantation) seek to alter the composition of microbes in the individual's intestinal tract. The downstream effects of this have been proposed to positively impact obesity, cystitis, blood pressure, susceptibility to infection, eczema, asthma and preeclampsia amongst other health outcomes. Amongst these, newer research points to a link between probiotics and mental health/neurological outcomes.

"Psychobiotics" is a new term coined to describe probiotic interventions which produce a health benefit in individuals with psychiatric or neurological disorders. The incidence of these disorders is on the rise globally and, following the global COVID-19 pandemic, is being diagnosed with greater frequency. Between 1990 and 2019, the disability-adjusted life-years attributed to mental disorders increased from 80.8 million to 125.3 million. As such, novel interventions which can prevent or modulate neurological disorders are of high interest. Indeed, the Future Market Insights estimates the current global market at $140.3 M with a projected worth of 201.8 M by 2033.

The concept of the gut-brain axis is decades old and is based around the direct neuronal connection between the two organs via the vagus nerve and the role of gut microbiota in production and modulation of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. A vast amount of data has been published on this topic using different approaches such as animal model-based, observational, association, mendelian randomisation bioinformatic and human intervention studies. However, a surfeit of data from limited studies with conflicting or weak results will result in unclear clinical utility.

### The biosecurity benefits of genetic engineering attribution [^53378559]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Biology can be misused, and the risk of this causing widespread harm increases in step with the rapid march of technological progress. A key security challenge involves attribution: determining, in the wake of a human-caused biological event, who was responsible. Recent scientific developments have demonstrated a capability for detecting whether an organism involved in such an event has been genetically modified and, if modified, to infer from its genetic sequence its likely lab of origin. We believe this technique could be developed into powerful forensic tools to aid the attribution of outbreaks caused by genetically engineered pathogens, and thus protect against the potential misuse of synthetic biology.

### Engineered bacteria to report gut function: technologies and implementation [^436e3208]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Advances in synthetic biology and microbiology have enabled the creation of engineered bacteria which can sense and report on intracellular and extracellular signals. When deployed in vivo these whole-cell bacterial biosensors can act as sentinels to monitor biomolecules of interest in human health and disease settings. This is particularly interesting in the context of the gut microbiota, which interacts extensively with the human host throughout time and transit of the gut and can be accessed from feces without requiring invasive collection. Leveraging rational engineering approaches for genetic circuits as well as an expanding catalog of disease-associated biomarkers, bacterial biosensors can act as non-invasive and easy-to-monitor reporters of the gut. Here, we summarize recent engineering approaches applied in vivo in animal models and then highlight promising technologies for designing the next generation of bacterial biosensors.

### Functional relevance of microbiome signatures: the correlation era requires tools for consolidation [^462f31ee]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Compelling research over the past decade identified a fundamental role of the intestinal microbiome on human health. Compositional and functional changes of this microbial ecosystem are correlated with a variety of human pathologies. Metagenomic resolution and bioinformatic tools considerably improved, allowing even strain-level analysis. However, the search for microbial risk patterns in human cohorts is often confounded by environmental factors (eg, medication) and host status (eg, disease relapse), questioning the prognostic and therapeutic value of the currently available information. In addition to a better stratification of human phenotypes, the implementation of standardized protocols for sampling and analysis is needed to improve the reproducibility and comparability of microbiome signatures at a meaningful taxonomic resolution. At the level of mechanistic understanding, the molecular integration of pleiotropic signals coming from this complex and dynamically changing ecosystem is one of the biggest challenges in this field. The first successful attempts to apply reverse genetics based on the available metagenomic information yielded identification of small molecules and metabolites with functional relevance for microbe-host interactions. Further expansion on the isolation of bacteria from the "unculturable biomass" will help characterize microbiome signatures in model systems, finally aiming at the development of clinically relevant synthetic consortia with safe and functionally well-defined strains. In conclusion and beyond reasonable enthusiasm, the mechanistic implementation and clinical relevance of microbiome alterations on disease susceptibility is still in its infancy, but the integration of all the above-mentioned strategies will help overcome the correlation era in microbiome research and lead to a rational evaluation of clinical strategies relevant for targeted microbial intervention.

### Recent advances of engineered bacteria for therapeutic applications [^d7ef5d87]. Molecular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Engineered bacterial systems have been widely utilized as versatile biotherapeutic platforms in disease intervention, yet their therapeutic efficacy remains limited. Recent advancements in synthetic biology have enabled the systematic deconstruction of bacteria through rational computational modeling and modular-genetic circuit design, thereby overcoming intrinsic functional limitations. These engineered bacteria represent a promising therapeutic strategy characterized by enhanced spatiotemporal precision, biosafety profiles, and scalable production. Moreover, the advent of sophisticated genetic engineering technologies has facilitated the expansion of bacterial therapeutic applications into new areas, including vaccine development and tumor-microenvironment modulation. Here, we systematically examine recent advances in the development and testing of engineered bacteria across different organs on the basis of tissue specificity. We further summarize the therapeutic roles of engineered bacteria in tumor treatment and metabolic-disorder management. Additionally, we outline advanced technologies for engineered bacterial development, emphasize their critical roles in optimizing the overall clinical efficacy of therapeutic agents after system-level optimization.

### Harnessing the microbiota for therapeutic purposes [^45f79f91]. American Journal of Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The myriads of microorganisms colonizing the human host (microbiome) affect virtually every aspect of its physiology in health and disease. The past decade witnessed unprecedented advances in microbiome research. The field rapidly transitioned from descriptive studies to deep mechanistic insights into host-microbiome interactions. This offers the opportunity for microbiome-targeted therapeutic manipulation. Currently, several strategies of microbiome-targeted interventions are intensively explored. Best evidence from human randomized clinical trials is available for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). However, patient eligibility as well as long-term efficacy and safety are not sufficiently defined. Therefore, there is currently no officially approved indication for FMT. Probiotics (live microorganisms) have long been discussed as a means to aid human health but have yielded varying results. Emerging techniques utilizing microbiota-targeted diets, small microbial molecules, recombinant bacteriophages, and precise control of strain abundance recently yielded promising results but require further investigation. The rapid technological progress of "omics" tools spurs advances in personalized medicine. Understanding and integration of interindividual microbiome variability holds potential to promote personalized preventive and therapeutic approaches. Emerging evidence points towards the microbiome as an important player having an impact on transplantation outcomes. Microbiome-targeted interventions have potential to aid against the many challenges faced by transplant recipients.

### The future of microbiome-based therapeutics in clinical applications [^0872c008]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The microbiome, a collection of microorganisms, their genomes, and the surrounding environmental conditions, is akin to a human organ, and knowledge is emerging on its role in human health and diseases. The influence of the microbiome in drug response has only been investigated in detail for the last 10 years. The human microbiome is a complex and highly dynamic system, which varies dramatically between individuals, yet there exists a common core microbiome that is heritable and can be transmitted to progeny. Here, we review the role of the human microbiome, which is now widely accepted as a major factor that drives the interpersonal variation in therapeutic response. We describe examples in which the microbiome modifies drug action. Despite its complexity, the microbiome can be readily altered, with the potential to increase the benefits and reduce the toxicity and side effects associated with pharmaceutical drugs. The potential of new microbiome-based strategies, such as fecal microbiota transplant, probiotics, and phage therapy, as promising medical therapeutics are outlined. We also suggest a combination reductionist and system-level approaches that could be applied to further investigate the role of microbiota in drug metabolism modulation of drug response. Finally, we emphasize the importance of combining microbiome and pharmacology studies as a novel means to treat disease and reduce side effects.

### Applications, challenges, and needs for employing synthetic biology beyond the lab [^fdff5728]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Synthetic biology holds great promise for addressing global needs. However, most current developments are not immediately translatable to 'outside-the-lab' scenarios that differ from controlled laboratory settings. Challenges include enabling long-term storage stability as well as operating in resource-limited and off-the-grid scenarios using autonomous function. Here we analyze recent advances in developing synthetic biological platforms for outside-the-lab scenarios with a focus on three major application spaces: bioproduction, biosensing, and closed-loop therapeutic and probiotic delivery. Across the Perspective, we highlight recent advances, areas for further development, possibilities for future applications, and the needs for innovation at the interface of other disciplines.

### Common principles and best practices for engineering microbiomes [^7ddd7966]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Despite broad scientific interest in harnessing the power of Earth's microbiomes, knowledge gaps hinder their efficient use for addressing urgent societal and environmental challenges. We argue that structuring research and technology developments around a design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle will advance microbiome engineering and spur new discoveries of the basic scientific principles governing microbiome function. In this Review, we present key elements of an iterative DBTL cycle for microbiome engineering, focusing on generalizable approaches, including top-down and bottom-up design processes, synthetic and self-assembled construction methods, and emerging tools to analyse microbiome function. These approaches can be used to harness microbiomes for broad applications related to medicine, agriculture, energy and the environment. We also discuss key challenges and opportunities of each approach and synthesize them into best practice guidelines for engineering microbiomes. We anticipate that adoption of a DBTL framework will rapidly advance microbiome-based biotechnologies aimed at improving human and animal health, agriculture and enabling the bioeconomy.

### Developing a new class of engineered live bacterial therapeutics to treat human diseases [^527bef40]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Testing strategies for engineered therapeutic organisms

The low cost and high throughput of DNA synthesis and assembly, as well as bioinformatics tools to identify potential targets and effectors, together enable the rapid and cost-effective generation of prototype engineered strains. However, the requirements for clinical development of engineered biotherapeutics, including diligent toxicology studies and adherence to regulatory guidelines, do not scale similarly and represent significant cost and effort for each candidate strain. Therefore, it will be advantageous to develop predictive testing strategies that can be applied in high throughput to characterize the function of engineered strains, to optimize potency, and to establish high confidence in translational potential prior to nomination of strains for clinical development. Figure 2 displays a schematic representation of how this strategy for development of engineered bacterial biotherapeutics could be implemented.

Fig. 2
Strategy for the development of engineered live bacterial therapeutic clinical candidates.

Schematic representation of a workflow for developing clinical candidate-quality engineered strains. The development workflow should incorporate technologies for optimizing strain potency, as well as predictive in vitro and in vivo assays, as well quantitative pharmacology models, to maximize translational potential for patient populations.

Environmental conditions, including pH, oxygen concentration, and nutrient availability, are major determinants of strain viability and metabolism, and the first line of testing for engineered biotherapeutic organisms could utilize predictive, high throughput in vitro models that recapitulate the physiological conditions of the target environment. For example, methods that simulate the conditions of the human upper gastrointestinal tract, such as the simulated human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME), are useful for characterizing the viability and function of engineered strains. These strains can be examined in isolation, or in the context of diverse microbial communities that represent the human gut microbiota. Moreover, these in vitro simulations can elucidate the kinetics of engineered circuit regulation and function over timescales that are relevant to human biology.

### Applications, challenges, and needs for employing synthetic biology beyond the lab [^ca5466d9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Overview of major challenges and requirements for deploying synthetic biology-based platforms in outside-the-lab settings.

Outside-the-lab scenarios have wide-ranging challenges and requirements for synthetic biology that are more demanding than typical laboratory settings. This figure provides a basic overview of major challenges and requirements associated with four major outside-the-lab settings including: space missions, developing nations, military missions, and agricultural settings. Challenges and requirements common to all settings are listed in the center, and those specific to certain outside-the-lab settings are listed in their respective boxes.

Both cell-based and cell-free system approaches have associated advantages and challenges with regard to ease of deployment in outside-the-lab situations. For instance, while whole-cell platforms are typically easier to mass-produce as well as consolidate multiple complex assays or reactions, there are challenges with long-term viability/stability, toxicity of the analytes or reaction components, and time delays due to the need for cell growth and analyte/nutrient transport. Cell-free platforms can address many of these associated challenges as they bypass the need for viable cells (and thus can be used to detect or produce compounds typically toxic to cells). This feature of an open reaction environment facilitates the manipulation of metabolism, transcription, and translation, for instance through exogenous addition of non-native substrates. The elimination of the requirement to sustain life also confers the ability to solely focus the system's resource utilization on a product or reaction of interest. However, significant batch-to-batch variability has been demonstrated across academic labs in the context of cell-free protein synthesis yields. Furthermore, the short cell-free reaction durations (typically on the order of hours), high reagent costs (particularly for energy sources and nucleotides), as well as difficulties in folding complex protein productspresent limitations in the application spaces for which cell-free platforms are currently viable.

We focus this Perspective on three major application spaces for the outside-the-lab deployment of synthetic biology: bioproduction, biosensing, and closed-loop living therapeutic and probiotic delivery. We open each major section with a brief intro into its applicability for outside-the-lab developments, analyze current work being done in that area, discuss areas where ongoing improvement is required to enable outside-the-lab deployment, and close with some potential scenarios to which outside-the-lab technology could be applicable.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on fermented foods [^6692a7a6]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

What processes are involved in making fermented foods

The outcome of a food or beverage fermentation process depends on the microorganism-led conversion of substrates into metabolites that support the aroma and taste, appearance, preservation, and nutritional properties of the finished product. These characteristics are time-dependent and determined by the microbiota as well as by a range of physicochemical parameters, including temperature, pH, water activity, oxidation–reduction potential and substrate availability. How these intrinsic and extrinsic environmental parameters are ultimately managed can have profound effects on the final properties and characteristics of fermented foods.

Systems and evolutionary biology approaches are now providing a rational basis for controlling or managing microbial diversity and community structure to achieve different fermentation processes. Although fermented foods have long been studied as model systems to understand microbial ecology, these latest efforts integrate broader ecological and evolutionary principles, including dispersal, selection, drift and diversification. The contribution of these principles to community assembly in fermented foods is outlined in Fig. 1. The use of these principles enables the control of fermentation microbiota in food independent of whether the fermentation is initiated with starter cultures, spontaneously or by inoculation from a prior successful fermentation of the same type (that is, back-slopping) (Fig. 1). The application of systems biology approaches combined with community reconstructions can identify specific microbial interactions that drive community composition, determine a genetic basis for particular microorganisms to live in a fermented food environmentand recreate the domestication processes that generated the industrial cultures used in fermentations. Ultimately, findings from those studies will help to address product variation and quality issues that occur even when starter cultures are used. They might also lead to the identification of biomarkers to monitor these foods throughout production and to predict nutritional and health-impacting qualities.

### Synthetic biology strategies for microbial biosynthesis of plant natural products [^bcca312e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Metabolic engineers endeavor to create a bio-based manufacturing industry using microbes to produce fuels, chemicals, and medicines. Plant natural products (PNPs) are historically challenging to produce and are ubiquitous in medicines, flavors, and fragrances. Engineering PNP pathways into new hosts requires finding or modifying a suitable host to accommodate the pathway, planning and implementing a biosynthetic route to the compound, and discovering or engineering enzymes for missing steps. In this review, we describe recent developments in metabolic engineering at the level of host, pathway, and enzyme, and discuss how the field is approaching ever more complex biosynthetic opportunities.

### The microbial food revolution [^fd61640d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Due to the high potential and varied applications of microbes in food, there have been numerous recent start-ups in this space, ranging from improving traditional fermentation to creating new products (Table 1). Development is still needed for technical advances and consumer acceptance but the field of single-cell proteins and engineered microbes in food has high potential, as will be explored in this review. This review aims to give an overview of the different applications of microorganisms in food ranging from traditional fermentation techniques to biotech applications of ingredient production (see Fig. 1). It covers the different novel applications of microbes in the food system as well as the role of synthetic biology in advancing this field. Finally, the obstacles and future perspectives will be considered.

### The promise and challenge of therapeutic genome editing [^0edffdd7]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

In the nearly seventy years since the discovery of the DNA double helix, technologies have advanced for determining, analyzing and altering genome sequences and gene expression patterns in cells and organisms. These molecular tools are the foundation of molecular biology, fueling the therapeutic industry by enabling profound advances in understanding the genetics of normal and disease traits. The ability to diagnose genetic diseases has developed rapidly with reductions in genome sequencing costs, extensive comparative analyses of human genome sequences and applications of high-throughput genomic screening. However, the dearth of therapies, much less cures, for genetic diseases has created a growing disconnect between diagnostics and treatments, underscoring the urgent need to develop therapeutic options. Mitigation or correction of disease-causing mutations is a tantalizing goal with tremendous potential to save and improve lives, representing a convergence of technical and medical advances that could eventually eradicate many genetic diseases.

Although methods for genome engineering and gene therapy have been of interest for decades, the development of engineered and programmable enzymes for DNA sequence manipulation has driven a biotechnological revolution –. In particular, fundamental research showing how clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins provide microbes with adaptive immunity has propelled transformative technological opportunities afforded by RNA-guided proteins. CRISPR-Cas9 and related enzymes have been used to manipulate the genomes of cultured cells, animals and plants, vastly accelerating the pace of fundamental research and enabling breakthroughs in agriculture and synthetic biology (reviewed in refs.–). Building on past gene therapy efforts, we are entering an era in which genome editing tools will be used to inactivate or correct disease-causing genes in patients, offering life-saving cures for people facing genetic disorders.

In this review I discuss therapeutic opportunities of genome editing, the ability to alter the DNA in cells and tissues in a site-specific manner. In addition to presenting current capabilities and limitations of the technology, I also describe what it will take to apply therapeutic genome editing in the real world. Comparison of somatic cell and germline editing highlights the importance of open public discussion about, and regulation of, this powerful technology.

### Synthetic biology strategies for microbial biosynthesis of plant natural products [^8c542cec]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Throughout this review, we have highlighted instances in which protein engineering was employed to solve challenges (e.g. low activity, product inhibition, and poor functioning in new host conditions) encountered during the reconstruction of metabolic pathways in heterologous hosts. As the design-build-test cycles associated with both metabolic engineering and protein engineering have been greatly accelerated in recent years, we expect to see protein engineering employed more frequently during the construction of heterologous metabolic pathways. Although these cycles have accelerated, engineering enzymes for altered small-molecule production still relies on screening, typically via LC or GC, rather than selection, resulting in a disproportionate amount of project time required for sample analysis, even for limited library sizes. One exciting means to engineer selections for small molecules is through the use of genetically-encoded biosensors linking concentration of a compound of interest to an output such as fluorescence-protein expression or cell fitness. Protein and RNA biosensors can be engineered to recognize a range of small molecules and control genetic output accordingly –, and early examples have demonstrated their application in enzyme evolution. As methods for developing biosensors improve we anticipate that they will be increasingly employed in enzyme engineering to explore wider ranges of sequence space more rapidly than traditional screening methods allow. Furthermore, we expect protein engineering to be used to solve a wider range of problems in the future — not only to adapt existing enzymes to their new conditions, but also to develop completely novel activities which fill in gaps in biosynthetic pathways or expand pathways in new directions for the production of novel PNP derivatives. This will allow existing and future heterologous biosynthetic pathways to be leveraged for the production of innumerable valuable and novel chemical entities. As metabolic engineering accelerates towards increasingly complex and tailored pathways in the coming years, we expect protein engineering to become an increasingly dominant force for the production of known and novel molecules on both the research and industrial scales.

Finally, we discuss how concurrent innovations in model systems and genetic tools have afforded opportunities to interrogate additional types of host-microbe relationships, such as those in the mammalian gut. Bringing these innovations together promises many exciting discoveries ahead.

### Physiological limitations and opportunities in microbial metabolic engineering [^35f0174b]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Metabolic engineering can have a pivotal role in increasing the environmental sustainability of the transportation and chemical manufacturing sectors. The field has already developed engineered microorganisms that are currently being used in industrial-scale processes. However, it is often challenging to achieve the titres, yields and productivities required for commercial viability. The efficiency of microbial chemical production is usually dependent on the physiological traits of the host organism, which may either impose limitations on engineered biosynthetic pathways or, conversely, boost their performance. In this Review, we discuss different aspects of microbial physiology that often create obstacles for metabolic engineering, and present solutions to overcome them. We also describe various instances in which natural or engineered physiological traits in host organisms have been harnessed to benefit engineered metabolic pathways for chemical production.

### Guidelines for biosafety laboratory competency: CDC and the association of public health laboratories [^38f37278]. MMWR Supplements (2011). Medium credibility.

Appendix A — terms used in these guidelines defines program components for laboratory biosafety and biosecurity. Administrative controls are changes in work procedures such as written safety policies, work practices, rules, supervision, schedules, and training with the goal of reducing the duration, frequency, and severity of exposures to hazardous materials or situations. ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) is terminology used in relation to radiation exposure levels, designating a work principle or philosophy intended to protect the worker from unnecessary exposure to workplace hazards. Barriers are any method used to separate workers, the outside community, and the environment from any hazardous material utilized and can include primary or secondary barriers. A biosafety manual is a laboratory manual developed and implemented by the employer that outlines procedures, equipment, personal protective equipment, and work practices that are capable of protecting employees from the health hazards presented by hazardous biologic materials used in that particular workplace, and biosafety records are records retained as required by regulatory and institutional policies to document training, surveillance, equipment maintenance and certification, accidents and exposure, inspections and audits, and inventories for hazardous agents. Biosecurity is the system to prevent unauthorized entry to laboratory areas, access to dangerous pathogens, or the unwarranted or accidental release of materials to the outside environment, and a biosecurity manual provides practical guidance related to personnel reliability and containment of biologic agents and toxins in the laboratory setting. Biosafety is an integrated approach to the management of potentially hazardous materials and activities and includes health, safety, security, environmental protection, emergency management, and community relations concerning activities involving potentially etiologic biologic materials and select agents, recombinant DNA, genetic research, and environmental bioremediation. Biosurety is a systematic approach and processes that minimize and manage physical, chemical, biologic, or radiologic exposures encountered with biotechnology activities and reduce or eliminate exposures, minimize risks, or mitigate the effects of exposures that cannot be prevented. A chemical hygiene plan is a written program developed and implemented by the employer that outlines procedures, equipment, personal protective equipment, and work practices to protect employees from health hazards presented by hazardous chemicals used in the workplace and that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, and chemical materials are substances with a distinct molecular composition that are produced by or used in chemical processes and can be present as solids, liquids, mists, vapors, or gases.

### Engineering biology applications for environmental solutions: potential and challenges [^db34c401]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Biosafety and biosecurity

Engineering processes for genetically modified microorganisms and their use in environmental biotechnology must be safe and trustworthy. Deploying engineered microbes in the environment needs thorough ecological risk assessments to prevent adverse effects on biodiversity. Strategies that enhance microbial efficiency must be balanced with safeguards to avoid unintended ecological consequences, such as disrupting native microbial communities or affecting higher trophic levels. The UK has strict legislation controlling the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Since 2011, only three consents for GMO release have been granted, with two pending. In the US, three agencies are responsible for regulating GMOs, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is likely that any microbes utilised for environmental solutions would be regulated by the latter two. In the European Union, the regulatory framework for GMOs is undergoing revisions to account for new genomic techniques (NGTs). The European Commission is considering updates that may differentiate between organisms produced by conventional genetic modification and those developed through precise gene-editing methods, potentially easing restrictions for certain environmental biotechnology applications.

The development of technologies for precise genetic modification of plants allowed for the passing of the Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Act in the UK in 2023, similar to legislation already in place in Argentina, the US, Australia and Japan. The act distinguishes GM from precision breeding in that the former may include genetic changes that could not have occurred naturally through traditional breeding. As such, the act covers precision-bred plants and may extend to animals engineered with gene-editing techniques. The availability of similar technology for microbes means such acts should be extended to cover the use in environmental biotechnology. Controlled environmental release of microbes engineered with antibiotic resistance genes is highly unlikely, as these may transfer to pathogenic species. However, technologies to precisely gene edit microbes mean it is possible to produce strains containing no additional foreign DNA. Selectable markers, including sacB, allow removal of antibiotic resistance genes. Increasing application of CRISPR-Cas to a broader range of microbes, coupled with Directed Accelerated Revision Technology, opens new opportunities and challenges for environmental synthetic biology biosafety and biosecurity –.

### Improving laboratory animal genetic reporting: LAG-R guidelines [^7740a052]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Assessing the genetic alterations

Genetic engineering was once restricted to a limited number of laboratory animal species, but as a result of advances in genome-editing techniques, there is now almost no limit to the species that can be genetically engineered. Standards for validation are evolving in parallel with the technology.

Different modes of alteration have differing potential for unwanted outcomes. For example, whereas random insertions are the aim of additive transgenesis, other engineering technologies aim to target a specific locus. Therefore, no universal recommendation can be made for the validation of a genetic modification. When a specific locus is targeted, validation should aim to characterize the genetic change at the region of interest. In all cases, genetic changes resulting from the engineering method should be assessed throughout the genome. As for maintaining genomic stability and quality, multiple crosses to the reference genetic background will mitigate the potential genome-wide impact of genetic engineering and should be reported (Table 1). For targeted events, both the sequence of the region of interest and the local structural integrity should be examined, the latter for exclusion of deletion, duplication, and inversion events. Supplementary Table 4 lists the various molecular assays that can be employed to interrogate these two aspects. Ideally, genetic quality would be regularly assayed, but importing or onboarding animals is the most important point at which to check the quality of newly acquired or generated models. A combination of methods that elucidate both the sequence and structure of the target locus and the genetic makeup of samples (Mendelian, mosaic, or chimeric animals) is required. The methods used will depend on a number of factors, such as the laboratory setup, whether a donor sequence was used in the mutagenesis process and the length of the modified segment. For example, point mutations are easily characterized using Sanger or next-generation short-read (NGS) sequencing, whereas verification of very large knock-ins is likely to require a long-read-based sequencing approach. The functional characterization of the products of mutated genes is also an important aspect of research quality but is outside the scope of these recommendations.

Future perspectives

This issue presents a series of review articles that illustrate the diverse applications of CRISPR–Cas9 in biomedical research. As this field continues to evolve, we are witnessing the early stages of a technological revolution with the potential for groundbreaking discoveries. Beyond basic biomedical research, CRISPR–Cas9 has far-reaching applications in medicine, agriculture and biotechnology. These applications, extensively reviewed elsewhere, include the treatment of genetic disorders, the development of disease-resistant crops and the engineering of microbial strains for industrial use. However, ethical and safety concerns remain, particularly regarding germline editing and unintended genetic consequences. As researchers continue to refine CRISPR–Cas9 technology, addressing these challenges will be crucial in ensuring its safe and effective application in diverse fields.

### Engineering biology applications for environmental solutions: potential and challenges [^e6eea3ae]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Governance challenges and changes

Innovations happen through convergence, which makes governance challenging and creates unanticipated regulatory gaps that need to be filled. Governance tools such as standards and regulatory sandboxes may address these gaps. Additionally, the governance of GMOs, which forms a large part of the relevant regulatory framework around engineering biology and its products, varies widely around the world. These policy and regulatory frameworks have, in recent times, started to undergo significant shifts in locations such as the UK, EU and USA (Table 1).

Table 1
Comparison of some GMO regulatory steps

Developers are challenging regulatory definitions for a range of reasons. Precise genetic engineering without introduction of foreign DNA, potentially limits risk. Prominent scientific and policy organisations have used these developments to argue for a differentiation between regulation designed to address Engineering Biology, and those introduced to control GMOs. Another key driver for this shift in regulation is that the GMO-relevant policy frameworks comprise several challenging features for developers. Both the UK and EU regulatory regimes contain both product- and process-focussed approaches, developed during the UK's membership of the EU. Product-focused elements imply that GMOs are governed differently depending on their status as a novel food, animal feed, or whether they are plants, animals, or microorganisms. Process-focussed regulation assesses GMOs via separate regulatory pathways, which are distinct from pathways for other 'risky' organisms, by virtue of being produced through genetic modification. There are also institutions and groups like advisory committees that only assess GM applications.

### Developing a new class of engineered live bacterial therapeutics to treat human diseases [^bf991d6d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Limitations for developing engineered bacterial therapies

Several challenges and limitations to the development of live engineered bacterial therapeutics are defined not by the tools of synthetic biology but rather by the lack of a clear mechanistic understanding of disease pathophysiology. A quantifiable relationship between the effectors expressed by an engineered organism and the underlying mechanisms of disease is necessary in order to engineer an optimal strain, but there remains a paucity of disease- and effector-related biomarkers to establish dose-response relationships, as well as target engagement at the site of action.

Currently, non-colonizing engineered organisms require frequent dosing, as the residence time of the strain is short in the body. However, it may be desirable to establish longer-term colonization by live bacterial therapeutics in the gastrointestinal tractto allow for continuous delivery of a therapeutic effector, thereby reducing the need for repeat dosing and enabling lower efficacious bacterial dose levels. This approach could also have the benefit of increasing patient receptivity and compliance, but biocontainment concerns would need to be addressed with regulatory authorities. Understanding the ecological niche occupied by live bacterial therapeutics and how to enhance colonization in the gut is an important area for continued investigation.

Finally, expansion of the tools for synthetic biology, to allow commensal organisms to be considered as chassis for engineered bacterial therapeutics, could enhance compatibility of the strain with the human host. Current bacterial synthetic biology tools are most advanced for strains of E. coli and Lactobacillus, but there are comparatively few engineering tools for the diverse set of strict anaerobes that reside in the colon.

### CRISPR-based genetic tools for the study of host-microbe interactions [^71ecd24b]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

CRISPR-based genetic tools have revolutionized our ability to interrogate and manipulate genes. These tools can be applied to both host and microbial cells, and their use can enhance our understanding of the dynamic nature of host-microbe interactions by uncovering their genetic underpinnings. As reviewed here, CRISPR-based tools are being used to explore the microbiome in an efficient, accurate, and high-throughput manner. By employing CRISPR screens, targeted genome editing, and recording systems to the study of host cells and microorganisms, we can gain critical insights into host defense mechanisms, potential vulnerabilities, and microbial pathogenesis, as well as essential or condition-specific genes involved in host-microbe interactions. Additionally, CRISPR-based genetic tools are being used in animal models to study host-microbe interactions in vivo. Recent advancements in CRISPR-derived technology can be combined with emerging techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, to examine the complex interactions between hosts and microbes, shedding light on the role of the microbiome in health and disease. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how these cutting-edge genetic tools are being used to investigate host-microbial systems, as well as their current limitations. Current research is likely to yield even more advanced genetic toolkits than those presently available, and these can serve researchers in identifying and exploring new therapeutic targets for diseases related to host-microbe interactions.

### Single strain control of microbial consortia [^e833be48]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Techniques for the assemblyand synthesisof DNA sequences have enabled the construction of complex, very large, even chromosome scale, synthetic biological systems. Recent efforts to systematically characterise genetic "parts", and develop software tools to produce DNA sequences from function specification, are enabling synthetic biological systems in which large numbers of regulatory proteins and promoters are involved. The production of each of these proteins sequesters resources that would otherwise be used by the host organism for growth and therefore leads to a reduction in growth rate. This provides a selective advantage to loss-of-function mutants that arise, suggesting that the functional period for the increasingly complex synthetic biological systems of the future will become ever more ephemeral.

Attempts have been made to minimise burden, make mutation deadly, or periodically displace mutating populations with a functioning population. Over the past decade, there have been attempts at division-of-labour, in which a system is split into subcomponents and distributed into specialised sub-populations of cells. This minimises the burden that is placed on individual cells which reduces, but does not remove, the selective advantage of loss-of-function mutations. In addition, the creation of synthetic communities allows the diversification and compartmentalisation of functions, modularisation, spatio-temporal control and mechanisms for biosafety.

Beyond the benefits for biotechnology applications of division-of-labour, synthetic biological systems will be increasingly applied in environments in which microbiomes are already present, such as for bio-therapeuticsor bio-remediation. In these settings, it is often undesirable to exterminate the resident species other than to remove pathogens. However, non-native species can find it difficult to persist long enough to be useful. The safety, efficacy, and societal acceptance of engineered bacteria in these environments rely on their predictable function, requiring predictable persistence and population dynamics. As an example, butyrate production by probiotic bacteria has been demonstrated to be beneficial for gut health, but over production of butyrate may be harmful. To sustain butyrate production within a healthy window a butyrate-producing bacterial strain would need to be maintained at a consistent level. Another example is in the use of biosensing strains to detect and report on disease states in vivo. Without knowledge of the size of the reporting population, it is impossible to distinguish between a weak signal from a large population and a strong signal from a small population.

### How science will help shape future clinical applications of probiotics [^008eedba]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The recent increased interest in probiotics among clinicians has many causes, primarily the concern about the limitations of the current armamentarium of pharmaceutical agents. Although probiotics have been used mostly in dietary supplements and foods to maintain health, scientific and clinical studies are recognizing the potential of some probiotics to be therapeutic in function. Scientific breakthroughs in understanding the source and composition of the human microbiota, the key nutritional factors that influence these microbes, and their immunomodulatory effects; the creation of disease-targeted recombinant strains; the isolation and characterization of signaling molecules that can modulate microbial biofilms and infectious processes; and advances in biomedical engineering that will provide new delivery systems for probiotics will shape the future of clinical applications of probiotics. In time and with rigorous documentation, some probiotics will likely find an important place in medical practice.

### Artificial selection of microbial communities: what have we learnt and how can we improve? [^5c58ea7a]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Microbial communities are capable of performing diverse functions with important bioindustrial and medical applications. One approach to improving community function is to breed new communities by artificially selecting for those displaying high community function ('community selection'). Importantly, community selection can improve the function of interest without needing to understand how the function arises, just like in classical artificial selection of individuals. However, experimental studies of community selection have had varied and largely limited success. Here, we review a conceptual framework to help foster an understanding of community selection and its associated challenges, and provide broad insights for designing effective selection strategies.

### Information about self… [^223f2cf1]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Gene therapy is the administration of genetic material to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene product or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use. Gene therapies offer the potential to treat diseases or conditions for which no or few treatments exist. They are being studied to treat cancer as well as genetic, infectious, and other diseases. FDA considers any use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in humans to be gene therapy. Gene therapy products are regulated by the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Clinical studies of gene therapy in humans require the submission of an investigational new drug application prior to their initiation in the United States, and marketing of a gene therapy product requires submission and approval of a biologics license application. Clinical trials of gene therapies can be found at www. clinicaltrials. gov. FDA has also approved certain gene therapy products.

FDA is aware that gene therapy products intended for self-administration and "do it yourself" kits to produce gene therapies for self-administration are being made available to the public. The sale of these products is against the law. FDA is concerned about the safety risks involved. Consumers are cautioned to make sure that any gene therapy they are considering has either been approved by FDA or is being studied under appropriate regulatory oversight.

### Synthetic biology 2020–2030: six commercially-available products that are changing our world [^d216decb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Cells as products

PROVEN, a biological nitrogen fertilizer for corn by Pivot Bio

Farmers must add nitrogen to crops to obtain high yields, most of which is produced using an industrial chemical process that consumes 1–2% of global energy. Bacteria that fix nitrogen from air are used as biological nitrogen fertilizers, but they are not compatible with cereal crops (corn, wheat, rice). Pivot Bio has created the first biological fertilizer for corn based on a γ-proteobacterium (KV137) that associates with corn roots and has the necessary genes to fix nitrogen. However, the genes are off when most needed, so synthetic biology was used to turn the genes on, which guided the remodeling of the KV137 genome. This bacterium is the active ingredient of the liquid fertilizer PROVEN that reduces the need for chemical fertilizer by 25 lbs/acre while increasing yields by 5.8 bushels. Unlike chemical fertilizer, rain does not leach the nitrogen into groundwater, a major source of pollution, or get released into the atmosphere as the powerful greenhouse gas N 2 O. In 2020, PROVEN was used on 250,000 acres, to be expanded to millions in 2021.

Soil, water, and animals harbor complex microbial communities into which there is the potential to add beneficial functions, or remove harmful ones, from these ecosystems –. Doing this by introducing a new strain can be challenging as the microbiome environment is poorly characterized, dynamic and ecologically rich. The best chasses to deliver a new function are from the target environment, as their ability to prosper in this context is non-trivially encoded in their genome; for example, Pseudomonas simiae requires 115 genes to optimally colonize a root. There are many potential chasses from which to choose: microbiomes can be occupied by thousands of species and tools to genetically modify undomesticated bacteria have improved. Advances in microfluidics, transformation, and genome editing make it easier to culture species and insert large DNA fragments. Principles from control theory can be applied to create genetic systems that do not require extensive re-tuning in a new chassis ("virtual machines"). Using these techniques, engineered plant-associated bacteria are being tested to increase crop yields, protect against pests, and increase the range of climates and soil conditions tolerated. More broadly, engineered probiotics can vaccinate chickens, protect honey bees against mites, stop malaria from surviving in mosquitos and as human treatments for infections, inflammation, metabolic disorders, and obesity.

### White paper on microbial anti-cancer therapy and prevention [^1795406c]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Where next?

Three issues that are essential for the development of microbial therapies are 1) finding the most appropriate predictive animal models, 2) development microbial therapies into cancer prophylactics, and 3) defining standard techniques for GMP manufacture.

Better animal models

Animal models are invaluable to the understanding of neoplastic development and to the evaluation of novel therapeutics. Each model has its benefits and deficiencies which should be carefully considered prior to the study. The implementation of multiple models over the course of the translational development path will aid in recapitulating as many aspects of human biology as possible. The choice of model should balance cost and efficiency with accurate representation of pathology and progression.

Allo- and xenotransplant models provide time-saving experimental protocols and less expensive animals than more complicated models. The use of immunocompromised xenotransplant models can provide information about the efficacy of oncolytic therapies, but are inappropriate for immunotherapies. Immune-deficient mice lack the ability to develop an adaptive memory response against both the microbe and the implanted tumor. Although allo-transplant models are immunocompetent, the speed of tumor growth in transplant models can prevent development of systemic or TME immune states present in human cancer.

Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) may more acurately recapitulate essential aspects of human cancer. Autochthonous tumors form in GEMMs from a single cell and grow with a time course similar to human cancer. This slower rate allows more natural structural maturation of the TME and more closely approximate the molecular and histopathological features of human neoplasms. The major limitations of autochthonous tumors in GEMMs are their cost, relatively low mutational load, and reduced clonal heterogeneity. Many GEMMs result in numerous transformed "cancer-seeding" niches, with uneven synchronies but relatively homogeneous genetics, which can make GEMMs hard to cure via microbial therapies.

Patient-derived xenografts (PDX), reconstitute the heterogeneity of the genomic aberrations seen in human cancers. This property overcomes the major limitation of GEMMs, but introduces additional limitations. In this model, primary human tumor tissue is introduced into "humanized" mice that have been reconstituted with a human hematopoietic system. This model can be cost prohibitive and has several limitations. There are inherent deficiencies of the human immune system when it is developed within a mouse, and tumor cells do not completely interact with host stromal and immune compartments in the local microenvironment. This system is also limited by the technical challenge of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching implanted tumors with the immune system of the reconstituted mice.

### Recent trends in industrial microbiology [^6fbfca12]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

The majority of current biotechnological applications are of microbial origin, and it is widely appreciated that the microbial world contains by far the greatest fraction of biodiversity in the biosphere. Because of their biotech impact, numerous efforts are being undertaken worldwide, with an ultimate goal to deliver new usable substances of microbial origin to the marketplace. However, the direct isolation of microbes always revealed that the majority are not amenable to be cultured and no representatives for many major microbial phyla have been thus far characterized. Therefore, the knowledge on new microbes and/or genomic information thereof, or from their communities, will pose an enormous potential to provide industry with novel products and processes based on the use of microbial resources, and contribute to and extend the basic mechanistic knowledge on the functioning of organisms. The present review highlights some examples and advances in the exploration of the genetic reservoir of (un)cultured microbes for industrial applications.

### Bacteriocin diversity, function, discovery and application as antimicrobials [^9045bdc1]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Bacteriocins are potent antimicrobial peptides that are produced by bacteria. Since their discovery almost a century ago, diverse peptides have been discovered and described, and some are currently used as commercial food preservatives. Many bacteriocins exhibit extensively post-translationally modified structures encoded on complex gene clusters, whereas others have simple linear structures. The molecular structures, mechanisms of action and resistance have been determined for a number of bacteriocins, but most remain incompletely characterized. These gene-encoded peptides are amenable to bioengineering strategies and heterologous expression, enabling metagenomic mining and modification of novel antimicrobials. The ongoing global antimicrobial resistance crisis demands that novel therapeutics be developed to combat infectious pathogens. New compounds that are target-specific and compatible with the resident microbiota would be valuable alternatives to current antimicrobials. As bacteriocins can be broad or narrow spectrum in nature, they are promising tools for this purpose. However, few bacteriocins have gone beyond preclinical trials and none is currently used therapeutically in humans. In this Review, we explore the broad diversity in bacteriocin structure and function, describe identification and optimization methods and discuss the reasons behind the lack of translation beyond the laboratory of these potentially valuable antimicrobials.

### Microbes and microbiomes in 2020 and beyond [^d9c77630]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Microbes have shaped the course of humanity, enabling basic biological discoveries such as the triplet nature of codons, yielding therapeutics including numerous antibiotics, and contributing to everyday life by serving us fermented products and as sources of enzymes for our laundry detergent. Recent studies have also revealed that our healthy existence is intricately reliant on microbes that inhabit our body and influence physiological functions in ways that we are only beginning to understand. Notably, the entirety of our knowledge of and from microbes is derived from 0.001% of microbial taxa predicted to exist on earth. With advances in technology that enable us to investigate microbes across time and space, humanity has the opportunity ' to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no one has gone before!' guided by reams of sequence information. In this commentary, we reflect on the impact of the burgeoning knowledge of microbes and microbiomes, and some of the tools required to explore this new world.

### Science and history of GMOs and other food modification… [^62d43cd3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2017: GMO apples are available for sale in the U. S. 2019: FDA completes consultation on first food from a genome edited plant. 2020: GMO pink pineapple is available to U. S. consumers. 2020: Application for GalSafe pig was approved. Identify To produce a GMO plant, scientists first identify what trait they want that plant to have, such as resistance to drought, herbicides, or insects. Then, they find an organism that already has that trait within its genes. In this example, scientists wanted to create insect-resistant corn to reduce the need to spray pesticides. They identified a gene in a soil bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis, which produces a natural insecticide that has been in use for many years in traditional and organic agriculture. Copy After scientists find the gene with the desired trait, they copy that gene. For Bt corn, they copied the gene in Bt that would provide the insect-resistance trait.

Insert Next, scientists use tools to insert the gene into the DNA of the plant. By inserting the Bt gene into the DNA of the corn plant, scientists gave it the insect resistance trait. This new trait does not change the other existing traits. Grow In the laboratory, scientists grow the new corn plant to ensure it has adopted the desired trait. If successful, scientists first grow and monitor the new corn plant in greenhouses and then in small field tests before moving it into larger field tests. GMO plants go through in-depth review and tests before they are ready to be sold to farmers. The entire process of bringing a GMO plant to the marketplace takes several years.

Scientists are developing new ways to create new varieties of crops and animals using a process called genome editing. These techniques can make changes more quickly and precisely than traditional breeding methods. There are several genome editing tools, such as CRISPR.

### Gene therapy for cancer: regulatory considerations for approval [^9b13ebaf]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

The rapidly changing field of gene therapy promises a number of innovative treatments for cancer patients. Advances in genetic modification of cancer and immune cells and the use of oncolytic viruses and bacteria have led to numerous clinical trials for cancer therapy, with several progressing to late-stage product development. At the time of this writing, no gene therapy product has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some of the key scientific and regulatory issues include understanding of gene transfer vector biology, safety of vectors in vitro and in animal models, optimum gene transfer, long-term persistence or integration in the host, shedding of a virus and ability to maintain transgene expression in vivo for a desired period of time. Because of the biological complexity of these products, the FDA encourages a flexible, data-driven approach for preclinical safety testing programs. The clinical trial design should be based on the unique features of gene therapy products, and should ensure the safety of enrolled subjects. This article focuses on regulatory considerations for gene therapy product development and also discusses guidance documents that have been published by the FDA.

### Emerging frontiers in microbiome engineering [^c408275c]. Trends in Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

The gut microbiome has a significant impact on health and disease and can actively contribute to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to fine-tune the microbial communities that constitute the microbiome, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of technological tools that may be used for microbiome engineering. These tools can enable investigators to define the parameters of a healthy microbiome and to determine how gut bacteria may contribute to the etiology of a variety of diseases. These tools may also allow us to explore the exciting prospect of developing targeted therapies and personalized treatments for microbiome-linked diseases.

### Engineering biology applications for environmental solutions: potential and challenges [^b5c9eafa]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Important technical challenges remain in terms of containment strategies and procedures and control measures (Fig. 3). An engineered organism that might be released into the environment accidentally, maliciously or with positive intent may bring risks that need to be managed. These include (a) the potential of the engineered organisms to "out-fitness" the native microbiome, (b) that the engineered organisms might not perform as intended with a phenotype that, while optimal to the target environment, might be detrimental in a different one, (c) that a trait of the engineered organism might unintentionally spread through the native microbiome by, e.g. horizontal gene transfer. To address these risks, biocontainment strategies have been proposed to improve biosafety of microorganisms. There are three main routes to genetically encoded biocontainment, meaning modified organisms are intrinsically bio-contained rather than physically contained within flasks, reactors, or other facilities. These strategies are sometimes referred to as genetic firewalls. One could bio-contain at the DNA replication level by modifying the DNA replication machinery of the organism to include some level of auxotrophy for some essential compound(s), which could be natural or new-to-nature nucleotides, or via the development and dependence on entirely orthogonal DNA replication enzymes or synthetic amino acids. At the transcriptional level, biocontainment strategies could involve synthetic gene circuits, orthogonal RNA polymerase-promoter pairs, and other regulatory interventions. At the translation level, strategies can focus on auxotrophy for natural amino acids, non-canonical amino acids and modified ribosomes. Although research on the use of non-canonical nucleotides and non-canonical amino acids is growing, there are many open questions and unexplored areas of potential synergy with biosecurity and biosafety. At the time of writing, there are many non-canonical nucleotides known, but only a few have been explicitly used as biosafety or biosecurity tools to enhance biocontainment and genetic firewalls. An overview of different potential biocontainment approaches is available through resources like the Biocontainment Finder which catalogues various strategies and their effectiveness.

### Low-cost anti-mycobacterial drug discovery using engineered E. coli [^db5c84b8]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Why perform a drug screen using an E. coli model rather than directly in the pathogen of interest? The TESEC approach offers low material costs, technical simplicity and base-level biosafety requirements. Synthetic biology tools developed for E. coli allow precise gene expression control, which our results indicate is important to minimize non-specific physiological stress. Efforts to make non-model microbes more genetically tractable may enable TESEC-like screening in other hosts. Alternately, genetic alterations of E. coli may allow it to more closely emulate the physiology or membrane structure of other microbes, leading to the convergence of the two approaches.

Beyond the scientific challenges, low-cost technologies like TESEC may help to alleviate the economic pressures that limit antibiotic development. Early-stage screening represents a significant fraction of total development costs due to high failure rates that require many screens to be launched for each advancing compound. While traditional pharma companies are increasingly unwilling to assume all of the financial risks, emerging economic models propose to distribute the costs and risks among academic laboratories, small- and medium- sized enterprises, charitable organizations and national research institutes in high-burden countries. TESEC strains can be freely replicated and exchanged, supporting highly multilateral projects characteristic of open scienceand open drug discovery.

### Applications, challenges, and needs for employing synthetic biology beyond the lab [^1c9c7a3b]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Beyond platforms aimed at delivery to the human microbiome, synthetic biology-enabled closed-loop delivery platforms are quickly being used to target the soil microbiome to help remote farm areas to both decreases nitrogenous fertilizer, which is both costly and poses environmental and health concerns, as evident by the projected 12.8% growth in the biofertilizer market (currently a $1 billion market) from 2020 to 2027, as well as reduce chemical pesticide application and improve plant health. Plant microbes have long been used to coat seeds to promote growth and reduce biotic/abiotic stresses. In this respect, just as the gut microbiome is a topic of strong recent interest, there is renewed interest in both understanding the interactions between plant roots and the rhizosphere, as well as manipulating processes such as nitrogen fixation.

In this vein, Fox et al.demonstrated the potential for in situ biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by inoculating major cereal crops with the nitrogen-fixing rhizobacterium Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 ×940, a strain developed to include a synthetic nitrogen fixation (nif) gene cluster from Pseudomonas stutzeri A 1501. While this approach increased crop biomass, there was a fitness burden on the bacterial cells resulting from constitutive nitrogenase activity. To address this issue, Ryu et al.engineered inducible nif clusters in the endophyte A. caulinodans to yield high levels of inducible nitrogenase activity without feedback ammonium repression. While further strain stability testing is needed, as well as allergenicity testing to determine whether the resulting crops yield additional allergies in humans, this work demonstrates the potential to link in situ production from synthetic organisms with crop production, especially aiding the crops yields for more remote or arid regions.

### Synthetic microbiology applications powered by light [^fd71ab1d]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Synthetic biology is a field of research in which molecular parts (mostly nucleic acids and proteins) are de novo created or modified and then used either alone or in combination to achieve new functions that can help solve the problems of our modern society. In synthetic microbiology, microbes are employed rather than other organisms or cell-free systems. Optogenetics, a relatively recently established technology that relies on the use of genetically encoded photosensitive proteins to control biological processes with high spatiotemporal precision, offers the possibility to empower synthetic (micro)biology applications due to the many positive features that light has as an external trigger. In this review, we describe recent synthetic microbiology applications that made use of optogenetics after briefly introducing the molecular mechanism behind some of the most employed optogenetic tools. We highlight the power and versatility of this technique, which opens up new horizons for both research and industry.

### Applications, challenges, and needs for employing synthetic biology beyond the lab [^04575f11]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Future applications for on-demand outside-the-lab production platforms

Platforms such as those described above could be used in remote military missions or space missions wherein possible medicines or supplements can be manufactured quickly in the event of a sudden disease outbreak. Similarly, on-demand production platforms could greatly benefit communities in developing nations, which often lack the infrastructure to store or access treatments. In both of these circumstances, portable, modular production platforms could be stored at room temperature and rehydrated/activated when a need for a certain compound arises, ideally to then yield fully purified products within a few days. In addition to therapeutic production, platforms for on-demand production of speciality chemicals can be used to minimize the need for inventory stockpiling in settings with limited storage capacity or infrastructure, enabling rapid production ramp-ups in response to oscillating market demands. Of particular interest for military missions, on-demand biofuel production platforms could obviate the need to transport and store large quantities of fuel on long missions. Platforms for continuous or on-demand production of small molecules can also be useful in terraforming operations as well as bioremediation. The development of living building materials, especially those that can develop and function using simple inputs such as sunlight, could facilitate the development of structural infrastructure in remote areas. In particular, these platforms could enable the production of buildings in outer space, in which transport of heavy building materials from earth is not feasible. The concept of living building materials can be extended further to the concepts of in situ production of protective coatings and anti-corrosion agents onto buildings, ships, and other parts of the built environment. Intentional coatings/doping of surfaces with microbes can be useful for in situ production of antimicrobial peptides, hydrophobic agents, or even anti-freeze proteins. These varied applications can help enhance material performance. Overall, ongoing development in whole-cell, cell-free, and biotic/abiotic interfacing production systems can have wide-ranging impacts on diverse outside-the-lab scenarios.

### Microbial engineering for the production of advanced biofuels [^3e43ba40]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Advanced biofuels produced by microorganisms have similar properties to petroleum-based fuels, and can 'drop in' to the existing transportation infrastructure. However, producing these biofuels in yields high enough to be useful requires the engineering of the microorganism's metabolism. Such engineering is not based on just one specific feedstock or host organism. Data-driven and synthetic-biology approaches can be used to optimize both the host and pathways to maximize fuel production. Despite some success, challenges still need to be met to move advanced biofuels towards commercialization, and to compete with more conventional fuels.

### Bottlenecks and opportunities for synthetic biology biosafety standards [^77172d29]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Outlook

The issue of biosafety standardization in synthetic biology has important implications at both the technical and policy levels. For the technical perspective, there is no shortage of existing and novel biocontainment strategies spanning physical, chemical and biological types of containment, ranging from well-documented, all the way to proof-of-concept tools. What is notable in reviewing this range is the surprising diversity and ingenuity of novel biosafety solutions. And although the conceptual tools are of course not yet standards, they allow the community to test and select specific technical solutions, thus laying the foundation for community approved novel biosafety standards.

From a policy perspective, the wealth of identified biosafety and biocontainment solutions provides clear coordinates for constructive intervention. The set of biosafety entries describe the laboratory side that defines the gap between academic research and real-world applications. In concert with the use of suitable metrics, we can foresee an effective, focused and measurable way forward by providing the means to carefully analyze and select promising biocontainment candidates from this set for further development and to improve their technology readiness levels.

### Applications, challenges, and needs for employing synthetic biology beyond the lab [^0adbc07d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Efforts using both whole-cell and cell-free technologies as well as synergistic developments with material science have demonstrated proof-of-concept studies of outside-the-lab molecule production applications. At their core, on-demand and continuous production functionalities entail the preservation and maintenance of metabolic activity in diverse settings. This requires field-deployable platforms to be genetically and environmentally stable, both while in long-term storage and metabolically active states. In addition, coupling of enhanced platform stability with user-friendly deployment technologies (such as integrated production and purification modules and liquid handling capacities) is needed for deployment in settings with limited or no access to resources or experienced personnel (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Design strategies for outside-the-lab deployment of synthetic biology systems.

This Perspective encompasses design strategies for deploying synthetic biology outside-the-lab, which vary based on the particular system type (whole-cell (blue), cell-free (red), biotic/abiotic interfacing (yellow)) and application space (bioproduction, biosensing, living therapeutics, and probiotic delivery; all in green). Outside-the-lab bioproduction design strategies include whole-cell liquid cultures, cell-free extract reactions, and encapsulation platforms interfacing living cells with materials, with widespread future applications including on-demand production of small molecules and biologic therapeutics as well as regenerable living building materials. Outside-the-lab biosensing design strategies include whole-cell engineered stress-resilient organisms and regenerable biofilms, cell-free CRISPR/Cas-based sensing platforms, as well as interfacing living cells with novel polymer and electronic systems, with broad future applications including continuous health and hazard monitoring. For bioproduction and biosensing, both whole-cell and cell-free systems are typically interfaced with deployment technologies, such as platform automation and microfluidic liquid handling, to facilitate outside-the-lab usability. Outside-the-lab closed-loop living therapeutics and probiotic delivery design strategies include whole-cell engineered microbes and mammalian cells compatible with the gut and soil microbiomes, as well as interfacing living cells with materials and magnetic systems, with future applications ranging from wound healing to continuous food production on earth and in space.

### Microbiome-based therapeutics [^ae2ae0d9]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Symbiotic microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract promote health by decreasing susceptibility to infection and enhancing resistance to a range of diseases. In this Review, we discuss our increasing understanding of the impact of the microbiome on the mammalian host and recent efforts to culture and characterize intestinal symbiotic microorganisms that produce or modify metabolites that impact disease pathology. Manipulation of the intestinal microbiome has great potential to reduce the incidence and/or severity of a wide range of human conditions and diseases, and the biomedical research community now faces the challenge of translating our understanding of the microbiome into beneficial medical therapies. Our increasing understanding of symbiotic microbial species and the application of ecological principles and machine learning are providing exciting opportunities for microbiome-based therapeutics to progress from faecal microbiota transplantation to the administration of precisely defined and clinically validated symbiotic microbial consortia that optimize disease resistance.

### Engineering and application of a biosensor with focused ligand specificity [^f55564a8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

For decades, microorganisms have been successfully transformed into cell factories for sustainable synthesis of industrially useful products in sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, food, feed, chemicals, detergents, and biofuels. With a growing world population and climate change creating a scarcity of water, land, and other vital resources, industrial biotechnology can make a decisive contribution toward meeting these global challenges. However, an envisioned bio-based future and sustainable economy requires development of efficient microbial production strains for a multitude of small molecules and applications. Whereas generation of genetic diversity (random or rational), as well as high-throughput genetic engineering of microorganisms does not pose a problem in this context, the rapid evaluation of a large number of clones is still challenging. In principle, each genetic variant must be cultivated and evaluated for its productivity individually, requiring costly and low-throughput methods, such as chromatography or mass spectrometry.

Biosensors have emerged as valuable tools for strain engineering and have changed the manner and speed, in which production strains are developed –. In general, biosensors detect changes in (intracellular) concentrations of small compounds and translate this input into a genetic output. Thus, biosensors can be used as molecular switches for rerouting microbial metabolism in response to the presence of a certain molecule. Alternatively, intracellular accumulation of a small molecule of interest can be converted into a machine-readable output, such as fluorescence. This allows for the rapid ultra-high-throughput screening of vast libraries of genetically diverse microorganisms at the single-cell level when combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), enabling the analysis of > 10 4 variants per second. The powerful FACS approach renders costly individual cultivation and evaluation of all clones in a given library unnecessary, and thus significantly speeds up design–build–test cycles. For such applications, RNA-based and transcription factor-based biosensors have been described in literature. In particular, transcription factor-based biosensors, comprised of a fluorescent protein-encoding reporter gene whose expression is controlled by a ligand-inducible transcriptional regulator (TR), have been successfully used for strain engineering in both, academic and industrial settings –.

### Applications, challenges, and needs for employing synthetic biology beyond the lab [^f041c917]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In terms of closed-loop plant-growth-promoting systems, platforms could be implemented in remote agricultural regions to promote crop health with limited need for human intervention or administration of chemical fertilizers or pesticides. In the future, stable microbe-based solutions could be applied via aerial application in a similar manner to current crop dusting to maximize efficiency and ease of use. Doing so would require additional research on the long-term stability and safety of microbe-based crop enhancing systems. Beyond terrestrial crops, synthetic biology-based production technologies could be applied to promote terraforming on Mars, in order to modify its current cold, dry, CO 2 -filled environment to make it habitable for Earth-based life forms. Synthetic biology can be used for terraforming approaches for inhabitance by current speciesor organisms found on drylands (as the closest case study for Mars' climate) as well as with genetically modified extremophile organisms with the highest propensity to survive in the current conditions on Mars.

Conclusion

Taken together, in the centuries since the time of van Leeuwenhoek, breakthrough discoveries have exemplified the transformative power of discovering new microbes, understanding their biology, and gaining access to their evolutionarily honed biocatalytic potential. Recognizing that this is just a tiny fraction of the abounding knowledge and resources that exist around us inspires curiosity and verve that in turn fosters endeavors in research. These efforts will certainly improve the quality of our lives and likely even sustain our survival as a species. The steady rise in multi-drug resistant superbugs and extended dry spell in the discovery of novel antibiotics is a major cause for concern. We hope that microbes will continue to yield novel antibiotics and inspire new synthetic solutions. Further, as we make progress in deciphering the mechanisms that commensal microbes use to influence its human host, we are certain to see a new wave of microbe-based therapeutics, including the potential use of bugs or "bug-derived products" as drugs. The promising impacts of new frontiers in microbiome research extend well beyond medicine. This has never been more evident as we rely on microbial cellulases for the production of biofuels, and realize that microbes are the largest players in the global carbon cycle with a tangible impact on global warming and the health of our planet. At a more fundamental level, we are innately curious about how the world around us works and the delightfully different manifestations of life. While it is certain that the next decade of microbiome research will reveal novel strategies in survival, unimagined metabolic pathways and intricate mechanisms in genetic regulation, it may well challenge more sacrosanct principles such as the central dogma. For instance, microbes did present us nonribosomal peptide synthesis as an alternate route to protein expression.

### A cross-systems primer for synthetic microbial communities [^2d4d3f6f]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The design and use of synthetic communities, or SynComs, is one of the most promising strategies for disentangling the complex interactions within microbial communities, and between these communities and their hosts. Compared to natural communities, these simplified consortia provide the opportunity to study ecological interactions at tractable scales, as well as facilitating reproducibility and fostering interdisciplinary science. However, the effective implementation of the SynCom approach requires several important considerations regarding the development and application of these model systems. There are also emerging ethical considerations when both designing and deploying SynComs in clinical, agricultural or environmental settings. Here we outline current best practices in developing, implementing and evaluating SynComs across different systems, including a focus on important ethical considerations for SynCom research.

### Bottlenecks and opportunities for synthetic biology biosafety standards [^e047ecb7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

What is the bottleneck for synthetic biology biosafety standards?

With the relevance of synthetic biology biosafety standards clearly visible, we wondered why there is such a lack of robust, standardized, and implemented biocontainment strategies. Is it because there are no technical solutions in the pipeline, or is it because existing promising solutions (which we may call proto-standards: technical solutions that could potentially become bona fide standards in the future) have not yet risen to this level? We set out to find evidence that either one or both of these gaps explain the somewhat puzzling lack of biocontainment standards. By identifying the key gap, we would be better placed to understand how to channel future efforts in the most effective way.

Searching peer-reviewed publications in Pubmed (keywords: containment, biosafety, synthetic biology, genetic engineering, CRISPR, gene flow, safeguard, kill switch, genetic code engineering, auxotrophy, cell free, chromosome free), we found 53 biosafety and biocontainment proto-standards with a potential to be applied in synthetic biology. Thematically the proto-standards are quite diverse, ranging from physical containmentto synthetic auxotrophy –, kill switches, semantic biocontainment such as genetic code engineering –, CRISPR safeguards such as gene drives, DNA barcoding, and chromosome free systems. Underlying all of these is an implied reliance on relevant metrics: what do we measure to assure the proto-standards are working as described, and what metrics are required to know when a proto-standard can become a standard?

Despite several review articles that provide good overviews of the strategies developed for biocontainment purposes. as far as we know, the list we put together represents the most comprehensive collection of biosafety and biocontainment solutions. Thus, we decided to structure the information, including its main feature, the microorganisms involved; its efficiency (measured or estimated by escape frequency), the tested or proposed application(s), the concern(s) or constraint(s), and the reference to make it easily usable and publicly available as an online Biocontainment Finder at.

### Synthetic microbial communities [^b28b0876]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Synthetic microbial communities as model systems

A promising way to overcome the difficulties associated with studying natural communities is to create artificial communities that retain the key features of their natural counterparts. These can then act as a model system to assess the role of key ecological, structural and functional features of communities in a controlled way. Here, we define a synthetic community as one that is created artificially by co-culturing of select (two or many) species under a (at least initially) well-defined media. While the individual species in such a community can be further engineered, we do not require presence of synthetically engineered species for a community to be defined as synthetic. Towards an increased understanding of natural communities, these synthetic communities can be utilised in two general ways, which we classify as function-based and interaction-based.

### Engineering biology applications for environmental solutions: potential and challenges [^8e8cc2f0]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Economic viability is crucial for scale-up, requiring process optimisation to reduce costs associated with energy, raw materials, and labour while maximising yield and productivity. Economic modelling can improve cost-efficiency predictions. Regulatory compliance is essential, ensuring processes meet standards for environmental safety, product quality, and operational practices. Achieving compliance is critical for market approval and the commercial success of the biotechnology solution. Beyond the bioreactor, deploying synthetic biology in environments where engineered organisms face competition requires additional consideration. In such systems, engineered microbes must maintain their functional roles amidst native microbial communities. Strategies include developing synthetic microbial consortia to outcompete natural populations, designing genetic constructs that enhance resilience and adaptability, and incorporating mechanisms for dynamic interaction with the environment. For instance, engineered microbes might be programmed to switch metabolic pathways in response to environmental signals, maintaining activity under fluctuating conditions. Genetic stability of strains is less important for biosensors and bioremediation utilised once or over short periods of time and could even be advantageous. For example, multiple studies have successfully used microbial consortia specialised for hydrocarbon degradation to bioremediate contaminated soil, and it is unlikely that such organisms persist in a hydrocarbon-deficient environment. Bioremediation of sites polluted with heavy metals or PFAS can restore habitats, facilitate the return of native species, and improve ecosystem health. Other challenges and opportunities in applied synthetic biology are discussed in Hanson and de Lorenzo, 2023.

Conclusions

In 2008, O'Malley et al. argued that "the fate of synthetic biology hinges on its capacity to deal with the complex properties of highly variable biological systems" and that "if synthetic biology's future is to be more than a modest contributor to "analytic" biology, it needs to develop broader engineering principles that do more than mimic those of non-biological engineering". One way of thinking about those engineering principles is that, through increasing knowledge about evolution and other biological processes, evolution could become central to new engineering paradigms. SCRaMbLE suggests an additional route: the work of devising these new paradigms might be shared with the microorganisms themselves.
