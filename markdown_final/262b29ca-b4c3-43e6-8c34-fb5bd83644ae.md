## Question

How often should you screen for kidney cancer using colonoscopy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often one should screen for kidney cancer using colonoscopy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what colonoscopy is actually indicated for. Then, I should verify what authoritative renal cell carcinoma (RCC) guidelines say about screening and diagnostic pathways. Next, I will examine whether any special populations change this (dialysis, transplant, hereditary syndromes). After that, I should double-check where colonoscopy and "kidney" might appear together in the literature to avoid misinterpretation. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, guideline-concordant answer and practical take-aways, ensuring I distinguish true screening from post-treatment surveillance or diagnostic workups.

> Let me first confirm colonoscopy's role. Colonoscopy is an endoscopic evaluation of the colon and rectum, used for colorectal cancer screening and polyp detection, not for kidney cancer detection; I need to ensure I am not overextending its indication into the retroperitoneal kidney, which is anatomically inaccessible to colonoscopy, and the major colorectal screening bodies frame its use solely for colorectal neoplasia, not RCC [^114V1mNd] [^111G7ELz] [^111gj73E].

> Wait, let me verify the RCC screening stance in current urologic and oncologic guidelines. The EAU explicitly advises against routine screening for primary RCC in any population, which immediately implies there is no endorsed "interval" for RCC screening in average-risk adults, and ESMO emphasizes cross-sectional imaging when RCC is suspected rather than any endoscopic test; colonoscopy is not part of the RCC diagnostic or surveillance algorithms in NCCN or AUA documents either, reinforcing that point [^111bWGvH] [^112vCKiS] [^115WZYp8] [^116oWWsA].

> I should confirm the recommended RCC diagnostic modalities. For suspected renal tumors, chest and abdominal multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT is standard for diagnosis and staging, with MRI preferred for venous involvement or when contrast/radiation avoidance is needed, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound or MRI for characterizing small or indeterminate renal masses; none of these pathways incorporate colonoscopy because the kidney lies outside the colonoscopic field of view [^116am2sF] [^115KESpG] [^116am2sF] [^112vCKiS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about special populations. In long-term dialysis patients, broad cancer screening often lacks survival benefit and cost-effectiveness; there is no recommendation to introduce colonoscopy for RCC detection in this group, which underscores that RCC screening, when considered at all, would rely on imaging, not colonoscopy [^1141qBq7].

> I need to check transplant-specific guidance next. Kidney transplant recipients should generally follow population colorectal screening guidance for colonoscopy, but transplant guidelines do not recommend RCC screening programs and certainly do not propose colonoscopy for RCC; where increased malignancy risk exists, the modality for renal evaluation remains imaging, not endoscopy [^116xE7gJ].

> But wait, what if the confusion arises from studies mentioning "kidney" and "colonoscopy" together? Indeed, in kidney transplant recipients, colonoscopy has been studied for colorectal cancer screening and stool-based test performance, but the target disease is colorectal neoplasia; these studies do not suggest colonoscopy detects RCC, and their use of "kidney" refers to the patient population, not the organ being screened [^1118cJZH] [^112oQnvy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could hereditary RCC syndromes change this? For suspected hereditary kidney cancer, guidelines recommend genetic evaluation and renal imaging–based surveillance, not colonoscopy; again, surveillance protocols pivot around MRI, CT, or ultrasound depending on syndrome and risk, and referral to genetics is emphasized rather than any endoscopic screening of the colon for RCC [^114dTnEz] [^115V6iNp] [^116HgWwW].

> Let me synthesize this carefully. Colonoscopy is not a screening test for kidney cancer, and no professional guideline recommends it for that purpose, so there is no recommended interval for "kidney-cancer screening with colonoscopy"; appropriate evaluation of the kidney relies on cross-sectional imaging when clinically indicated, and routine RCC screening of average-risk adults is not advised [^111bWGvH] [^112vCKiS].

> I should double-check that I clearly separate screening from surveillance. After treatment for localized RCC, follow-up uses scheduled chest imaging and abdominal CT/MRI per risk strata; for example, CUA suggests abdominal imaging at defined intervals for pT1 disease, and AUA recommends risk-adapted chest imaging for recurrence surveillance — these are surveillance protocols for known RCC, not screening, and still do not involve colonoscopy [^111C1KBa] [^116oWWsA].

> Practical take-away, confirmed: Do not use colonoscopy to screen for kidney cancer; there is no interval to recommend. Use CT or MRI when RCC is suspected or for risk-adapted post-treatment surveillance, and reserve colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening per age and risk in both the general population and transplant recipients, as appropriate [^111bWGvH] [^112vCKiS] [^114V1mNd].

Never use **colonoscopy** to screen for kidney cancer; colonoscopy is for colorectal cancer only [^114V1mNd]. Kidney cancer screening is **not recommended** for the general population [^111bWGvH], and when indicated for high-risk patients, it should be done with abdominal imaging (ultrasound, CT, or MRI) — not colonoscopy [^112vCKiS] [^111Hn9vf]. Colonoscopy does not visualize the kidneys and is not a valid or effective test for kidney cancer.

---

## Anatomical and physiological considerations

Colonoscopy examines the colon and rectum, not the kidneys, which are retroperitoneal and lie outside the colonoscope's field of view [^111gj73E]. Thus, colonoscopy **cannot detect** kidney tumors or lesions.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major organizations (EAU, AUA, NCCN) **do not recommend** colonoscopy for kidney cancer screening [^111bWGvH]. Instead, they call for **abdominal imaging** (ultrasound, CT, or MRI) when kidney cancer is suspected or in high-risk patients [^112vCKiS].

---

## Evidence regarding colonoscopy and kidney cancer detection

There is **no evidence** that colonoscopy detects kidney cancer. It is designed for colorectal lesions and cannot identify renal masses or abnormalities.

---

## Risks and limitations of colonoscopy for kidney cancer screening

Using colonoscopy for kidney cancer screening has **significant risks and limitations**:

- **Invasiveness and complications**: Colonoscopy is invasive and carries risks such as bleeding, perforation, and infection [^116ytqdG].

- **Ineffectiveness**: Colonoscopy cannot detect kidney cancer, making it an ineffective screening tool.

- **Unnecessary procedures**: Using colonoscopy for kidney cancer screening could lead to unnecessary procedures, increased healthcare costs, and patient anxiety.

---

## Appropriate screening methods for kidney cancer

When kidney cancer screening is indicated (e.g. high-risk patients), **appropriate methods** include:

- **Ultrasound**: Non-invasive and commonly used for initial evaluation of renal masses [^116am2sF].

- **CT scan**: Provides detailed imaging of renal structures and is commonly used for diagnosis and staging [^111Hn9vf].

- **MRI**: Useful for detailed imaging, particularly in patients with contraindications to CT contrast or radiation exposure [^115KESpG].

---

## Frequency of kidney cancer screening

Routine kidney cancer screening is **not recommended** for the general population [^111bWGvH]. For high-risk patients (e.g. hereditary syndromes or family history), individualized protocols using appropriate imaging modalities are recommended [^117PtQwG] [^111beUqi].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Colonoscopy is **not appropriate** for kidney cancer screening because it cannot visualize the kidneys. Use **abdominal imaging** (ultrasound, CT, or MRI) when screening is indicated in high-risk patients [^112vCKiS]. Routine kidney cancer screening is **not recommended** for the general population [^111bWGvH].

The incidence of most cancers increases with age. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in older adults after cardiovascular disease. Many common cancers in older adults can be prevented from occurring or can be identified at an early stage and treated effectively. The prevention and identification of cancer in its early stages, in an attempt to reduce discomfort and disability associated with advanced cancer and cancer treatment, is also a priority.

Overscreening for cancer in older adults can lead to unnecessary diagnostic testing and unnecessary treatment. Both older adults and their healthcare providers need guidance on the appropriate use of cancer prevention and screening interventions. This first of a two-part review addresses special considerations regarding cancer prevention for adults aged 65 and older. Screening decisions and the impact of limited life expectancy and an older adult's ability to tolerate cancer treatment are also addressed.

Guidance is provided regarding the prevention and early identification of lung, colorectal, bladder, and kidney cancer in older adults. The prevention of breast, prostate, and female urogenital cancers are addressed in Part 2.

### Considerations regarding the present and future roles of colonoscopy in colorectal cancer prevention [^111gj73E]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Effective and safe colonoscopy is essential to colorectal cancer prevention, regardless of the method used for colorectal cancer screening. The level of reduction in colorectal cancer incidence provided by colonoscopy and polypectomy varies widely in available studies. There are several mechanisms by which colonoscopy might fail to prevent colorectal cancer, and some of these mechanisms might be overcome by simple, currently available measures. Furthermore, advances in colonoscope technology could enhance the effectiveness of colonoscopy or render it less operator-dependent. The large market for colorectal cancer screening in the United States has spawned innovative noncolonoscopic technologies for colorectal cancer and polyp detection.

Because these technologies are diagnostic only, their overall impact on outcomes may ultimately be determined by whether they successfully increase adherence to screening — which should reduce colorectal cancer incidence — versus displace patients from colonoscopy screening, which potentially could increase colorectal cancer incidence. Additionally, factors such as cost-effectiveness and the extent to which they reduce colonoscopy complications will influence their impact. As these strategies emerge, monitoring their effects on adherence, cancer prevention, and procedural complications will be needed to optimize their roles relative to primary colonoscopy screening.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^113pmvQo]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

No studies have been published on the benefits or harms of screening kidney transplant recipients for colorectal cancer. Clinical practice guidelines for the care of kidney transplant recipients have suggested screening from the age of 50 years with faecal haemoglobin, and have proposed that this might be cost-effective. However, the prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia is unknown, as is the diagnostic accuracy of faecal haemoglobin testing in kidney transplant recipients. Importantly, faecal haemoglobin might be less specific for colorectal neoplasia due to the incidence of positive tests from colitis caused by cytomegalovirus infection or the toxicity of immunosuppressive drugs, for example. In addition, no data have been published on the safety of colonoscopy in transplant recipients, which might have increased harms due to the negative influence of immunosuppression.

To fill this gap in available data, we conducted a cross sectional study of prevalence and diagnostic accuracy in a kidney transplant recipient population. We used both faecal haemoglobin testing and colonoscopy to determine the prevalence and characteristics of advanced colorectal neoplasia and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a faecal immunochemical test for human haemoglobin (the index test) compared with colonoscopy (the reference standard) to detect advanced colorectal neoplasia in this population.

### Current evidence on screening for renal cancer [^111xtj22]. Nature Reviews Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) incidence is increasing worldwide. A high proportion of individuals are asymptomatic at diagnosis, but RCC has a high mortality rate. These facts suggest that RCC meets some of the criteria for screening, and a new analysis shows that screening for RCC could potentially be cost-effective. Targeted screening of high-risk individuals is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy to maximize the benefits and reduce the harms of screening. However, the size of the benefit of earlier initiation of treatment and the overall cost-effectiveness of screening remains uncertain. The optimal screening modality and target population are also unclear, and uncertainties exist regarding the specification and implementation of a screening program.

Before moving to a fully powered trial of screening, future work should focus on the following:

- **Developing and validating accurate risk prediction models**: This enhances early detection strategies for RCC.
- **Developing non-invasive methods of early RCC detection**: Innovations here could improve screening uptake.
- **Establishing the feasibility, public acceptability, and potential uptake of screening**: Understanding public perception is essential for successful implementation.
- **Establishing the prevalence of RCC and stage distribution of RCC detected by screening**: This informs the potential impact and adjustments needed in screening protocols.
- **Evaluating the potential harms of screening, including the impact on quality of life, overdiagnosis, and over-treatment**: Addressing these concerns is crucial to balance benefits and risks.

### Patients with colorectal and renal cell carcinoma diagnoses appear to be at risk for additional malignancies [^116HXYN3]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may be at risk for additional primary malignancies. A review of 101 patients with these conditions was performed. Forty-two percent of patients had one or more additional malignancies; none appeared to be associated with Lynch syndrome (LS). This suggests the need for careful follow-up in these patients and further study.

- **Background**: Small studies have demonstrated that patients who have both colorectal and renal cell carcinoma may be at increased risk for the development of additional malignancies. A possible genetic basis has been suggested. Our study describes the clinicopathologic features of these patients and clarifies the relationship of this cohort with Lynch syndrome (LS).

- **Methods**: Patients with primary CRC and RCC treated at our institution were identified for the study. Medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical information. Immunohistochemical staining for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was performed on tumor tissue when possible.

- **Results**: During the study period, 24,642 patients were treated for CRC and 7,366 were treated for RCC at our institution. One hundred seventy-nine patients had both diagnoses, with 101 patients eligible for inclusion in our cohort. Tumors were typically early stage. The two cancers presented as synchronous lesions in 42% of patients. Thirty-two patients had one additional primary malignancy, seven patients had two additional primary malignancies, and three patients had three additional primary malignancies. No patient had a family history that met the Amsterdam criteria.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^1118cJZH]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

Predictors of colorectal neoplasia:

In univariate logistic regression analyses, the only characteristic of participants that was significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer was age (unadjusted odds ratio 1.16 [95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.33] per year). We found similar results when we analyzed age in 5-year bands (odds ratio 2.07 [1.04 to 4.13] for every 5 years above 55). All patients diagnosed with cancer were male; none had undergone previous screening colonoscopy or had a family history of cancer. No identifiable characteristics of patients were significantly associated with advanced neoplasia.

Previous screening for colorectal cancer:

Seventy-eight (34%) participants had had one or more colonoscopies before enrollment in this study. A family history of colorectal cancer (odds ratio 2.37 [1.10 to 5.10]) and a history of rectal bleeding (2.00 [1.09 to 3.68]) were both associated with previous colonoscopy. We did not find any significant differences in the rates of advanced and non-advanced neoplasia between participants who had had previous screening in a post hoc analysis (data not shown).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for renal cell carcinoma, specifically with respect to surveillance for recurrence, the AUA 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining chest imaging. X-rays are advised for low-risk and intermediate-risk groups, while CT scans are recommended for high-risk and very high-risk groups in patients managed with surgery, either partial nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy, for a renal malignancy. Further chest imaging should be obtained after 5 years based on informed/shared decision-making discussions.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^112oQnvy]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

In a meta-analysis of studies screening with colonoscopy in the general population, which had a similar age, sex, and family history profile to this study, the prevalence of colorectal cancer was found to be 0.78% (0.13% to 2.97%), and that of advanced neoplasia was 5.0% (4.0% to 6.0%). The finding in this study of a prevalence estimate of advanced colorectal neoplasia at 13% (approximately twice the prevalence in the general population) is consistent with other studies showing a standardized incidence ratio of colorectal cancer of approximately two to three in transplant recipients. The increased risk of many types of cancers in transplant recipients has been associated with immunosuppression; however, we were not able to show an association between the duration or type of immunosuppression and neoplasia, perhaps due to the relatively small number of cases. Other, as yet unrecognized, factors may also contribute to the increased risk of colorectal cancer in these patients, and larger studies of transplant populations will be needed to determine these.

In line with clinical practice, we chose a faecal immunochemical test (Insure, Enterix Australia) as a means to screen for colorectal neoplasia. The sensitivity and predictive value of this test were poor for advanced colorectal neoplasia, although specificity was better. Although several stools were sampled, testing was performed on a one-off basis, and sensitivity could potentially be improved with serial testing.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: cross-sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^1122tAuT]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The performance characteristics of immunochemical faecal haemoglobin tests to identify advanced colorectal neoplasia have been variable across a range of studies. However, a large study of a one-off faecal haemoglobin versus colonoscopy found a sensitivity and specificity for advanced neoplasia of 27.1% and 95.1%, comparable to our findings. Faecal haemoglobin thus seems to have similar diagnostic accuracy to detect advanced colorectal neoplasia in both the transplant and general populations. Factors such as sub-clinical colitis from cytomegalovirus infection or drug toxicity, or potentially microscopic haematuria, which might be present in some transplant recipients, most commonly in the early post-transplant period, do not seem to have resulted in any significant adverse effect on specificity in this predominantly long-term post-transplant cohort.

In a case-control study of colonoscopy surveillance conducted as "usual care" in 315 kidney transplant recipients compared with 630 general population controls referred for screening colonoscopy (and therefore unlikely to be truly at "average risk" owing to referral bias), Park and colleagues reported prevalences of 7.0% for advanced adenomas and 1.9% for cancers. The odds ratios were 3.5 for advanced adenomas and 12.0 for cancers in screened transplant recipients. However, most of the transplant cohort was under 50 years old, and such a population would be expected to have low rates of advanced colorectal neoplasia, compared with the older population included in our study.

### Renal cell carcinoma: Diagnosis and management [^113YUWcG]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Kidney cancer is one of the ten most common cancers in the United States, with 90% attributed to renal cell carcinoma. Men, especially black men, are more likely to be affected than women. Renal masses, either cystic or solid, are best detected with contrast-enhanced, triple-phase computed tomography. Renal tumors are often detected incidentally during a computed tomography scan of the abdomen or chest ordered for unrelated symptoms. Hematuria serves as a warning sign that necessitates further evaluation and imaging, leading to a diagnosis and treatment plan.

Treatment options include active surveillance, ablation, nephron-sparing tumor excision, nephrectomy, and systemic treatment. **Predictors of a poor prognosis**: Poor functional status and metastasis are considered predictors of a poor prognosis. In recent years, new therapies have improved the prognosis for patients with metastatic disease. The family physician should be aware of risk factors, such as hypertension, tobacco use, exposure to trichloroethylene, and familial syndromes, as well as lifestyle and dietary modifications that may reduce risk.

### Screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer in long-term dialysis patients [^1141qBq7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Some have suggested that the American Cancer Society guidelines for cancer screening be applied to patients who are on long-term dialysis, using cancer screening as a means of assessing delivered preventive health care to patients with ESRD. However, cancer screening is effective only when it leads to a survival benefit (usually expressed as days of life saved) without incurring high financial costs. Certain cancers, such as human papillomavirus-associated cervical and tongue cancer and urologic malignancies, are more common among dialysis patients. Yet, because the expected remaining lifetime of most dialysis patients is shorter than the time lived to develop malignancy, cancer screening in dialysis patients as applied to the general population is ineffective from the perspective of both cost and survival benefit. Cancer screening in dialysis patients is, therefore, best provided in an individual patient-focused manner. The occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer, as well as issues related to cancer screening in dialysis patients, are discussed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for renal cell carcinoma, specifically in relation to genetic testing, the ESMO 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining genetic testing if patients exhibit any of the following:

- **Young age at diagnosis**: Genetic testing is advised for individuals diagnosed at an unusually young age.

- **Multiple or bilateral lesions**: Patients with multiple or bilateral tumors should undergo genetic evaluation.

- **Family history**: Those with first- or second-degree relatives with RCC should consider genetic testing.

- **Related disorders**: Patients with conditions known to predispose to RCC require genetic assessment.

- **Exhausted standard treatment options**: If standard treatments have been exhausted, genetic testing is recommended to explore additional therapeutic options.

### Genetic predisposition to renal cell carcinoma: Implications for counseling, testing, screening, and management [^117PtQwG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

In many individuals with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a hereditary cause may have contributed to cancer development. Various risk factors can suggest a genetic contribution, including early disease onset, multifocal or bilateral tumors, family history of RCC, and personal or family history of other benign or malignant tumors. Genetic counseling and understanding of the entire family tree are the first steps in evaluation and will determine if the patient should proceed with testing.

Methods of testing have changed to next-generation sequencing, which allows multiple genes to be evaluated together. The results of testing have significant implications for the individual and their family members. Screening of the kidney and at-risk organs ensues, with most algorithms focusing on early diagnosis and intervention to limit morbidity and mortality of disease manifestations.

A comprehensive clinical program that can offer multidisciplinary care is useful for several complex cancer syndromes. Management of localized and advanced hereditary kidney cancers may differ from the sporadic forms of RCC. Knowledge of the genetics can have significant management implications, and if necessary, genetic evaluation can be expedited to allow treatment decisions.

### Kidney cancer, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115WZYp8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

The NCCN guidelines for kidney cancer focus on the screening, diagnosis, staging, treatment, and management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Patients with relapsed or stage IV RCC typically undergo surgery and/or receive systemic therapy. Tumor histology and risk stratification of patients are important in therapy selection.

The NCCN guidelines for kidney cancer stratify treatment recommendations by histology; recommendations for first-line treatment of ccRCC are also stratified by risk group. To further guide management of advanced RCC, the NCCN Kidney Cancer Panel has categorized all systemic kidney cancer therapy regimens as "Preferred", "Other Recommended Regimens", or "Useful in Certain Circumstances". This categorization provides guidance on treatment selection by considering the efficacy, safety, evidence, and other factors that play a role in treatment selection. These factors include pre-existing comorbidities, the nature of the disease, and, in some cases, consideration of access to agents. This article summarizes surgical and systemic therapy recommendations for patients with relapsed or stage IV RCC.

### Kidney cancer, version 2.2017, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117MDbeL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

The NCCN guidelines for kidney cancer provide multidisciplinary recommendations for the clinical management of patients with clear cell and non-clear cell renal carcinoma. These guidelines are developed by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts from NCCN member institutions consisting of medical oncologists, hematologists and hematologic oncologists, radiation oncologists, urologists, and pathologists. The NCCN guidelines are in continuous evolution and are updated annually or sometimes more often if new high-quality clinical data become available in the interim.

### Von Hippel-Lindau disease: Update on pathogenesis and systemic aspects [^113jLHwm]. Retina (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to provide an update summarizing the biologic pathways governing von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease pathogenesis and to offer an overview of systemic manifestations as well as screening recommendations.

- **Methods**: A PubMed search of the English language literature was conducted using the following search terms: von Hippel-Lindau, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and VHL. From 6,696 publications, the most pertinent information related to the pathogenesis and systemic aspects of VHL disease was included in this review.

- **Results**: Von Hippel-Lindau disease is one of the most frequently occurring multisystem familial cancer syndromes. The disease results from a germline mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. Mutation in the VHL gene affects multiple cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix formation, apoptosis, and, in particular, the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia. As a result, there is widespread development of vascular tumors affecting the retina, brain, and spine, as well as a spectrum of benign and malignant tumors and/or cysts in visceral organs.

- **Conclusion**: The ophthalmologist plays a key role in VHL disease diagnosis, as retinal hemangioblastoma is frequently the first disease manifestation. Screening guidelines for individuals with known VHL disease, and those at risk of VHL disease, help to ensure early detection of potentially vision-threatening and life-threatening disease.

The objective is to provide an updated RCC guideline based on standardized methodology, including systematic reviews, which is robust, transparent, reproducible, and reliable.

- **Evidence acquisition**: For the 2019 update, evidence synthesis was undertaken based on a comprehensive and structured literature assessment for new and relevant data. Where necessary, formal systematic reviews adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were undertaken. Relevant databases, including Medline, Cochrane Libraries, trial registries, and conference proceedings, were searched until June 2018. This included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective or controlled studies with a comparator arm, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Where relevant, risk of bias (RoB) assessment, and qualitative and quantitative syntheses of the evidence were performed. The remaining sections of the document were updated following a structured literature assessment. Clinical practice recommendations were developed and issued based on the modified GRADE framework.

- **Evidence synthesis**: All chapters of the RCC guidelines were updated based on a structured literature assessment for prioritized topics based on the availability of robust data. For RCTs, RoB was low across studies. For most non-RCTs, clinical and methodological heterogeneity prevented pooling of data. The majority of included studies…

### EAU guidelines on renal cell carcinoma [^116am2sF]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for renal cell carcinoma, particularly with respect to imaging for staging, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend using non-ionizing modalities, including MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. These techniques are advised for further characterization of small renal masses, tumor thrombus, and differentiation of unclear renal masses if the results of contrast-enhanced CT are indeterminate.

### Canadian urological association guideline for followup of patients after treatment of non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^117GxX69]. Canadian Urological Association Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for renal cell carcinoma, specifically for surveillance of recurrence in high-risk cases (pT3/pT4 and N+ tumors), the CUA 2018 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Initial surveillance**: Obtain clinical assessment, blood biochemistry, and chest X-ray (CXR) or chest CT within 3 months after surgery.
- **Intermediate surveillance**: Continue with assessments every 6 months for 3 years.
- **Long-term surveillance**: Conduct assessments annually thereafter.
- **Advanced imaging**: Perform abdominal CT or MRI at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 60 months, and then every two years.

This structured regimen aims to optimize early detection and intervention for recurrence in high-risk patients.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^113d49Nq]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Study participants completed a faecal immunochemical test for human haemoglobin using the Enterix Insure kit (Enterix Australia). This test employs a brush to obtain each faecal sample, which is then applied to a testing card; two samples are taken from consecutive bowel motions. Participants completed a questionnaire concerning the timing of the samples, colorectal symptoms, and details of colorectal disease, previous screening, and family history. A history of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drug use and allergies was also sought. Additional data were provided by reviewing medical records.

De-identified test cards were forwarded to a central laboratory (Enterix Australia, Sydney) for processing using methods previously described. Study investigators had no involvement in the laboratory analysis of samples. After faecal testing, and regardless of the result, participants were referred for colonoscopy. To reduce the risk of dropout, participants were informed of faecal haemoglobin results before colonoscopy only upon request. Interventional gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons performed colonoscopies; due to ethical clearance requirements, we could not blind physicians to the faecal haemoglobin result. In the three major participating centres, specific colonoscopy lists were arranged for this study; colonoscopies were also done in regional hospitals and in the private sector.

Participants received bowel preparation according to the endoscopist's preference — usually a polyethylene glycol-based preparation alone or in combination with a sodium picosulfate-based preparation.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross-sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^114jWsCm]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

From information available from hospital units' records, we estimated that the population of eligible transplant recipients in South Australia would be approximately 400 patients. Between 1 June 2008 and 30 June 2011, 360 patients were assessed for initial eligibility and invited to participate.

- **Flow of participants through study**: Patients' progression through the study is demonstrated, along with the primary outcome of advanced colorectal neoplasia. Patients who were excluded or withdrew from the study are noted. In total, 229 patients completed the study, a completion rate of 64%. Twenty-six (10%) patients who completed faecal haemoglobin testing did not have colonoscopy and were excluded from analysis. Outcomes for all participants were finalized according to available results as of 31 October 2011. Characteristics of study participants are also detailed, with numbers (percentages) provided unless stated otherwise.

Details of previous colorectal history and screening are elaborated, presenting a comprehensive view of the participants' backgrounds.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^111PSZbW]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

We recorded faecal immunochemical test results as either positive or negative for the presence of human haemoglobin, as reported by the laboratory. Retrieved colorectal biopsy samples were sent to local laboratories for histological examination. Pathologists were not aware of the faecal haemoglobin result or that patients were enrolled in this study. The final diagnosis for each participant was determined on the basis of combined results of colonoscopy and histology of retrieved or resected specimens.

To calculate the prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia, as well as other pathology, we classified participants on the basis of their most advanced lesion. For example, we classified a participant with an adenoma with high grade dysplastic changes and a tubular adenoma as having an advanced adenoma with high grade dysplasia. We defined advanced colorectal neoplasia, in accordance with previous studies, as the presence of either cancer or an advanced adenoma — a tubular adenoma of at least 10 mm diameter, a villous or tubulovillous adenoma (that is, at least 25% villous), or an adenoma with high grade dysplasia. We diagnosed and staged cancer according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer's classification.

We used Stata software version 11.2 for all statistical analyses. Data is expressed as raw values and percentages for categorical data and as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for continuous data. Student's t test was used to compare continuous variables and logistic regression for categorical variables.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^116Nf97E]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

This was a population-based, cross-sectional study of prevalent kidney transplant recipients, conducted through outpatient clinics at metropolitan and regional hospitals in the state of South Australia. Three tertiary renal services, which collectively care for all adult transplant recipients in the state, were involved. The study took place between June 2008 and October 2011.

Kidney transplant recipients were eligible if they were aged over 50 years, were at least six months post-transplant, and gave written informed consent. Patients were invited to participate during the course of routine follow-up in the outpatient clinic. Exclusion criteria included previous colorectal cancer or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, colonoscopy within 12 months, symptoms or signs suggestive of colorectal cancer or other significant non-neoplastic colorectal disease, known or suspected familial colorectal cancer syndrome (patients with cancer in one close relative were eligible), chronic inflammatory bowel disease, unstable cardiopulmonary disease, bleeding disorder or unacceptable risk of bleeding, terminal illness or life-threatening malignancy, or a failed transplant and subsequent return to dialysis.

Patients with a history of previous rectal bleeding attributed to hemorrhoids or other non-neoplastic disease were eligible provided bleeding was not an active problem. Patients receiving anticoagulant treatment were also eligible, provided they could discontinue this treatment at the time of screening colonoscopy if requested by the endoscopist.

### Public attitudes towards screening for kidney cancer: An online survey [^115KT58e]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The study explored cancer beliefs and attitudes towards kidney cancer screening. The majority of participants held positive views about cancer outcomes, with only 6.7% expressing cancer fatalism. Attitudes towards screening were also favorable; 91.8% of participants agreed that screening could reduce the risk of dying from kidney cancer.

- **General cancer beliefs and attitudes**: The beliefs were compiled using published coefficients to form the "Beliefs about cancer outcomes".

- **Intention to attend screening**: Intention to take up screening was high, with over 90% indicating they would accept screening invitations through urine testing, blood testing, or low-dose CT combined with lung screening. Lower intention levels were reported for ultrasound (89.5%) and low-dose CT of the kidneys alone (78.8%).

- **Burden, inconvenience, and worry associated with screening tests**: A detailed examination revealed varied responses across five screening modalities. A majority of participants (771, 76%) reported willingness to attend screening by all five modalities. Conversely, 20 participants (2%) stated they would not attend screening by any method, and 28 participants (27%) were willing to attend only the combined lung and kidney CT scan, excluding other methods. Notably, 217 participants (21%) would not attend a CT scan of the kidneys alone, though 181 of these indicated willingness to participate in other forms of screening.

### Familial renal carcinoma: Clinical evaluation, clinical subtypes and risk of renal carcinoma development [^114npn2Y]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Familial renal carcinoma is defined as families with two or more individuals with renal cell carcinoma, without evidence of known hereditary renal carcinoma syndromes. To better characterize this familial cancer, we reviewed renal carcinoma families evaluated at the National Cancer Institute between 1990 and 2004 to identify distinctive features of these families. We also determined the risk of renal carcinoma in first-degree relatives of affected family members.

- **Materials and methods**: We evaluated 141 at-risk asymptomatic relatives of affected individuals from 50 families, each with two or more members with renal carcinoma. Histology slides of renal tumors from affected family members were reviewed. At-risk members from renal carcinoma families were screened for occult renal neoplasms using renal ultrasound and computerized tomography. DNA from select families was tested for germline mutations of known renal carcinoma genes when clinically indicated, and constitutional cytogenetic analysis was performed to search for germline chromosome alterations.

- **Results**: Familial renal carcinoma families could be subdivided into subtypes based on tumor multiplicity and renal tumor histology. Of 141 at-risk members of renal carcinoma families screened for occult renal tumors, two were found to have occult renal tumors, identified as renal oncocytoma and a solid tumor that was not resected, respectively. No histologically confirmed occult renal carcinomas were detected in at-risk family members. Several families previously classified as having familial renal carcinoma were found on further evaluation.

### Public attitudes towards screening for kidney cancer: An online survey [^112hweiP]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Kidney cancer is often asymptomatic, leading to proposals for a screening program. The views of the public towards introducing a new screening program for kidney cancer are unknown. The aim of this study was to explore attitudes towards kidney cancer screening and factors influencing the intention to attend a future screening program.

- **Methods**: We conducted an online population-based survey of 1021 adults aged 45–77 years. The main outcome measure was the intention to attend four possible screening tests (urine, blood, ultrasound scan, low-dose CT) as well as extended low-dose CT scans within lung cancer screening programs. We used multivariable regression to examine the association between intention and each screening test.

- **Results**: Most participants stated that they would be 'very likely' or 'likely' to undergo each of the screening tests [urine test: n = 961 (94.1%); blood test: n = 922 (90.3%); ultrasound: n = 914 (89.5%); low-dose CT: n = 804 (78.8%); lung CT: n = 962 (95.2%)]. Greater intention to attend was associated with higher general cancer worry and less perceived burden/inconvenience about the screening tests. Less worry about the screening test was also associated with a higher intention to attend, but only in those with low general cancer worry (cancer worry scale ≤ 5). Compared with the intention to take up screening with a urine test, participants were half as likely to report that they intended to undergo blood [OR 0.56 (0.43–0.73)] or ultrasound [OR 0.50 (0.38–0.67)] testing, and half as likely again to report that they intended to take part in a screening program.

### Management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: ASCO guideline [^116brb7N]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for renal cell carcinoma, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ASCO 2022 guidelines recommend comparing tissue acquired outside the site of the primary disease to the primary histology for the diagnosis of metastatic clear cell RCC. Assess common markers of clear cell RCC, including paired box gene 8 and carbonic anhydrase IX.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^114ugFoi]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The primary outcomes of this study highlight significant findings. Overall, 29 (13%, 95% confidence interval 9% to 18%) participants were diagnosed with advanced colorectal neoplasia. Specifically, 4 (2%) participants were found to have high-grade dysplastic lesions, and 5 (2%) had previously undiagnosed colorectal cancer. Additional details regarding the cancer's location, staging, and surgical procedures performed can be found in the appendix. Notably, one participant with a large adenoma underwent a right hemicolectomy.

Faecal haemoglobin was positive in 28 (12%, 8% to 17%) participants. However, statistical analysis showed no significant association between faecal haemoglobin results and prior history of visible rectal bleeding or the usage of aspirin, warfarin, or clopidogrel (P > 0.05). Additionally, of the five participants diagnosed with cancer, three had positive faecal haemoglobin tests, indicating a sensitivity of 60%. Importantly, the location of the tumour did not correlate with the faecal haemoglobin result (P > 0.05).

Among the 72 participants identified with neoplasia, 18 (8%) had two or more adenomas, and seven (3%) had three or more adenomas. The study's findings, summarized in Tables 4 and 5, illustrate the diagnostic accuracy of faecal haemoglobin testing in detecting advanced colorectal neoplasia.

### Serum amino acid levels as a biomarker for renal cell carcinoma [^115u4V2T]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Prognosis in renal cell carcinoma is dependent on tumor stage at presentation, with significant differences in survival between early and late-stage disease. Currently, to our knowledge, no screening tests or biomarkers have been identified for the early detection of kidney cancer. Therefore, we investigated whether serum amino acid profiles are a potentially useful biomarker in patients with renal cell carcinoma.

- **Materials and methods**: The concentrations of 26 amino acids were determined in serum taken preoperatively from 189 patients with renal cell carcinoma and from 104 age- and sex-matched controls.

- **Results**: Statistically significant changes were observed in patient levels of 15 amino acids, with 13 being decreased and 2 being increased. A logistic regression model using 8 amino acids, including cysteine, ornithine, histidine, leucine, tyrosine, proline, valine, and lysine, was created to distinguish cases from controls. A receiver operator curve based on this model had an area under the curve of 0.81. This same model also had predictive value in terms of overall survival and tumor recurrence in patients with renal cell carcinoma.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that serum amino acid levels may be useful as a screening tool for identifying individuals with renal cell carcinoma and predicting outcomes.

### Final recommendation statement: Colorectal cancer: Screening [^116ytqdG]. JAMA (2021). Low credibility.

Harms from screening colonoscopy have been reported in 67 observational studies (n = 27,746,669). Rates of serious bleeding events and perforations are lower with screening colonoscopy than with colonoscopy performed following positive stool-based screening test results. This difference is presumably due to fewer biopsies and adenoma removals. The rate is 14.6 major bleeding events per 10,000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 9.4–19.9; 20 studies; n = 5,172,508) and 3.1 perforations per 10,000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 2.3–4.0; 26 studies; n = 5,272,600). If sedation is used during colonoscopy, cardiopulmonary events may rarely occur, although the precise frequency of occurrence is not known. No higher risk of other serious harms with screening colonoscopy was observed in 4 cohort studies.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^117XoPtc]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Short and medium-term outcomes for transplant recipients are excellent, but mortality is significant in the long term, largely due to malignancy. Transplant recipients need long-term immunosuppressive treatment to prevent graft loss, which has been associated with an increased risk of cancer. Although the greatest relative increase in risk has been seen for non-melanoma skin cancers and cancers associated with viral infection, the risk of more common solid organ cancers, including colorectal cancer, is also significantly increased, with a relative risk compared with the general population of between two and three. Transplant recipients who develop colorectal cancer are often younger at diagnosis and have poorer outcomes than those in the general population.

Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide; major risk factors include age, male sex, and a family history, and survival is strongly linked to the stage of cancer at diagnosis. In the general population, screening with guaiac-based faecal occult blood tests followed by colonoscopy in individuals with a positive test has been shown to reduce colorectal cancer mortality. Faecal occult blood screening is recommended for individuals over the age of 50 with average risk. Immunochemical tests specific for faecal human haemoglobin have largely replaced the guaiac-based tests used in early trials, based on improved acceptability and performance.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^116xE7gJ]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 7.1 – KTR: Screening for cancer

We suggest that the organization of screening for neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) take into account the following:

- **Screening recommendations**: Screening should be similar to the general population for cervical, breast, colon, and prostate cancer (2C). Screening is not recommended for renal cell carcinoma (2C).
- **Patient education**: Education both pre- and post-transplantation is essential (1C). Patients should be aware of malignancy risk and encouraged to report symptoms which may represent de novo malignancy, such as breast or testicular lumps (2D).
- **Skin surveillance**: Conducted by a healthcare professional at least biannually up to 5 years post-transplant and annually from 5 years post-transplant (2C).
- **Patients with cirrhosis**: Should undergo an annual hepatic ultrasound and determination of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (2C).

- **Audit measure**: Proportion of patients having screening procedures for neoplasia at the annual review clinic.

- **Rationale**: The merits of any screening program must balance the individual's risk of developing the disease, their prognosis if detected, and the risk of harm from screening. Screening should be individualized and reflect co-morbidities and other competing risks, such as vascular disease. Some authors have advocated more frequent screening, like annual cervical screening, but there is little evidence to support these assertions. Thus, screening should follow the pattern in the general population for most common cancers. The national cancer screening protocols are described on the NHS Cancer Screening Programme (NHSCSP) website. Patient education regarding neoplasia should be undertaken pre-transplant, with reinforcement thereafter.

Each January, the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, including guideline updates, emerging issues relevant to cancer screening, and a summary of data on cancer screening rates for U.S. adults. In 2005, there were no updates to ACS guidelines. In this issue of the journal, we summarize the guidelines, discuss recent evidence and policy changes with implications for cancer screening, and provide an update on the most recent data pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening by age, sex, and insurance status from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

### Lynch syndrome: A primer for urologists and panel recommendations [^113KwWWw]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, is a common genetic disease. The predisposition of patients with Lynch syndrome to urological cancer, particularly upper tract urothelial carcinoma, is underappreciated. Urologists may be involved in several aspects of care involving Lynch syndrome, including identifying undiagnosed patients, surveillance of those with established Lynch syndrome or screening family members, in addition to treating patients with Lynch syndrome in whom upper tract urothelial carcinoma develops. We sought to increase awareness in the urological community about Lynch syndrome and provide some guidance where little currently exists.

Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement, we reviewed the available published literature and guidelines from 1998 to 2014 on Lynch syndrome and its association with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Recommendations based on the literature and the consensus of expert opinion are provided.

No randomized or prospective study has been done to evaluate Lynch syndrome in the setting of urological cancer. All data were based on retrospective studies. Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by germline mutations in four mismatch repair genes, leading to the accumulation of DNA errors in microsatellite regions. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma develops in up to 28% of patients with known Lynch syndrome. The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is established by clinical criteria and tumor tissue testing.

### Renal transplantation in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome: Should we [^111iEhh2]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Young patients with multifocal, bilateral kidney cancers should be screened for inherited renal cancer syndromes. Although the management of the tumor invariably involves nephrectomy (nephron-sparing or not) with or without adjuvant therapies, the patient prognosis is greatly influenced by the inherited syndrome. Hereditary kidney cancer syndromes follow different clinical courses and respond differently to therapy compared to sporadic kidney cancers. Most importantly, the molecular diagnosis may reveal other genetic underpinnings of the disease and its phenotypic variations, alerting clinicians to potential clinical consequences. Molecular identification of involved genes will be determinant for predicting future clinical implications, assessing the risk of recurrence, and evaluating the patient's candidacy for renal transplant.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^114QkjUi]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

In a population of asymptomatic kidney transplant recipients aged over 50 years at otherwise average risk for colorectal cancer, we found a high prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia (13%, 95% confidence interval 9% to 18%). To detect one case of advanced colorectal neoplasia, 8 (6 to 12) participants needed to have colonoscopy. Faecal haemoglobin had poor sensitivity (31.0%, 15.3% to 50.8%) but reasonable specificity (90.5%, 85.6% to 94.2%) for advanced neoplasia. If colonoscopy had been performed only following a positive faecal haemoglobin test (as in population screening), three participants would have needed colonoscopy for each identified case, but 20 (69%) cases of advanced neoplasia would have gone undetected.

This study is the first to evaluate faecal haemoglobin screening for colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients, and it remains the only study of colonoscopy surveillance among transplant recipients of a similar age and risk profile to the general population included in trials of screening that showed reduced mortality from colorectal cancer. This study presents prospective data on the safety of routine surveillance colonoscopy in kidney transplant recipients and demonstrates that this can be implemented without adverse effects in a population with a wide range of renal function and comorbidity.

In the medical management of renal cell carcinoma, specifically regarding advanced or metastatic disease and clear cell RCC first-line therapy, the ESMO 2024 guidelines recommend offering sunitinib (I, A), pazopanib (I, A), or tivozanib (II, B) as alternatives to first-line PD-1-targeted combinations when immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is contraindicated or unavailable. Consider offering cabozantinib as an alternative for IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk patients who cannot receive first-line PD-1-targeted therapy.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^116twvPo]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Objective: To investigate whether screening kidney transplant recipients aged over 50 years for colorectal cancer with a faecal immunochemical test for haemoglobin might be justified. This was done by determining the prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia and evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of faecal haemoglobin testing compared with colonoscopy in a population of kidney transplant recipients at otherwise average risk.

Design: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study with the index test of faecal haemoglobin and reference standard of colonoscopy.

Setting: Outpatient clinics in metropolitan and regional hospitals in South Australia.

Participants: 229 kidney transplant recipients aged 50 years and over, who were at least 6 months (mean 9.0 years, SD 8.4 years) post-transplant and otherwise at average risk of colorectal cancer, completed the study between June 2008 and October 2011.

Interventions: Faecal immunochemical testing (Enterix Insure) for human haemoglobin, followed by colonoscopy with histological evaluation of retrieved samples.

Main outcome measures: Prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia, defined as an adenoma at least 10 mm in diameter, villous features, high grade dysplasia, or colorectal cancer; sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of faecal haemoglobin testing for advanced neoplasia compared with colonoscopy.

Results: Advanced colorectal neoplasia was found in 29 (13%, 95% confidence interval 9% to 18%) participants, including 2% (n = 4) with high grade dysplasia and 2% (n = 5) with colorectal cancer. Faecal testing for haemoglobin was positive in…

### "Incidentally" discovered Von Hippel Lindau disease: an emerging clinical phenotype [^115bzvxk]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Increasing accessibility to genetic screening for cancer risk can lead to earlier surveillance and prevention; however, this also brings the challenge of incidental identification of germline pathogenic gene variants. Here, we report a single institution case series of six otherwise healthy individuals with "incidental" Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease. These patients were found to have pathogenic germline variants in the VHL gene after undergoing genetic testing for other purposes (five for familial breast cancer risk and one to determine ancestry), but they exhibited no VHL disease-associated tumors.

The penetrance and expressivity of such incidental variants are not currently known, and therefore, no surveillance guidelines exist. Nevertheless, the historical association of these variants with high disease penetrance compels us to currently recommend active surveillance of their carriers, with annual imaging of the brain, spine, and abdomen.

### The impact of the new who classification of renal cell carcinoma on the diagnosis of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma [^115bNpLz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

Advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying hereditary tumor predisposition further emphasize the importance of timely and accurate diagnosis of these conditions. Meanwhile, the diagnostic pathology of kidney tumors, aside from the classic histological subtypes, can be very challenging. This underlines the critical role of the interface between specialties, beginning with the detailed collection of medical and family histories, as well as the assessment of possible HLRCC-associated extrarenal manifestations at RCC diagnosis.

Unclear or complex cases from a morphological point of view, as well as cases where proper classification requires additional stainings not established in all pathology institutes, should be referred for consultation with departments possessing sufficient expertise. Diagnosis of FH-deficient RCC should prompt the offer of genetic counseling and genetic testing to identify cases with causative pathogenic germline variants in FH, as an alternative to biallelic somatic inactivation. The majority of FH variants characterized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic are missense variants, which are more likely to retain positive FH IHC staining compared to the less frequent truncating variants or large deletions. Additionally, as more clinical information becomes available, it is anticipated that many variants of uncertain significance will be reclassified with greater accuracy.

Confirmation of the diagnosis through genetic testing has substantial consequences for the RCC patient.

### Cancer screening in renal transplant recipients: What is the evidence [^115pUvXc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Increased cancer risk is well established in the renal transplant population. Little, however, is known about the benefits and harms of cancer screening, treatment effectiveness, and the overall cancer prognosis in renal transplant recipients. In this study, we critically appraised guidelines for cancer screening in the renal transplant and general populations using standard criteria for an evidence-based screening program. Guidelines were included when they were applied to adult participants, had objectives specific to cancer screening, and were written in English.

Recommendations for breast and colorectal cancer screening in the general population were supported by evidence of cancer-specific mortality benefits from randomized controlled trials of cancer screening. Convincing evidence from observational studies demonstrated that population cervical cancer screening is effective. Additionally, test performance of mammography, fecal occult blood testing, and Pap smear was accurate. Population breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening also appeared to be cost-effective in the general population.

On the contrary, recommendations for cancer screening in renal transplant recipients were entirely extrapolated from data in the general population. Studies in the general population have led to the development of cancer screening guidelines in transplant recipients. Due to increased cancer risk, differences in diagnostic test performance, competing risks for deaths from causes such as cardiovascular disease, and reduced overall life expectancies, the validity of their recommendations becomes questionable.

### Public attitudes towards screening for kidney cancer: An online survey [^114UuX89]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to assess public attitudes towards potential kidney cancer screening programmes. Participants expressed high levels of intention to take up kidney cancer screening, both within kidney cancer-specific screening programmes and in conjunction with lung cancer screening. This was despite over 80% knowing nothing about kidney cancer or having only heard of the condition before participating in the survey.

There were significant differences in intention between screening modalities, with a preference for urine testing or low-dose CT combined with lung cancer screening over a blood test, ultrasound scan, or low-dose CT alone. Participants were also more likely to intend to undergo screening if they reported higher general cancer worry or less burden/inconvenience associated with the screening test, and if they had symptoms of kidney cancer or their GP had recommended screening. Less worry about the screening test was also associated with higher intention to attend, but only in those with lower general cancer worry. For those with higher general cancer worry, the general worry about cancer appeared to dominate any worry associated with the screening test itself.

The overall positive attitude towards a screening programme for kidney cancer mirrors the general enthusiasm for cancer screening seen in population-based surveys and findings of a similar study on a potential lung cancer screening programme. In that study, over 90% of survey respondents believed that there was benefit to lung cancer screening.

### Public attitudes towards screening for kidney cancer: An online survey [^115pEvRC]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Kidney cancer is often asymptomatic, leading to proposals for a screening programme. The views of the public towards introducing a new screening programme for kidney cancer are unknown. The aim of this study was to explore attitudes towards kidney cancer screening and factors influencing intention to attend a future screening programme.

- **Methods**: We conducted an online population-based survey of 1021 adults aged 45–77 years. The main outcome measure was the intention to attend four possible screening tests (urine, blood, ultrasound scan, low-dose CT) as well as extended low-dose CT scans within lung cancer screening programmes. We used multivariable regression to examine the association between intention and each screening test.

- **Results**: Most participants stated that they would be 'very likely' or 'likely' to undergo each of the screening tests [urine test: n = 961 (94.1%); blood test: n = 922 (90.3%); ultrasound: n = 914 (89.5%); low-dose CT: n = 804 (78.8%); lung CT: n = 962 (95.2%)]. Greater intention to attend was associated with higher general cancer worry and less perceived burden/inconvenience about the screening tests. Less worry about the screening test was also associated with higher intention to attend, but only in those with low general cancer worry (cancer worry scale ≤ 5). Compared with intention to take up screening with a urine test, participants were half as likely to report that they intended to undergo blood [OR 0.56 (0.43–0.73)] or ultrasound [OR 0.50 (0.38–0.67)] testing.

### EAU guidelines on renal cell carcinoma: the 2010 update [^116ANn7j]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The European Association of Urology Guideline Group for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has prepared these guidelines to help clinicians assess the evidence-based management of RCC and incorporate the present recommendations into daily clinical practice.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The recommendations provided in the updated guidelines are based on a thorough review of available RCC guidelines and review articles, combined with a systematic literature search using Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

- **Evidence synthesis**: A number of recent prospective randomized studies concerning RCC are now available with a high level of evidence, whereas earlier publications were based on retrospective analyses, including some larger multicenter validation studies, meta-analyses, and well-designed controlled studies.

- **Conclusions**: These guidelines contain information for the treatment of an individual patient according to a standardized general approach. Updated recommendations concerning diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up can improve the clinical handling of patients with RCC.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^113reVGn]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

A potential criticism of our study is that we used a cross-sectional design without a control (that is, non-transplant recipient) group, which limits our ability to directly compare the findings with the general population. However, this study was designed to fill the gaps in evidence for screening of transplant recipients, rather than as a comparison with the general population. Conducting a large-scale colonoscopy study in a comparable general population cohort truly at average risk would have been ethically and logistically difficult, given established screening guidelines and that a population screening programme has been implemented in Australia, similar to those in other countries. Such a study of participants at average risk selected from the general population by using electoral (voter) registrations encountered difficulties in recruiting participants to have colonoscopy and produced limited results.

This study has limited statistical power to identify predictors of risk of neoplasia or to compare subgroups due to the relatively small number of cases of advanced colorectal neoplasia and cancer. Larger studies in multiple jurisdictions would be needed to identify sufficient cases to investigate the relations between factors such as immunosuppressive drugs or other transplant-related factors and colorectal neoplasia.

Although laboratory analysis of faecal samples and the interpretation of histology were done in a blinded fashion, we were not able to blind endoscopists to the faecal haemoglobin result because of ethical requirements to ensure that abnormal test results were addressed appropriately.

### Public attitudes towards screening for kidney cancer: An online survey [^112mJvVF]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Among the participants in our study, we found that there is an overall enthusiasm for kidney cancer screening, with high potential uptake rates. Our findings also highlight the influence of screening modality, with particular support for urine and low-dose CT combined with lung cancer screening, as well as individual-level and system-level factors that are likely to influence uptake. Together, these findings support ongoing research into kidney cancer screening tests and the potential for combining kidney cancer screening with existing or new screening programmes.

### Screening for colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia in kidney transplant recipients: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study of faecal immunochemical testing for haemoglobin and colonoscopy [^114Ta1aJ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Quality of faecal haemoglobin testing and colonoscopy

Faecal testing cards were developed a mean of 9.0 (SD 4.4) days after the first faecal sample was taken and 8.2 (4.1) days after the second sample. The median interval between the faecal haemoglobin result and completion of colonoscopy was 82 (interquartile range 47–135) days.

The caecum was intubated in 219 (96%) of 229 screening colonoscopies. Colonoscopy was incomplete in six cases; screening was supplemented with computed tomographic colonography (n = 2), barium enema (n = 2), or a repeat colonoscopy 12 months later (n = 1). One participant did not attend the appointment for computed tomographic colonography. In four cases, no data on caecal intubation were recorded in the colonoscopy report.

Views of the bowel were considered at least partly reduced because of suboptimal preparation in 36 (16%) participants. Seven (3%) participants returned for a follow-up colonoscopy with improved preparation and had composite results from both procedures included in study outcomes.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® post-treatment follow-up and active surveillance of clinically localized renal cell carcinoma: 2021 update [^116HgWwW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for most malignant renal tumors and is considered the most lethal of all urologic cancers. For follow-up of patients with treated or untreated RCC and those with neoplasms suspected to represent RCC, radiologic imaging is the most valuable component of surveillance, as most relapses and cases of disease progression are identified when patients are asymptomatic. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the various imaging modalities for the detection of disease, recurrence, or progression is essential when planning follow-up regimens.

This document addresses the appropriate imaging examinations for asymptomatic patients who have been treated for RCC with radical or partial nephrectomy or ablative therapies. It also discusses the appropriate imaging examinations for asymptomatic patients with localized biopsy-proven or suspected RCC undergoing active surveillance.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence.
