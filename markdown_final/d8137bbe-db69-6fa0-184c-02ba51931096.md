## Question

Is coffee okay for diverticulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether coffee is okay for diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between diverticulosis and diverticulitis. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about diet during acute diverticulitis. Next, I will examine the direct evidence on coffee and diverticular disease. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility and any indirect signals. Finally, I will synthesize practical, phase-specific recommendations and note any caveats or exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Diverticulosis refers to the presence of colonic diverticula, which are usually asymptomatic, whereas diverticulitis is inflammation of those diverticula and requires acute management and dietary caution during the flare, so coffee advice differs by phase and symptoms [^b80db9c7] [^d7aa92e7].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance for acute diverticulitis. The AGA advises a clear liquid diet during the acute phase of uncomplicated diverticulitis and advancing the diet as symptoms improve, which implies avoiding solid foods — including coffee — initially, even though coffee itself is not singled out as prohibited [^622dd2f9] [^b9d03454] [^d591a3d2]. Wait, let me verify whether any major guideline explicitly restricts coffee; I don't see a directive to avoid coffee per se, but the practical implication is that if you're on clear liquids, coffee (unless black and without additives) wouldn't fit, and advancing to low residue then regular diet should be symptom-guided [^b9d03454] [^d591a3d2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic disease. I need to check the evidence base for coffee and diverticular disease outside acute flares. Multiple cross-sectional studies and a large prospective cohort from Turkey found no association between coffee consumption (total, instant, Turkish, or brewed) and colonic diverticulosis, and daily caffeine intake was not related to diverticulosis either, which supports the idea that coffee is not a risk factor for diverticula formation [^28afeb81] [^460f7ff8] [^32dc514d]. Let me consider causality; a Mendelian randomization analysis using FinnGen and UK Biobank data likewise found no causal association between coffee consumption and diverticular disease, which strengthens the inference that coffee is not harmful in this context [^de882eb6].

> I should double-check whether any study hints at benefit. In univariate analyses, instant coffee and higher daily caffeine intake were associated with lower odds of diverticulosis, but these associations attenuated or became non-significant after multivariable adjustment, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret them as protective effects rather than confounded observations [^d017776e] [^460f7ff8]. But wait, what if coffee's motility effects help symptomatic patients? Observational data don't establish benefit, so I shouldn't claim that coffee prevents diverticulitis or complications based on these studies alone [^28afeb81] [^de882eb6].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility. Coffee can increase colonic motility and has anti-inflammatory properties via polyphenols, which theoretically could modulate factors relevant to diverticular disease, but there is no direct clinical evidence that these effects translate into reduced diverticulitis risk or symptom control in patients with established disease, so I need to avoid over-extrapolation from bench to bedside [^706cda03] [^28afeb81]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought coffee's motility might reduce recurrence, but I should correct that: while motility effects are real, we lack interventional data showing coffee reduces diverticulitis recurrence, so I shouldn't ascribe clinical benefit where it's unproven [^28afeb81] [^de882eb6].

> I will now examine indirect signals that could inform tolerance. Coffee has been studied in postoperative colorectal settings and appears safe and may hasten return of bowel function, which suggests gastrointestinal tolerability in recovery contexts, but this is not diverticulitis-specific and should be interpreted as supportive of general GI safety rather than evidence of benefit in diverticulitis [^880079b8] [^c7a0e0a9]. Let me reconsider whether this changes acute-phase advice; it does not, because postoperative protocols and acute diverticulitis diets have different goals and constraints, so I should not generalize across scenarios [^b9d03454].

> Now, I should synthesize practical guidance by phase. During an acute diverticulitis flare, prioritize a clear liquid diet for comfort and advance slowly; coffee is not prohibited outright, but it is not part of clear liquids and should generally be avoided until you advance to low residue and then regular diet as pain, fever, and tolerance allow, with black coffee without cream or sweeteners acceptable if it doesn't worsen symptoms during the transition [^622dd2f9] [^b9d03454] [^d591a3d2]. In remission or for chronic diverticular disease, current evidence indicates coffee is acceptable and not a risk factor; if it causes individual bloating, reflux, or loose stools, tailor intake, but there is no guideline-based reason to restrict it otherwise [^28afeb81] [^460f7ff8] [^de882eb6].

> But wait, what about additives and preparation? I need to ensure I'm not overlooking irritants. Cream, artificial sweeteners, and very high caffeine loads can provoke GI symptoms in some patients, so if symptoms recur, a trial of black coffee or decaffeinated coffee may help distinguish caffeine effects from other components, even though the disease-level data don't show harm from coffee itself [^28afeb81] [^460f7ff8]. I should confirm that this is framed as individualized troubleshooting rather than a blanket restriction, which aligns with modern, permissive dietary counseling in diverticular disease [^d1d60b8b].

> Finally, I should integrate this with broader prevention advice so the recommendation is balanced. Emphasize a high-quality diet with adequate fiber, normal BMI, physical activity, smoking cessation, and avoidance of frequent NSAIDs for secondary prevention, and reassure patients that nuts, seeds, popcorn, and coffee do not need to be eliminated for diverticulitis prevention, which aligns with contemporary guideline shifts away from outdated restrictions [^c2e86095] [^d1d60b8b] [^513b1632].

Coffee is **generally safe** for patients with diverticulitis when consumed in moderation. There is **no evidence** that coffee increases the risk of diverticulitis or its complications, and it does not need to be avoided during recovery. However, during acute episodes, limit intake if it causes gastrointestinal irritation or discomfort, and resume normal intake once symptoms resolve. Individual tolerance varies, so adjust intake based on personal response.

---

## Evidence on coffee consumption and diverticulitis

Several studies have examined the relationship between coffee consumption and diverticular disease, including diverticulitis:

- **No increased risk**: Observational studies have consistently found no association between coffee consumption and an increased risk of diverticulitis or its complications [^d034c859] [^de882eb6].

- **Neutral effect**: A large prospective cohort study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found that coffee consumption was not associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding [^d034c859].

- **Mendelian randomization**: A Mendelian randomization study using genetic data from large cohorts found no causal association between coffee consumption and diverticular disease, further supporting its safety [^de882eb6].

---

## Physiological effects of coffee relevant to diverticulitis

Coffee has several physiological effects that may influence gastrointestinal function, particularly in patients with diverticulitis:

- **Increased colonic motility**: Coffee stimulates colonic motility, which may theoretically increase intraluminal pressure and potentially exacerbate symptoms in patients with acute diverticulitis. However, clinical evidence does not support a significant exacerbation of symptoms or complications due to coffee consumption [^706cda03].

- **Anti-inflammatory properties**: Coffee contains polyphenols and other bioactive compounds with anti-inflammatory properties, which may theoretically benefit patients with chronic or recurrent diverticulitis. However, clinical evidence supporting a therapeutic benefit is limited [^706cda03].

- **Gastrointestinal irritation**: In some individuals, coffee may cause gastrointestinal irritation, acid reflux, or diarrhea, which could exacerbate symptoms during acute episodes of diverticulitis. Individual tolerance varies, and patients should adjust their intake accordingly [^1ce4d3b1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **do not specifically advise against coffee consumption** in patients with diverticulitis. General dietary recommendations focus on maintaining a high-fiber diet, adequate hydration, and avoiding foods that individually exacerbate symptoms. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) emphasize individualized dietary counseling and do not list coffee as a restricted beverage [^c2e86095] [^801b2589].

---

## Practical recommendations for coffee consumption in diverticulitis

Based on current evidence and expert opinion, the following practical recommendations can be made:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation regarding coffee consumption** |
|-|-|
| Acute diverticulitis episode | Limit or avoid coffee if it causes gastrointestinal irritation or exacerbates symptoms. Resume normal intake once symptoms resolve. |
| Chronic or recurrent diverticulitis | Coffee can be consumed in moderation, provided it does not individually exacerbate symptoms. Monitor tolerance and adjust intake accordingly. |
| Post-recovery period | Coffee can be safely consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet. Individual tolerance should guide intake. |

---

## Potential risks and considerations

While coffee is generally safe, patients with diverticulitis should consider the following:

- **Individual tolerance**: Some patients may experience gastrointestinal irritation, acid reflux, or diarrhea with coffee. Individual tolerance should guide intake.

- **Additives**: Cream, sugar, or artificial sweeteners added to coffee may cause gastrointestinal symptoms in some individuals. Consider black coffee or minimal additives if symptoms occur.

- **Hydration**: Coffee has mild diuretic properties, so patients should ensure adequate hydration, particularly during acute episodes of diverticulitis.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Coffee is **generally safe** for patients with diverticulitis when consumed in moderation. There is **no evidence** linking coffee to an increased risk of diverticulitis or its complications. During acute episodes, limit intake if it causes irritation, and resume normal intake once symptoms resolve. Individual tolerance varies, so adjust intake based on personal response.

Conclusion

This study revealed that coffee intake or caffeine intake does not increase the risk of colonic diverticulosis. This finding might be impactful in providing dietary consultation to patients with colonic diverticulosis in daily practice. Further research may explore whether different coffee types have varying effects. Given the wide array of effects of coffee on human metabolism in various levels, future studies focusing on this topic can lead to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis both for diverticulosis and other disorders; potentially leading to revealing the role of a commonly consumed beverage as to whether it is a risk factor for or protective against various clinical pictures. In conclusion, our study suggests that coffee consumption is not a significant risk factor for colonic diverticulosis. Coffee's potential role – if any – in diverticulosis pathogenesis remains subtle, and further research is warranted.

### Diverticulitis: new frontiers for an old country: risk factors and pathogenesis [^bd10c60d]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The understanding of diverticulitis has advanced little beyond the initial postulates of Burkitt and Painter who proposed that diverticular disease results from a deficiency of dietary fiber. Diverticular disease and diverticulitis are viewed simply as a consequence of a diet, which takes in relatively little fiber. Our understanding of diverticulitis has not advanced beyond these basic concepts. As many as two-thirds of individuals in the West have diverticular disease by the age of 85 years, but only 10% to 25% will manifest any related clinical symptoms. Other than age, several risk factors have been identified for the development of diverticular disease and diverticulitis. In particular, obesity and red meat intake are risk factors. Smoking is more controversial and alcohol, coffee, and caffeine have not shown to be risk factors. Vegetable intake, a strict vegetable diet, and increased fiber intake decreases the risk of development of diverticular disease, as well as diverticulitis. Physical activity also seems protective. Despite these evidences, the risk factors and pathophysiology progression from asymptomatic diverticular disease to diverticulitis have been inadequately studied. This subject is reviewed in more detail in this manuscript.

Introduction

Diverticulosis is a disease condition mainly affecting the adult population, which is characterized by pouch formations (diverticula) alongside the colonic wall. It is the most common benign pathology of the colon. While diverticulosis can be silent and undiagnosed in the majority of the patients, complications such as acute diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding are life-threatening conditions affecting approximately 5% of diverticulosis patients. Genetics, inflammation, neuromuscular abnormalities and lifestyle including dietary habits are all considered to play roles in the disease pathogenesis. Abnormalities in colonic motility have also been shown in diverticulosis patients.

Coffee is the second most consumed beverage throughout the world following water. Comprised of hundreds of different chemicals, most of the biochemical functions of coffee are attributed to caffeine, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, hydroxyhydroquinone, phenolic acid and polyphenols. Coffee has been shown to increase colonic motility in various studies. It has also been shown to affect the neuromuscular function of the gastrointestinal tract, affecting the brain-gut axis. A recent proposed effect of coffee is its involvement in cell protection with repair enzymes, antioxidation and detoxification. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) system activation is the key point in this protective mechanism by inducing cellular defense gene expression. Through the effects of its various ingredients and their molecular interactions, coffee has been shown to be beneficial healthwise in a wide array of disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disorders, kidney stones, liver cancer and all-cause mortality.

Because inflammation, neuromuscular abnormalities, and colonic motility all play roles in diverticulosis pathogenesis, and coffee can influence these factors, we hypothesized that coffee consumption might influence the development of diverticulosis, whether in a harmful or protective manner. A comprehensive literature search has been carried out prior to the initialization of the study through PubMed and Embase databases and to our knowledge, this is the first study directly investigating the relationship between coffee and diverticulosis. We analyzed coffee subtypes separately (instant, Turkish, brewed) in a relatively large Turkish patient cohort, who regularly consume Turkish coffee as a part of their culture.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate the effect of coffee consumption on diverticulosis. Genetics, inflammation, colonic motility and neuromuscular structure of gastrointestinal tract are thought to play roles in diverticulosis pathogenesis. Considering the wide spectrum of effects of coffee on these pathogenetic mechanisms, we wanted to investigate a potential direct relationship between coffee and diverticulosis. We found no significant association between coffee intake and diverticulosis, consistent with our hypothesis that coffee might not be a risk factor for diverticulosis. Although to our knowledge no other study directly investigating the role of coffee consumption on colonic diverticulosis exists, the results of our study is in line with the study by Aldoori et al. suggesting that coffee intake is likely not a significant risk factor for diverticular disease.

Of the known risk factors for diverticulosis, age was revealed to be a significant risk factor in this study. In univariate analysis, ASA and NSAID usages were also found to be risk factors for diverticulosis. Multivariate analysis revealed N This finding is in line with the literature, as ASA and NSAID are shown to increase the risk of diverticulitis and bleeding in various studies. Black tea is a beverage consumed daily in Turkey by the majority of the population and black tea consumption habits were also questioned. Black tea consumption was found to be related to lower rates of diverticulosis in univariate logistic regression analysis albeit multivariate analysis did not reveal a significant relationship. Future studies on this topic might reveal more on the effect of black tea on diverticulosis.

Diet and lifestyle

Different lifestyle factors affecting DD manifestations have been identified. The most consistent data, all originating from post hoc analysis, derive from 3 large, long-lasting cohort studies. These include the Health Professionals Follow-up Study with 47,888 male subjects and 6-year follow up, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition with 47,033 male/female and 11.6-year follow up, and the Swedish Mammography Cohort with 36,592 female and 13-year follow up. The main available evidence concerning the protective or aggressive role of lifestyle factors is briefly summarized in Fig. 2. However, the available data need to be interpreted with caution when considering that a factor may: a) act over decades; b) change in the same subject during life; c) exert a diverse role in a different phase of DD; and d) interact with other factors. It has been found that higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with a reduced risk of diverticulitis development. Moreover, vitamin D concentrations are linked to the endoscopic severity of DD patients with more severe disease showing significantly lower scores. On the other hand, no significant role emerged for vitamin A, vitamin C, coffee consumption, sodium or potassium.

Background

Diverticulosis is the most common benign pathology of the colon. Genetics, inflammation, neuromuscular abnormalities, colonic motility and lifestyle including dietary habits play roles in disease pathogenesis. Coffee is one of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide and exerts antiinflammatory functions in the human body as well as affecting colonic motility and neuromuscular physiology of the gastrointestinal system. Therefore, this study was planned to investigate the relationship between coffee consumption and diverticulosis.

Materials and methods

A total of 1669 patients undergoing colonoscopy was enrolled in this cross-sectional study over a span of one year. Data from the patients was gathered through a questionnaire and matched with colonoscopy results. Coffee consumption was evaluated both as total cups of coffee consumed regardless of subtype per day and individual consumption of subtypes which were designated as instant coffee (Nescafe), Turkish coffee and brewed coffee (referred to as machine coffee in Turkey).

Results

Overall coffee consumption regardless of subtype was not found to be related to diverticulosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed age and non-steroid antiinflammatory drug usage were risk factors for diverticulosis with odds ratios of 1.062 and 1.645 respectively. Regular exercise was found to be related with lower rates of colonic diverticulosis with an odds ratio of 0.684. Coffee consumption be it total sum or specific subtypes or caffeine intake were not found to be statistically significantly related to diverticulosis in multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Conclusion

This study revealed that coffee intake or caffeine intake does not increase the risk of colonic diverticulosis. Further research may explore whether different coffee types have varying effects.

Materials and methods

Study design

This cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2022 – March 2023 in the Gastroenterology Endoscopy Unit of Antalya Training and Research Hospital. A one-page questionnaire was prepared to gather the data for the study including questions both about the demographics and diverticulosis associated factors. The questionnaire consisted of following questions: gender, age, weight, height, place of living (urban/suburban/rural), smoking status, alcohol consumption, regular exercise (at least three times a week and at least for 30 min each session), sufficient water consumption (water intake of at least 2.5 L per day was deemed as sufficient water consumption), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) usage (regularly), painkiller usage (non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID)), presence of constipation (defined as defecation intervals of more than 72 h), need to strain during defecation, black tea consumption, coffee consumption (including subtypes: instant coffee (Nescafe), Turkish coffee and brewed coffee (referred to as machine coffee in Turkey)). Coffee consumption was recorded as cups per day. For instant coffee and brewed coffee, a standart coffee cup of 150 mililiters was recorded as 1 cup. For Turkish coffee, since it is served in special instruments with a standart, small sized cup, 65 mililiters was recorded as 1 cup. To overcome multicollinearity, caffeine content of coffee subtypes and black tea have been calculated. The patient population was split into two groups based on daily caffeine intake: patients with daily caffeine intake of below 100 mg and patients with daily caffeine intake of 100 mg and above. These two groups were investigated in terms of diverticulosis presence. The questionnaire utilized in the study is an original questionnaire developed specifically for this study. English language version of the questionnaire developed for this study is available as a supplementary file.

Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were given with frequencies (n) and percentages (%) and continuous variables were presented as the mean (± standart deviation, (SD)) or median with minimum and maximum values. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate whether the data set was normally distributed. Fisher's exact test was performed to determine relationship between categorical variables. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed for non-parametric comparisons of continuous data. Chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the effects of independent variables on diverticulosis. Variables with a p level of below 0.1 were included in multivariate regression analysis. Level of significance was p < 0.05. Odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were reported. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

1669 patients were enrolled in the study. Diverticulosis was detected in 151 patients (9.0%). Female to male ratio was close to 1:1 with 834 patients being female and 835 patients being male. 963 patients (57.7%) had a BMI value of 25 kg/m² or higher. 399 patients (23.9%) were active smokers. Alcohol consumption was relatively low in the study population (n = 59, 3.5%). 726 patients (43.5%) were doing regular exercise and 1154 patients (69.1%) were drinking at least 2.5 L of water per day. 187 patients (11.2%) reported they had constipation, while 793 patients (47.5%) reported they need to strain during defecation. No relationship between gender and diverticulosis was observed. ASA and NSAID usage was correlated with a higher prevalence of diverticulosis (p: < 0.001 and p:0.011 respectively). Total coffee consumption, including all three subtypes in the study, was not found to be an independent factor for diverticulosis presence. BMI, place of living, smoking, alcohol consumption, regular exercise and sufficient water intake were not statistically significantly correlated to presence of diverticula. Regarding defecation, presence of constipation or requirement of straining during defecation were not found to be related to diverticulosis. Patients were also split into two groups in terms of coffee consumption as patients drinking no coffee and patients drinking at least 1 cup of coffee regardless of subtype. No difference in terms of diverticulosis prevalence was detected between these two groups. Patient characteristics and their relationship with the presence of diverticulosis are given in Table 1.

### Relationship of coffee consumption with colonic diverticulosis [^ac671966]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are limitiatons of the study. Because of the cross-sectional design of the study, coffee consumption and diverticulosis presence were assessed simultaneously. This design prevented us from establishing definitely that coffee intake preceded diverticulosis. A parameter including previous coffee consumption, similar to package-years in smoking, would have better reflected the relationship between coffee and diverticulosis. The main limitation of the study is the lack of certain parameters in the questionnaire utilized, which are potentially related to diverticulosis presence. Dietary fiber intake and intake of fruit, vegetables and meat would give more valuable results. Obesity-related factors, metabolic health and family history, and educational status of the patient population would also be valuable additions to the study analysis. The study is from a tertiary center from Southwestern Turkey, so the generability of the results is limited. Additionally, the study population consists of patients undergoing colonoscopy, which may not reflect the general population. Gathering patient data via a questionnaire can also be considered a limitation since recall bias and misreporting is possible. The questionnaire utilized in the study is not a standardized and validated questionnaire, hence inherited weaknesses of the questionnaire might have caused limitations in data gathering. Finally, given that age is a risk factor for diverticulosis, stratification of patients according to age and investigating the relationship of different age groups with diverticulosis would have given valuable data but this analysis was not possible due to relatively small number of patients with colonic diverticulosis. Future studies, which we are also conceptualizing as a continuation of this study, incorporating validated food frequency questionnaire or 24 h dietary recall in addition to the aforementioned items will lead to a stronger analysis of the subject and give valuable results.

Table 2
Relationship of qualitative parameters with diverticulosis

Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed age, ASA usage, NSAID usage and black tea consumption were statistically significantly related to diverticulosis. Older age, ASA usage and NSAID usage were found to be risk factors for diverticulosis with odds ratios of 1.066, 2.205 and 1.733 respectively. Black tea was found to be related to lower rates of diverticulosis with an odds ratio of 0.941 (95% CI: 0.888–0.997), indicating a 5.9% risk reduction per additional daily cup. While total coffee consumption was not found to be related to diverticulosis (OR: 0.777, 95% CI: 0.596–1.014, p = 0.064), instant coffee was related to lower rates of diverticulosis with an odds ratio of 0.660 (95% CI: 0.468–0.931). A daily caffeine intake of 100 mg or above was found to be related to lower rates of diverticulosis (OR: 0.774, 95% CI: 0.551–0.997, p < 0.001). Relationship of exercise status (at least 30 min of exercise three times per week) with diverticulosis presence was found to have a p level below 0.1 in univariate analysis, so this parameter was also added to the multivariate analysis. Univariate analysis results are given in Table 3.

Age, black tea consumption per day and total coffee consumption per day as well as subgroups of coffee consumptions were analyzed. Age was found to be a significant factor for diverticulosis (p = < 0.001). Mean (± SD) age of patients with diverticulosis was 65.09 (± 8.36) years compared to 55.24 (± 14.16) in patients without diverticulosis. Black tea consumption was not found to be related to diverticulosis. Total coffee consumption per day did not differ between patients with or without diverticulosis but instant coffee (Nescafe) consumption per day was significantly higher in patients without diverticulosis than with diverticulosis. On average, patients without diverticulosis consumed nearly double the amount of instant coffee compared to those with diverticulosis (0.58 ± 0.97 cups per day versus 0.33 ± 0.63 cups per day respectively (mean ± SD, p = 0.019). Turkish coffee and brewed coffee consumption was not found to differ between patients with or without diverticulosis. Relationship of qualitative study parameters with diverticulosis are given in Table 2.

### Relationship of coffee consumption with colonic diverticulosis [^6c93416d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Coffee consumption was investigated in three subtypes since they are the most commonly consumed coffee types in Turkey: instant coffee (Nescafe), Turkish coffee and brewed coffee. The rationale behind investigating different types of coffees was that they might contain different amounts of caffeine and bioactive compounds, although calculation of these were beyond the scope of this study. Instant coffee is widely used around the world owing to its quick preparation and easy storage. Instant coffee generally consists of less caffeine than brewed coffee. Turkish coffee is a type of coffee prepared and served in special instruments. It is commonly consumed in Turkey. Brewed coffee, referred to as "machine coffee" in Turkey, is gaining popularity especially among the young population due to increasing number of coffee shops. Overall coffee consumption regardless of subtype was not found to be related to diverticulosis. A recent study by Wierzejska et al. revealed that instant coffee contained 23 mg caffeine per serving on average compared to 143 mg caffeine per serving on average for Americano coffee. Turkish coffee typically has 60 mg of caffeine per serving (65 ml). To avoid multicollinearity, caffeine content of coffee and black tea consumed by the study population was calculated and investigated. No relationship was found between daily caffeine intake and colonic diverticulosis. One point to consider in the reported coffee consumption habits of the patients is the possibility of reverse causation. Patients enrolled in the study might have changed their dietary habits due to gastrointestinal symptoms or medical advice prior to colonoscopy, which might have affected causality.

One notable result of the study was the relationship between regular exercise and colonic diverticulosis. Regular exercise was found to be associated with lower rates of colonic diverticulosis presence. This finding is in line with the literature, with studies showing the preventive effect of exercise on both diverticulosis and development of diverticular complications. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Aune et al. investigated BMI and physical activity and their relationship with diverticular disease risk. This analysis included five cohort studies with 147,869 participants. Physical activity was found to be related with a lower rate of diverticular disease, which is in line with our findings. There are a few proposed mechanisms through which physical exercise might alter risk of diverticular disease. Prevention of overweight and obesity, maintaining a healthy gastrointestinal motor function, decrease in intracolonic pressure, reduced transit time and neuroendocrine changes are some of these mechanisms. Further research on the topic is warranted to clarify the relationship between physical exercise and diverticular disease risk.

### Genetically predicted adiposity, diabetes, and lifestyle factors in relation to diverticular disease [^de882eb6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Adiposity, type 2 diabetes, alcohol and coffee consumption, and smoking have been examined in relation to diverticular disease in observational studies. We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to assess the causality of these associations.

Methods

Independent genetic instruments associated with the studied exposures at genome-wide significance were obtained from published genome-wide association studies. Summary-level data for the exposure-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms with diverticular disease were available in the FinnGen consortium (10,978 cases and 149,001 noncases) and the UK Biobank study (12,662 cases and 348,532 noncases).

Results

Higher genetically predicted body mass index and genetic liability to type 2 diabetes and smoking initiation were associated with an increased risk of diverticular disease in meta-analyses of results from the two studies. The combined odds ratio of diverticular disease was 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–1.33; P < .001) for a 1-standard deviation (~4.8 kg/m²) increase in body mass index, 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01–1.07; P = 0.007) for a 1-unit increase in log-transformed odds ratio of type 2 diabetes, and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.12–1.30; P < .001) for a 1-standard deviation increase in prevalence of smoking initiation. Coffee consumption was not associated with diverticular disease, whereas the association for alcohol consumption largely differed between the 2 studies.

Conclusions

This study strengthens the causal associations of higher body mass index, type 2 diabetes, and smoking with an increased risk of diverticular disease. Coffee consumption is not associated with diverticular disease. Whether alcohol consumption affects the risk of diverticular disease needs further investigation.

Foods not linked to increased risk include that "Nut, corn, and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis", and "consuming fruits with small seeds (strawberries and blueberries) is not associated with increased risk". Activity and adiposity also matter: "Physical activity, particularly when it is vigorous, decreases risk", while "Obesity, particularly central obesity, weight gain, and smoking are also risk factors", and "Alcoholism, but not alcohol consumption by itself, increases risk as well".

0. 86 after further multivariable adjustment. 1 This change was largely because of adjustment for tobacco smoking, because smokers were more likely to drink coffee than nonsmokers. For this reason, it is important to adjust our models for tobacco smoking, and the availability of detailed information on tobacco use was a strength of the cohort.

Patient selection

Patients admitted to the endoscopy unit for colonoscopy of any indication were included in the study. Patients below 18 years of age were not included as well as patients who could not fill the questionnaire due to illiteracy or cognitive impairment (dementia, mental retardation, etc.). Patients were informed on the questions in the questionnaire to avoid misunderstandings, with emphasis of coffee consumption. A cup of coffee was designated as 150 mililiters of coffee (a typical volume for a coffee cup) for instant coffee and brewed coffee. For Turkish coffee, a cup was designated as 65 mililiters, since Turkish coffee is uniformly served in special instruments which are smaller than typical coffee cups, similar to the volume of espresso coffee. Other beverages which would potentially act as caffeine sources such as green tea and energy drinks were not included in the questionnaire since these beverages are rarely, if ever, consumed by the Turkish population due to cultural and traditional habits. The author team evaluated the questionnaire in a meeting to prevalidate the questionnaire in terms of clarity, relevance and completeness before initiation of the study. Questionnaires were handed out before the colonoscopy procedure and gathered before the patient went for colonoscopy. Questionnaire forms collected during the day were matched with the corresponding colonoscopy procedural reports at the end of each day. Patients with an insufficient colonoscopic evaluation (insufficient bowel preparation, incomplete procedure due to any reason) were also excluded from the study. Power calculation was performed by G*Power prior to the study and a population size of 115 patients with diverticulosis was estimated to be sufficient for analysis with an alpha error value of 0.05 and power of 95%. The study was designed to include all the patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria within the predetermined one year period, hence the number of patients with diverticulosis is above the calculated number. A total of 1669 patients were enrolled in the study over a span of twelve months.

An inherent selection bias should be kept in mind in the patient selection procedure. Since our endoscopy unit is a tertiary unit in the region, more symptom-driven patients were probably included in the analysis. Additionally, patients with diverticulosis tend to be of older age and optimal bowel preparation might be harder to achieve in this population, hence leading to exclusion of these patients resulting in a lower diverticulosis prevalence.

Concluding remarks

From honing in on specific dietary and genetic associations to refining surgical techniques, the complex landscape of diverticulitis is ever-changing. At a glance, there are more publications on quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes. These matters are particularly important as we attempt to become less aggressive in our care, so that we do not inadvertently promote chronic symptoms and recurrent disease in the name of "doing less". Patterns of treatment and societal guidelines remain significantly heterogeneous worldwide. We look forward to the longer-term results of trials from the last decade and ongoing innovation in the field.

### Fibers and polyphenols in diverticular disease: from pathophysiology to management [^f2d71dc5]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

7.3 Synergic Interplay Between Dietary Fibers and Polyphenol‐Rich Foods

Overall, the combined intake of polyphenol‐rich foods and dietary fiber represents a promising, multifactorial strategy for the prevention and management of diverticulitis. Fiber contributes to reducing intraluminal pressure and modulating colonic transit, while polyphenols exert protective effects by counteracting oxidative stress and chronic low‐grade inflammation. This synergistic interplay supports microbiota homeostasis and the preservation of the intestinal barrier, ultimately lowering the risk of disease recurrence.

Findings from a large perspective cohort study in women further reinforce this concept, showing that higher total fiber intake, particularly from fruit and cereal sources, was associated with a significantly reduced risk of incident diverticulitis. Notably, the study identified whole fruits such as apples, pears, and prunes as particularly protective, highlighting the importance of food quality alongside quantity. However, it is essential to recognize that the practical implementation of such dietary recommendations can be challenging. Individuals with a history of diverticular disease often develop restrictive eating patterns, frequently avoiding polyphenol‐rich and FODMAP‐containing foods out of fear of symptom recurrence. This behavior may stem from hospital‐imposed dietary limitations during acute episodes — such as clear‐fluid or low‐residue diets — which can create lasting perceptions of "unsafe" foods. Qualitative studies describe this as a "fear of food" cycle, where avoidance behaviors persist even in remission and lack strong evidence of benefit. Moreover, this habit may lead to the exclusion of beneficial compounds and a reduction in overall dietary diversity. In this context, nutritional counseling emerges as a fundamental tool to help patients identify well‐tolerated food sources and to gradually reintroduce polyphenol‐ and fiber‐rich foods in a personalized and symptom‐conscious manner.

Furthermore, although fiber intake was traditionally restricted in the clinical management of diverticular disease, current evidence supports its protective role. Personalized nutrition strategies guided by qualified professionals are, therefore, crucial not only for correcting outdated misconceptions but also for promoting long‐term dietary adherence, patient empowerment, and improved intestinal health.

### Can coffee or chewing gum decrease transit times in colon capsule endoscopy? A randomized controlled trial [^81380a0a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 186 participants were included in the study from October 2015 to July 2016. Due to missing data on allocation 8 participants were excluded from analysis. The intention was to treat 57 participants with coffee, 61 with chewing gum and include 60 control participants. All 12 participants that refused their allocation (8 coffee and 4 chewing gum) were excluded from the per protocol analysis. In the coffee group one study was incomplete due to technical failure of the colon capsule three minutes after ingestion and therefore excluded from per protocol analysis.

Sixty-six % (n = 109) of participants were male and their average age was 64 ± 7 years. The age of participants was similar in all groups, but there was a trend towards more male participants in the chewing group (77% vs 55 and 63% in respectively the coffee and control group, p = 0.052). The excretion rates, bowel quality and amount of capsules that was retained before the cecum are displayed in Fig. 1. There were no significant differences between the groups, even though the chewing gum had the highest excretion rate of 63% (95% CI: 49–76) in comparison to coffee (58%; 95% CI: 43–72) and controls (55%; 95% CI: 42–68). Chewing gum had also the lowest number of capsules retained before the cecum. Colon and total transit times were similar in all groups (Fig. 2). Previous studies generally presented the total transit time in categories, which are presented in Additional file 1: Figure S1.

3 Epidemiology

Diverticulosis is usually an incidental and asymptomatic condition observed in patients undergoing endoscopic or radiological examinations for other medical reasons. Due to the incidental nature of the diagnosis, it is difficult to accurately estimate its incidence and prevalence, which is influenced by age and geographic location of the population. Indeed, it is widely reported that its prevalence increases with age, being as low as 10% in individuals < 40 years of age and up to 70% in those older than 80 years.

Gender differences have also been observed. Diverticulosis is more prevalent in males than females gender until the 6th decade. A recent study reported that diverticulosis has a lower prevalence in premenopausal age women compared to postmenopausal age women, who show the same risk of developing diverticula as same‐age men, hinting at a possible key role for hormones in the development of diverticula.

In early epidemiological studies, diverticulosis has been described as a condition of "westernized" populations, with the highest incidence being registered in the United States, Western Europe, and Australia. This disparity has been attributed to differences in lifestyle and dietary habits, particularly the high‐fiber diet in the East versus the low‐fiber diet typical of Western countries. Indeed, a higher consumption of dietary fibers has been associated with a decreased risk of diverticulitis in both male and female patients. A prospective study conducted in Sweden reported that immigrants from non‐Westernized countries carried a lower risk for hospitalization due to acute diverticulitis than natives. The risk has been reported to progressively increase over time after settlement, suggesting the adoption of a western lifestyle as a potential risk factor for the development of diverticula.

### Medical conditions associated with coffee consumption: disease-trajectory and comorbidity network analyses of a prospective cohort study in UK biobank [^b646ab2e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

The final study cohort consisted of 395,539 individuals, among whom 113,995 and 77,404 had low and high levels of coffee consumption, respectively (Figure 1). The median ages at cohort entry were 56.0 and 57.0 years for individuals with low and high levels of coffee consumption, respectively, and the median follow-up time was 11.8 years for both (Table 1). Compared with individuals with low-level coffee consumption, those with high-level coffee consumption were more likely to be male (51.57% compared with 42.02%, respectively), to be obese (BMI ≥ 29.9 kg/m², 27.32% compared with 23.38%, respectively), to be a current smoker (17.03% compared with 8.85%, respectively), to be a current heavy alcohol drinker (hazardous or harmful drinking, 42.29% compared with 31.17%, respectively), and to have a better household income (≥ 52,000£, 25.27% compared with 21.36%, respectively), but were less likely to have high-level tea intake (≥ 4 cups per day, 13.31% compared with 46.27%, respectively) or enough fruit and vegetable consumption (28.38% compared with 31.45%, respectively). A lower level of total estradiol was observed among individuals with high-level coffee intake, compared to individuals with low-level coffee intake; this was, however, only noted among women, regardless of menopause status or HRT use (Supplemental Table 3). Similar results were also observed when comparing individuals with moderate-level coffee consumption to those with low-level coffee consumption, with the exception of BMI and smoking status.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update — management principles and patient counseling: Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course, and in patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively, rather than routinely, in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, while antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation, and an elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes; instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices. In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Question 4 — dietary fiber in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis — The AGA suggests a fiber-rich diet or fiber supplementation in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis and characterizes this as a conditional recommendation with very low quality of evidence. There are no studies that address whether dietary or supplemental fiber intake reduces the risk of recurrent acute diverticulitis, and risk reduction for recurrent diverticulitis is extrapolated from a study examining patients without a prior history of diverticulitis. The benefits of fiber for chronic abdominal pain in patients with diverticulosis are inconsistent and do not necessarily imply benefit in terms of recurrent diverticulitis, and patient preferences and side effects of fiber such as abdominal bloating should be considered when counseling a patient.

### Cigarette smoking, coffee consumption, alcohol intake, and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: a mendelian randomization study [^c9c7b721]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are widely associated with smoking in epidemiological studies, whereas there are conflicting results for the association between CD and UC for both coffee and alcohol consumption. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether cigarette smoking and alcohol and coffee consumption are causally associated with either CD or UC.

Methods

We utilized 540 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms for 3 potentially addictive substances-nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine-to assess the association of smoking, coffee, and alcohol consumption with CD and UC (12,194 CD cases, 12,366 UC cases, and 25,042 controls of European ancestry), using Mendelian randomization analysis. Mendelian randomization estimates were used to evaluate the effect of the exposure factors on CD and UC risk. Sensitivity analysis was employed to test for any directional pleiotropy.

Results

We found evidence for a positive causal association between the age of smoking initiation and UC risk and between alcohol consumption and CD risk, which disappeared after sensitivity analysis for both associations (P > 0.05). No evidence for a causal association between cigarettes per day, smoking initiation, smoking cessation, and coffee consumption variables and UC or CD was found.

Conclusions

We found no clear evidence that either genetically predicted smoking, coffee consumption, or alcohol consumption are causally associated with the risk for CD or UC, although our findings indicate a potential positive association between the age of smoking and UC and between alcohol consumption and CD.

### Diverticular disease: rapid evidence review [^d7aa92e7]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Diverticulitis should be suspected in patients with isolated left lower quadrant pain, abdominal distention or rigidity, fever, and leukocytosis. Initial laboratory workup includes a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and C-reactive protein measurement. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast is the preferred imaging modality, if needed to confirm diagnosis and assess for complications of diverticulitis. Treatment decisions are based on the categorization of disease as complicated vs. uncomplicated. Selected patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis may be treated without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis is treated in the hospital with modified diet or bowel rest, antibiotics, and pain control. Abscesses that are 3 cm or larger should be treated with percutaneous drainage. Emergent surgery is reserved for when percutaneous drainage fails or the patient's clinical condition worsens despite adequate therapy. Colonoscopy should not be performed during the flare-up, but should be considered six weeks after resolution of symptoms in patients with complicated diverticulitis who have not had a high-quality colonoscopy in the past year. Diverticulitis prevention measures include consuming a vegetarian diet or high-quality diet (high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes), limiting red meat and sweets, achieving or maintaining a body mass index of 18 to 25 kg/m², being physically active, and avoiding tobacco and long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Partial colectomy is not routinely recommended for diverticulitis prevention and should be reserved for patients with more than three recurrences or abscess formation requiring percutaneous drainage.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that still garners significant attention and study because of its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome. We provide a review of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis. Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, showing how the epidemiology of the disease process is shifting away from what was previously felt to be a disorder primarily limited to older western populations. Interestingly, as has long been suspected, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here. The data for non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are reviewed, as are pharmacologic agents studied for use in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. Lastly, we present controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis. This review will provide a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature relating to diverticulitis.

### Modern concepts in diverticular disease [^cbcd5b8b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Over the last decade there has been a striking shift in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathology, and management of diverticular disease. Indeed, many of the guidelines published in the late nineties and early 2000s are now redundant. High-fiber diets, avoidance of nuts and seeds, antibiotic treatment for mild diverticulitis, elective resection after 2 attacks of diverticulitis, Hartmann's procedure (HP), and aggressive management of young patients are all open to question. The more we challenge our understanding of diverticulitis it becomes apparent how little we know about this disease entity. This review aims update the reader on current hypotheses and evidencebased modern management strategies in diverticular disease.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of left-sided colonic diverticulitis [^b66b0a13]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guideline — lifestyle and risk-factor modification: Tobacco cessation, reduced meat intake, physical activity and weight loss are recommended interventions to potentially reduce the risk of diverticulitis (Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). In a prospective cohort study of 46,295 men, a "Western" dietary pattern was associated with increased risk; men in the highest quintile had a multivariate hazard ratio of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.20–1.99) for diverticulitis compared with the lowest quintile. In another analysis, 907 incident cases over 757,791 person-years showed an inverse linear relationship between the number of low-risk lifestyle factors and diverticulitis incidence (p for trend < 0.001), and when all 5 low-risk factors were present the relative risk of diverticular disease was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.15–0.48). A meta-analysis of 5 prospective studies that comprised 6076 cases found elevated relative risk for an initial episode in current smokers 1.36 (95% CI, 1.15–1.61), former smokers 1.17 (95% CI, 1.05–1.31), and ever smokers 1.29 (95% CI, 1.16–1.44); risks for complications were 2.54 (95%, 1.49–4.33) in current smokers and 1.83 (95% CI, 1.25–2.67) in ever smokers. The same authors reported that a 5-unit increase in BMI carried relative risks of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.09–1.56) for a first episode and 1.20 (95% CI, 1.04–1.40) for diverticular disease-related complications, and note that weight reduction and smoking cessation may be recommended to reduce incidence, while the role in secondary prevention is unclear.

Is there a role for diet and nutraceuticals?

Diverticular disease has historically been considered a disease of diet and lifestyle. In the 1960s, Painter and Burkitt observed a striking difference in the prevalence of diverticular disease in the UK when compared with Africa and Asia. They attributed the high prevalence of diverticular disease in the West to insufficient fiber intake. Recent studies, however, indicate that after controlling for other risk factors, dietary fiber intake is not associated with the prevalence of diverticulosis detected at colonoscopy. On the other hand, a number of population-based studies have shown that fiber intake is inversely associated with the risk of diverticulitis – (Figure 6). It is not clear whether a specific type or source of fiber is more beneficial in reducing the risk of diverticulitis.

Figure 6.
Relationship between fiber intake and risk of diverticulitis in the EPIC study (from Crowe et al.).

RR, relative risk.

Red meat intake, particularly unprocessed red meat, is also associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis. The substitution of poultry or fish for one serving of red meat decreased risk by 20%. In one study, vegetarians were at a 30% decreased risk compared with omnivores.

Dietary patterns as a whole, and not just specific components of the diet, seem to be related to the risk of diverticulitis. In a study, men in the highest quintile of Western dietary pattern (high in red meat, fat and refined grains) had a hazard ratio of 1.55 (95% CI 1.20–1.99) when compared with men in the lowest quintile, after adjustment for multiple potential confounders, including body mass index and physical activity level. Conversely, high scores of prudent dietary pattern (high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains) were at a decreased risk (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60–0.91), compared with low scores(Figure 7).

Acute diverticulitis is a common condition that has been increasing in incidence in the United States. It is associated with increasing age, but the pathophysiology of acute diverticulitis is still being elucidated. It is now believed to have a significant contribution from inflammatory processes rather than being a strictly infectious process. There are still many questions to be answered regarding the optimal management of acute diverticulitis because recent studies have challenged traditional practices, such as the routine use of antibiotics, surgical technique, and dietary restrictions for prevention of recurrence.

Fiber

Data on the role of fiber in primary prevention of diverticulitis are particularly conflicting. Patients with a history of diverticulosis or DD commonly seek dietary and lifestyle recommendations to reduce their risk of occurrence/recurrence of the disease and/or complications. The traditional recommendation has been to consume a high-fiber diet. Using data from a single case-control study that included 56 participants, it is estimated that a high-fiber diet might reduce the number of complications (by 52 cases per 1000 patients treated) and the need for surgery (by 100 cases per 1000 patients treated). Based on a prospective cohort study that examined the association of dietary fiber intake and risk of incident hospitalization for DD, it is estimated that a high-fiber diet may reduce the risk of acute diverticulitis by 59 cases per 1000 patients. We rated the quality of this evidence as very low based on substantial differences between our target population (those with a history of diverticulitis) and those in the cohort study (those without a history of diverticulitis). Only three randomized trials analyzed the role of fiber in preventing diverticulitis occurrence in those patients. Unfortunately, their sample size was far too small to demonstrate a significant effect of high-fiber supplementation on the prevention of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis or other complications of DD (e.g. abscess, perforation, stenosis, fistula or bleeding).

8 Conclusions

Historically, dietary interventions have often been discouraged in the management of SUDD due to concerns that certain foods might exacerbate symptoms or lead to complications. However, current guidelines have changed this perspective, recognizing the pivotal role of nutrition in both symptom management and disease prevention. Dietary fibers are now acknowledged for their benefits in enhancing gastrointestinal motility, modulating the gut microbiota, and reducing intraluminal pressure. In particular, polyphenols, found abundantly in plant‐based foods, exhibit antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties that may further improve gastrointestinal health. Emerging evidence suggests that polyphenols can modulate gut microbiota composition and function, contributing to the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity and to the reduction of oxidative stress. Given the interindividual variability in responses to dietary components, personalized nutrition strategies are essential. Not only the quantity, but also the quality and individual tolerability of foods must be considered. Therefore, a proper balance in the intake of foods that contain both FODMAPs and polyphenols by adjusting their introduction based on the patients' clinical response seems to be highly useful. Tailoring dietary recommendations to individual tolerances and metabolic profiles ensures optimal intake of fibers and polyphenols, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes and promoting long‐term adherence to dietary modifications.

### Fibers and polyphenols in diverticular disease: from pathophysiology to management [^215fc5d5]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Diverticular disease is usually defined as symptomatic diverticulosis ranging from a condition of SUDD to diverticulitis. It is estimated that approximately 25% of individuals with diverticulosis develop SUDD while the progression to diverticulitis seems to occur in a minority of patients. Among these patients, only 12% of patients will progress to complications such as perforation, abscess, or fistula. Although diverticula are more frequent in elderly individuals, diverticular disease seems to show a different age‐related trend with a higher rate of related hospitalizations and a more aggressive course in younger patients (< 45 years). Female patients have also been reported to have a higher hospitalization rate compared to male patients at all ages.

### Randomized clinical trial on the effect of coffee on postoperative ileus following elective colectomy [^880079b8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus is a common problem after abdominal surgery. It was postulated that coffee intake would decrease postoperative ileus after colectomy.

Methods

This was a multicentre parallel open-label randomized trial. Patients with malignant or benign disease undergoing elective open or laparoscopic colectomy were assigned randomly before surgery to receive either coffee or water after the procedure (100 mL three times daily). The primary endpoint was time to first bowel movement; secondary endpoints were time to first flatus, time to tolerance of solid food, length of hospital stay and perioperative morbidity.

Results

A total of 80 patients were randomized, 40 to each group. One patient in the water arm was excluded owing to a change in surgical procedure. Patient characteristics were similar in both groups. In intention-to-treat analysis, the time to the first bowel movement was significantly shorter in the coffee arm than in the water arm (mean(s.d.) 60·4(21·3) versus 74·0(21·6) h; P = 0·006). The time to tolerance of solid food (49·2(21·3) versus 55·8(30·0) h; P = 0·276) and time to first flatus (40·6(16·1) versus 46·4(20·1) h; P = 0·214) showed a similar trend, but the differences were not significant. Length of hospital stay (10·8(4·4) versus 11·3(4·5) days; P = 0·497) and morbidity (8 of 40 versus 10 of 39 patients; P = 0·550) were comparable in the two groups.

Conclusion

Coffee consumption after colectomy was safe and was associated with a reduced time to first bowel action.

7 Role of the Diet in the Management of DD

The therapeutic management of SUDD is still uncertain, as testified by the low‐level evidence of current guidelines recommendations, due to the limited availability of evidence. A significant discrepancy regarding the incidence of diverticular disease between Western countries and rural Africa has been described since the seventies. A potential inverse correlation between dietary fiber intake and the incidence of diverticular disease has been hypothesized, suggesting that a high‐fiber diet may play a protective role in diverticula development.

7.1 Fibers

Fibers are commonly classified into soluble and insoluble types, which differ in fermentability and their effect on stool consistency and transit time. Fibers retain water in the intestinal lumen, increasing stool weight and reducing transit time. By lowering the pressure exerted by stool in the weaker areas of the colonic lumen, adequate intake of fiber may reduce the likelihood of developing diverticula. In addition, dietary fibers undergo fermentation by intestinal bacteria, leading to the production of SCFAs, which improve colonic mucosal integrity. Based on these properties, in the last decades, several studies investigated the potential role of a high‐fiber diet and fiber supplementation in SUDD management and prevention of acute diverticulitis. Two systematic reviews have examined the role of dietary fiber in the management of SUDD, suggesting a potential benefit in symptom improvement and stool regulation. However, both highlighted significant methodological limitations, including heterogeneity in fiber types and dosages, inconsistencies in study design, and lack of standardized treatment protocols. These issues prevent strong conclusions and limit the current strength of evidence supporting fiber supplementation in clinical practice. Aune et al. reported a correlation between different types of fibers and diverticular disease and suggested a reduction in the risk of acute diverticulitis with 10 g/die of fruit fiber and cereal.

ABSTRACT

Backgrounds

Diverticular disease, particularly symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), significantly impacts patient quality of life and is increasing in prevalence, especially in Western countries. While its pathophysiology is multifactorial, diet — specifically low fiber intake — has been implicated as a key modifiable factor in disease development and progression. Fibers influence colonic motility and stool composition, potentially reducing the formation of diverticula and symptom severity. Polyphenols, bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties, may further protect intestinal integrity and modulate gut microbiota.

Purpose

This narrative review explores emerging evidence on the role of dietary fiber and polyphenols inmanagement. Despite promising mechanistic insights, current studies are limited by heterogeneity and methodological constraints. Personalized nutritional strategies focusing on fiber and polyphenol‐rich foods warrant further investigation to optimize therapeutic outcomes in SUDD.

### Diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment [^c33fdfba]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease refers to symptomatic and asymptomatic disease with an underlying pathology of colonic diverticula. Predisposing factors for the formation of diverticula include a low-fiber diet and physical inactivity. Approximately 85 percent of patients with diverticula are believed to remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic disease without inflammation is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring colonoscopy because imaging studies cannot discern the significance of diverticula. Fiber supplementation may prevent progression to symptomatic disease or improve symptoms in patients without inflammation. Computed tomography is recommended for diagnosis when inflammation is present. Antibiotic therapy aimed at anaerobes and gram-negative rods is first-line treatment for diverticulitis. Whether treatment is administered on an inpatient or outpatient basis is determined by the clinical status of the patient and his or her ability to tolerate oral intake. Surgical consultation is indicated for disease that does not respond to medical management or for repeated attacks that may be less likely to respond to medical therapy and have a higher mortality rate. Prompt surgical consultation also should be obtained when there is evidence of abscess formation, fistula formation, obstruction, or free perforation.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

To investigate whether the effects of high-level coffee consumption could be modified by sex, for medical conditions with statistically significant results in the main PheWAS, we tested the differences between sex-specific HRs by introducing an interaction term in the models. The subsequent disease-trajectory and comorbidity network analyses were performed separately for men and women. Further, instead of focusing on the high-coffee-consumption group alone, we tested the association between the level of coffee consumption (cups per day) and risks of these diseases. Both linear and categorical, nonlinear models were fitted, and a likelihood ratio test was used to determine whether the dose-response relationship was linear. In addition, we performed the PheWAS separately for a high-level intake of regular coffee (N = 61,784) and a high-level intake of decaffeinated coffee (N = 14,722).

To further reduce the possibility that preexisting health conditions might affect one's choice of coffee consumption, in addition to the exclusion of individuals with gastroduodenal ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, IBS, IBD, or glaucoma at baseline, we performed 2 sensitivity analyses by repeating the PheWAS after: 1) excluding 90,509 individuals with a diagnosis or symptoms of cardiovascular or gastrointestinal diseases at baseline (Supplemental Table 1) and 137,835 individuals with elevated blood pressure (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) or heart rate (≥ 120) at baseline; and 2) excluding noncoffee drinkers (i.e. individuals with 0 cups of coffee per day) from the low-level consumption group (n = 85,308), assuming an extreme scenario that stringent noncoffee drinkers were intolerant to coffee. In an additional sensitivity analysis, we used a 2-year lag time since the recruitment date to assess the impact of the temporal order between exposure to coffee intake and subsequent incidences of medical conditions on the results.

All the statistical analyses were conducted using SciPy (version 1.4.1), Statsmodels (version 0.11.1) and Lifelines (version 0.25.2) in Python 3.8.

### Can coffee or chewing gum decrease transit times in colon capsule endoscopy? A randomized controlled trial [^9debfb78]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Increasing the rate of complete CCE investigations is necessary for the implementation of CCE in clinical routine diagnostics. Chewing gum did improve the excretion rate in this study (not significantly), is cheap and has no known side effects; therefore the addition of chewing gum should be considered in future bowel preparation studies. The strong correlation between adequate bowel cleansing quality and complete investigations, suggests that an effective bowel preparation will improve both cleansing quality and completion rate and inspires to continue investigating bowel preparations for CCE.

In another systematic review and meta-analysis that only included ten randomized trials that were deemed "high quality", the use of chewing gum was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39–0.79) and faster time to first flatus (WMD − 0.31 days, 95% CI − 0.36 to − 0.26) and bowel movement (WMD − 0.47, 95% CI − 0.60 to − 0.34), but no difference in length of stay. However, the trials included in this meta-analysis suffered from many of the same limitations pertaining to heterogeneity and variable perioperative management strategies that were present in the prior studies. Nonetheless, the overall body of literature suggests that chewing gum may only have a small effect on gastrointestinal recovery without a clear effect on length of stay but is safe and not costly.

There are even some data to support the use of coffee to facilitate gastrointestinal recovery after colorectal surgery. Caffeine and coffee may stimulate the lower gastrointestinal tract and can potentially reduce postoperative ileus. A meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials including 606 patients reported that drinking coffee decreased the time to first bowel movement and toleration of oral intake, but did not reduce time to flatus, overall complications, or length of stay.

### Management of colonic diverticular disease in the third millennium: highlights from a symposium held during the United European Gastroenterology week 2017 [^8b92b173]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

What are the aims of treatment?

As mentioned above, the clinical spectrum of colonic diverticular disease is wide and ranges from asymptomatic diverticula to SUDD, uncomplicated diverticulitis and eventually, complicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the management, and the therapeutic approach are different, depending on the severity of the disease. Overall, prevention of progression, treatment of active disease and prevention of recurrence are the three key aims of treatment in any clinical manifestation of diverticular disease.

Asymptomatic diverticulosis does not need any pharmacologic treatment. However, healthy lifestyle (regular physical exercise, maintaining ideal body weight, abstention from smoking) and high-fiber diet are recommended to prevent its progression to SUDD and its complications. Most people with diverticulosis will not progress to symptomatic disease. The proportion of subjects with diverticulosis that eventually develop SUDD or acute diverticulitis is unknown. Consensus papers and reviews, state that 80–85% of subjects with diverticulosis will remain asymptomatic throughout their life, whereas 15–20% of symptomatic patients will suffer from diverticular disease without inflammation, while the remainder will have diverticulitis. However, estimates of progression need to be based on more reliable studies. One studyidentified 2222 patients with baseline diverticulosis. Over an 11-year follow-up period, 95 patients developed diverticulitis (4.3%; 6 per 1000 patient-years). The median time to event was 7.1 years.

Pharmacological treatment of SUDD should reduce intensity and frequency of symptoms and prevent the progression to diverticulitis, (Table 2). Most symptoms in SUDD are mild to moderate but they impair the patients' quality of life. Typical symptoms of SUDD include pain (in the lower or left lower quadrant of the abdomen), bloating and changes in bowel habits, symptoms also observed in patients with IBS; a differential diagnosis between these two clinical entities should therefore be attempted.

Table 2.
Aims of therapy in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

Progression to diverticulitis is uncommon and often benign. One prospective, long-term study, assessing the development of complications in patients with SUDD, pointed out that 97% of patients had mild or no symptoms after a median follow-up of 66 months. Acute diverticulitis appeared in only 2.5% of cases.

### Can coffee or chewing gum decrease transit times in colon capsule endoscopy? A randomized controlled trial [^70a2fb4f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A high rate of complete colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) investigations is required for a more widespread use of CCE. The objective of this study was to assess if coffee or chewing gum can increase excretion of the colon capsule within battery life time (excretion rate).

Methods

One hundred eighty six screening participants with a positive immunochemical fecal occult blood test were included in this single-centre randomized controlled trial with blinding of the investigators to the randomization. Participants received instant coffee, chewing gum or nothing in addition to the standard bowel preparation.

Results

The intention was to include 57 participants in the coffee group, 61 in the chewing gum group and 60 in the control group, on 8 participants data were missing. A total of 165 participants were included in a per protocol analysis. Exclusion was due to not receiving the allocated intervention (8 coffee, 4 chewing gum) and technical failure of the capsule (1 coffee). The excretion rate was 58% in the coffee group (n = 48), 63% in the chewing gum group (n = 57) and 55% in the control group (n = 60, p > 0.2). Transit times were similar in all groups. The excretion rate was low in participants who had transit times over 10 h (14%). A strong correlation was found between adequate cleansing and excretion of the capsule. There were no serious adverse events related to the interventions or CCE investigations.

Conclusions

Chewing gum and coffee did not improve excretion rate in this study. An effect of chewing gum could not be proven, possibly due to sample size. Since chewing gum might improve excretion rates, is cheap and has no known side effects, it needs to be considered in future bowel preparation trials for CCE.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^8a572a50]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

### Can coffee or chewing gum decrease transit times in colon capsule endoscopy? A randomized controlled trial [^dd45c357]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Methodologic limitations of this study are the exclusion of participants after randomization and unclear allocation of intervention in eight objects, which caused the coffee group to be smaller than the other groups; and the absence of a sample size calculation. The sample size of this study was not powered to prove a difference of 8%, therefore a significant effect cannot be demonstrated. This study might lack effect because the interventions were applied only once, whereas previous studies distributed the intervention multiple times. Additionally, the interventions were dependent on passage through the stomach, instead of planned on set times after ingestion of the capsule.

The exact physiologic effects of coffee and chewing gum on the bowel are still unknown. A study in healthy volunteers indicates that coffee increases the rectosigmoid motility in about a third of the individuals. Coffee has been shown to reduce time to first bowel movement after colorectal and gynecologic surgery by 9.4–15.4 h on average. A recent meta-analysis on the effect of chewing gum on postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery, including 1736 patients from 18 RCTs, observed a reduction of 16.4 h (95% confidence interval: − 22.7; − 10.2) of time to first bowel movement. One of the two studies in small bowel capsule endoscopy found a significant reduction of transit time. However this study was conducted as a pilot study without a sample size calculation. Both studies distributed chewing gum immediately after ingestion of the capsule and every 2 h afterwards. If coffee and chewing gum would have been applied immediately after ingestion of the capsule and repeated every 2–3 h afterwards, the effect of these interventions might have been stronger than demonstrated in this study.

### Gut microbiome composition and metabolic activity in women with diverticulitis [^f693f1ae]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

By leveraging a large-scale stool collection within a prospective cohort of health professionals spanning decades of follow-up, we were able to collect detailed information on lifestyle and dietary factors to minimize confounding for evaluating gut microbiome and metabolite alterations in diverticulitis, as well as to assess modulation effects of diet on diverticulitis by the gut microbiome. We used a previously validated instrument to ascertain diverticulitis that covered a full spectrum of disease severity. However, potential limitations should be noted. First, to facilitate large-scale microbiome analysis, we focused on stool microbiome, not mucosal. Studies have shown that the stool and mucosal microbial communities are clustered within individuals, and thus fecal samples can be used as a readily procured proxy for defining interpersonal differences in gut microbial ecology. In addition, relevant biopsies are difficult to obtain since colonoscopy is usually avoided during the acute episode of diverticulitis. Second, based upon the population-based design of our study, it was not feasible to access medical records for all cases of diverticulitis, which limited our ability to determine the exact timing of diagnosis for each individual. Thus, some cases might have been diagnosed before the time of stool collection. Future studies are warranted to examine the prospective role of the gut microbiome and metabolites in the development of diverticulitis. Third, we do not have accurate information on whether controls have diverticulosis or not. While prior colonoscopy-based studies have not identified a specific microbial signature in the mucosa of asymptomatic diverticulosis cases, we hypothesize that perturbations of gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity we observed may reflect changes relating to both formation and inflammation of diverticula. Finally, we examined the gut microbiome and metabolome in relation to diverticulitis only in women. The microbiome can vary between men and women, and there are certain female-specific risk factors for diverticulitis (e.g. menopausal hormone use). Further research involving men is necessary to validate our findings.

Our study offers evidence on alterations in gut microbiome composition, functions, and metabolic activity in diverticulitis, in particular those involved in inflammation and lipid metabolism. It proved to modulate dietary effects and corresponding metabolites relevant to diverticulitis. These results significantly expand our understanding of the pathogenesis of this understudied disease. Additional research, including validation among a broader range of populations and well-designed prospective investigations, holds the potential in advancing clinical care by enabling personalized microbiome-informed dietary interventions or therapeutic manipulation of gut microbiota for the prevention and treatment of diverticulitis.

AGA acute diverticulitis — aspirin use: The AGA suggests against routinely advising patients with a history of acute diverticulitis to avoid the use of aspirin (Conditional recommendation, very-low quality of evidence). Observational studies indicate a slightly increased risk of any episode of diverticulitis (relative risk, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.47) and a less certain estimate for complicated diverticulitis (relative risk, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–2.10); the guideline also notes modest protective effects on overall mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction tempered by a modest increase in gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Updates in the understanding and management of diverticular disease [^93f9f5ea]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diverticulosis leads to significant morbidity and mortality and is increasing in prevalence worldwide. In this paper, we review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of diverticular disorders, followed by a discussion of recent updates and changes in the clinical approach to diverticular disease.

Recent Findings

Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are likely not necessary for low-risk patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, and not all patients with recurrent diverticulitis require colectomy. Dietary restrictions do not prevent recurrent diverticulitis. Visceral hypersensitivity is increasingly being recognized as a cause of persistent abdominal pain after acute diverticulitis and should be considered along with chronic smoldering diverticulitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticula, and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

Summary

Clinicians should be aware that traditionally held assumptions regarding the prevention and management of diverticular disorders have recently been called into question and should adjust their clinical practice accordingly.

### Diverticulitis: a review [^b80db9c7]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of multiple outpouchings (diverticula) originating from the intestinal lumen. Diverticulitis is defined as inflammation of these diverticula. The annual incidence of diverticulitis in the US is approximately 180 per 100 000 people, resulting in approximately 200 000 hospital admissions annually and an estimated health care expenditure of more than $6.3 billion/year.

Observations

Risk factors for diverticular disease include age older than 65 years, genetic factors such as variant in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 (TNFSFI5) gene; connective tissue diseases such as polycystic kidney disease, Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; body mass index 30 or greater; use of opioids, steroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with diverticulosis will develop acute diverticulitis in their lifetime, which typically presents as left lower quadrant pain associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis. A contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan is the recommended diagnostic test and has a sensitivity of 98% to 99% and specificity of 99% to 100%. Approximately 85% of people with acute diverticulitis have uncomplicated diverticulitis (absence of abscess, colon strictures, colon perforation, or fistula formation). Management of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis consists of observation with pain management (typically acetaminophen) and dietary modification with a clear liquid diet. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with systemic symptoms such as persistent fever or chills, those with increasing leukocytosis, those older than 80 years, those who are pregnant, those who are immunocompromised (receiving chemotherapy, or high-dose steroids, or have received an organ transplant), and those with chronic medical conditions (such as cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes). First-line antibiotics consist of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or cefalexin with metronidazole. For patients who cannot tolerate oral intake, intravenous antibiotic therapy (ie, cefuroxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or ampicillin/sulbactam) is appropriate. Complicated diverticulitis is managed with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam and additional invasive management as indicated (ie, percutaneous drainage of associated intra-abdominal abscess or colon resection). Patients with generalized peritonitis should undergo emergent laparotomy with colonic resection. Postoperative mortality for diverticulitis managed electively or emergently is 0.5% for elective colon resection and 10.6% for emergent colon resection.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, diverticulitis affects approximately 180 per 100 000 people annually. For uncomplicated diverticulitis, first-line therapy is observation and pain control, and antibiotics should be initiated for patients with persistent fevers, increasing leukocytosis, sepsis or septic shock, advanced age, pregnancy, immunocompromise, and certain chronic medical conditions. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis includes intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam, and, if indicated, percutaneous drainage of abscess or resection of diseased segment of colon.

### Coffee consumption and health: umbrella review of meta-analyses of multiple health outcomes [^1ce4d3b1]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Liver and gastrointestinal outcomes

In addition to beneficial associations with liver cancer, all categories of coffee exposure were associated with lower risk for a range of liver outcomes. Any versus no coffee consumption was associated with a 29% lower risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (relative risk 0.71, 0.60 to 0.85), a 27% lower risk for liver fibrosis (odds ratio 0.73, 0.56 to 0.94), and a 39% lower risk for liver cirrhosis (0.61, 0.45 to 0.84). Coffee consumption was also associated with a lower risk of cirrhosis with high versus low consumption (0.69, 0.44 to 1.07)and one extra cup a day (relative risk 0.83, 0.78 to 0.88). Exposure to one extra cup a day was also significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality from cirrhosis (0.74, 0.59 to 0.86). In a single article, for meta-analyses of consumption and chronic liver disease, high versus low (0.35, 0.22 to 0.56), any versus none (0.62, 0.47 to 0.82), and one extra cup a day (0.74, 0.65 to 0.83) were all associated with benefit.

Coffee consumption was also consistently associated with significantly lower risk of gallstone disease. A non-linear dose response was also apparent, though risk sequentially reduced as consumption increased from two to six cups a day. High versus low consumption was associated with a marginally higher risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, but this did not reach significance.

Metabolic disease

Coffee consumption was consistently associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes for high versus low consumption (relative risk 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.75)and one extra cup a day (0.94, 0.93 to 0.95). There was some evidence for a non-linear dose-response, but the risk was still lower for each dose of increased consumption between one and six cups. Consumption of decaffeinated coffee also seemed to have similar associations of comparable magnitude. For metabolic syndrome high versus low coffee consumption was associated with 9% lower risk (0.91, 0.86 to 0.95). High versus low consumption was also significantly associated with a lower risk of renal stonesand gout.

### Paradigm shift: the copernican revolution in diverticular disease [^6f6507d4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diverticular disease (DD) is an umbrella definition that includes different clinical conditions ranging from diverticulosis to severe and potentially life-threatening complications. In the last decade, new concepts regarding pathogenetic alterations have been developed, while the diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic approaches to the management of DD patients have changed. The protective role of dietary factors (i.e. fiber) has been questioned, whilst some drugs widely used in clinical practice have been found to have a deleterious effect. The use of antibiotics in all patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was reconsidered, as well as the need for a surgical approach in these patients. Conflicting recommendations in different guidelines were proposed for the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated DD. An endoscopic classification of DD was introduced, and a "curative" endoscopic approach has been pioneered. Based on these observations, which together amount to a kind of "Copernican revolution" in the management of DD patients, we performed a comprehensive and critical reappraisal of the proposed modifications, aiming to discriminate between certainties and doubts on this issue.
