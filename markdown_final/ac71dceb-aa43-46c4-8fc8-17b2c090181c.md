## Question

How do you work up a 55-year-old man with loss of hair anteriorly in￼ temporal area

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating a 55-year-old man with anterior temporal hair loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis and which entities are most likely versus must-not-miss. Then, I should verify the key history elements that separate scarring from nonscarring alopecia and guide testing. Next, I will examine the scalp systematically, including trichoscopy, to look for diagnostic clues. After that, I need to check which laboratory tests are actually indicated and which are low-yield. Then, I should confirm when and how to perform a scalp biopsy. Finally, I will synthesize likely diagnoses and outline initial management and follow-up, making sure I double-check guideline-based therapies and counseling points along the way.

> Let me first confirm the most likely diagnosis in a 55-year-old man with anterior temporal hair loss: androgenetic alopecia (AGA) remains the leading consideration because of its high prevalence and characteristic bitemporal recession pattern, though I should not jump to conclusions without excluding mimics and scarring processes that can permanently destroy follicles if missed [^115vwv6A] [^116rT5Jn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to build a prioritized differential. Nonscarring mimics include alopecia areata (AA), telogen effluvium (TE), and tinea capitis, while scarring mimics include frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), fibrosing alopecia in a pattern distribution (FAPD), lichen planopilaris (LPP), discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), with CCCA less likely in isolated temporal disease but still important in skin of color presentations; I should also keep rare entities like temporal triangular alopecia in mind, though it typically presents in childhood, and remember that neoplastic mimics such as desmoplastic melanoma can rarely present as alopecic patches and warrant biopsy if the course is atypical or refractory [^111WWcTw] [^111mgpeS] [^113f4CbC] [^114Bi12g].

> Next, I should review the history elements that most efficiently separate scarring from nonscarring alopecia. I need to ask about onset and tempo (sudden versus gradual), symptoms such as pruritus, burning, or pain that suggest inflammation, and whether there has been hair regrowth or complete loss in patches; I should also screen for triggers like recent stressors, surgeries, febrile illnesses, or medications for TE, and ask about family history of pattern hair loss and autoimmune disease; finally, I should assess psychosocial impact and quality of life because guidelines for AA emphasize documenting disease burden and baseline photography for longitudinal assessment [^1174KEDN] [^114YsgQZ] [^112Y1Dzn].

> I will now examine the scalp systematically, starting with global pattern recognition and then moving to targeted bedside tests. Let me first confirm whether the hair loss is patterned (frontotemporal recession with possible vertex involvement) versus patchy, and whether there are signs of scarring such as loss of follicular ostia, perifollicular erythema, scale, or papules; a gentle hair pull test can help distinguish active shedding (positive in TE, AA, and early AGA) from inactive disease, and trichoscopy can reveal diagnostic clues like hair diameter diversity and peripilar signs in AGA, yellow dots, black dots, and exclamation mark hairs in AA, and perifollicular erythema/scale with loss of ostia in scarring alopecias; I should also inspect eyebrows, beard, and body hair because FFA often involves these sites [^112Y1Dzn] [^114C6B4z] [^111dWpnn] [^116mXpQZ].

> Wait, let me verify the role of laboratory testing so I don't over-order. Routine labs are not required for straightforward AGA; I should reserve testing for atypical presentations, diffuse shedding, or suspected systemic disease. If there is diffuse hair loss or systemic symptoms, a basic screen with CBC, ferritin, TSH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D is reasonable; if there are AA features or autoimmune comorbidities, I should consider ANA and thyroid antibodies; if there are signs of hyperandrogenism in women, targeted androgens may be indicated, but in men with classic AGA, endocrine testing is usually unnecessary unless there are red flags; I should double-check that these principles align with primary care and dermatology guidance [^114C6B4z].

> I need to ensure I do not miss a scarring process, so I should confirm when to biopsy. Indications include diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, signs of inflammation or scarring, or failure to respond to appropriate therapy; a 4 mm punch from the active edge provides the best yield, and I should request horizontal sections for follicular counts and vertical sections for inflammatory patterns, with clinicopathologic correlation guiding the final diagnosis; if I suspect a lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia like FFA or LPP, I should ask the pathologist to evaluate for perifollicular fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrates, and if I suspect DLE, I should request direct immunofluorescence on a second biopsy [^113pwuv6] [^113pwuv6] [^11383ZvA].

> Let me synthesize likely diagnoses based on age and pattern. In a 55-year-old man with anterior temporal thinning, AGA is most likely, characterized by progressive bitemporal recession and sometimes vertex involvement, with trichoscopy showing hair diameter diversity and peripilar signs; AA can mimic this with smooth, well-demarcated patches and exclamation mark hairs, and a case report even described AA sparing white hairs, which is a useful diagnostic clue; FFA is less common in men but should be suspected with frontotemporal recession plus eyebrow loss, perifollicular erythema/scale, and loss of ostia; FAPD presents with features of both AGA and a lymphocytic scarring process and may require biopsy to confirm; CCCA typically involves the vertex with peripilar halos and loss of ostia and is less likely in isolated temporal disease, but I should keep it in mind in Black patients or when symptoms of itch/burn are prominent [^115vwv6A] [^117JYT75] [^116mXpQZ] [^114LSp1C] [^111mgpeS].

> Now, I should outline initial management while I confirm the diagnosis. For AGA, evidence-based first-line therapy is topical minoxidil 5% solution or foam twice daily plus oral finasteride 1 mg daily, with counseling that response may take 6 to 12 months and that continued therapy is required to maintain benefit; I should also discuss expectations, potential adverse effects, and the possibility of combining therapies for enhanced results; for AA, first-line options include potent topical corticosteroids or intralesional triamcinolone for limited disease, with guideline-directed escalation if needed; for suspected FFA or other primary cicatricial alopecias, I should initiate anti-inflammatory therapy promptly and consider biopsy to confirm, as delays risk permanent follicle loss [^113uXUEV] [^1123idF7] [^1128QVqU] [^1149PdoL].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or refractory? I should double-check for red flags such as ulceration, neurologic symptoms, or failure to respond to appropriate therapy, which should prompt reconsideration of the differential and a low threshold for biopsy to exclude mimics like neoplasia or deep inflammatory disorders; in parallel, I should document baseline photographs and consider validated severity tools for AA to track response and guide shared decision-making [^113f4CbC] [^114YsgQZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and patient education are explicit. Reassessment at 3 to 6 months allows me to verify treatment response, reinforce adherence, and adjust therapy; I should counsel that AGA is chronic and progressive, so maintenance therapy is typically lifelong, and that both minoxidil and finasteride require continued use to preserve benefit; for AA, I should screen for psychological distress and quality-of-life impact and offer supportive resources, aligning with BAD guidance on holistic care [^115vwv6A] [^1127EWGM] [^115QJCaU].

In a 55-year-old man with anterior temporal hair loss, the most likely diagnosis is **androgenetic alopecia (AGA)** [^115vwv6A], characterized by bitemporal recession and frontal thinning [^116rT5Jn]. Key mimics include **alopecia areata** (smooth, well-demarcated patches with exclamation-mark hairs) [^117JYT75], **frontal fibrosing alopecia** (scarring with eyebrow loss) [^116mXpQZ], and **temporal triangular alopecia** (congenital, stable, triangular patch) [^114Bi12g]. Workup should start with a **focused history and exam** [^112Y1Dzn], including hair-pull and dermoscopy [^114C6B4z]; order CBC, ferritin, TSH, and 25(OH)D if diffuse shedding or systemic symptoms are present [^113pwuv6]. If the diagnosis is uncertain or scarring is suspected, perform a 4-mm punch biopsy [^113pwuv6] with horizontal and vertical sections [^115a1uSC]. Management is based on the diagnosis: topical minoxidil and oral finasteride for AGA [^1123idF7]; intralesional steroids for alopecia areata [^117JYT75]; and anti-inflammatory therapy for scarring alopecias [^111mgpeS].

## Clinical evaluation

### History

- **Onset and progression**: Gradual (AGA) vs sudden (AA, TE) [^115vwv6A] [^115dMVro].
- **Family history**: AGA, AA, TTA [^116rT5Jn] [^1174KEDN].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Weight change, fatigue, rash (TE, AA, FFA) [^notfound].
- **Medications**: Anticoagulants, antithyroids, beta-blockers, retinoids (TE) [^116rT5Jn].
- **Hair care practices**: Traction, chemicals, heat (traction alopecia) [^notfound].

---

### Physical examination

- **Hair-pull test**: Positive in AA, TE, active AGA [^117AHKkD].
- **Dermoscopy**: Miniaturization (AGA), exclamation hairs (AA), loss of ostia (FFA) [^111dWpnn].
- **Scalp**: Erythema, scale, pustules, scarring [^111mgpeS].
- **Eyebrows/beard**: Loss suggests FFA or AA [^116mXpQZ].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Routine labs are not required for typical AGA; **obtain CBC, ferritin, TSH, and 25(OH)D** if diffuse shedding or systemic symptoms are present [^notfound]. Consider **testosterone/DHEAS** only when features of androgen excess are present [^112bdEqK].

---

## Indications for scalp biopsy

Biopsy is indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain, scarring alopecia is suspected, or atypical features are present. Use a **4-mm punch** at the active edge, and request horizontal and vertical sections [^115dMVro] [^1158brMt] [^113f4CbC].

---

## Management strategies

| **Diagnosis** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Androgenetic alopecia | - Topical **minoxidil 5% BID** [^113uXUEV] <br/> - Oral **finasteride 1 mg daily** [^1128QVqU] <br/> - Consider **hair transplantation** [^1152Gtfi] |
| Alopecia areata | - Intralesional **triamcinolone** [^117JYT75] <br/> - Topical **corticosteroids** [^1149PdoL] <br/> - Consider **JAK inhibitors** for extensive disease [^115KSkpq] |

| Temporal triangular alopecia | - Observation <br/> - Hair transplantation for cosmetic reasons [^notfound] |
| Telogen effluvium | - Identify and **treat trigger** [^115dMVro] <br/> - Reassurance <br/> - Supportive **care** [^notfound] |

---

## Patient education and counseling

Emphasize the **chronic, progressive nature** of AGA and the need for ongoing therapy [^115vwv6A]. Discuss potential adverse effects and set realistic expectations [^112cSSbz]. Address psychological impacts and consider support groups [^113T3BQP].

---

A 55-year-old man with anterior temporal hair loss most likely has AGA, but AA, FFA, and TTA must be considered. Use **history, exam, dermoscopy, and selective labs** to distinguish these entities, and proceed to biopsy if the diagnosis is uncertain or scarring is suspected [^116mbCMe]. Management is diagnosis-specific, with minoxidil and finasteride for AGA, intralesional steroids for AA, and anti-inflammatory therapy for FFA [^116X5Hed].

Case description

A 55-year-old man presented to dermatology clinic with a smooth alopecic patch on the right temporal scalp of 4 months' duration. He additionally reported a history of hair loss on the frontal scalp that started 6 months after a left partial hemi-glossectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in 2011. Physical exam revealed a 5.5-centimeter circular alopecic patch on the right temporal scalp with white hairs preserved throughout the patch and rare exclamation point hairs around the periphery. Follicular ostia were preserved. Treatment was initiated with 0.6 mL of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injected intradermally at a concentration of 10 mg/mL on 2 occasions 6 weeks apart. A photo taken 6 weeks after the initial treatment demonstrated regrowth of pigmented hair in small tufts throughout the alopecic patch (Fig 1).

### How to diagnose hair loss [^113pwuv6]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

This review presents a systematic approach to the diagnosis of hair loss. An accurate diagnosis is based on history, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and scalp biopsy. Whether the hair loss is a cicatricial or noncicatricial alopecia guides one's history taking. After assessing the patient's global appearance, the hair and scalp are evaluated, aided by a hair pull, hair tug, Hair Card, and hair mount. Scalp biopsies can confirm a diagnosis and are essential in all cases of cicatricial alopecia. In all patients with hair loss a complete blood count, ferritin, thyroid stimulating hormone, and vitamin D 25OH should be ordered.

### Approach to the adult female patient with diffuse nonscarring alopecia [^112VaZaR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Alopecias are traditionally categorized by the presence or absence of scarring and by a diffuse or localized pattern. A common clinical conundrum is that of a woman presenting with the chief complaint of diffuse, nonscarring hair loss. We review the 4 main diagnostic possibilities for this clinical scenario: (1) female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia), (2) acute and chronic telogen effluvium, (3) diffuse alopecia areata, and (4) loose anagen syndrome. We also outline our approach to the individual patient, emphasizing the pertinent history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing. This approach usually allows the clinician to make a definitive diagnosis or limited differential diagnosis and to offer the patient therapeutic options.

### Evaluation and diagnosis of the hair loss patient: part I. history and clinical examination [^112Y1Dzn]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Hair loss (alopecia) is a common problem and is often a major source of distress for patients. The differential diagnosis of alopecia includes both scarring and nonscarring alopecias. In addition, many hair shaft disorders can produce hair shaft fragility, resulting in different patterns of alopecia. Therefore, an organized and systematic approach is needed to accurately address patients' complaints to achieve the correct diagnosis. Part 1 of this 2-part continuing medical education article on alopecia describes history taking and the clinical examination of different hair loss disorders. It also provides an algorithmic diagnostic approach based on the most recent knowledge about different types of alopecia.

### Lessons from a scoping review: clinical presentations of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia [^117HtfqT]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) nomenclature describes a typical clinical presentation of cicatricial hair loss that begins on the vertex scalp with progressive, symmetric, and centrifugal evolution. However, atypical presentations have been noted clinically by the authors and reported in the literature.

Objective

We sought to characterize the distribution of hair loss in published cases of adult patients with CCCA.

Methods

A 3-step search process was used to evaluate research articles in Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health, EMBASE, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Studies with scalp photography or description of hair loss distribution were included. Three researchers evaluated eligible studies for clinical subtypes. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review was used to report results.

Results

Ninety-nine studies consisting of 281 cases of CCCA were included. Hair loss distributions included variants of the classic presentation along with distinct subtypes such as patchy, occipital, parietal, frontal, temporal, and trichorrhexis.

Limitations

Studies had significant homogeneity, as the classic distribution of CCCA was commonly reported. Additionally, clinically diagnosed cases may have concurrent diagnoses, and numerous studies did not report trichoscopy findings.

Conclusion

CCCA terminology may not always be reflective of clinical presentation. Understanding atypical presentations is essential to inform appropriate and targeted treatment.

### How not to get scar (r) ed: pointers to the correct diagnosis in patients with suspected primary cicatricial alopecia [^112UQQ4y]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary cicatricial alopecias (PCAs) are a rare, but important, group of disorders that cause irreversible damage to hair follicles resulting in scarring and permanent hair loss. They may also signify an underlying systemic disease. Thus, it is of paramount importance that clinicians who manage patients with hair loss are able to diagnose these disorders accurately. Unfortunately, PCAs are notoriously difficult conditions to diagnose and treat. The aim of this review is to present a rational and pragmatic guide to help clinicians in the professional assessment, investigation and diagnosis of patients with PCA. Illustrating typical clinical and histopathological presentations of key PCA entities we show how dermatoscopy can be profitably used for clinical diagnosis. Further, we advocate the search for loss of follicular ostia as a clinical hallmark of PCA, and suggest pragmatic strategies that allow rapid formulation of a working diagnosis.

### Pattern hair loss in men: diagnosis and medical treatment [^111Tv1nD]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia is a common cause of hair loss in both men and women. The exact pathogenesis of androgenetic alopecia is not well understood. As the name implies, the role of androgens and genetic susceptibility predisposes to pattern hair loss due to gradual conversion of terminal hair into vellus hair. Male and female pattern hair loss are clinically distinct entities but histologically indistinguishable. The role of sex hormones in females is less understood. This article discusses current understanding of the etiopathogenesis of hair loss in men, diagnostic tests available, and its medical management.

### Diffuse hair loss in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus [^114LSp1C]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA)
B. Alopecia Areata
C. Lupus hair
D. Fibrosing alopecia with a pattern distribution (FAPD)
E. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)

Answers:

A. FFA – Incorrect. The clinical presentation does not support this diagnosis. Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia characterized by frontotemporal and eyebrow hairloss.FFA is also associated with facial papules. FFA has been reported to occur rarely in both discoid lupus and systemic lupus erythematosus.
B. Alopecia Areata – Incorrect. Diffuse alopecia areata may be a mimicker clinically, however the classic histopathology would not show a scarring alopecia. There would be absence of perifollicular fibrosis and there would be a lymphocytic cell infiltrate around the anagen bulb.
C. Lupus hair – Incorrect. Lupus hair is characterized by dry and fragile short hairs on the frontal hair-line in patients with SLE, giving the appearance of vellus hairs on the anterior scalp.
D. FAPD – Correct. FAPD is a lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia that has been recently described and has overlapping clinical and histopathologic features of FFA and androgenetic alopecia. Our patient has hair loss in a frontoparietal distribution with histopathology showing lymphocytic infiltrate around the infundibular region of the hair follicle, perifollicular lamellar fibrosis, and miniaturized hair follicles which makes FAPD most likely.FAPD occurs more frequently in postmenopausal women than men. White patients are more commonly affected, but FAPD has been reported in Hispanic individuals and those of African descent.
E. DLE – Incorrect. Discoid lupus can cause a scarring alopecia characterized by violaceous atrophic plaques with follicular plugging and dyspigmentation. Histopathology shows interface dermatitis, basement membrane thickening, lymphohistiocytic infiltration around vessels and appendages, mucin deposition, and follicular keratotic plugs.

### Hair loss: diagnosis and treatment [^115vwv6A]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on androgenetic alopecia:

- **Definition**: Androgenetic alopecia, also known as male or female pattern baldness, is a common form of hair loss in both genders.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of androgenetic alopecia involves both genetic and hormonal factors. The condition is known to depend on the presence of the androgen dihydrotestosterone and a genetic predisposition, with the androgen receptor gene playing a significant role.
- **Epidemiology**: Androgenetic alopecia is estimated to affect about 0.2–2% of the population worldwide.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for androgenetic alopecia include a genetic predisposition, specifically a susceptibility locus at chromosome 20p11.22, advancing age, and hormonal influences.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, it is characterized by a progressive loss of hair, with a specific pattern of baldness. In men, it often presents as hairline recession at the temples and balding at the top of the head. In women, it typically manifests as a general thinning of hair across the entire scalp, with preservation of the frontal hairline.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of androgenetic alopecia is chronic and progressive. While treatments can slow the progression and improve hair density, there is currently no known cure. The hair loss typically continues over time.

### Trichodystrophies: a hair-raising differential diagnosis [^115wz23p]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The appearance of an individual's hair is said to be reflective of internal health. Patients with hair shaft disorders commonly present with fragile, lusterless, sparse hair in addition to psychosocial distress. Hair shaft disorders may be hereditary or acquired and may present in children or adults. Due to the varied presentations, the differential diagnosis for hair is broad and often confusing. The authors present a question-by-question guide to help clinicians arrive at the correct diagnosis.

### Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) part I-diagnosis and clinical presentation [^116mXpQZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia (FFA) is a primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia predominantly affecting postmenopausal Caucasian women. It is characterized by a progressive frontotemporal hairline recession that presents as a scarring hairless band and is often accompanied by eyebrow and body hair loss. Although initially described in postmenopausal women, FFA has been observed in a broader demographic, including premenopausal women and occasionally men. The etiology remains elusive, with potential factors including genetic predisposition, hormonal influences, and chemical exposures playing a role. FFA exhibits a slow and distinctive progression, which sets it apart from other hair loss conditions. Apart from environmental factors, improved recognition and increased awareness have contributed to the growing number of diagnosed cases worldwide, a trend characterized by some as epidemic. In this CME article, part I, we provide a comprehensive review of FFA, encompassing its historical background, demographic features, clinical subtypes, trichoscopy findings, and diagnostic criteria.

### Desmoplastic melanoma presenting as an alopecic patch in a young patient [^113f4CbC]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Previously, 4 cases have reported DM presenting as scar-like alopecia. The first identified a 50-year-old man with a localized erythematous patch of hair loss on the left frontal scalp. Three cases presented with alopecic patches of a few months' duration; the differential included alopecia areata, discoid systemic lupus erythematosus, and lichen planus. After failure to respond to standard therapy, 2 patients underwent biopsy followed by wide local excision of the primary lesion. A third patient sought surgical treatment at an outside facility but was lost to follow-up, while the fourth patient underwent radiation therapy vs surgery due to lesion size. A few patients experienced multiple recurrences and even neurotropism in the first reported case with involvement of the trigeminal nerve, emphasizing risk of neurologic involvement.

While an atypical presentation of DM further complicates a clinically challenging diagnosis, our patient lacked previous malignancy or evidence of similar lesions elsewhere that would raise suspicion for a neoplastic/metastatic etiology of his alopecia. Further, our patient had a history of pilar cysts requiring repeated incision and drainage locally and at the site of concern. Despite the high probability for a benign cause, the expedient primary care provider referral to dermatology played a formative role in the timely detection of his DM. Additionally, high clinical suspicion by his primary dermatologist led to prompt biopsy as opposed to further clinical trials of topical or injectable therapies. This underscores the importance of tissue sampling in cases of alopecia with an atypical clinical course.

### Guidelines for clinical trials of frontal fibrosing alopecia: consensus recommendations from the international FFA cooperative group (IFFACG) [^113AAAip]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) has become one of the most common causes of cicatricial alopecia worldwide. However, there is a lack of clear aetiology and robust clinical trial evidence for the efficacy and safety of agents currently used for treatment.

Objectives

To enable data to be collected worldwide on FFA using common criteria and assessment methods.

Methods

A multicentre, international group of experts in hair loss was convened by email to create consensus recommendations for clinical trials. Consensus was defined at > 90% agreement on each recommended part of these guidelines.

Results

Standardized diagnostic criteria, severity rating, staging, and investigator and patient assessment of scalp hair loss and other clinical features of FFA were created.

Conclusions

These guidelines should allow the collection of reliable aggregate data on FFA and advance efforts in both clinical and basic research to close knowledge gaps in this condition.

### Trichoscopy of the beard: aid tool for diagnosis of frontal fibrosing alopecia in men [^116EYowT]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

We describe a case of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) in a man. Beard trichoscopy can help us make the differential diagnosis with androgenetic alopecia in difficult cases.

A healthy 58-year-old man presented to our dermatology service with a 5-year history of diffuse progressive alopecia involving frontotemporal and parietal areas. Clinical evaluation exposed alopecic patches of the beard (Fig 1).

### Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia in black men: a case series highlighting key clinical features in this cohort [^111mgpeS]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical examination often reveals loss of follicular ostia between hair shafts, which is characteristic of cicatricial alopecias. The most common and specific trichoscopy finding is peripilar white or gray halos, which was seen in all our patients (Fig 2). Other trichoscopy findings include a honeycomb pigmented network interrupted by irregular white patches, follicular papules and pustules, perifollicular erythema, and scale. The peripilar white-gray halos seen using trichoscopy are often correlated with the histologic finding of perifollicular fibrosis surrounding the outer root sheath. Additional histologic features of CCCA include lymphocytic infiltrate, follicular dropout, and premature degeneration of the inner root sheath (Fig 6).

CCCA and AGA have overlapping clinical and trichoscopic features that can lead to misdiagnosis (Table I). Both CCCA and AGA can present initially as hair thinning on the vertex scalp; however, the limited extent of hairline recession in CCCA contrasts the more extensive recession of the frontotemporal scalp in AGA (Figs 4 and 5). Unlike the Norwood Hamilton scale for male pattern hair loss, wherein patients demonstrate progressive bitemporal thinning prior to notable vertex scalp hair loss, our series of men had relative retention of the temporal hairline. This may be a useful clue for distinguishing CCCA from AGA clinically, considering their potential overlap and concurrent existence, because AGA is the leading form of alopecia in men. Patients with CCCA may also present with symptoms of itch, pain, or burning. Perifollicular erythema, follicular papules, and scaling are also more suggestive of a scarring process, with deep-red or violaceous hues often seen in darker skin types. The lack of inflammatory features in AGA can prompt clinicians to consider other types of alopecia, such as CCCA, while formulating a comprehensive differential. These 2 forms of alopecia can also be distinguished based on trichoscopy findings given the absence of follicular ostia is key to the scarring process in CCCA. There are no established diagnostic criteria for CCCA; therefore, clinicopathologic correlation is often necessary to differentiate AGA and CCCA or confirm the diagnosis in a concomitant case of both and aid in individualized management options for better outcomes. Although AGA may exist concomitantly with CCCA, especially in male patients, and therapies, such as minoxidil, can be used to increase hair density in both conditions, it is important to identify CCCA correctly to initiate additional anti-inflammatory therapy as soon as possible.

### Diagnosing and treating hair loss [^115dMVro]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Physicians should be careful not to underestimate the emotional impact of hair loss for some patients. Patients may present with focal patches of hair loss or more diffuse hair loss, which may include predominant hair thinning or increased hair shedding. Focal hair loss can be further broken down into scarring and nonscarring. Scarring alopecia is best evaluated by a dermatologist. The cause of focal hair loss may be diagnosed by the appearance of the patch and examination for fungal agents. A scalp biopsy may be necessary if the cause of hair loss is unclear. Alopecia areata presents with smooth hairless patches, which have a high spontaneous rate of resolution. Tinea capitis causes patches of alopecia that may be erythematous and scaly. Male and female pattern hair losses have recognizable patterns and can be treated with topical minoxidil, and also with finasteride in men. Sudden loss of hair is usually telogen effluvium, but can also be diffuse alopecia areata. In telogen effluvium, once the precipitating cause is removed, the hair will regrow.

### A nonhealing scalp ulceration in a patient with a history of herpes zoster infection [^111DVhMF]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 63-year-old male smoker presented with a nonhealing, enlarging wound on his right parietal scalp and an associated 2-month history of pruritus and "needle-like" pains. Medical history was significant for a herpes zoster eruption in the same area 7 months prior, treated with acyclovir. Examination found right-sided facial asymmetry with alopecia of the eyebrow, a sharply demarcated scalp ulceration with exposed periosteum, an angulated erosion at the anterior border of the ulcer, and another angulated erosion over the right medial eyebrow (Figs 1 and 2). Laboratory values showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. The patient's vital signs and the remainder of systemic examination were unremarkable.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Recurrent herpes zoster infection
B. Basal cell carcinoma
C. Temporal arteritis
D. Pyoderma gangrenosum
E. Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS)

Answers:

A. Recurrent herpes zoster infection – Incorrect. Recurrent infection with herpes zoster is uncommon in immunocompetent individuals and does not produce the ulcerations and disfigurement seen in this patient.
B. Basal cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Although basal cell carcinoma is common on the head and neck and may present as an ulcerative plaque if untreated, the clinically sharp, angulated margins make this diagnosis unlikely.
C. Temporal arteritis – Incorrect. Temporal arteritis is a systemic vasculitis that commonly presents with headache and jaw claudication, not seen in this patient. Additionally, cutaneous manifestations are rare.
D. Pyoderma gangrenosum – Incorrect. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis that initially presents as a papule and rapidly develops into an ulcer with overhanging violaceous borders. It most commonly affects the trunk or lower extremities and is regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion.
E. TTS – Correct. This patient presents with altered sensation and self-induced trauma after trigeminal nerve injury from a previous varicella zoster infection. TTS can result from trigeminal nerve or brainstem nuclei damage, most commonly from iatrogenic causes, but other causes include herpes infection, stroke, or trauma. Nerve injury results in paresthesia, prompting patients to reflexively scratch the affected area and cause self-induced ulcerations. The patient's history of a prior herpes zoster infection in the same dermatomal distribution as the presenting ulcerations along with neuropathic pain is consistent with TTS. TTS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and laboratory tests and biopsies are often ordered to differentiate it from other dermatologic diseases.

### Inverse androgenic alopecia [^112tzyVk]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A man in his 50s presented to our clinic with obvious progressive hair thinning in the occipital area below the creeping alopecia crown vertex accompanied by the typical Hamilton-Norwood pattern of male androgenetic alopecia (MAGA) hair loss. Based on his clinical features, trichoscopy findings and histological features, as well as his good response to conventional anti-MAGA therapeutic drugs, such as finasteride and minoxidil, a novel isotype of MAGA, named inverse-MAGA, was first identified, and this isotype should be widely evaluated in future studies.

### How real is senescent alopecia? A histopathologic approach [^111vCbLA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Senescent alopecia was originally thought to affect people aged 50 years or older with no family history or evidence of pattern balding. It was described as a diffuse thinning involving the whole scalp due to a steady decrease in thick terminal hairs, but without evidence of increased miniaturization. Senescent alopecia is not a primary diagnosis in this clinic. Most possible examples of it are assumed to be androgenetic or diffuse alopecia. In the study reported here, horizontal sections of 2149 scalp specimens from individuals with male and female pattern and diffuse alopecia, as well as from normal controls, were examined, and their follicular counts were recorded and sorted into decades. The decade of 20 to 29 years contained a significant number of patients and was used for baseline follicular counts for comparison with all succeeding decades up to age 99 years. A reduction of 15% below baseline was considered significant. In 10.6% of patients with male pattern alopecia, the age of onset of a significant reduction in follicular counts was 50 years; in 5.7% of patients with female pattern alopecia it was 70 years, and in 2.0% of patients with diffuse alopecia it was 80 years. These data suggest that most cases of significant hair loss in the elderly are androgen driven. The few patients with deteriorating diffuse alopecia may be the exception. The study concluded that old age is not a significant cause of hair loss.

### Distinctive age distribution and hair loss pattern putatively highlighting uniqueness of Japanese cases of fibrosing alopecia in a pattern distribution [^111972cs]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fibrosing alopecia in a pattern distribution (FAPD) is a unique entity which presents clinicopathological characteristics of both male/female pattern androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and lichen planopilaris (LPP). This entity was first reported in 2000 and its criteria was recently proposed. Etiopathogenesis of FAPD has been speculated to be immunological destruction involving miniaturized hair follicles but still remains elusive. To date, few Asian FAPD cases have been reported in the literature. In this study, Japanese FAPD cases were identified based on the aforementioned criteria and analyzed to delineate clinicopathological characteristics. By retrospectively revisiting medical records and clinical photographs, 24 Japanese cases comprising 17 women and seven men were diagnosed as FAPD. All male patients had disease onset by their early 30s, whereas most female patients had developed the condition in middle age or later. Their initial diagnoses prior to the diagnostic confirmation of FAPD were mostly LPP. Based on the clinical phenotypes, the cases were categorized into AGA and LPP types. These subtypes were characterized by foremost trichoscopic and histopathological findings of AGA or LPP, respectively. Unlike previously reported cases, our patients tended to manifest hair loss in both vertex and frontal to mid-scalp with minimal regression of anterior hairline, manifesting unique "parachute" pattern, which has been reported as a representative characteristic of East Asian AGA in the literature. Anti-inflammatory therapies seemed to be effective to deter hair loss but insufficient to achieve improvement. Further accumulation of the cases is necessary; however, these findings may provide additional pathophysiological insights into FAPD and highlight uniqueness of the etiology and clinical phenotype of Japanese FAPD putatively influenced by racial predispositions.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

How Should This Man Be Evaluated?

Does This Man Have Clinically Evident Androgen Deficiency?

The first step is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap of the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Because of his report of depressed mood and fatigue, the patient was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool that screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is a key first step in the evaluation (Table 1). In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, 3 sexual symptoms (low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections) were the only symptoms (out of a total of 19 candidate symptoms) that were consistently associated with a low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion; diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. Of note, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Because reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations in the European Male Ageing Study might reflect reverse causation. In the European Male Aging Study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with a normal serum testosterone. His symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value. They may be caused by systemic disease (see below). However, the constellation of symptoms of sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone justify further evaluation for androgen deficiency.

Table 1.
Clinical features of testosterone deficiency in men

The patient lacks more specific clinical signs of hypogonadism (Table 1), but these findings, such as new-onset or increased gynecomastia that is almost always characterized by breast pain and tenderness, deficient male pattern body hair (that is generally only seen in longstanding hypogonadism), hot flashes that might occur with acute onset of hypogonadism (eg, bilateral orchidectomy), and/or small (< 15 cc) testes are not common in hypogonadal middle-aged or older men. Although small testes are an uncommon finding in older men with newly diagnosed hypogonadism, Klinefelter syndrome, the most common cause of classic organic hypogonadism, is typically characterized by very small testes (≤ 4 cc each), is underdiagnosed (by 50% or more), and might not be diagnosed until middle or older age.

### Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia in black men: a case series highlighting key clinical features in this cohort [^1158brMt]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Table I
Comparison of androgenetic alopecia and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia in Black men

Our 3 cases reveal that although CCCA has been predominant in Black women, it should also be considered in Black men. Our cases highlight a key clinical distinguishing feature of male CCCA, demonstrating notable thinning on the vertex scalp with relative maintenance of the hairline, a feature that is yet to be noted in previous literature and can help clinicians more easily differentiate this form of scarring alopecia in Black men from AGA. To our knowledge, there have only been 12 reported cases of CCCA in Black men in the literature. The paucity of published evidence of CCCA cases in Black men raises the following question: how common is misdiagnosis of CCCA for other alopecias? Our case series demonstrates the need for clinicians to thoroughly review symptoms as well as clinical and trichoscopic findings and have an appropriate threshold for scalp biopsy when there is concern for a scarring process. Our cases add to the limited, but now growing, evidence of CCCA in Black men and are a call for future studies to explore the clinical characteristics of CCCA and diagnostic outcomes in Black men.

### Scarring alopecia and scalp pruritus [^11383ZvA]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What further workup is warranted for the patient in this case?
A. Antinuclear antibodies with reflex extractable nuclear antigen antibodies and urinalysis
B. Serum protein electrophoresis/urine protein electrophoresis
C. Pulmonary function testing
D. Additional biopsy for direct immunofluorescence
E. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 to evaluate for associated autoimmune thyroid disease

Answers:

A. Antinuclear antibodies with reflex extractable nuclear antigen antibodies and urinalysis – Incorrect. These tests would be useful in screening for lupus and ruling out renal involvement when discoid lupus of the scalp is suspected.
B. Serum protein electrophoresis/urine protein electrophoresis – Incorrect. These are indicated in suspected multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and primary amyloidosis and associated dermatoses. Amyloidosis may cause hair loss in rare cases.
C. Pulmonary function testing – Correct. Sarcoidosis of the scalp is the cutaneous manifestation of a systemic disease. All patients with sarcoidosis should receive a pulmonary and cardiac evaluation.
D. Additional biopsy for direct immunofluorescence – Incorrect. Direct immunofluorescence is helpful in diagnosis of autoimmune blistering conditions that can cause scarring alopecia and differentiating chronic discoid lupus plaques from other inflammatory processes.
E. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 to evaluate for associated autoimmune thyroid disease – Incorrect. In a case of alopecia areata, these tests can be used to screen for associated autoimmune thyroid disease.

### Alopecia areata: disease characteristics, clinical evaluation, and new perspectives on pathogenesis [^117XccQW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, inflammatory, nonscarring type of hair loss. Significant variations in the clinical presentation of AA have been observed, ranging from small, well-circumscribed patches of hair loss to a complete absence of body and scalp hair. Patients affected by AA encompass all age groups, sexes, and ethnicities, and may experience frustration with the unpredictable nature of their disease for which there is currently no definitive treatment. The cause of AA remains incompletely understood, though it is believed to result-at least in part-from a loss of immune privilege in the hair follicle, autoimmune-mediated hair follicle destruction, and the upregulation of inflammatory pathways. Patients with AA frequently experience marked impairment in psychological well-being, self-esteem, and may be more likely to suffer from psychiatric comorbidities. Part one of this two-part continuing medical education series describes the epidemiology, clinical evaluation, prognosis, and recent advancements in the understanding of the pathogenesis of AA.

### Androgenetic alopecia [^116X5Hed]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or male pattern hair loss, affects approximately 50% of the male population. AGA is an androgen-related condition in genetically predisposed individuals. There is no treatment to completely reverse AGA in advanced stages, but with medical treatment (eg, finasteride, minoxidil, or a combination of both), the progression can be arrested and partly reversed in the majority of patients who have mild to moderate AGA. Combination with hair restoration surgery leads to best results in suitable candidates. Physicians who specialize in male health issues should be familiar with this common condition and all the available approved treatment options.

### Use of trichoscopy for the diagnosis of alopecia areata coexisting with primary scarring alopecia in a female hair loss patient [^116wvLBG]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite patchy hair loss being typically observed in alopecia areata (AA), similar lesions can be seen in other forms of alopecia and the diagnosis is sometimes challenging. Of note, patchy primary scarring alopecia (SA) needs to be clearly distinguished from AA as SA can leave permanent hair loss. Herein, we report a previously unreported case of AA coexisting with SA successfully diagnosed by detailed trichoscopic investigation. A 42-year-old woman visited us with patchy hair loss lesions on the scalp. On physical examination, alopecic lesions sized up to 2 cm in diameter were observed in the right temporal and parietal regions. A gentle hair pull test collected dystrophic anagen hairs from some patches. Trichoscopy detected tapering hairs and black dots. The diagnosis of AA was made. However, some reddish patches were totally hair pull test negative, urging us to further evaluate the remaining lesions. Additional trichoscopic investigation revealed the disappearance of follicular ostia and the presence of a white and milky-red area and peripilar scales, suggestive of SA. In histology, the clinically AA lesion showed peribulbar cell infiltration, while the potentially SA lesion demonstrated inflammatory cell infiltration around the isthmus and the decrease in hair follicles, some of which were replaced by fibrotic tissue. The final diagnosis of AA coexisting with SA was made. Intralesional corticosteroid injection improved AA but not SA. These findings emphasize the need for thorough trichoscopic examination for accurate diagnoses of rare hair loss conditions.

### Alopecias in lupus erythematosus [^116WYJ7w]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a chronic multiorgan autoimmune disease with a spectrum of clinical and serological presentations. The major target organs are the joints, skin, kidneys, lungs, and the nervous and serous systems, with ANA as the frequent hallmark antibody. At any point during the disease course of SLE, dermatological findings may be found in over 80% of patients. Certain presentations of LE on the skin and hair can aid in assessing, classifying and predicting systemic involvement.

Hair loss is a frequent occurrence in SLE and is present in more than half of the patients at some point during the course of the disease. Although several patterns of hair loss can exist in the setting of SLE, the aetiology is not always specific to LE (box 1). Determining whether alopecia is inherent to LE or just coincidental to LE is crucial because it has been included in several classification systems for SLE (table 1), including the latest Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria. Non-scarring alopecia, in particular, has been incorporated in the SLICC criteria because its specificity to SLE is high (95.7) in the derivation sample, and it met the standards of clinical consensus among experts. Non-scarring alopecia is clinically defined by the SLICC as diffuse thinning and fragility of the hair in the absence of other causes. Several processes that result in non-scarring alopecia must therefore be ruled out before attributing hair loss to LE (boxes 1 and 2).

Box 1
Alopecias in lupus erythematosus

Table 1
SLE criteria throughout the years with cutaneous features

Box 2
Differential diagnoses of alopecias

In this paper, we discuss an approach to recognising the different causes of hair loss that occur in LE and their differential diagnoses. The categorisation we employ is largely based on how scalp biopsy features are consistent with the diagnosis of LE. We also expand on the alternate diagnoses of non-scarring alopecia in LE. Certain points in the history and physical exam (which may necessitate the use of dermoscopy) can, in the majority of cases, lead the physician to make a confident diagnosis. However, non-scarring alopecia in SLE has a wide range of differential diagnoses (boxes 1 and 2) which can challenge a physician's clinical acumen. In a patient suspected to have SLE but with an unclear aetiology of hair loss, working closely with dermatologists and performance of ancillary tests such as a scalp biopsy, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and/or serological markers may be warranted.

### Transverse sections for diagnosis of alopecia? [^115oYu4Z]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2005). Low credibility.

Several authors have claimed usage of sections cut horizontally as being preferable to conventional cuts in vertical direction in the diagnosis of alopecias. In this article, we address in critical fashion, all statements that have been made in the literature that seem to favor sections cut horizontally in contrast to sections cut conventionally (ie, vertically) in coming to a diagnosis of diseases of the scalp. Our assessment reveals that the idea of horizontal sections being advantageous compared with sections cut vertically is based largely on the assumption that counting of follicles is the key to a diagnosis with specificity of diseases of the scalp. But a quantitative approach to diagnosis of alopecias is flawed; it does not allow differential diagnosis of common alopecias to be made with certainty. A qualitative approach, however, based on reliable and repeatable criteria applied in sections cut vertically, allows in most instances a diagnosis to be rendered precisely.

### Clinical patterns of hair loss in men: is dihydrotestosterone the only culprit? [^111kTsBk]. Dermatologic Clinics (2021). Medium credibility.

A number of pathways and factors including oxidative stress, inflammation, prostaglandins, vasculogenesis, Wnt/β-catenin, and transforming growth factor-β have been shown to be important in male androgenetic alopecia. There is limited but increasing evidence of the potential usefulness of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, prostaglandins, and growth factors for treating of androgenetic alopecia. Lifestyle factors and comorbidities including cardiovascular risk factors have been shown to be associated with male androgenetic alopecia. Further study of these pathways, factors, and comorbidities is needed to better understand the pathophysiology, find potentially useful therapeutic targets, and ensure a comprehensive approach to the management of androgenetic alopecia in men.

### Rapidly progressive diffuse fibrosing alopecia [^116psBHx]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 25-year-old man presented with progressive hair thinning for 3 years in July 2017. Physical and global examination showed that although scalp hair thinning was not very apparent at that time (Fig 1, A), small patches of hair loss similar to the pencil-eraser–sized areas of focal atrichia described by Olsenwere observed (Fig 1, B). The eyebrows, beard, armpit hair and pubic hair were sparse, and vellus hair of the limbs was absent. There were no lesions typical of lichen planus found elsewhere. Dermoscopic examination showed confluent white dots and loss of follicular ostia but no prominent hair miniaturization or high ratio of vellus hair (Fig 1, C). Results of complete blood count, liver function tests, free testosterone, syphilis IgG, thyroid function tests, antinuclear factor, and rheumatoid factor were either normal or negative. A scalp biopsy from the temporal aspect of the right scalp showed lichenoid folliculitis and concentric fibrosis around both the isthmus and infundibulum, with some follicles destroyed and replaced by connective tissue (Fig 1, D and E). Given the clinical manifestations and dermoscopic and histopathologic examination findings, a diagnosis of CPHL was rendered. The patient was treated with oral glycyrrhizin capsules, topical tacrolimus, and halometasone.

The first patient was a 60-year-old man with progressive hearing loss, tinnitus, recurrent episodes of otalgia, and otorrhea in his right ear during the last 2 years. The second patient was a 66-year-old man who presented with aural fullness in his right ear and a mild pain in the region of right mastoid. Mild hearing loss and episodes of dizziness with sensation of falling for about 6 months were reported in the clinical history.

Conclusions

The prognosis of EP is considered favorable in regard to the solitary bone plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma (MM). The differential diagnosis of EPs from other plasma cell dyscrasias and especially from MM is considered essential. It is a radiosensitive tumor and, especially for EPs of temporal bone, the combined treatment of surgery resection and postoperative radiation seems to provide the best local control and the lower risk of occurrence. The therapeutic strategy includes a close follow-up of the patients because of the risk of occurrence and/or dissemination into MM. The 10-year survival rate reaches 70% with the appropriate therapy.

### Linear alopecia areata [^116mzvcr]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, immune-mediated, nonscarring hair loss disorder. It typically presents with sharply demarcated round patches of hair loss and can be found in any age. Severe hair loss forms include alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis. AA may significantly affect a patient's quality of life. Here, we report a case of AA presenting a linear form of alopecia.

### Female pattern hair loss [^113T3BQP]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Female pattern hair loss is a common condition characterized by a diffuse reduction in hair density over the crown and frontal scalp with retention of the frontal hairline. The prevalence increases with advancing age. It has been widely thought to be the female counterpart of male balding and is often referred to as female androgenetic alopecia. However, the role of androgens is not fully established. Scalp hair loss is undoubtedly a feature of hyperandrogenism in women but many women with female pattern hair loss have no other clinical or biochemical evidence of androgen excess. Female pattern hair loss is probably a multifactorial genetically determined trait and it is possible that both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent mechanisms contribute to the phenotype. In managing patients with female pattern hair loss the physician should be aware that the adverse effects on quality of life can be quite severe and do not necessarily correlate with the objective degree of hair loss. The treatment options are currently limited but modest improvements in hair density are achievable in some women.

### Alopecias in lupus erythematosus [^117AHKkD]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Alopecia areata

There is an increased incidence of alopecia areata in LE which reflects their similar autoimmune nature. Circular and completely alopecic patches, devoid of erythema or scaling are the characteristic clinical features of AA (figure 6). A gentle hair pull test on the edges of the patch reveals dystrophic anagen hairs. Dermoscopy classically shows yellow dots, black dots and exclamation point hairs. A mononuclear cell infiltrate is typically found surrounding the anagen bulb, although this microscopic finding can also be found in patchy lupus alopecia and syphilitic alopecia. If deep dermal mucin deposition is found in addition to the usual biopsy features of alopecia areata, it might be reasonable to search for underlying SLE. Cases of tumid LEand lupus panniculitideshave been reported to be initially diagnosed as AA, pending histopathology. The prognosis of AA is different from the patchy alopecia in LE because AA can have an unpredictable course, whereas the patchy hair loss in LE responds favourably to immunosuppressive therapy.

Alopecia areata. Non-inflammatory circular patch of hair loss on the parietal scalp.

Ophiasis is more known as a rare form of alopecia areata in which the hairless region follows a band-like distribution along the parieto-temporo-occipital region. In LE, it can be both scarring or non-scarring. Although it is regarded as one of the major features that portend a poor prognosis in AA, there are no available data to say this risk is the same as for those with LE.

A previously healthy 24-year-old man presented with acute-onset vertigo after a recent tick bite sustained during a hiking trip. The initial illness included fever, malaise, headache, and neck stiffness, all of which resolved without treatment within 1 week. Days later, he developed persistent vertigo accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and imbalance, but without hearing loss or other focal neurologic deficits. Neurologic examination localized the lesion, and imaging confirmed the suspected site of involvement. Additional diagnostic testing identified an unusual abnormality correlating with the clinical findings. The patient was treated appropriately based on the findings, leading to complete resolution of symptoms and full recovery.

It is crucial that hair restoration surgeons understand the basic clinical diagnosis and pathologic condition of other hair loss conditions that are not always amenable to successful hair transplantation. In this article nonscarring and scarring mimickers of androgenetic alopecia are discussed. Nonscarring conditions include alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, and tinea capitis. Some of the more common scarring alopecias include lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. Less common inflammatory conditions include pseudopelade of Brocq, discoid lupus erythematosus, and folliculitis decalvans.

### Extensive facial scarring after ablative laser resurfacing in a patient with frontal fibrosing alopecia [^115fsY1f]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

FFA is a condition of scarring hair loss, with an increasing incidence being reported in the current literature. It is often a clinical diagnosis and has several distinct clinical features to guide the clinician toward a diagnosis. Laser procedures are increasingly common, with evidence-based efficacy and safety. In this article, we have presented the first known case, to our knowledge, of extensive facial scarring in a patient with undiagnosed FFA after an ablative erbium laser resurfacing procedure. We hope to illustrate the importance of recognizing FFA, or scarring alopecia in general, in patients presenting for laser therapy and avoiding ablative procedures to avoid potentially serious complications that may lead to potentially serious scarring.

### Update on primary cicatricial alopecias [^111fhh1D]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The cicatricial alopecias encompass a diverse group of disorders characterized by permanent destruction of the hair follicle and irreversible hair loss. Destruction of the hair follicle can result from primary, folliculocentric disease or as a secondary result. This article focuses on the former, or primary cicatricial alopecias. The cause and pathogenesis of many of these disorders are largely unknown. Although unique clinicopathologic features allow for accurate diagnosis in some cases, diagnostic certainty is often elusive and reflects the limits of present understanding. Classification of the primary cicatricial alopecias on the basis of pathology provides a diagnostic and investigational framework and, it is hoped, will facilitate future enlightenment. Details of classification, etiopathogenesis, clinicopathologic features, differential diagnosis, and practical management of the primary cicatricial alopecias will be discussed.

Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the following aspects of the primary cicatricial alopecias: (1) the new, consensus-issued classification scheme, (2) current understanding about etiopathogenesis, (3) salient clinicopathologic features, (4) differential diagnosis, and (5) therapeutic management.

### Approach to the patient: diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^112ipK59]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Diagnostic workup of Cushing syndrome. Flowchart is based on Lacroix et al. The likelihood ratios (LRs) for the first-line screening tests and scalp hair analysis concern pooled data from and findings from, respectively. LRs take sensitivity and specificity into account and determine the posttest probability given a certain pretest probability (higher LR + = increasing probability of disease with positive test result; lower LR - = decreasing probability of disease with negative test result). Abbreviations: CBG, cortisol-binding globulin; LR-, negative likelihood ratio; LR+, positive likelihood ratio.

CS is unlikely with normal test results; however, referral to an endocrinologist is recommended in patients with a high likelihood. In other cases, a reevaluation in 6 months should be considered if a patient has progressive features. An abnormal test result prompts further evaluation by an endocrinologist. Patients should be subsequently tested again with 1 or 2 first-line screening tests or a second-line screening test (eg, combined dexamethasone-CRH test or midnight serum cortisol) if necessary. The diagnosis of CS is established with concordant abnormal results indicating hypercortisolism. Further evaluation should be focused on identifying the underlying cause. Endogenous CS is unlikely with 2 normal test results and requires no further evaluation unless a cyclical CS or a (rare) glucocorticoid hypersensitivity is suspected. In the rare condition of increased glucocorticoid sensitivity, a clinical picture of CS is present, but laboratory tests show (borderline) low plasma and urinary cortisol values while responsiveness to ACTH (Cortrosyn) or metyrapone stimulation test and/or insulin-induced hypoglycemia is normal. An ultra-low-dose DST showing suppressed morning serum cortisol levels is also indicative of this rare condition, and functional testing of the glucocorticoid receptor or sequencing of the glucocorticoid receptor gene may be considered in specialized centers. In these cases, use of any type of exogenous corticosteroids should be ruled out or only use of low dosages equivalent to hydrocortisone replacement therapy or below with a history of development of cushingoid features after initiation. Primary glucocorticoid resistance, a rare genetic condition resulting mainly from mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor gene, would on the contrary yield abnormal test results. These patients present with symptoms of increased mineralocorticoid and/or androgen action, combined with biochemical hypercortisolism from compensatory overdrive of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, but lack of specific cushingoid features. This increased HPA-axis activity from the decreased peripheral glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity should be distinguished from pathological hypercortisolism from CS. In general, follow-up and further evaluation is recommended in the event of discordant results or high clinical suspicion of cyclical CS.

### Pilonidal sinus of the chin: mistreated as a dental fistula [^115ReVK3]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Pilonidal sinus is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with penetration of hair particles into the skin. It is rare in the chin area and, to our knowledge, there is only one such reported case. A 56-year-old man was previously admitted to a private clinic, with a hard mass on his anterior buccal sulcus. Three of the patient's teeth were extracted as the swelling was thought to be associated with a dental infection. Because the fistula did not resolve, the patient was referred to our department. Following radiological and clinical examinations, the hard mass was reached intraorally and hair shafts were seen inside it. The area was closed primarily after cleaning the inflammatory tissues and the hairs. The recovery period was uneventful. In this case report, we present a pilonidal sinus encountered in the chin area, the wrong treatment initially given to the patient and the subsequent treatment carried out by us.

2.3 Study participants

Eligible subjects were healthy 18–65-year-old males with self-reported hair thinning, AGA, TE, or hair loss occurring for more than 3 months prior to screening. Hair loss was confirmed by physical examination done by a certified dermatologist who excluded ineligible types of alopecia, hair, or scalp disease, and assigned a clinical diagnosis of AGA or TE, later confirmed by phototrichometry. AGA was determined clinically by observing hair thinning and miniaturisation in the region of the scalp that was consistent with the Hamilton-Norwood (HN) classification I–VII. AGA diagnosis was confirmed by phototrichogram analysis of diversity of TH diameters and then graded with the anisotrichosis score (the ratio of one standard deviation of TH diameters to the mean TH diameter) of more than 20% and a TH/VH ratio of < 4:1. TE was diagnosed by subject history including reports of self-reported thinning hair and shedding, by evaluating signs of general thinning or diffuse hair loss of the scalp, and by directly ruling out underlying treatable causes. Phototrichogram analysis of TH telogen rate greater than 20% was used to confirm the TE diagnosis. HN classification was assigned by the clinical dermatologist and verified from global photographs. For this trial, a primary diagnosis of AGA or TE was a prerequisite before subjects were randomised to a given study arm. As seen in Fig. 1, seventy-nine subjects were assessed; 50 deemed as eligible for enrolment in the trial with a primary diagnosis of AGA, and 46 subjects were further enroled and randomised.

### Update on trichoscopy: integration of the terminology by systematic approach and a proposal of a diagnostic flowchart [^111dWpnn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Trichoscopy represents a non-invasive diagnostic modality widely used in daily practice. Despite the common perception that this technique has been fairly established, some key issues remain to be addressed. Complexity and inconsistency in terminology in past literature are likely to confuse investigators when they are recording, reporting, and retrieving the findings. In addition, a diagnostic algorithm adopting sufficiently integrated and updated findings is not readily available. By adopting a systematic review approach, this review attempted to redefine major trichoscopic findings and integrate their synonyms individually into the most frequently used terms besides identifying and discussing terms which potentially cause confusion. The findings are categorized into five subgroups: hair shaft, follicular, perifollicular, scalp findings, and hair distribution pattern abnormalities. The calculation of sensitivities and positive predictive values of such redefined findings was conducted by reviewing the descriptions in the past literature on major hair diseases, including alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia/female pattern hair loss, telogen effluvium, trichotillomania, lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, discoid lupus erythematosus, folliculitis decalvans, tinea capitis, and dissecting cellulitis, to confirm the diagnostically meaningful findings for representative diseases. This attempt redefined, for instance, yellow dots, short vellus hairs, exclamation mark hairs, black dots, and broken hairs as the findings of diagnostic significance for alopecia areata and hair diameter diversity, peripilar sign, and focal atrichia for androgenetic alopecia/female pattern hair loss. An updated diagnostic flowchart is proposed with the instructions to maximize its usefulness. Current limitations and future perspectives of trichoscopy as well as other emerging non-invasive diagnostic modalities for hair diseases are also discussed.

### Clinical relevance of hair microscopy in alopecia [^115fad3u]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Hair microscopy can clarify the cause of hair loss in a range of diagnoses. Most of these are associated with hair breakage, the rest are related to lack of growth. Hair breakage may be due to excessive trauma or underlying susceptibility, where structural clues may be present. Lack of growth reflects follicular dynamics and represents the central mechanism of most common causes of alopecia. In such conditions, microscopy only reveals nonspecific confirmation of short anagen. Although this may assist clinical diagnosis, microscopy in alopecia only allows exclusion of diagnoses related to hair breakage. Confidence in the outcome of hair microscopy is based on the size of the sample of hairs, the length of the hair, the characteristics of the observations and the experience of the person undertaking the microscopy.

### Alopecia areata update [^117KsZ8D]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Alopecia areata (AA) is a common nonscarring alopecia. It affects 1.7% of the population at some point in their lives. AA is an autoimmune condition characterized by dense peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate. The exact cause and triggering factors are still unknown. The scalp is the most commonly affected area but any hair-bearing area can be involved. All available treatment options are neither curative nor preventive. This article will discuss updates in AA with focus on etiopathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment options and suggest treatment plans based on the age of the patient and extent of the disease.

### Three types of alopecia in one patient: a case of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, alopecia areata, and telogen effluvium [^112QfW3L]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are diverse types of alopecia, and patients often do not fit under a single diagnostic label. Patients may present with multiple overlapping forms of alopecia, complicating diagnosis and management. Notably, persons of African heritage frequently demonstrate a pattern of multiple concurrent forms of hair loss, often involving both scarring and nonscarring types. Genetic, inflammatory, mechanical, and environmental factors can influence patterns of hair loss. Underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in patients with skin of color (SOC) can lead to delayed treatments and poorer outcomes. Although instances of concurrent alopecia areata (AA) and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) have been documented, their infrequency in the literature may be attributed to the diagnostic difficulties associated with these conditions.

Hair loss can be psychologically distressing, affecting mental health, self-esteem, and social interactions, and leading to a significant negative impact on quality of life. Early and precise diagnosis of all contributing factors is critical to minimizing emotional distress, promoting patient well-being, increasing management effectiveness, and improving patient outcomes.

In this report, we present a patient with 3 distinct types of alopecia: AA, which is characterized as an autoimmune nonscarring alopecia; CCCA, as a chronic scarring alopecia; and telogen effluvium, characterized as a reactive nonscarring hair loss. This case underscores the need for a thorough clinical assessment to differentiate and manage coexisting conditions and increases awareness of complex alopecia, especially in patients with SOC.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^117TcAWZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Pathology of the external and middle ear is the most frequent reason to prescribe antibiotics and perform surgery in children and young adults. In the majority of cases imaging studies are not performed; the need for imaging comes when complications are suspected or when treatment is not effective. This paper discusses indications for temporal bone imaging studies and presents the most frequent pathological conditions, together with differential diagnosis, clinical symptoms and methods of treatment.

Methods and Results

This pictorial review describes major external and middle ear diseases, with special regard to clinical findings and appropriate reporting.

Conclusions

Apprehension of the complete clinical picture, together with imaging clues, narrows differential diagnosis and helps avoid mistakes. Evaluation of temporal bone pathologies requires close cooperation between the clinician and radiologist.

### The surgical treatment of cicatricial alopecia [^112DRof4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Surgical correction of cicatricial alopecia can yield exceptional results when performed in the appropriate clinical scenario. To facilitate determination of the most suitable corrective therapy, we propose two new categories of cicatricial alopecia: "unstable" and "stable". Unstable cicatricial alopecia is intermittent and results in possible subsequent scarring hair loss in either new or old areas. Stable cicatricial alopecia, on the other hand, refers to fixed permanent scarring. While surgical excision is preferred to hair transplantation for both categories of cicatricial alopecia, this preference is even stronger in cases of unstable cicatricial alopecia due to its intermittent and progressive nature. Regardless of which corrective technique is used, analysis of specific physical patient characteristics coupled with a careful view towards the possible evolution of male pattern baldness or female pattern hair loss are essential to achieve superior long-term results. Herein we also outline guidelines for identifying these physical traits as well as for performing hair transplantation and surgical excision in order to achieve optimal cosmetic outcomes and minimize postoperative complications.

### The role of hair follicle counts and ratios in the histopathological assessment of androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata and telogen effluvium: does counting' count'? [^115a1uSC]. Human Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

The histopathological assessment of scalp biopsies for the diagnosis of alopecia is most commonly undertaken in specialist centers. Occasionally, pathologists encounter such specimens outside a specialist setting or at a low frequency, which makes a confident diagnosis difficult. A methodical approach is essential to identify and interpret the histopathological findings, and one of the diagnostic tools is the use of follicular counts and ratios. This method is particularly emphasized in the context of non-scarring alopecia and, furthermore, for the identification of alopecias with overlapping features. We raised the question as to what is the role of follicular hair counts and ratios in the differential diagnosis of non-scarring alopecia with overlapping features, and sought the answer in our literature review. The English literature on the histopathological assessment of horizontal scalp biopsies taken for the evaluation of non-scarring alopecia, focusing on hair follicle counting as a diagnostic tool, with particular emphasis on androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and telogen effluvium, was reviewed. Follicular counts and ratios are a helpful diagnostic tool. However, these need to be coupled with the morphological features specific for each alopecia subtype to render a confident diagnosis.

### PRECISE scale: a quantitative classification for androgenetic alopecia and its application to hair transplantation [^112efimB]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Male-Pattern hair loss (MPHL) or Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is an extremely common problem that afflicts men in the post pubertal period. Although the prevalence differs according to race and ethnicity, there is a universal distribution and increase with age.

Historically, a wide variety of classifications approach the subject in a qualitative way. One of the first classification was done by Beek (1950), who classified MPHL on frontal and fronto-vertical. One year later, Hamilton (1951) focused on a more detailed proposal from the fronto-parietal and frontal recesses and on the vertex miniaturization. Later, Ogata (1953) worked on subtypes contemplating patterns of the Japanese population. By considering the inclusion of Afro-descendants in his studies, Setty (1970) simplified Hamilton's work from 1951. Further, Norwood (1975) refined Hamilton's classification from the observation that miniaturization begins in the temples, as well as at the crown/vertex, progressing to the top of the scalp. This last one is known as the Norwood-Hamilton scale, which is considered the most used scale in the western world.

Since the scale of Norwood-Hamilton, several researchers and doctors again proposed new qualitative classifications. By introducing a simplified classification of baldness based on Caucasian Europeans, Bouhanna proposed their own scale in 1976. Blanchard and Blanchard based their classification on measurements taken at six anatomical landmarks in the scalp. In the year 2000, Koo used the shape of the bald areas to develop a new categorization. In the same year, Bouhanna launched a very detailed classification with parameters such as: fixed distances from the face, mobility and thickness of the scalp and hair covering power. Seven years later, BASP (2007) was created as a gender independent classification and based on anterior hairline shape and frontal and vertex hair density combining basic and specific types. Finally, the works done by Ludwig and Savin highlighted the female-pattern hair loss (FPHL).

Introduction

Generally, cicatricial alopecias are relentlessly and slowly progressive. We describe clinical and histologic features of rapidly progressive cicatricial alopecia in a young man, with overlapping features of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), lichen planopilaris (LPP), fibrosing alopecia with a pattern distribution (FAPD), and cicatricial pattern hair loss (CPHL), suggesting that these conditions may exist along a spectrum.

### Concurrent lichen planopilaris and female androgenic alopecia in skin of color: a case series [^115Jy8Ev]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Trichoscopy findings can differ in the skin of color requiring a dedicated approach with adequate examination in order to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. This case series details three cases of concurrent lichen planopilaris (LPP) and female androgenic alopecia (FAGA) in the skin of color.

Methods

Gross examination of all cases revealed mild to moderate hair density thinning of the temporal and frontal scalp. Trichoscopy was done in all three cases before biopsy. The temporal scalp of each patient showed diffuse hair follicle miniaturization with minimal terminal hairs and brown follicular halos, all findings were consistent with FAGA. However, upon inspection of the frontal scalp, each case revealed findings associated with scarring alopecia including scale, erythema, and peripilar casts in addition to the presence of follicle miniaturization.

Results

In the first two cases, two punch biopsies were taken, one from the temporal scalp and one from the frontal scalp. Temporal biopsy revealed FAGA and frontal biopsy revealed LPP arising in a background of AGA. In the third case, only the frontal scalp was biopsied, which showed LPP in a background of FAGA. All three cases received the same treatment regimen; clobetasol 0.05% solution and minoxidil 5% foam/solution topically for treatment of FAGA and monthly intralesional triamcinolone acetonide for treatment of the LPP.

Conclusion

Our report suggests the importance of total scalp dermoscopy and the need for biopsies in areas with varying dermoscopy findings as opposed to areas with the most significant hair loss. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(3):320–322. doi:10.36849/JDD.7318.

### Finasteride-mediated hair regrowth and reversal of atrophy in a patient with frontal fibrosing alopecia [^112kUcbp]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Case report

A 51-year-old woman presented with a 9-year history of asymptomatic frontal hair loss (Fig 1, A and C, before treatment). Hair loss started at age 42 in the preauricular area and extended to the entire frontal hairline. The patient was premenopausal at the time of first hair loss and entered menopause at age 49. Eyebrows were reduced in density but still present. A proportion of existing hair follicles in the receded hairline displayed perifollicular erythema and perifollicular scale. Marked atrophy was noted along the frontal hairline, and facial veins were visible (Fig 1, A and C). Biopsy findings confirmed the diagnosis of a lymphocytic cicatricial scarring alopecia consistent with the clinical diagnosis of frontal fibrosing alopecia. Results of blood work, including iron and thyroid studies, were normal. Initial treatments, including hydroxychloroquine (6 month trial); betamethasone valerate, 0.1% cream (3 weeks); and tacrolimus, 0.1% ointment (2 months), were not helpful and did not lead to any clinical change. The patient then started finasteride, 2.5 mg daily, and within 3 months experienced a reduction in redness and reversal of skin atrophy followed by hair regrowth in the fronto-temporal scalp. Further improvements were noted at 1-year follow-up (Fig 1, C and D).

Regarding medical management for androgenetic alopecia, more specifically with respect to topical minoxidil, male-pattern hair loss, EDF 2018 guidelines recommend to consider combining topical minoxidil 2–5% solution (or 5% foam BID) with oral finasteride 1 mg once daily for greater efficacy.

### Commentary: iron deficiency and hair loss: problems with measurement of iron [^111ehGuY]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Iron is involved in many critical physiologic processes within the hair follicle, suggesting that iron deficiency could disrupt hair synthesis. However, studies of iron as a cause of hair loss have produced conflicting results. Some of the discrepancies may relate to limitations of assays for iron deficiency. This commentary discusses the sensitivity and specificity of available tests for iron deficiency and presents practical guidelines for testing and supplementation.

### Treating baldness in men… [^112cSSbz]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

What is male pattern baldness. Male pattern baldness is hair loss that happens because the male hormone testosterone changes the hair roots. Can male pattern baldness be treated. Male pattern baldness doesn't have to be treated, but many men feel better about the way they look if their "bald spot" is covered. Some treatments are minoxidil, finasteride, hair transplants and toupees. Which treatment is right for me. This is a personal decision to make after looking at all of your options. Ask to see "before" and "after" pictures of men who have used the methods you're thinking about trying. Think about these factors: how far along your baldness is; how you feel about having surgery; the cost; and how easy it is to use. Do these medicines cure baldness. No. Nothing cures baldness. Two medicines can help regrow some lost hair, but not all of it.

Finasteride and minoxidil usually regrow only enough hair to cover part of the bald areas. Both of these medicines work better on the crown of the head than on the front hairline. Will minoxidil or finasteride work for me. There is no way to predict who will respond to these medicines. It may take up to six months before you can tell if the medicine is working. Men who are younger, who have a smaller bald area and who start using the medicine early may have better results. These medicines may be most helpful for men who have just started balding. Do these medicines have side effects. Like all medicines, these medicines cause some side effects. A few men have had sexual side effects from finasteride that went away after they stopped taking the medicine. Minoxidil causes an itchy scalp in a few men. This also goes away when the medicine is stopped. How do I use these medicines. Minoxidil is sprayed on and rubbed into the scalp twice a day.

Finasteride is a pill you take once a day. Both medicines must be used every day. When you stop taking either medicine, you start to lose hair again.

### Hair loss: common causes and treatment | AAFP… [^116rT5Jn]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Specific Disorders ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss in men and women and is a normal physiologic variant. It is most prevalent in white men, with 30%, 40%, and 50% experiencing androgenetic alopecia at 30, 40, and 50 years of age, respectively.
2. Although this condition is less common in women, 38% of women older than 70 years may be affected
3. Many patients with androgenetic alopecia have a family history of this condition. Hair thinning occurs in a sex-specific pattern. Men typically present with bitemporal thinning, thinning of the frontal and vertex scalp, or complete hair loss with residual hair at the occiput and temporal fringes. 5 Women typically present with diffuse hair thinning of the vertex with sparing of the frontal hairline. Some women experience thinning over the lateral scalp.

Common conditions that mimic androgenetic alopecia include thyroid disease, iron deficiency anemia, and malnutrition. Treatment is based on patient preference. Topical minoxidil is approved for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men. Hair regrowth is more robust at the vertex than in the frontal area, and will take six to 12 months to improve. Hair loss in alopecia areata occurs in three different patterns: patchy alopecia is circumscribed, oval-shaped, flesh-colored patches on any part of the body; alopecia totalis involves the entire scalp; and alopecia universalis involves the whole body. Evaluation of the scalp may reveal short vellus hairs, yellow or black dots, and broken hair shafts. Microscopic examination of the hair follicles demonstrates exclamation mark hair, and systemic corticosteroids. 12 Currently available therapies often yield unsatisfactory results, and some clinicians rely on the high rate of spontaneous remission or recommend a hairpiece or wig if remission does not occur.
13. Posterior auricular lymphadenopathy may help differentiate tinea capitis from other inflammatory causes of alopecia. If the diagnosis is not clear from the history and physical examination, a skin scraping taken from the active border of the inflamed patch in a potassium hydroxide preparation can be examined microscopically for the presence of hyphae.

Skin scrapings can also be sent for fungal culture, but this is less helpful because the fungi can take up to six weeks to grow. Tinea capitis requires systemic treatment; topical antifungal agents do not penetrate hair follicles. If the causative agent is a. TELOGEN EFFLUVIUM Telogen effluvium is a nonscarring, noninflammatory alopecia of relatively sudden onset, with similar incidences between sexes and age groups. It occurs when large numbers of hairs enter the telogen phase and fall out three to five months after a physiologic or emotional stressor. The list of inciting factors is extensive and includes severe chronic illnesses, pregnancy, surgery, high fever, malnutrition, severe infections, and endocrine disorders. Causative medications include retinoids, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, beta blockers, and antithyroid medications; discontinuation of oral contraceptive agents is another possible cause.

### Surgical options for male pattern baldness… [^1118tpGL]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

to the editor: I read with interest the article entitled "Medical Treatment for Balding in Men. " 1 While the title aptly describes the article's content and its focus on medical therapies, I was disappointed that it almost completely ignored surgical options. Surgical solutions for androgenetic alopecia include autografts, flaps and lifts, scalp reduction and scalp extenders. The ideal candidate for autograft is a man with dense hair on the sides or back of his head. Micro, mini or standard grafting are successful in many cases, especially in frontotemporal balding areas that have not been amenable to medical therapy. The average cost of grafting is $50 per plug, multiplied by an average of 300 plugs per case, or approximately $15, 000. While this may seem expensive, it compares favorably with the 30- to 40-year lifetime costs of a daily dosage of full-strength minoxidil and/or finasteride.

Moreover, beyond the inherent small risk of surgery, no long-term side effects are evident. Modern plastic surgery involves the advanced techniques of scalp lifts and flaps, scalp reduction and scalp extenders. These surgical treatments have met with great success and resulted in good cosmetic results. I would also like to point out that the U. S. Food and Drug Administration's original label approval for finasteride was contingent on its use with Neutrogena T/Gel shampoo, which adds to the total costs of treatment. A full discussion of all potential treatments for male pattern baldness is indicated for our patients. in reply: Although our article 1 focused on the medical treatments of male pattern baldness, Dr. Elgert rightly points out that surgery is also an option.
