## Question

i have a patient who takes a fentanyl patch at 25mcg/hr. What is the Morphine Milligram Equivalents?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to calculate the morphine milligram equivalent (MME) for a 25 mcg/hour transdermal fentanyl patch. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which MME conversion factor applies to transdermal fentanyl. Then, I should verify the calculation and ensure the units align correctly. Next, I will cross-check the result against authoritative sources and consider variability in conversion ratios. Finally, I should review safety implications and clinical caveats that affect interpretation of this MME value, including incomplete cross-tolerance and titration principles.

> Let me first confirm the conversion factor. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on a transdermal fentanyl-to-morphine MME factor of 2.4, meaning 1 mcg/hour of transdermal fentanyl equals 2.4 mg/day of oral morphine equivalents. This factor is explicitly listed in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guideline and is consistent with VA/DoD and CDC guidance on MME calculations for fentanyl patches [^117PNZvm] [^112KczHJ] [^1138xqZA].

> Now, I should double-check the math. Applying the 2.4 factor to 25 mcg/hour yields 25 × 2.4 = 60 mg/day oral morphine equivalents. Wait, let me verify the units — yes, the factor converts mcg/hour of transdermal fentanyl directly to mg/day of oral morphine equivalents, so 25 mcg/hour equals 60 MME/day [^117PNZvm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to ensure this aligns with other references. The CDC's 2022 guideline includes fentanyl in its MME framework and cautions that equianalgesic conversions are estimates; the VA/DoD synopsis similarly notes that fentanyl is dosed in mcg/hour and that MME conversions are approximations, reinforcing that 60 MME/day is a reasonable estimate for 25 mcg/hour transdermal fentanyl while acknowledging interpatient variability [^112dgYFH] [^115MbDpF].

> I should also consider variability in fentanyl-to-morphine ratios reported across studies. Literature synthesizing equianalgesic data shows ratios ranging roughly from about 50:1 to 100:1 for oral morphine to transdermal fentanyl, which implies that 25 mcg/hour could correspond to anywhere from about 50 to 100 mg/day oral morphine equivalents depending on the dataset and direction of conversion; this variability underscores why MME is an estimate and why clinical judgment is essential [^112KumjE] [^112pTKYn].

> Next, I should review clinical implications. A daily MME around 60 sits at or above commonly cited risk thresholds. The CDC advises careful reassessment before increasing total opioid dosage to 50 MME/day or more, and many guidelines flag higher risks at or above 50–90 MME/day, so this 25 mcg/hour patch places the patient in a range where overdose risk, sedation, and respiratory depression warrant heightened vigilance and risk mitigation strategies [^112dgYFH] [^112eaxGM] [^114HDrWD].

> But wait, what if someone tries to use this MME to switch opioids directly? I need to ensure I emphasize a key safety principle: equianalgesic tables and MMEs are not for 1:1 dose conversions when rotating opioids; because of incomplete cross-tolerance and pharmacokinetic variability, the new opioid should be started at a substantially reduced dose — often 33–50% less than the calculated MME — and then titrated carefully to effect with close monitoring [^115MbDpF] [^112dgYFH].

> I should also confirm fentanyl-specific cautions that can alter exposure and risk. Heat can increase fentanyl release from the patch, and CYP3A4 inhibitors can raise fentanyl levels, both increasing the risk of respiratory depression; these factors can effectively increase the "functional MME" even when the nominal patch dose is unchanged, so I need to check for interacting medications and counsel on avoiding external heat sources [^1178SyHJ] [^112SWeMj].

> Let me reconsider the final answer to ensure internal consistency. Given the 2.4 MME factor and 25 mcg/hour dose, the calculation is 25 × 2.4 = 60 MME/day. This estimate is consistent with major guidelines and sits within the range suggested by equianalgesic literature variability, so I can conclude with confidence that a 25 mcg/hour transdermal fentanyl patch is approximately 60 MME/day, with the explicit caveat that this is an estimate and clinical judgment must guide any therapeutic decisions or opioid rotations [^117PNZvm] [^112KczHJ] [^112KumjE].

---

A 25 mcg/hr fentanyl patch is approximately **60 MME/day** [^112KczHJ] using the standard conversion factor of 2.4 [^1138xqZA]. This estimate assumes steady-state delivery over 72 hours and should be interpreted as a **conservative approximation** [^115MbDpF] due to interpatient variability and incomplete cross-tolerance. Always use clinical judgment, monitor closely, and adjust the dose based on patient response and adverse effects.

---

## Calculation of MME for fentanyl patch

The standard conversion factor for transdermal fentanyl to oral morphine equivalents is **2.4** [^112dgYFH] (i.e. 1 mcg/hr fentanyl ≈ 2.4 mg/day oral morphine) [^117PNZvm]. Thus, a 25 mcg/hr patch equals **60 mg/day oral morphine equivalents (MME)**.

---

## Clinical implications of 60 MME/day

- **Risk threshold**: 60 MME/day exceeds the 50 MME/day threshold associated with increased overdose risk; clinicians should reassess benefits and risks at or above this level [^112eaxGM] [^112dgYFH].

- **Monitoring**: Patients at ≥ 50 MME/day require closer monitoring for adverse effects, misuse, and overdose risk [^112eaxGM].

- **Dose escalation**: Avoid routine dose increases above 50 MME/day without clear benefit; if escalation is needed, increase by the smallest practical amount and reassess frequently [^112dgYFH].

---

## Factors influencing fentanyl patch conversion to MME

Several factors can affect the **accuracy of MME conversions** for fentanyl patches:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, body weight, hepatic and renal function, and genetic variability can influence fentanyl metabolism and absorption [^114bJrRd] [^112dgYFH].

- **Environmental factors**: Heat exposure can increase fentanyl release from the patch, potentially leading to overdose [^1178SyHJ].

- **Clinical factors**: Incomplete cross-tolerance, prior opioid exposure, and concurrent medications can significantly alter equianalgesic conversions [^115MbDpF] [^112SWeMj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **CDC guideline**: Recommends caution when prescribing opioids at or above 50 MME/day, emphasizing individualized risk-benefit assessment and close monitoring [^112dgYFH].

- **VA/DoD guideline**: Advises particular caution with transdermal fentanyl due to variability in absorption and pharmacokinetics, recommending conservative initial dosing and careful titration [^115MbDpF].

- **FDA warnings**: Emphasize the risk of fatal respiratory depression, especially in opioid-naive patients or when converting from other opioids [^111ShxYh].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring caution or adjustment

Certain clinical scenarios warrant **caution or dose adjustment** when using fentanyl patches:

- **Opioid-naive patients**: Fentanyl patches are contraindicated in opioid-naive patients due to the risk of fatal respiratory depression [^111ShxYh].

- **Elderly or debilitated patients**: Increased sensitivity to opioids may necessitate lower initial doses and slower titration [^114bJrRd].

- **Patients with hepatic or renal impairment**: Dose adjustments may be necessary due to altered drug metabolism and clearance [^114bJrRd].

- **Patients with concurrent CNS depressants**: Increased risk of respiratory depression requires careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^112SWeMj].

## Fentanyl patch to MME conversion

| **Fentanyl patch dose (mcg/hr)** | **Approximate mme/day** |
|-|-|
| 12 mcg/hr | 28.8 MME/day |
| 25 mcg/hr | 60 MME/day |
| 50 mcg/hr | 120 MME/day |
| 75 mcg/hr | 180 MME/day |
| 100 mcg/hr | 240 MME/day |

---

A 25 mcg/hr fentanyl patch is approximately **60 MME/day**. Clinicians should apply this conversion cautiously, considering patient-specific factors and current guidelines, and monitor closely for adverse effects and overdose risk.

Alternatively, for adult and pediatric patients taking opioids or doses not listed in Table 1, use the following methodology when converting patients from oral or parenteral opioids to fentanyl transdermal system:

Calculate the previous 24-hour analgesic requirement.
Convert this amount to the equianalgesic oral morphine dose using a reliable reference.
Refer to Table 2 for the range of 24-hour oral morphine doses that are recommended for conversion to each fentanyl transdermal system dose. Use this table to find the calculated 24‑hour morphine dose and the corresponding recommended initial fentanyl transdermal system dose.
Initiate fentanyl transdermal system treatment using the recommended dose and titrate patients upwards (no more frequently than 3 days after the initial dose and every 6 days thereafter) until analgesic efficacy is attained. A 37.5 mcg/hour dose may also be used. For patients that require more than 100 mcg/hour, several transdermal systems may be used.
Do not use Table 2 to convert from fentanyl transdermal system to other therapies because this conversion to fentanyl transdermal system is conservative and will overestimate the dose of the new agent.

Additional intermediate strengths 37.5 mcg/hr, 62.5 mcg/hr, and 87.5 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal systems are available and may be considered during conversion from prior opioids or dose titration. For example, the 37.5 mcg/hr system could be used before converting or titrating to a 50 mcg/hr system. Similarly, a 62.5 mcg/hr system is available for use as an intermediate strength between the 50 mcg/hr and the 75 mcg/hr system, and an 87.5 mcg/hr system is available as an intermediate strength between the 75 mcg/hr system and the 100 mcg/hr system.

The additional intermediate strengths, 37.5 mcg/hr, 62.5 mcg/hr and 87.5 mcg/hr, were not used in the clinical studies.

For delivery rates in excess of 100 mcg/hour, multiple systems may be used.

### Poor adhesion of fentanyl transdermal patches may mimic end-of-dosage failure after 48 hours and prompt early patch replacement in hospitalized cancer pain patients [^117FjDW3]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort of mainly cancer patients, replacement of fentanyl TTS earlier than the prescribed 72 hours was observed in a higher than expected proportion (31%). However, most of these divergent dosing intervals had been annotated by the nurses. They were related to dosage-finding strategies or inadequate skin adhesion or were the results of a time correction after an erroneous application such as in evening instead of morning. An application period of 60 hours was not used, probably because it would result in an inconvenient change every 2.5 days, such as one change in the morning and the next in the evening. This might also lead to more confusions than every third day.

In our study, the frequency of an application period of 2 days (48 hours) was 7.4%, which was in the range of other studies. Higher opioid dosage and younger age of our patients were associated with early fentanyl TTS replacement. To our knowledge, a similar relationship is mentioned in a Korean study performed in cancer patients taking sustained-release opioids – oral morphine, oxycodone and transdermal fentanyl patch. Patients aged < 40 years and taking daily dosages > 120 mg oral morphine equivalent (corresponding to fentanyl TTS 50 µg/hour) showed more often breakthrough pain. The authors calculated that pain control with fentanyl TTS lasted for 62.9 hours on average. However, the authors performed a self-reported survey over the last week, and thus, the results might simply mirror that younger patients who need high opioid dosages might feel breakthrough pain more easily than older patients. Furthermore, extrapolation to TTS is questionable because oral and transdermal application forms were aggregated. Finally, stoicism is more pronounced in elderly patients whose beliefs may influence their pain experience. Thus, we conclude that younger patients may complain more and thus obtain higher opioid dosages.

Case 2

The EHR medication list showed three consecutive prescriptions, all issued in the past 90 days, for 4 mg oxycodone tablets to take two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed; the end dates were specified for each prescription, and only the most recent prescription was marked as 'active'. The RxSignature method, using the signature information derived from the one active prescription, computed the MEDD as 30 MME/day. The MEDD estimated by both the RxQuantity and RxAudit methods was 32.7 MME/day on average over the past 90 days.

Case 3

The medication list showed two prescriptions issued within the past 90 days and labelled as 'active': one for morphine extended release 30 mg tablets (take one twice a day) and another for hydrocodone 4 mg tablets (take one every 4 hours as needed). The RxSignature method estimated MEDD at 90 MME/day; both the RxQuantity and the RxAudit methods resulted in the MEDD of 23.3 MME/day on average over the past 90 days.

Case 4

The medication list showed two 'active' opioid prescriptions: one for 100 µg/hour fentanyl patch (apply one every 3 days) and another for 5 mg oxycodone tablets (take 2 every 4 hours as needed). Although they were both issued 6 months prior to the audit date, they did not have an 'end date' entered and were not marked as 'completed'; therefore, they were still labelled as 'active' in the EHR, and the RxSignature yielded MEDD of 330 MME/day based on these two prescriptions. Because these prescriptions were issued outside of the 90-day assessment period, the RxQuantity-based and RxAudit-based MEDD was zero.

### Assessment of dosing frequency of sustained-release opioid preparations in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain [^1127jrb5]. Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Many patients with moderate to severe chronic nonmalignant pain require dosing of long-acting opioids more frequently than recommended by the product's manufacturer. To accurately quantitate opioid dosing in clinical practice, daily dosing was prospectively assessed in pain clinic patients.

Design

A single-center, 30-day, prospective, observational cohort study, approved by the hospital IRB.

Patients

Forty-one evaluable adult outpatients receiving treatment with long-acting opioids for moderate to severe chronic nonmalignant pain.

Outcome Measures

The primary measure was the daily number of consumed doses of prescribed long-acting opioid. Rescue medication use, average daily pain intensity, and patient-reported adverse events were also recorded.

Results

The mean daily number of doses was 3.0 for oxycodone controlled release (CR), 2.9 for morphine CR, and 3.7 for methadone. For transdermal fentanyl, 50% of patients required dosing every 24–48 hours. Ninety-one percent of oxycodone CR-treated patients, 86% of morphine CR-treated patients, and 50% of fentanyl patch-treated patients required dosing more frequently than that recommended by the product's manufacturer. Patients who received oxycodone CR, morphine CR, and transdermal fentanyl required a mean of 2.9, 2.9, and 3.7 rescue doses per day, respectively.

Conclusions

Many patients taking common long-acting opioids for chronic nonmalignant pain require dosing more frequently than recommended by product labeling, and take an additional 3–4 daily doses of rescue opioid, yet they continue to report moderate to severe pain. Newer opioid formulations that can provide sustained analgesia with convenient dosing are needed as well as a better understanding of the many additional factors that may influence opioid use patterns in patients with chronic pain.

Chronic Short-Acting Opioid Therapy

Perioperative pain management of patients consuming routine and scheduled oral opioids should include the following:

1. Instructions to continue baseline medication the morning of surgery through the postoperative period. a. If transdermal fentanyl patches are used preoperatively, patients should be converted to an IV morphine equivalent dose. This is because of alterations in fentanyl release during fluid shifts and body temperature changes observed with surgery.
2. Titrate short-acting μ-agonist to effective pain control.
3. When oral medications cannot be consumed, the 24-hour morphine equivalent dose should be calculated for conversion to IV management until oral medications can be reinstituted.

Illicit Opioids

Perioperative pain management is further complicated by inaccurate consumption history and variation in strength of illicit drugs:
If available, consult addiction medicine, APS, or psychiatry.

Methadone (Slow-Release Oral Morphine or Opioid Agonist)

Perioperative pain management of patients consuming methadone should include the following:

1. If available, consult addiction medicine, APS, or psychiatry.
2. Continue baseline methadone throughout the perioperative period including the morning of surgery.
3. If unable to take oral medications, convert the 24-hour dose to IV methadone according to the conversion chart and administer in 2–4 divided doses. a. Pharmacokinetics of methadone are influenced by CYP450 and CYP3A4 metabolism and may also vary based on the patient's own metabolism. Consult a pharmacist or APS specialist for conversion to the appropriate morphine equivalent dose.
4. Supplement perioperative pain with short-acting agonist.
5. Close respiratory monitoring due to combined effects.
6. Educate the patient on acute opioid taper.

### Fentanyl transdermal system [^111ShxYh]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

General Principles

Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated for management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that:

requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time
cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.

Fentanyl transdermal system should ONLY be used in patients who are already receiving opioid therapy, who have demonstrated opioid tolerance, and who require a total daily dose at least equivalent to fentanyl transdermal system 25 mcg/hr. Patients who are considered opioid-tolerant are those who have been taking, for a week or longer, at least 60 mg of morphine daily, or at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, or at least 8 mg oral hydromorphone daily, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

Because serious or life-threatening hypoventilation could occur, fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated:

in patients who are not opioid-tolerant
in the management of acute pain or in patients who require opioid analgesia for a short period of time
in the management of post-operative pain, including use after out-patient or day surgeries (e.g., tonsillectomies)
in the management of mild pain
in the management of intermittent pain (e.g., use on an as needed basis [prn])

### Prevalence of opioid-induced adverse events across opioids commonly used for analgesic treatment in Japan: a multicenter prospective longitudinal study [^1124ZBNL]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurements

We performed a daily assessment of the severity of constipation, delirium, drowsiness, nausea, and other AEs due to analgesics and analgesic adjuvants until termination of follow-up. We rated AEs from grade 1 to 5 based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. A patient was considered to have an AE if the causal relationship between opioids and AEs was "possible", "probable", or "definite" and the grade was ≥ 1. When the same AEs occurred more than two times during the observation period, we only recorded the higher-grade events.

We calculated the dose of opioid at enrollment as daily morphine milligram equivalents based on previous studies: oral morphine 60 mg = intravenous (IV)/subcutaneous (SC) morphine 30 mg = oral oxycodone 40 mg = IV/SC oxycodone 30 mg = fentanyl patch 25 μg/h = IV/SC fentanyl 0.6 mg = oral tapentadol 200 mg = oral hydromorphone 12 mg = IV/SC hydromorphone 2.4 mg = oral tramadol 300 mg.

Data analysis and statistics

First, we extracted opioid-using patients from all enrolled patients. We excluded patients who received analgesic treatment by only non-opioids, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Second, descriptive analyses were performed to summarize the analyzed baseline patient characteristics.

Third, multivariate logistic analysis was performed to compute the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for each AE with the following variables: opioid (reference group = oxycodone), age (per 10 years), sex (reference group = male), renal dysfunction (reference group = absent), and primary cancer site (digestive tract, lung, and others; reference group = others). As for opioid, we selected oxycodone because of the most frequency prescription in the analyzed patients. Opioids prescribed to less than 30 patients were excluded from the analysis because they would destabilize the logistic model. Potential confounding variables were identified based on previous studies.

All analyses were performed using JMP version 16 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A p value between 0.01 and 0.05 was considered to be a weak indication of the finding, and a p value of < 0.01 was considered to be a clear indication of a finding.

### Practical management of opioid rotation and equianalgesia [^112pTKYn]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Fentanyl

Fentanyl is a phenylpiperidine opioid agonist. Its low molecular weight is low and high lipid solubility provides excellent bio-availability (90%) via the transdermal or transmucosal routes, although the oral bioavailability is low (< 30%). Fentanyl is predominantly converted by CYP3A4-mediated N-dealkylation to norfentanyl, a nontoxic and inactive metabolite. The mean elimination half-life is approximately 17 hours. According to the summary of product characteristics (fentanyl 50 μg/mL solution for injection), a dose of 100 μg (2 mL) per day transdermal has an analgesic action that is comparable with 10 mg oral morphine.

One randomized controlled, double-blind, crossover study, three prospective studies, and three retrospective studies reported data on conversion ratios between fentanyl (td, sc, iv) and other opioids targeted in our search (Table 2). These studies demonstrate considerable variability in conversion ratios, both within and across studies, and underscore the need for caution in applying ratios during opioid rotation from and to fentanyl.

Two published studies on the dose conversion ratio between the transdermal fentanyl patch (Ftd) and morphine preparations have been identified. Kato et al published in 2004 the results of their retrospective observational study of 144 patients with chronic pain of cancer origin and with difficulty tolerating oral morphine, undergoing rotation to fentanyl patch. The authors calculated the conversion ratio from the regression equation obtained from the daily oral morphine dose prior to rotation and daily fentanyl patch delivered dose in subjects undergoing opioid rotation from oral morphine to fentanyl patch (R² = 0.68), reporting a daily oral morphine dose/daily fentanyl patch delivered dose ratio of 78:1.

Donner et al performed a multicenter study with 98 patients (38 patients were treated according to protocol and their data were analyzed) with controlled cancer pain with the aim of studying the most convenient conversion ratio when switching from morphine to transdermal fentanyl. Initial doses were calculated with the Mpo:Ftd ratio of 100:1. The regression analysis comparing fentanyl dosages at the end of the study (day 15) with the morphine dosages at day 1 demonstrated a mean Mpo:Ftd ratio of 70:1 (R² = 0.82). This result implicates that a calculation table with a ratio 100:1 is by 30% subequianalgesic but may be appropriate with allowance of a safety margin.

These are not tables of equianalgesic doses.
The conversion doses in these tables are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral or parenteral opioid analgesics to fentanyl transdermal system.
The tables cannot be used to convert from fentanyl transdermal system to another opioid because these conversions will result in an overestimation of the dose of the new opioid (these conversions are conservative) and may result in fatal overdosage.

Alternatively, for adult and pediatric patients taking opioids or doses not listed in Table 1, use the following methodology when converting patients from oral or parenteral opioids to fentanyl transdermal system:

1. Calculate the previous 24-hour analgesic requirement.

2. Convert this amount to the equianalgesic oral morphine dose using a reliable reference.

Additional intermediate strengths 37.5 mcg/hr and 62.5 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal systems are available and may be considered during conversion from prior opioids or dose titration. For example, the 37.5 mcg/hr system could be used before converting or titrating to a 50 mcg/hr system. Similarly a 62.5 mcg/hr system is available for use as an intermediate strength between the 50 mcg/hr and the 75 mcg/hr system.

The additional intermediate strengths, 37.5 mcg/hr and 62.5 mcg/hr, were not used in the clinical studies.

For delivery rates in excess of 100 mcg/hr, multiple systems may be used.

### The cost of lost productivity in an opioid utilizing pain sample [^114p7sAS]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Opioid Dosage

The outpatient pharmacy data captured the drug number (NDCNUM), brand name, generic name, ingredients, dose, quantity, and days-supply for filled prescriptions. These data were used to calculate the morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dosage based on published morphine equivalent conversion factors (MECF).

For each patient, total MME was calculated by summing the MME for all filled opioid prescriptions within a given time period. The average daily MME was calculated by dividing the total MME by the number of days in the period. Patients were categorized into one of three opioid use groups based on daily MME in the year after index: none (< 5 MME/day), low (5–25 MME/day), or moderate (≥ 25 MME/day). Note that average daily MME dosage may vary from prescription dosage, as gaps between refills can reduce the average daily dosage compared to the prescribed dosage.

Disability Days

The primary outcome was the total number of days of disability, which included short-term disability leave, long-term disability leave, and workers' compensation. Disability data were aligned with index event. In the database, periods of disability were defined by start and end dates. Days of disability was calculated by subtracting the end date from the start date. Patients were considered "on disability" if they had at least one day of disability absence within a given period. The proportion of all patients in the study on disability was calculated for each month in the year before and after index. The cumulative disability days in the one year before and after index were compared, and the cumulative disability days in the one month before and after index were compared. Total days of disability were converted into working days of disability by multiplying by a factor of 0.69, accounting for working days (5 of 7) and holidays (7.6 per year, Bureau of Labor and Statistics).

### Distributed opioids in morphine equivalent: a global measure of availability for palliative care [^115H11PQ]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2025). Medium credibility.

Calculation of Morphine Equivalents

The quantities of the opioids included in the DOME measure were converted to a common metric — oral morphine equivalent milligrams (herein also designated morphine-equivalents). This conversion is necessary to account for the widely divergent potencies of the different opioids. Based on decades of research, these potency differences have been characterized in terms of analgesic potential, using morphine analgesia as a standard. For example, studies have shown that the potency difference between oral morphine and oxycodone means that just 20.0–22.5 mg of oral oxycodone will provide analgesia equivalent to 30 milligrams (mg) of oral morphine in an opioid-naive patient with pain.

Given these potency differences, the quantities of the different opioid medicines distributed within a country cannot be simply added to evaluate the capacity for clinical use. Meaningful interpretation requires that the quantity of each opioid other than morphine be adjusted to account for its potency relative to morphine. For the DOME measure, this adjustment was implemented by creating conversion factors (Table 1) based on the information in equianalgesic dose tables, which describe the doses of varied opioids that yield analgesia equivalent to a standard oral morphine dose. Although there are continuing controversies about the accuracy of some of the equianalgesic dose ratios, the consistent use of an accepted equianalgesic dose table is a best practice during clinical care. It is therefore the tool used to calculate DOME.

Background

The equipotency ratio of transdermal (TD) fentanyl to oral morphine has been established as 1:100; for buprenorphine TD, a ratio of 1:75 has been proposed, although this ratio has not been confirmed in clinical studies. Growing evidence from clinical practice, in which much lower doses of buprenorphine are used, suggests that this conversion ratio may be too high.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare calculated equipotent oral morphine doses of fentanyl TD with equipotent oral morphine doses of buprenorphine TD prescribed in clinical practice.

Methods

This retrospective study identified patients with cancer and noncancer pain who had received ≥ 1 prescription for fentanyl TD or buprenorphine TD (the all-patients groups) from the German IMS Disease Analyzer-mediplus database, which contains all relevant data concerning drug prescriptions from 400 practices in Germany. Also identified were subgroups of the all-patients groups who had received long-term treatment with fentanyl TD or buprenorphine TD and were considered to have similar pain intensity, as they had previously received similar analgesic medication (the identical-cohort groups). Mean prescribed daily doses for the all-patients and identical-cohort groups were calculated based on the distribution of prescribed patch strengths. Because patients could have applied > 1 patch, mean prescribed daily doses were also calculated based on an assumption of double application when appropriate. Equipotent oral morphine doses were estimated using equipotency ratios of 1:100 for fentanyl TD and 1:75 for buprenorphine TD.

Results

The all-patients groups consisted of 2198 patients with noncancer pain and 2544 patients with cancer pain; the identical-cohort groups consisted of 380 patients with noncancer pain and 496 patients with cancer pain (529 women, 347 men; mean age, 74 years [range, 25–101 years]). Equipotent doses of oral morphine were significantly lower in patients receiving buprenorphine TD compared with those receiving fentanyl TD (P < 0.001). In cancer patients, the equipotent oral morphine doses of fentanyl TD and buprenorphine TD were 130.9 to 138.9 mg and 85.2 to 88.8 mg, respectively; in noncancer patients, the corresponding values were 117.0 to 118.3 mg and 80.2 to 80.9 mg. Based on these results, an equipotency ratio of 1:110 to 1:115 for buprenorphine TD would appear to be more appropriate than the proposed ratio of 1:75.

Conclusions

The fact that this retrospective analysis conducted in identical cohorts showed lower calculated equipotent oral morphine doses in the buprenorphine TD groups compared with the fentanyl TD groups calls into question the proposed 1:75 ratio for conversion of buprenorphine TD to equipotent oral morphine doses. Based on the findings of the present study, an equipotency ratio of 1:110 to 1:115 may be more appropriate. However, confirmative data from prospective randomized clinical trials are needed.

Prescription opioids and opioid epidemic — United States prescription trends show declines in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) dispensed and in high daily-dose segments. Use of prescription opioids, measured by MME dispensed, increased from 27 billion MME in 1992 to 246 billion MME in 2011, then decreased to an estimated 100 billion MME in 2020. From 2018 to 2019, every state experienced a decline in MME per capita, and declines were largest in states that previously had the highest rates of opioid prescribing. Segmented by daily MME, 2011–2019 changes were a 70% decline for 90+ MME per day, 52% for 50 to 90 MME per day, 32% for 20 to 50 MME per day, and 11% for less than 20 MME per day; the figure shows a total -51% change. CDC dispensing data are available from 2006 to 2020 at national, state (per 100 persons), and county levels.

### Fentanyl transdermal system [^115tZJTJ]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Initial Fentanyl Transdermal System Dose Selection

Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Due to the mean half-life of approximately 17 hours, patients who are thought to have had a serious adverse event, including overdose, will require monitoring and treatment for at least 24 hours.

There has been no systematic evaluation of fentanyl transdermal system as an initial opioid analgesic in the management of chronic pain, since most patients in the clinical trials were converted to fentanyl transdermal system from other narcotics. The efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system 12 mcg/hr as an initiating dose has not been determined. In addition, patients who are not opioid-tolerant have experienced hypoventilation and death during use of fentanyl transdermal system. Therefore, fentanyl transdermal system should be used only in patients who are opioid-tolerant.

To convert patients from oral or parenteral opioids to fentanyl transdermal system, use Table C:

Alternatively, for adult and pediatric patients taking opioids or doses not listed in Table C, use the following methodology:

Calculate the previous 24-hour analgesic requirement.
Convert this amount to the equianalgesic oral morphine dose using Table D.
Table E displays the range of 24-hour oral morphine doses that are recommended for conversion to each fentanyl transdermal system dose. Use this table to find the calculated 24-hour morphine dose and the corresponding fentanyl transdermal system dose. Initiate fentanyl transdermal system treatment using the recommended dose and titrate patients upwards (no more frequently than every 3 days after the initial dose or than every 6 days thereafter) until analgesic efficacy is attained. The recommended starting dose when converting from other opioids to fentanyl transdermal system is likely too low for 50% of patients. This starting dose is recommended to minimize the potential for overdosing patients with the first dose. For delivery rates in excess of 100 mcg/hr, multiple systems may be used.

Opioid dose–overdose relationships (United States 2010–2019) — The page reports that "the relationships between total opioid doses, any opioid deaths (AOD), prescription opioid deaths (POD), opioid treatment admissions (OTA), and annual prescription opioid sales (i.e., morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per capita) are either non-existent, or significantly negative/inverse", and that "the data from 2010 to 2019 – notably concurrent with initiation of CDC guidelines in 2016 – demonstrate that TOD, AOD, and OTA in 1,000s continued to escalate with distinct decline in both POD and MME per capita of prescription opioids". It adds that "the CDC assertion of a continued direct relationship between these factors simply is not valid", consistent with findings "in the United States from 2010 to 2019" that "there is no longer a direct correlation", with TOD defined as total overdose deaths (TOD).

### The use of rotation to fentanyl in cancer-related pain [^113d8mmU]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Pain management in clinical practice has benefited – during recent years – from clear and efficient guidelines, and also due to the advent of new drugs. Current therapeutic modalities offer multiple options for cancer patients so that pain can be efficiently controlled and palliation is feasible. Opioid rotation can achieve a favorable analgesia/toxicity ratio. Fentanyl therapy allows an improvement in life quality through good analgetic control, and a reduction of adverse effects, including digestive symptoms, the quality of sleep and awakening vigilance, as well as avoiding injectable and oral administrations.

Fentanyl induces far fewer adverse neurologic effects, is efficient and – most importantly – is safe, even if the patch is changed at 4 hours. Eligible patients are those in whom the pain is controlled at stable medium or small doses of opioid, patients with nausea or vomiting after other opioids and patients in which oral administration is difficult because of dysphagia or because of eso-gastric localization of the tumor. The initial dose of fentanyl treatment has to be reduced by 25%–50% compared to equivalent doses of oral morphine and the anterior opioid has to be maintained for a further 8–12 hours so the action of fentanyl can take place; the dose ratio of conversion of morphine:fentanyl can vary between 70 and 150:1.

Sweating, however, remains a problem and can make fentanyl administration difficult, but this can be overcome by using a fentanyl matrix. Fentanyl therapy is recommended to be continued during chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or in the case of surgical interventions. Rotation to fentanyl patches is an efficient and elegant solution with reduced adverse effects for cancer patients.

Opioid rotation, especially to fentanyl, has been shown to cause an overall increase in the quality of life in patients with malignant disease. Finally, rotation to fentanyl is also advantageous from an economic point of view.

### Calculating conversations in opioid conversions… [^112NyRfM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What is an MME. Why do we need to calculate MME. Patient Care Guidelines/ State limits Morphine milligram equivalents Guidelines and State Limits MME limits are intended to help clinicians make safe, appropriate decisions concerning changes to opioid regimens. MME/day metric can be used as a gauge of the overdose potential MME/day can help predict likelihood of addiction Does a higher MME/day result in better function. So here are the questions…
- "If I am starting with opioid "A" at dose "B, " what dose of opioid "C" do I need to prescribe to have the same analgesic effect. "
- "If my patient is taking an opioid other than morphine, what would be the equivalent milligrams as morphine per day. And does this exceed recommended guidelines".

### Using electronic health record's data to assess daily dose of opioids prescribed for outpatients with chronic non-cancer pain [^115JfyE2]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Opioid dose calculation and validation

Literature in chronic pain and addiction medicine fields recommends the use of MEDD as one of the measures to assess the risk/benefit of various opioid dosage levels. The MEDD represents a patient's daily opioid dose, expressed in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs). The MEDD is calculated by multiplying the total daily dose of a given opioid by the established conversion factor to arrive at this opioid's daily MME, then summing the daily MME for all different opioids taken by the patient. For this study, each unique opioid was assigned a conversion factor specific to this opioid and its route of administration (table 1) following the recommended conversion factors, which were cross-examined by the study's expert physicians (AEZ and NS).

Table 1
Morphine milligram equivalent conversion factors for the 10 opioid types prescribed to the target population

Long-term opioid therapy is defined as lasting for at least 90 days. With the focus of this study on patients treated with long-term opioid therapy, we established the 'prior 90 days' as the most appropriate assessment period when calculating the MEDD using the RxQuantity and RxAudit methods. Relying on a longer assessment period (eg, prior 90 days), rather than on the current prescriptions only, for assessing the MEDD is consistent with clinical practice guidelines, which recommend evaluating the patient's adherence to opioid therapy by checking their prior prescription records in the EHR and Prescription Drug Monitoring databases for signs of early refills or 'doctor shopping'. Factoring such adherence findings into the decision-making process prior to issuing a new prescription is critical for reducing the risk of opioid misuse, overdose and diversion.

### Fentanyl (fentanyl system) [^115MKsuh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

These are not tables of equianalgesic doses.
The conversion doses in these tables are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral or parenteral opioid analgesics to fentanyl transdermal system.
The tables cannot be used to convert from fentanyl transdermal system to another opioid because these conversions will result in an overestimation of the dose of the new opioid (these conversions are conservative) and may result in fatal overdosage.

Alternatively, for adult and pediatric patients taking opioids or doses not listed in Table 1, use the following methodology when converting patients from oral or parenteral opioids to fentanyl transdermal system:

Calculate the previous 24-hour analgesic requirement.
Convert this amount to the equianalgesic oral morphine dose using a reliable reference.
Refer to Table 2 for the range of 24-hour oral morphine doses that are recommended for conversion to each fentanyl transdermal system dose. Use this table to find the calculated 24-hour morphine dose and the corresponding recommended initial fentanyl transdermal system dose.
Initiate fentanyl transdermal system treatment using the recommended dose and titrate patients upwards (no more frequently than 3 days after the initial dose and every 6 days thereafter) until analgesic efficacy is attained. A 37.5 mcg/hour dose may also be used. For patients that require more than 100 mcg/hour, several transdermal systems may be used.
Do not use Table 2 to convert from fentanyl transdermal system to other therapies because this conversion to fentanyl transdermal system is conservative and will overestimate the dose of the new agent.

An additional intermediate strength 37.5 mcg/hour fentanyl transdermal system is available and may be considered during conversion from prior opioids or dose titration. For example, the 37.5 mcg/hour system could be used before converting or titrating to a 50 mcg/hour system.

The additional 37.5 mcg/hour system was not used in the clinical studies.

For delivery rates in excess of 100 mcg/hour, multiple systems may be used.

### Fentanyl transdermal system [^112SWeMj]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Fentanyl transdermal system is ONLY for use in patients who are already tolerant to opioid therapy of comparable potency. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Due to the mean half-life of approximately 17 hours, patients who are thought to have had a serious adverse event, including overdose, will require monitoring and treatment for at least 24 hours.

The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazodone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING; CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug Interactions; WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for further information).

Pediatric patients converting to fentanyl transdermal system with a 25 mcg/hr patch should be opioid-tolerant and receiving at least 60 mg of oral morphine or the equivalent per day. The dose conversion schedule described in Table C, and method of titration described below are recommended in opioid-tolerant pediatric patients over 2 years of age with chronic pain (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.

Fentanyl transdermal system should be used with caution in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations, Geriatric Use).

### Transdermal fentanyl versus sustained release oral morphine in strong-opioid naïve patients with chronic low back pain [^113Fu6Lu]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

Open, randomized, parallel group multicenter study.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl (TDF) and sustained release morphine (SRM) in strong-opioid naïve patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).

Summary Of Background Data

Most studies of TDF and SRM have involved patients already receiving strong opioids. This is the first large-scale study focusing on strong-opioid naïve patients with CLBP.

Methods

Adults with CLBP requiring regular strong opioid therapy received either TDF or SRM for 13 months. Starting doses were 25 microg/hr fentanyl patches every 72 hours or 30 mg oral morphine every 12 hours. Doses were adjusted according to response. Participants assessed pain relief and bowel function using weekly diaries. Other assessments, including quality of life, disease progression, and side effects, were made by patients and investigators.

Results

Data from 680 patients showed that TDF and SRM provided similar levels of pain relief, but TDF was associated with significantly less constipation than SRM, indicating a greater likelihood of satisfactory pain relief without unmanageable constipation for patients receiving TDF. Other ratings were similar for TDF and SRM, but TDF provided greater relief of pain at rest and at night.

Conclusions

TDF and SRM provided equivalent levels of pain relief, but TDF was associated with less constipation. This study indicates that sustained-release strong opioids can safely be used in strong-opioid naïve patients.

### Opioid equipotency conversions for hospitalized infants: a systematic review [^115s3onj]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Conversion factors, equianalgesic ratios, or equianalgesic doses used to calculate morphine milligram equivalents (MME) were extracted by full manuscript review. In articles which cited other literature documenting a conversion factor for MME, the full manuscript of the cited literature was reviewed to extract a conversion factor. Manuscripts were also reviewed to extract the source of the conversion factors chosen by authors–specifically, if the conversion factors being used in each study were generated based on adult physiology, pediatric physiology, or neonatal physiology. For the purpose of this study, we will refer to these conversion factor source populations as reference populations.

One reviewer extracted data using a standardized data collection template. The second reviewer checked the extracted data. Disagreements were re-evaluated in partnership.

### Implementation interventions to promote healthcare professional uptake of evidence-based opioid deprescribing for adults with chronic non-cancer pain [^116uYP1U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

For each study, we will present outcome data as point estimates with risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes (adherence to evidence‐based guidelines, proportion of participants prescribed, dispensed or consumed any opioid analgesic; switch in analgesia; adverse events; healthcare professional‐reported intention to change prescribing behaviour), and mean differences (MDs) with corresponding 95% CIs for continuous outcomes (MME daily dose; pain; function; HRQoL; patient satisfaction).

For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. the proportion of participants prescribed any opioid), we will transform any relevant continuous data into dichotomous data to include in meta‐analyses and use the generic inverse variance method to compare transformed effect estimates on the logarithmic scale.

Where trials use different measures for the same outcome or concept for our continuous outcomes, we will use the reported outcome measure that was the highest in our hierarchy as an index measure. We will transform means and standard deviations (SDs) of other outcome measures to the scale of the index instrument and pool the data using MD as the summary estimate. For MME dose, we will assume mg/day as the index instrument. The daily MME will be determined by first calculating the total daily dose (single‐dose studies will use the stated dose; multiple‐dose studies will multiply the stated dose by the number of doses per day) and then multiplying the daily total by the MME multiplier according to the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) opioid dose equivalence calculation table. For studies describing dosing per body weight, the daily dose will be based on the mean or median body weight reported in the trial or, if not reported, the average body weight from a similar trial or 70 kg for an average adult. For interventions that used dosing ranges (e.g. one to two tablets every four to six hours) without an average number of daily tablets reported, the dose will be calculated as the maximum allowable daily MME. For pain, we will assume the 0 to 10 scale (zero represents no pain) as the index instrument. For function, we will assume the 0 to 100 scale (100 represents the best function) as the index instrument. If different scales are used to measure quality of life, we will not nominate an index measure, but we will calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs. The SMD will be re‐expressed as a MD on a typical scale by multiplying by a typical among‐person SD (e.g. the SD of the control group at baseline from the most representative study).

### Intravenous acetaminophen for postoperative delirium-reply… [^1138xqZA]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In Reply We agree with Dr Wanek that the fentanyl conversion factor for morphine equivalents was incorrect. A conversion factor of 2. 4 was used per current recommendations1 for conversion of fentanyl transdermal patch dosage in micrograms per hour to morphine equivalents in milligrams per day. Cardiac surgical patients in this trial received IV fentanyl; therefore, the correct conversion factor for fentanyl in an opioid-naive patient is 100. We recalculated additional postoperative analgesic requirements as the sum of + + morphine dose + morphine milligram equivalents. In the original article, the median opioid dose was 322. 5 µg in the acetaminophen groups and
405. 3 µg in the placebo groups.

Using the revised formula, the acetaminophen groups still received a lower opioid dose in the first 48 hours postoperatively compared with the placebo groups, which was statistically significant.

2.3 Initial Dosage

Do not initiate treatment with fentanyl transdermal system in opioid nontolerant patients [see Contraindications (4)].

The recommended starting dose when converting from other opioids to fentanyl transdermal system is intended to minimize the potential for overdosing patients with the first dose.

Conversion From Other Opioids to Fentanyl Transdermal System:

When fentanyl transdermal system therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

While there are useful tables of opioid equivalents readily available, there is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products. As such, it is preferable to underestimate a patient's 24-hour fentanyl requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the

24-hour fentanyl requirements which could result in adverse reactions. In a fentanyl transdermal system clinical trial, patients were converted from their prior opioid to fentanyl transdermal system using Table 1 as a guide for the initial fentanyl transdermal system dose.

Each fentanyl transdermal system is worn continuously for up to 72 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

When converting patients from oral or parenteral opioids to fentanyl transdermal system, use Table 1 (alternatively use Table 2 for adult and pediatric patients taking opioids or doses not listed in Table 1) and consider the following:

For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion.
Reduce the calculated daily oral hydrocodone dose by 25%

Always round the dose down, if necessary, to the nearest HYSINGLA ER tablet strength available and initiate therapy with that dose. If the converted HYSINGLA ER dose using Table 1 is less than 20 mg, initiate therapy with HYSINGLA ER 20 mg.

Example conversion from a single opioid to HYSINGLA ER:

For example, a total daily dose of oxycodone 50 mg would be converted to hydrocodone 50 mg based on the table above, and then multiplied by 0.75 (i.e., take a 25% reduction) resulting in a dose of 37.5 mg hydrocodone. Round this down to the nearest dose strength available, HYSINGLA ER 30 mg, to initiate therapy.

Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal or for signs of over-sedation/toxicity after converting patients to HYSINGLA ER.

Conversion from Methadone to HYSINGLA ER

Regular evaluation is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.

Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to HYSINGLA ER

Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, HYSINGLA ER treatment can be initiated. For each 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch, a dose of HYSINGLA ER 20 mg every 24 hours represents a conservative initial dose. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to HYSINGLA ER, as there is limited experience with this conversion.

### A proposed opioid tapering tool [^115cjQCA]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Previous studies suggest a lack of confidence among primary care providers in managing patients on chronic opioid therapy (COT) for chronic non-cancer related pain (CNCP). The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently introduced guidelines on opioid tapering. In light of these recommendations, our group developed an opioid tapering software to assist healthcare providers in managing patients on COT.

Methods

The initial iteration of our software utilizes RedCap for the application programming interface (API). This tool is designed to reduce a patient's prescribed chronic opioids by 5–10% every month, or 5 morphine milligram equivalents per day (MME), whichever is the greatest, in line with HHS guidelines. Users can also adjust the rate of taper.

Discussion

Our group plans to use this software in an upcoming pilot study to taper patients on COT for CNCP. We are exploring the possibility of transitioning our software into other available APIs with the goal of integrating this software into major electronic health record systems. Our group envisions that our software will provide an additional tool within a patient-centered, multi-modal framework in managing patients on COT for CNCP.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^117Gq9xZ]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

International opioid consumption patterns and policy drivers — A 2022 congressional report stated that the amount of prescription opioids dispensed per million people per day in the United States is approximately 4 times the median for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, and a country level observational study showed decline of opioid rates from 216 to 152 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per 1,000 persons between 2009 and 2019 with consumption declines in the United States and Germany. In Germany, opioids were more common in older people and women in the North, Fentanyl was the most prescribed strong opioid in outpatient settings, and authors felt there were no signs of an opioid epidemic. Decreases in volume and dosage have been driven by changes in clinical usage, restrictive legislation enacted since 2012, and CDC guidelines; legislation including the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act has resulted in prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) in all states that facilitate decreases in inappropriate prescriptions.

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride (Exalgo) [^111dqsyk]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Example conversion from a single opioid to EXALGO:

Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid

30 mg of oxycodone twice daily equals a total daily dose of 60 mg of oxycodone

Step 2: Calculate the approximately equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the opioid

Multiply the 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone by the conversion factor of 0.4 for a result of 24 mg of oral hydromorphone

Step 3: Calculate the starting dose of EXALGO, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose

50% of 24 mg results in an initial dose of 12 mg of EXALGO once daily
Adjust individually for each patient

Table 1. Conversion Ratios to EXALGO*

* The conversion ratios and approximate equivalent doses in this conversion table are only to be used for the conversion from current opioid therapy to EXALGO.

It is extremely important to monitor all patients closely when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and tends to accumulate in the plasma.

Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to EXALGO

Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, EXALGO treatment can be initiated. For each 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal dose, the equianalgesic dose of EXALGO is 12 mg every 24 hours. An appropriate starting dose of EXALGO is 50% of the calculated total daily dose every 24 hours.

Morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dosing — conversion method and cautions for full opioid receptor agonists state that all doses are expressed as mg/d except for fentanyl, and to multiply the daily opioid dose by the conversion factor to determine the equianalgesic dose in MME, recognizing these conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability. The guidance specifies not to use the calculated MME dose to set the dose of a new opioid when converting; the new opioid is typically dosed at substantially lower than the calculated MME dose (33–50% less) to avoid accidental overdose due to incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. Particular caution is advised with fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/d, and absorption is affected by heat and other factors. The HHS conversion factors table does not have an associated MME conversion factor for buprenorphine products.

Fentanyl patch vs morphine — outcome importance and research needs emphasize that in the setting of the current US opioid epidemic, the use of multimodal, non-opioid medications is the goal right now; moving away from the routine use of opioids such as Fentanyl and Morphine has been a priority for surgeons, anesthesiologists and patients; the ability to provide opioid medications in the postoperative period without maintenance of intravenous access may be appealing as the number of ambulatory total joint arthroplasties increase; future research should be focused on patients who may benefit from Fentanyl patch or Morphine PCA in the postoperative period such as chronic pain patients or those who have uncontrolled pain in the setting of aggressive multimodal oral analgesia.

### Fentanyl transdermal system [^111VZt8T]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Alternatively, for adult and pediatric patients taking opioids or doses not listed in Table C, use the conversion methodology outlined above with Table D.

* Table C should not be used to convert from fentanyl transdermal system to other therapies because this conversion to fentanyl transdermal system is conservative. Use of Table C for conversion to other analgesic therapies can overestimate the dose of the new agent. Overdosage of the new analgesic agent is possible (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Discontinuation of Fentanyl Transdermal System).

The majority of patients are adequately maintained with fentanyl transdermal system administered every 72 hours. Some patients may not achieve adequate analgesia using this dosing interval and may require systems to be applied every 48 hours rather than every 72 hours. An increase in the fentanyl transdermal system dose should be evaluated before changing dosing intervals in order to maintain patients on a 72-hour regimen. Dosing intervals less than every 72 hours were not studied in children and adolescents and are not recommended.

Because of the increase in serum fentanyl concentration over the first 24 hours following initial system application, the initial evaluation of the maximum analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system cannot be made before 24 hours of wearing. The initial fentanyl transdermal system dose may be increased after 3 days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Dose Titration).

During the initial application of fentanyl transdermal system, patients should use short-acting analgesics as needed until analgesic efficacy with fentanyl transdermal system is attained. Thereafter, some patients still may require periodic supplemental doses of other short-acting analgesics for "breakthrough" pain.

Dose Titration

The recommended initial fentanyl transdermal system dose based upon the daily oral morphine dose is conservative, and 50% of patients are likely to require a dose increase after initial application of fentanyl transdermal system. The initial fentanyl transdermal system dose may be increased after 3 days based on the daily dose of supplemental opioid analgesics required by the patient in the second or third day of the initial application.

Physicians are advised that it may take up to 6 days after increasing the dose of fentanyl transdermal system for the patient to reach equilibrium on the new dose (see graph in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, patients should wear a higher dose through two applications before any further increase in dosage is made on the basis of the average daily use of a supplemental analgesic.

Appropriate dosage increments should be based on the daily dose of supplementary opioids, using the ratio of 45 mg/24 hours of oral morphine to a 12.5 mcg/hr increase in fentanyl transdermal system dose.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^115gGVWw]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid dose–risk evidence indicates that higher morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and tramadol dosing are associated with adverse outcomes. In patients on moderate doses (< 200 MME), an overdose rate of 7.92 (9.94 per 1,000 population) was reported, and patients receiving > 120 MME per day were more likely to have drug-related encounters than those getting lower doses. Implementation of guidelines that considered 120 MME as a high dose reduced overall opioids per day by 27% and long-acting Schedule II opioids by 37% among those on > 120 MME per day, and the number of deaths was reduced by 50% from 2009 to 2010. High dose tramadol (> 400 mg) showed an increasing frequency of adverse effects with 2 patients experiencing seizures. Doses > 100 MME per day have not been validated in clinical trials and should be considered excessive, and available literature correlates increasing mortality with increasing doses.

### Poor adhesion of fentanyl transdermal patches may mimic end-of-dosage failure after 48 hours and prompt early patch replacement in hospitalized cancer pain patients [^1178nwmR]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Besides fentanyl, 46% of the patients obtained co-analgesic agents. Metamizole was the most often used non-opioid co-analgesic, either alone (19.9%) or in combination with paracetamol (3.8%) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (2%). Paracetamol was the second most often prescribed co-analgesic agent (14.4%). The use of co-analgesic did not differ if the replacement interval for fentanyl TTS was 48 hours or other (data not shown). The CYP 3A4 inducers St John's wort, carbamazepine, and rifampicin were administered to seven patients (0.9%) whose fentanyl TTSs were not replaced after 48 hours.

Additional breakthrough pain medication (rescue) was needed by 91.2% of the patients. Morphine was the most often used rescue medication and was administered as oral drops (44.2%), parenteral formulation (16.9%), or a combination of both (22.3%). For the fentanyl TTSs that were replaced after 48 hours, the mean dosages of breakthrough pain medication (calculated as oral morphine equivalent in milligram) were similarly high during the first day/0–24 hours and the next day/24–48 hours (first day: 185.1 mg versus second day: 157.0 mg; Wilcoxon p = 0.57), but 4.5-fold and 5.5-fold higher than the fentanyl TTS with other replacement time (first day: 185.1 mg versus 39.6 mg; Chi = 238.3, p < 0.001; second day: 157.0 mg versus 28.8 mg; Chi = 227.2, p < 0.001; Table 2). For the fentanyl TTS with other replacement time, the mean dosages of breakthrough pain medication did not change over the three consecutive days (39.6 mg [first day] and 30.2 mg [third day]; Wilcoxon p = 0.83; Table 2). Range and significance of the values remained after exclusion of the three patients with highest dosages of fentanyl TTS, ie, > 300 µg/hour.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxycontin) [^117EgrnV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Step #1: To calculate the estimated total OXYCONTIN daily dosage using Table 1:

For pediatric patients taking a single opioid, sum the current total daily dosage of the opioid and then multiply the total daily dosage by the approximate conversion factor to calculate the approximate OXYCONTIN daily dosage.
For pediatric patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oxycodone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain the approximate OXYCONTIN daily dosage.
For pediatric patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion.

Step #2: If rounding is necessary, always round the dosage down to the nearest OXYCONTIN tablet strength available and initiate OXYCONTIN therapy with that dose. If the calculated OXYCONTIN total daily dosage is less than 20 mg, there is no safe strength for conversion and do not initiate OXYCONTIN.

Example conversion from a single opioid (e.g., hydrocodone) to OXYCONTIN: Using the conversion factor of 0.9 for oral hydrocodone in Table 1, a total daily hydrocodone dosage of 50 mg is converted to 45 mg of oxycodone per day or 22.5 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours. After rounding down to the nearest strength available, the recommended OXYCONTIN starting dosage is 20 mg every 12 hours.

Step #3: Close observation and titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal or for signs of over-sedation/toxicity after converting patients to OXYCONTIN [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] for important instructions on titration and maintenance of therapy.

There is limited experience with conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN in pediatric patients 11 years and older. If switching from transdermal fentanyl patch to OXYCONTIN, ensure that the patch has been removed for at least 18 hours prior to starting OXYCONTIN. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, start with a conservative conversion: substitute 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours for each 25 mcg per hour fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN.

If using asymmetric dosing, instruct patients to take the higher dose in the morning and the lower dose in the evening.

### Opioid taper practices among clinicians [^115agBbx]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The target audience for these guidelines was primary care providers treating chronic pain patients. The guidelines provided recommendations to limit morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and, more specifically, to avoid increasing > 90 mg/day without careful justification or guidance as to how to taper patients to these doses. Statements regarding MME are concerning as they were made without acknowledging the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability among different opioids. The guidelines also failed to note the variability among MME calculations/calculators which limits standardized conversion from one opioid to another. Subsequent data has indicated that providers, payers and policy makers have misapplied these recommendations. For this reason we have included questions pertaining to comfort level tapering at various MME in the survey.

Prior to and in response to these guidelines several states passed laws establishing maximum daily doses for opioids and many third-party payers have followed suit by limiting coverage based on maximum MMEs. Individual providers have often erred by applying the guidelines inflexibly and without regard for patient specific factors. Others have misapplied the recommendations to populations beyond the scope of the guideline such as those with cancer, those receiving medication assisted treatment for opioid addiction or post-surgical patients. In a commentary published approximately three years after the writing of the guidelines two of the authors commented that better evidence is needed to guide clinical decisions regarding when and how to reduce high dose opioids for patients receiving long term therapy. These laws and plan limitations pose multiple problems in our health care system including limiting patient access to necessary medications, potentially putting patients in danger of opioid withdrawal if their therapy is abruptly discontinued, and increased suicidality.

### A randomized trial looking at planning prompts to reduce opioid prescribing [^112fkYvH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs)

Of the 1,538,821 prescriptions dispensed during the study, 559,658 (36.37%) were for an opioid. Logarithm-transformed MME normalized the distribution (Supplementary Fig. S1a, b). Table 3 shows the change in average total weekly MME pre-to-post intervention between study arms. In the comparator arm, the average weekly MME decreased from 157.81 (95% CI: 153.85, 161.76) pre-intervention to 77.05 (95% CI: 75.12, 78.98) post-intervention, compared to 157.70 (95% CI: 153.45, 161.96) and 103.16 (95% CI: 100.34, 105.98) in the standard arm. The difference in average weekly MME pre-to-post intervention was −80.76 (95% CI: −82.92, −78.60) in the comparator arm and −54.55 (95% CI: −56.05, −53.04) in the standard arm. The difference in average weekly MME pre-to-post intervention between study arms was −26.21 (95% CI: −29.63, −22.86), corresponding to a 12.85% (95% CI: 6.83%, 18.49%; P < 0.001) greater decrease in MME among prescribers randomized to the comparator letter (Supplementary Table S1a).

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride [^111YRJxK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets

Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets treatment can be initiated. To calculate the 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose, use a conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Then reduce the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose by 50%.

For example:

Step 1: Identify the dose of transdermal fentanyl.

75 mg of transdermal fentanyl

Step 2: Use the conversion factor of 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

75 mg of transdermal fentanyl: 36 mg total daily dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets

Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the converted dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets strengths available.

50% of 36 mg results in an initial dose of 18 mg, which would be rounded down to 16 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily
Adjust individually for each patient

Conversion from Methadone to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets

Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.

### Novel opioid analgesics for the development of transdermal opioid patches that possess morphine-like pharmacological profiles rather than fentanyl: possible opioid switching alternatives among patch formula [^111CvJDU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Are there novel opioid analgesics potentially suitable for patch formulation for transitioning from transdermal fentanyl?
Findings: We synthesized novel opioids new-opioid 1 (N1) and new-opioid 2 (N2), which possess morphine-like pharmacological profiles with transdermal activity, and they showed fewer tolerance characteristics in fentanyl-tolerant mice.
Meaning: Analgesics, such as N1 and N2, could serve as novel transdermal opioids for transitioning from fentanyl patches.

A recent review of the pharmacological management of cancer pain reported that 70% of cancer patients experience acute or chronic cancer pain, manifesting as physical pain with psychological and social effects that significantly reduce quality of life. – Approximately 80% of cancer pain is now controlled with the proper use of analgesics; pain is generally managed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pain ladder, and potent opioids are typically used. Fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone are commonly used according to the patients' pain condition. Among these analgesics, fentanyl patches are widely used because they require no administration devices, offer safety and convenience, avoid the first-pass effect, and are slowly absorbed to maintain the required blood concentrations. However, use of these patches is associated with tolerance, often necessitating a transition to other opioids. – Unfortunately, morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone have poor transdermal absorption, and there are currently no alternative potent opioid patches to substitute for transdermal fentanyl. Thus, the development of novel opioid patch formulations is essential.

### Standardizing research methods for opioid dose comparison: the NIH HEAL morphine milligram equivalent calculator [^112XFhiA]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We developed the National Institutes of Health helping to end addiction long-term initiative morphine milligram equivalent (MME) calculator to standardize MME calculations across pain research studies, addressing a critical barrier to effective research synthesis and meta-analysis. The tool provides evidence-based mapping factors for 29 opioids through a research electronic data capture-based calculator and companion Web site (research-mme.wakehealth.edu). Development involved systematic evidence evaluation of literature from 1949 to March 2024, following PRISMA guidelines. From an initial screening of over 170,050 articles, we identified 24 studies providing evidence for conversion factors. The calculator incorporates 4 standardized time-window calculation methods aligned with current research approaches and includes traditional full agonists, partial agonists, and mixed-mechanism agents. Using modified GRADE methodology, we evaluated evidence quality for each conversion factor, documenting levels from high-quality randomized controlled trials to pharmacokinetic extrapolation. Our tool replicates most existing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conversion factors while expanding coverage to 7 additional opioids and 6 formulations not included in the 2022 CDC conversion table. The calculator features options to analyze results with or without buprenorphine, accommodating its emerging role in pain research. This standardized framework enables researchers to map opioid doses using consistent, evidence-based ratios and harmonize data collection across research networks. While the tool represents a significant advance in standardizing MME calculations for research, limitations in the underlying evidence base highlight the need for continued validation through clinical research.

### Fentanyl (fentanyl system) [^115umUh5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate fentanyl transdermal system to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.21)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics.

Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of fentanyl transdermal system, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the fentanyl transdermal system dosage.

The dosing interval for fentanyl transdermal system is 72 hours. Do not increase the fentanyl transdermal system dose for the first time until at least 3 days after the initial application. Titrate the dose based on the daily dose of supplemental opioid analgesics required by the patient on the second or third day of the initial application.

It may take up to 6 days for fentanyl levels to reach equilibrium on a new dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, evaluate patients for further titration after no less than two 3-day applications before any further increase in dosage is made.

Base dosage increments on the daily dosage of supplementary opioids, using the ratio of 45 mg/24 hours of oral morphine to a 12 mcg/hour increase in fentanyl transdermal system dose.

If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

A small proportion of adult patients may not achieve adequate analgesia using a 72-hour dosing interval and may require systems to be applied at 48 hours rather than at 72 hours, only if adequate pain control cannot be achieved using a 72-hour regimen. An increase in the fentanyl transdermal system dose should be evaluated before changing dosing intervals in order to maintain patients on a 72-hour regimen.

Dosing intervals less than every 72 hours were not studied in children and adolescents and are not recommended.

### High opioid doses, naloxone, and central nervous system active medications received by Medicare-enrolled adults [^114BDPCf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

From an initial sample of 55,951, a total of 4568 patients were included, of which 3452 (76%) had a daily MME < 50 and 1116 (24%) had a daily MME ≥ 50. The majority of patients were ≥ 65 years of age (75%), predominantly female (66%), and had ≥ 4 prescribers (74%) with 1 prescribing opioids (54%). Patients were also mostly with ≥ 11 unique medications (81%), used 2 pharmacies (58%), and predominantly (80%) resided in regions where more than 10% of households lived below the federal poverty level. Complete demographic information appears in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Results from logistic regression assessing relationship between patient characteristics and prescribing of mean daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) ≥ 50

A multivariate logistic regression found age (p < 0.001), sex (p = 0.003), and number of unique medications (p < 0.001) associated with having a daily MME ≥ 50. Patients < 85 years of age compared to individuals ≥ 85 had 1.57–4.19 times the odds of being prescribed a daily MME ≥ 50. Males were more likely than females to be prescribed a daily MME ≥ 50, (OR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.08–1.45, p = 0.003). While the number of medications was significantly associated with being prescribed a daily MME ≥ 50, only patients with ≥ 17 unique medications compared to patients with 8–10 medications had a significant association with having a daily MME ≥ 50 (OR: 1.55, 95% CI 1.25–1.93, p < 0.001). Complete results from the regression are presented in Table 1.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxycontin) [^113WSN3X]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4 Conversion from Opioids to OXYCONTIN in Adults

Conversion from Other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to OXYCONTIN

If switching from other oral oxycodone formulations to OXYCONTIN, administer one half of the patient's total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCONTIN every 12 hours.

Conversion from Other Opioids to OXYCONTIN When OXYCONTIN therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to OXYCONTIN defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours.

It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral oxycodone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioids.

Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to OXYCONTIN.

Conversion from Methadone to OXYCONTIN

Regular evaluation is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.

Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to OXYCONTIN

Treatment with OXYCONTIN can be initiated after the transdermal fentanyl patch has been removed for at least 18 hours. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, start with a conservative conversion: substitute 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours for each 25 mcg per hour fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion.

RESULTS

Twenty‐two persons were included in the study, 14 opioid‐naïve subjects (7 men/7 women, mean age: 24 years (range 20–35 years), weight: 72 ± 4 kg, body mass index: 23.0 ± 4.0 kg/m 2) and 8 chronic opioid users (3 men/5 women, mean age: 42 (range 31–53 years), weight: 77 ± 11 kg, body mass index: 26 ± 4 kg/m 2) that used high‐dose opioids for at least 3 months (range 0.25–29 years; Table 1). Two opioid‐naïve individuals withdrew consent after their first fentanyl dosing session but their data were included in the analysis (PK/PD data for one subject and only PK data for the other). Two chronic opioid users were in a medically supervised substitution setting. One used intranasal heroin obtained from the harm reduction clinic, and the other was on stable substitution treatment with buprenorphine. Both had concurrent use of other drugs of abuse, including cocaine and cannabis. Other chronic opioid users were taking prescription opioid medications (predominantly oral oxycodone or fentanyl transdermal patch) for a variety of chronic pain conditions. The mean morphine‐equivalent dose was 220 ± 134 mg per day. All chronic opioid users were successfully transitioned to oxycodone and, on average, 114 mg oxycodone (range 50–315 mg) was consumed daily on bridging days. On the study day, no oxycodone or any opioid other than fentanyl was consumed.

Hydromorphone maintenance dosing includes "PO: 2 mg q4h" and "IV: 0.4 mg q3h" with "CI: 0.5 mg/hr". Class cautions note "All opioids confer risk of addiction and life-threatening respiratory depression" and "Extended-release preparations are not intended for acute pain", with an additional fentanyl-specific consideration that "Fentanyl may accumulate in lipid stores with prolonged use".

### Safety concerns with the centers for disease control opioid calculator [^1114DiLo]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

MME dosing was designed in an attempt to examine opioids with similar analgesic effects and should not be used to determine an exact mathematical dosing conversion. The pharmacology and unique properties of each opioid and patient individuality must be considered when a therapeutic opioid conversion is contemplated. Conversion should not simply rely on a mathematical formula embedded within the CDC calculator software. Furthermore, the current calculation for methadone employed by the calculator could allow for potentially dangerous conversions. This is especially problematic considering this calculator is intended to target nonspecialist, general practitioners. We expect a higher level of scientific accuracy and integrity from an agency entrusted to protect citizens' health and welfare.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — buprenorphine transdermal system (TDS) dosing and precautions: Buprenorphine TDS is available in every 7 day patch formulation that delivers 5 mcg/hr, 7.5 mcg/hr, 10 mcg/hr, 15 mcg/hr, and 20 mcg/hr. In opioid-naïve patients or those on < 30 mg MEDD of an alternate agent, initiate treatment with a 5 mcg/hr patch; because buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal in patients already on opioids, the dose of other opioid should be tapered to ≤ 30 mg MEDD before initiating buprenorphine, and the 10 mcg/hr patch may then be initiated at the next dosing interval. Initial buprenorphine TDS dose can also be based on previous oral morphine equivalent, with 10 mcg/hr for 30–80mg MEDD; the maximum dose of buprenorphine TDS 20 mcg/hr may not provide adequate analgesia for patients requiring greater than 80 mg MEDD, and an alternate analgesic should be considered. Dosage does not need to be adjusted in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, renal impairment, or in the elderly. Due to risk of QTc prolongation, the dose of one 20 mcg/hr patch per week should not be exceeded, avoid use in patients with long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome, or those taking Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmic medications, and advise patients that application of external heat (e.g., hot baths, sunbathing, saunas, heating pads) increases maximum plasma concentration of buprenorphine and risk of fatal overdose.

Results

Included studies

A PRISMA flow diagram showing the screening process and reasons for exclusion is shown in Figure 1. A total of 109 studies were identified from searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases, one additional study was identified from hand searching the reference lists of identified articles, and one study was identified by ad hoc searching. The major reason for discarding articles was that they were non-comparative studies, or that they were general reviews or non-English language articles. In total, six studies that compared TD buprenorphine and TD fentanyl and 11 studies that compared TD buprenorphine and/or TD fentanyl with other pain medications were identified. Among studies comparing TD buprenorphine and TD fentanyl, three were prospective, of which one was a direct comparison of TD buprenorphine and TD fentanyl, and three studies were retrospective.–Among studies comparing TD buprenorphine and/or TD fentanyl with other pain medications, the majority (seven studies) were prospective,–two were retrospective, and two were meta-analyses or systematic reviews. Table 1 presents the design of included studies comparing TD buprenorphine with TD fentanyl, and Table 2 presents the design of included studies comparing TD buprenorphine and/or TD fentanyl with other pain medications.

Utilization of TD buprenorphine and TD fentanyl

Two studies reported outcomes associated with utilization of TB buprenorphine or TD fentanyl in patients with cancer pain. Of these one study directly compared TD buprenorphine with TD fentanyland one study compared TD buprenorphine and/or TD fentanyl with other pain medications.

Direct comparison

A retrospective study examined mean prescribed doses of TD buprenorphine and TD fentanyl to compare calculated equipotent oral morphine doses. Of 2544 patients in a German database who had received ≥ 1 prescription for TD buprenorphine or TD fentanyl for cancer pain, mean prescribed daily doses were lower with TD buprenorphine than with TD fentanyl. Equipotent oral daily morphine doses, calculated using current conversion ratios, were statistically significantly lower with TD buprenorphine than with TD fentanyl (P < 0.001).

Indirect comparisons

Preliminary analysis of 330 patients enrolled in a multicenter, observational study in Italy showed that 56.7% of patients received a strong opioid. Fentanyl and buprenorphine TD delivery systems were the most regularly prescribed (23.8% and 9.6% of patients, respectively). Morphine and oxycodone were prescribed in 11.3% and 10.8% of patients, respectively, while methadone was prescribed in only 1%.

### Practical management of opioid rotation and equianalgesia [^116mH1LR]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the recent literature on opioid rotation (ie, switching from one opioid drug to another or changing an opioid's administration route) in cancer patients experiencing severe pain and to develop a novel equianalgesia table for use in routine clinical practice.

Methods

The MEDLINE database was searched with terms "cancer pain", "opioid rotation", "opioid switching", "opioid ratio", "opioid conversion ratio", and "opioid equianalgesia" for the major opioids (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, and hydromorphone) and the intravenous, subcutaneous, oral, and transdermal administration routes. Selected articles were assessed for the calculated or cited opioid dose ratio, bidirectionality, and use of the oral morphine equivalent daily dose or a direct drug-to-drug ratio.

Results

Twenty publications met our selection criteria and were analyzed in detail. We did not find any large-scale, prospective, double-blind randomized controlled trial with robust design, and most of the studies assessed relatively small numbers of patients. Bidirectionality was investigated in seven studies only.

Conclusion

The updated equianalgesic table presented here incorporates the latest data and provides information on bidirectionality. Despite the daily use of equianalgesic tables, they are not based on high-level scientific evidence. More clinical research is needed on this topic.

### Safety concerns with the centers for disease control opioid calculator [^111sXnpi]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Morphine milligram equivalence (MME) and other comparable acronyms have been employed in federal pain guidelines and used by policy makers to limit opioid prescribing.–On March 18, 2016, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released its Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The guidelines provided 12 recommendations for "primary care clinicians prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care". One of the CDC recommendations states that clinicians "should avoid increasing dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day".

There has been controversy regarding the methodology used to develop the CDC opioid prescribing guidelines, including concern regarding the bias of the guideline committees due to its domination by the anti-opioid group, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. The CDC used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework for producing evidence-based recommendations; however, the guidelines deviated significantly from the established GRADE methodology without associated justification. There is a significant mismatch in the strength of the recommendations made in the guidelines and the supporting evidence. When considering that all recommendations were based on level 3 or 4 evidence yet eleven of the recommendations were assigned grade A, this is a major deviation from the National Clearing House guidelines on levels of evidence and grades of recommendations. The CDC guidelines excluded studies with observation periods of less than 1 year for basing their recommendations on the benefits and risks of opioids. According to the CDC guidelines, "No evidence shows a long-term benefit of opioids in pain and function versus no opioids for chronic pain with outcomes examined at least 1 year later". This is inconsistent with current standards on analgesic study durations in chronic pain. The international harmonized standards adopted by the United States for approval of chronic pain interventions recommend 12 weeks for efficacy assessment. Tayeb et al conducted a review evaluating analgesic trial durations for opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and behavioral therapy. The authors found that nearly all trials had active treatment durations of 12 weeks or less across 869 articles. Commenting on CDC's recommendation on nonopioid therapies, Tayeb et al wrote, "if a one year minimum threshold for duration of active treatment were required to justify using any of the major typical therapies for chronic pain, then none of these nonopioid therapies could be recommended".

ASIPP dose descriptions — morphine milligram equivalents (MME) thresholds and overdose risk note that, with overwhelming evidence for the risk of misuse and limited efficacy of chronic opioid therapy, the rationale for high-dose opioids is limited and absolute MME cut offs remain inconsistent. Generally, patients who do not respond to low or medium opioid doses are unlikely to respond to higher doses. Guidance thresholds cited include State of Washington advice that the daily dose of opioids should not exceed 120 mg of MME; American Pain Society/AAPM defining "high doses" as 100 mg MME; CDC guidelines recommended a limit of 50–90 MME; ASIPP designation of low dose as 40 MME; and a Canadian "watchful dose" at 200 MME. Reported overdose risk signals include increased risk when dose is equivalent to 50 MME or higher, a 9-fold increase in overdoses at higher doses of opioids (> 100 MME) versus lower doses (< 20 MME), greater overdose risk if daily doses are above 40 MME, and much higher overdose death rates at higher doses (200–400 MME) and at very high doses > 400 MME).

### A randomized, open, parallel group, multicenter trial to investigate analgesic efficacy and safety of a new transdermal fentanyl patch compared to standard opioid treatment in cancer pain [^113qtmJ6]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

A new 72-hour transdermal fentanyl matrix patch has been designed, which has a 35%-50% reduction of the absolute fentanyl content compared with other currently available transdermal fentanyl patches that are using the matrix technology. The new patch has previously been shown to be pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to the marketed fentanyl patch. To determine noninferiority in efficacy in cancer patients and to compare safety, a clinical trial comparing the new fentanyl patch with standard oral or transdermal opioid treatment was planned. The design was an open, parallel group, multicenter trial, in which 220 patients were randomized to receive either the fentanyl patch or standard opioid treatment for 30 days. The primary efficacy variable, pain intensity (PI) on a 0–10-point numerical rating scale, was recorded once daily. The primary endpoint was the relative area under the curve of PI expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible PI area under the curve. Any adverse events were recorded; four tolerability endpoints, constipation, nausea, daytime drowsiness, and sleeping disturbances, were assessed daily. Noninferiority was shown; the upper 95% confidence interval limits of the mean difference in relative PI area under the curve between the fentanyl patch and standard opioid treatment were less than 10% for both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. Scores for the tolerability endpoints were similar in the treatment groups. The new fentanyl matrix patch with a lower drug load was found noninferior and as safe as established standard oral and transdermal opioid treatment.

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: expert opinion [^113RkEfS]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Consensus Recommendation

Clinical best judgment should be used to individualize any conversion, but the following can be considered while noting that some downward titration may be necessary for patients on high opioid doses:

For patients taking doses below the following amounts (∼ ≤ 90 MME):

Fentanyl transdermal: ≤ 25 µg/h
Oxycodone: ≤ 60 mg/d
Hydrocodone or morphine: ≤ 90 mg/d
Hydromorphone: ≤ 16 mg/d
Oxymorphone: ≤ 45 mg/d
Tapentadol: Any dose

Discontinue after the last nighttime dose.
Consider initiating an adrenergic α₂ agonist (e.g. clonidine, lofexidine) or an immediate-release opioid (e.g. current opioid) to reduce the risk of withdrawal.
Initiate buprenorphine the following morning per the prescribing information, as either 10-µg/h transdermal buprenorphine or 150-µg buccal buprenorphine twice daily. Titrate buprenorphine as needed for pain per recommendations in the prescribing information.

In patients transitioning to buprenorphine from higher doses of opioids (∼ > 90 MME):

Fentanyl transdermal: > 25 µg/h
Oxycodone: > 60 mg/d
Hydrocodone or morphine: > 90 mg/d
Hydromorphone: > 16 mg/d
Oxymorphone: > 45 mg/d

Discontinue after the last nighttime dose.
Consider initiating an adrenergic α₂ agonist (e.g. clonidine, lofexidine) or an immediate-release opioid (e.g. current opioid) to reduce the risk of withdrawal.
Initiate buprenorphine the following morning as either 20-µg/h transdermal buprenorphine once daily or 300-µg buccal buprenorphine twice daily and follow the recommendations in the prescribing information for upward titration as needed. Note that 20 µg/h is the highest dose of transdermal buprenorphine currently available in the United States. If these doses are ineffective, consider higher doses of the buccal formulation on the basis of risk/benefit analysis.

Short-acting opioids have been suggested to prevent withdrawal during the switch to buprenorphine.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^116Y2cPv]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) opioid prescribing guidelines — background and scope state that opioid prescribing in the United States is decreasing while the opioid epidemic is "continuing at an uncontrollable rate", with "a significant number of opioid deaths, primarily associated with illicit fentanyl use", and that "the data show no clear correlation between opioid prescribing (either number of prescriptions or morphine milligram equivalent [MME] per capita), opioid hospitalizations, and deaths". The document states that "the 2016 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have resulted in notable problems including increased hospitalizations and mental health disorders" related to "lack of appropriate opioid prescribing" and "inaptly rapid tapering or weaning processes", and notes that "a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic has been emerging". Objectives are "to provide guidance for the prescription of opioids for the management of chronic non-cancer pain", based upon "a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence" by a multidisciplinary panel "assessing the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations". Methods included developing objectives and key questions, use of "trustworthy standards" with "appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest(s)", literature review of opioid use, abuse, effectiveness, and adverse consequences, and panel review with tabulated comments and incorporated changes. The multidisciplinary panel "finalized 20 guideline recommendations for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain", and the summary reports "over 90% agreement for the final 20 recommendations".

### Poor adhesion of fentanyl transdermal patches may mimic end-of-dosage failure after 48 hours and prompt early patch replacement in hospitalized cancer pain patients [^115orG3H]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This study has several strengths. First, patients received a wide range of transdermal fentanyl dosages, reflecting real-world practice in pain cancer treatment. Second, quantitative data were backed up with qualitative data obtained from the health care professionals currently caring for cancer patients. Thus, this mixed method approach was able to add further facets in exploring the reasons for early transdermal patch replacement. Finally, our findings represent a real-life context and add to the current knowledge base on the very real perception for need to change dose in patients.

This study has some limitations. First, the conversion of the rescue medication into oral morphine equivalent was calculated with the equipotency references available from Swiss Hospitals. Other sources might propose other references, which might influence the final values. However, the most often used rescue medication in this study was morphine whose factor 100 is universal. Thus, the potential variations in the calculated rescue medications can be considered as marginal. Second, the rescue medication was extracted from the records and summed over 24 hours from 12 am to 11:59 pm. Because most of the fentanyl TTS were administered at 2 pm, a shift is thinkable within the amount of rescue medication calculated over each 24 hours. However, this difference concerns only the first 14 hours and merges into the next interval. As a consequence, the overall values might be marginally influenced. Third, the electronic confirmation of the administrations contained some errors. Small typing errors were corrected when the identification of the product was unequivocal (eg, one fentanyl TTS 50 µg/hour was recorded as 50 fentanyl TTSs) or when the intention was unequivocal (eg, the stop time was entered as an administration time). From the total 3,122 fentanyl TTS administered to 739 patients, 27.9% were excluded because of missing data from a major field, mostly the strength. This might be due to time constraint on the wards or different interpretation of the entry fields in the database. Nevertheless, the final analysis of 2,250 fentanyl TTS allows strong results. Fourth, pain assessment was not taken into consideration. Thorough pain assessment and reassessment guide the monitoring and the dosing of the administered pain medication and are performed routinely at St Clara hospital. However, our aims were not to correlate the administered pain medication according to patients' pain scores, and thus, we focused more on data sets related to our question of interest. Finally, we did not scientifically determine the reasons for early change, such as comparison of residual content of patches or sequential blood levels.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate fentanyl transdermal system to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.21)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics.

Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of fentanyl transdermal system, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the fentanyl transdermal system dosage.

The dosing interval for fentanyl transdermal system is 72 hours. Do not increase the fentanyl transdermal system dose for the first time until at least 3 days after the initial application. Titrate the dose based on the daily dose of supplemental opioid analgesics required by the patient on the second or third day of the initial application.

It may take up to 6 days for fentanyl levels to reach equilibrium on a new dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, evaluate patients for further titration after no less than two 3‑day applications before any further increase in dosage is made.

Base dosage increments on the daily dosage of supplementary opioids, using the ratio of 45 mg/24 hours of oral morphine to a 12 mcg/hour increase in fentanyl transdermal system dose.

If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

A small proportion of adult patients may not achieve adequate analgesia using a 72-hour dosing interval and may require systems to be applied at 48 hours rather than at 72 hours, only if adequate pain control cannot be achieved using a 72-hour regimen. An increase in the fentanyl transdermal system dose should be evaluated before changing dosing intervals in order to maintain patients on a 72-hour regimen.

Dosing intervals less than every 72 hours were not studied in children and adolescents and are not recommended.

### Trends and rapidity of dose tapering among patients prescribed long-term opioid therapy, 2008–2017 [^111ftNi5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

A 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prescribing guideline cautioned against higher-dose long-term opioid therapy and recommended tapering daily opioid doses by approximately 10% per week if the risks outweigh the benefits. Warnings have since appeared regarding potential hazards of rapid opioid tapering.

Objectives

To characterize US trends in opioid dose tapering among patients prescribed long-term opioids from 2008 to 2017 and identify patient-level variables associated with tapering and a more rapid rate of tapering.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used deidentified medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment records for 100 031 commercial insurance and Medicare Advantage enrollees, representing a diverse mixture of ages, races/ethnicities, and geographical regions across the United States. Adults with stable, higher-dosage (mean, ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs]/d) opioid prescriptions for a 12-month baseline period and 2 or more months of follow-up from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017, were included in the study.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Tapering was defined as 15% or more relative reduction in mean daily MME during any of 6 overlapping 60-day windows within a 7-month follow-up period. The rate of tapering was computed as the maximum monthly percentage dose reduction.

Results

Among the 100 031 participants (53 452 [53.4%] women; mean [SD] age, 57.6 [11.8] years), from 2008 to 2015, the age- and sex-standardized percentage of patients tapering daily opioid doses increased from 10.5% to 13.7% (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] per year, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.05–1.06]) before increasing to 16.2% in 2016 and 22.4% in 2017 (aIRR in 2016–2017 vs 2008–2015, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.16–1.25]). Patient-level covariates associated with tapering included female sex (aIRR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.10–1.15]) and higher baseline dose (aIRR for ≥ 300 MMEs/d vs 50–89 MMEs/d, 2.57 [95% CI, 2.48–2.65]). Among patients tapering daily opioid doses, the mean (SD) maximum dose reduction was 27.6% (17.0%) per month, and 18.8% of patients had a maximum tapering rate exceeding 40% per month (ie, faster than 10% per week). More rapid dose reduction was associated with 2016–2017 vs 2008–2015 (adjusted difference, 1.4% [95% CI, 0.8%-2.1%]) and higher baseline dose (adjusted difference, 2.7% [95% CI, 2.2%-3.3%] for 90–149 vs 50–89 MMEs/d).

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients using long-term opioid therapy are increasingly undergoing dose tapering, particularly women and those prescribed higher doses; in addition, dose tapering has become more common since 2016. Many patients undergoing tapering reduce daily doses at a rapid maximum rate.

Definitions and Variables

Medication prescribing records contain EPIC-generated medication IDs in addition to text fields containing the medication name, generic name, form, and pharmaceutical class. We searched the generic name field for all opioid medications that can be ordered with a prescription in outpatient settings in the United States (eTable 2 in the Supplement). We included medications with a pharmaceutical class of analgesic and excluded those with class of expectorant, antitussive, antidiarrheal, and all that were not oral or transdermal in form. We excluded buprenorphine with the exception of 2 forms that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for pain (Butrans and Belbuca). Prescription order data included the ordering date, patient ID, prescriber ID, medicine name, strength (eg, 5 mg), number of units (eg, 30 tablets), and number of authorized refills. Refills were counted in the same year or quarter as the initiating prescription. We defined long-acting formulations as those that included the terms extended release or long acting in their generic name or form fields as well as methadone tablets and transdermal formulations. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) conversion reference table, we calculated the morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) for each prescription as the product of the medication strength, number of units, number of refills, and the relevant conversion factor.

Using the cohort year as the unit of analysis, we calculated several measures of opioid prescribing for each year of the study: (1) percentage of patients who received at least 1 prescription for an opioid by age and sex, (2) number of opioid prescriptions per 100 patients, (3) number of long-acting opioid prescriptions per 100 patients, (4) mean annual MME per patient, (5) mean MME per prescription, (6) number of chronic opioid users, and (7) number of high-dose opioid users. We defined chronic opioid users as patients who were prescribed within any calendar quarter 160 or more opioid pills (short acting or long acting), 90 or more long-acting pills, or any methadone pills or fentanyl patches. Prescription instructions were found to be unreliable in EHR data because many were composed of free text that could not be categorized, complicating the calculation of a daily dose. Therefore, we defined high-dose users as those individuals among chronic opioid users with a mean of more than 90 MMEs/d through any quarter of a calendar year.

Watanabe et al reviewed the charts of 22 patients with cancer-related pain who were switched from a variety of opioids to subcutaneous fentanyl by continuous infusion. In 13 patients who were switched from morphine or hydromorphone and reached dose stability (defined as no dose changes and no more than two rescue doses per day for 48 hours), the median relative potency Mpo:Fsc ratio (n = 4 patients who stabilized) was 85.4:1 (range 65:1–112.5:1). The authors noted a wide range of dose ratios and suggested that a more cautious morphine to fentanyl potency ratio of 100:1 may be advisable and acknowledged that the small size of the study was a major limitation.

In a prospective study of 23 hospice cancer patients (published in 1999), Hunt et al compared subcutaneous morphine to subcutaneous fentanyl in a trial designed to evaluate pain control and side effects. In this study, they used and then confirmed a conversion ratio of 10 mg Msc:150 μg Fsc. This equates to an Msc:Fsc conversion ratio of 66:1. Although this was a crossover double-blind trial, bidirectionality was not investigated. Furthermore, the crossover was performed early (on day 3), which complicated the interpretation of adverse events, and the small number of subjects in this report limits the conclusions that can be made.

Kawano et al examined dose conversion ratios in patients undergoing opioid rotation from morphine injection (continuous IV administration [Miv]) to transdermal fentanyl patches in a prospective observational study of 45 patients with chronic pain of cancer origin. The results supported the feasibility of rotation from continuous endovenous morphine to fentanyl patches, with a conversion ratio of 50:1, but also showed that fentanyl doses decreased with the equivalent target morphine dose, ratio ranging from 28:1 (lower dose Miv) to 48:1 (higher dose Miv). These results suggest that in opioid rotation from low dose, 50:1 is not enough for the fentanyl patch. Similarly, Matsumura et al reported retrospective data from 122 patients, suggesting that the typical conversion OXpo:Ftd ratio was 95:1 but was significantly reduced in patients taking a daily oral morphine equivalent dose of < 45 mg/d and in patients with poor pain control to 52:1 and 64:1, respectively (study using MEDD for conversion, not selected in our analysis).

### Benefit-risk analysis of buprenorphine for pain management [^115uSFbG]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Benefit-Risk Assessment of Buprenorphine vs Conventional Opioids

Efficacy

Buprenorphine has a long-standing history of efficacy in postsurgical acute pain (IV formulation) and chronic pain (SL and transdermal formulations), and its clinical efficacy has been shown to be greater than that of morphine in some studies. Buprenorphine has been suggested to be 25 to 115 times more potent as an analgesic than morphine (depending on the study), with no ceiling effect on analgesia. Buprenorphine products no longer have an MME factor in the Centers for Disease Control opioid conversion guide, as they are not expected to be associated with overdose risk in the same dose-dependent manner as full µ-opioid receptor agonists. In addition to morphine, the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine has also been demonstrated to be equal to or greater than oxycodone (MME factor [mg]: 1.5) or fentanyl (MME factor for patch [µg]: 7.2) in chronic pain studies. When compared across clinical studies, the efficacy of buprenorphine buccal film was similar to that of the conventional ER opioids hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and oxymorphone. In a meta-analysis examining the effects of buprenorphine (SL, transdermal, and buccal) on chronic pain outcomes in patients with or without opioid use disorder (OUD), the authors found that efficacy was more pronounced in patients without OUD, and high doses may be needed for patients with OUD. Overall, the data from these studies suggest that buprenorphine has equivalent or greater clinical analgesic efficacy than conventional opioids.

### Fentanyl transdermal system [^113CK8JD]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated for management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that:

requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and
cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.

Fentanyl transdermal system should ONLY be used in patients who are already receiving opioid therapy, who have demonstrated opioid tolerance, and who require a total daily dose at least equivalent to fentanyl transdermal system 25 mcg/hr (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients who are considered opioid-tolerant are those who have been taking, for a week or longer, at least 60 mg of morphine daily, or at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, or at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

Because serious or life-threatening hypoventilation could result, fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use on an as needed basis (i.e., prn), for the management of post-operative or acute pain, or in patients who are not opioid-tolerant or who require opioid analgesia for a short period of time (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS).

An evaluation of the appropriateness and adequacy of treating with immediate-release opioids is advisable prior to initiating therapy with any modified-release opioid. Prescribers should individualize treatment in every case, initiating therapy at the appropriate point along a progression from non-opioid analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen, to opioids, in a plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Health Research and Quality, the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Policy, or the American Pain Society.

Patients should be assessed for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Patients receiving opioids should be routinely monitored for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction.

VA/DoD guideline — buprenorphine transdermal delivery system (BTDS) conversion: For patients taking ≤ 80 mg MEDD, consider converting to BTDS. When switching patients from oral MEDDs of 30 to 80 mg to BTDS, a patch strength of 10 mcg/h is recommended as a conservative initial conversion dose. The highest available BTDS strength of 20 mcg/h may be equianalgesic to an oral MEDD of 36 to 55 mg, whereas the product information states that the 20 mcg/h patch may not provide adequate analgesia for patients requiring greater than an oral MEDD of 80 mg.

### Prediction of infection risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with biologics: are we any closer to risk stratification? [^111m1mYm]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Opioids

Opioids are frequently administered in musculoskeletal conditions with 40% of RA patients using prescription opioids daily in a US study. One emerging concern with opioids is the risk of infection. Certain opioids affect lymphocyte and phagocyte proliferation, reduce innate immune cell activity and inhibit cytokine expression and antibody production in animal studies. A previous epidemiological study concluded an increased risk of serious infection in RA patients on opioids, using a self-controlled case series design to allow within-person comparisons when the patient was either on or off drug. Risk of serious infection was higher with use of long-acting opioids, immunosuppressive opioids (codeine, morphine, transdermal fentanyl) and those with a daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dose of at least 60 mg. Most recently, opioids were found to be an independent risk factor of invasive pneumococcal disease, which include serious infection such as bacteraemia, meningitis and invasive pneumonia. In that study, as well as the above risk factors, the risk of infection was increased with higher daily dosages [50–90 MME/day: OR, 1.71 (CI 1.22, 2.39]; ≥ 90 MME/day: OR, 1.75 (CI, 1.33,2.29)]. Whether this risk increases further when combined with biologic therapies remains unknown. Therefore, although large biologic cohorts remain one of the best study designs to investigate risk of infection, one limitation among many is the lack of accurate exposure information on time-varying steroid and opioid use/dose that are likely to be co-prescribed in a large proportion of patients.

3.3. Effect of daily opioid dose on mortality

Compared with patients on low-dose opioids (MME/day of < 50MME/day), a statistically significant higher risk of death was observed in patients on MME/day of 50 or above across both the UK and US cohorts. In the UK cohort, specifically, this effect was observed across all 3 pain subgroups (Table 5). Across all patients in the UK cohort, a higher risk of death was conferred on a daily MME/day of 50 and above (HR, 5.33 [95% CI, 5.05–5.63]), with similar HRs across the 120 to 200 MME/day and ≥ 200 MME/day groups (Table 5). In the US cohort, an incremental increase in risk of death was observed with higher MME/day: 50 to 120 MME/day: (HR, 1.86, [95% CI, 1.15–3.01]), 120 to 200 MME/day: (HR, 6.46, [95% CI, 2.95–14.13]); ≥ 200 MME/day: (HR, 11.52 [95% CI, 4.94–26.86]). In the Canadian cohort, a statistically significant higher risk of death was observed in patients on ≥ 200 MME/day (Table 5).

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^116F7SK7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency department discharge prescribing — consumption, early long‑term risk, and exposure sources show that the median amount of opioid actually consumed after an opioid prescription is less than 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME), and that there is increased risk for opioid‑naive patients to develop long‑term use beginning with the third day of therapy. Among ED patients with current opioid dependence, greater than one third reported first exposure via legitimate prescriptions for acute painful conditions, and in 11% the index prescription came from an ED visit. The policy scope focuses on prescribing at discharge rather than administration during the visit, and the document notes there is not an accurate method of predicting which patients will develop opioid use disorder (OUD) or experience adverse effects versus benefit at discharge.

### Fentanyl transdermal [^115FreTm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate fentanyl transdermal system to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.21)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics.

Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of fentanyl transdermal system, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the fentanyl transdermal system dosage.

The dosing interval for fentanyl transdermal system is 72 hours. Do not increase the fentanyl transdermal system dose for the first time until at least 3 days after the initial application. Titrate the dose based on the daily dose of supplemental opioid analgesics required by the patient on the second or third day of the initial application.

It may take up to 6 days for fentanyl levels to reach equilibrium on a new dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, evaluate patients for further titration after no less than two 3-day applications before any further increase in dosage is made.

Base dosage increments on the daily dosage of supplementary opioids, using the ratio of 45 mg/24 hours of oral morphine to a 12 mcg/hour increase in fentanyl transdermal system dose.

If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

A small proportion of adult patients may not achieve adequate analgesia using a 72-hour dosing interval and may require systems to be applied at 48 hours rather than at 72 hours, only if adequate pain control cannot be achieved using a 72-hour regimen. An increase in the fentanyl transdermal system dose should be evaluated before changing dosing intervals in order to maintain patients on a 72-hour regimen.

Dosing intervals less than every 72 hours were not studied in children and adolescents and are not recommended.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^1124AF8M]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

The rationale in choosing the doses to be administered was based on a previous experience with IV-MO in doses of 4 mg in patients receiving an equivalent dose of oral morphine of 60 mg, and on the suggestion from previous studies of OTFC that 200 μ g OTFC should be administered in patients receiving at least 60 mg day⁻¹ of oral morphine or 25 μg h⁻¹ (0.6 mg day⁻¹) of transdermal fentanyl. This does not mean that the dose of the two drugs is equianalgesic, despite some information drawn from previous local experience and studies performed in other settings.

The IV-MO dose was administered for about 5 min at 1/5 of the oral daily dose, converted using an equianalgesic ratio of 1/3 (IV/oral). For example, a daily morphine oral dose of 60 mg corresponds to an intravenous dose of 20 mg (1/3 ratio), and then is converted to 4 mg (20%), to be used as the dose for episodic pain. Written orders were given and IV-MO was administered by nurses, already trained in using such an approach, as a standard practice of the unit. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate was administered, after a previous explanation of the use, by patients themselves, also assisted by nurse, in doses proportional to the basal daily opioid dose, as described for IV-MO. Doses were rounded off to the closest value for patients receiving intermediate dosages. Only one stick of OTFC was used. Thus, patients receiving oral morphine equivalents in the dose range of 270–330 mg were excluded, owing to unavailability of the calculated dose of OTFC (1000 μ g).

### Hydrocodone bitartrate (zohydro) [^113Lxdck]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Example conversion from a single opioid to ZOHYDRO ER

Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid (in this case, extended-release oxymorphone); 15 mg oxymorphone twice daily = 30 mg total daily dose of oxymorphone.

Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydrocodone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1; 30 mg total daily dose of oxymorphone x 2 = 60 mg of oral hydrocodone daily. The daily dose should then be divided in half for administration every 12 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose which is 30 mg ZOHYDRO ER every 12 hours. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate ZOHYDRO ER capsule strengths available. Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal or for signs of over-sedation/toxicity after converting patients to ZOHYDRO ER.

The dose of ZOHYDRO ER can be gradually adjusted preferably at increments of 10 mg every 12 hours every 3 to 7 days, until adequate pain relief and acceptable adverse reactions have been achieved.

Conversion from Methadone to ZOHYDRO ER Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and tends to accumulate in the plasma.

Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to ZOHYDRO ER ZOHYDRO ER treatment can be initiated 18 hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative hydrocodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of ZOHYDRO ER, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to ZOHYDRO ER, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion.

### Predicting long-term response to strong opioids in patients with low back pain: findings from a randomized, controlled trial of transdermal fentanyl and morphine [^114VE54S]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Effects of age

Older patients (defined as those at least 75 years old, n = 51) tended to use lower opioid doses than younger patients (< 75 years, n = 621). The median daily doses at study endpoint were 58 mg for SRM and 43 μg/h (102 mg) for TDF for older patients compared with 116 mg SRM and 54 μg/h (130 mg) TDF for younger patients. The average morphine dose in older patients remained stable throughout the study; the mean morphine dose was 57 mg at baseline and 59 mg at endpoint, however the mean dose in patients who completed the study was 66 mg at month 13. The average fentanyl dose was 25 μg/h at baseline, 44 μg/h at endpoint (for all patients, whenever they left the study), and 50 μg/h at month 13 (i.e. for patients who completed the study).

The proportion of responders tended to be higher in the younger than the older age groups (56% vs 45%, respectively, for 30% response and 40% vs 31%, respectively, for 50% response). However, no statistical significance could be detected, probably due to the small sample size. The proportion of patients who withdrew because of adverse events was higher in the elderly sub-group than in the younger patients: rates of withdrawal were 56% (n = 15) for SRM and 42% (n = 10) for TDF in the older group compared with 29% (n = 89) and 37% (n = 115), respectively in the younger patients.

### Oxycodone (Xtampza) [^114nm12t]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1	Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

XTAMPZA ER should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
XTAMPZA ER single doses greater than 36 mg (equivalent to 40 mg oxycodone hydrochloride [HCl]) or a total daily dose greater than 72 mg (equivalent to 80 mg oxycodone HCl) are to be administered only to patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients who are opioid-tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone HCl per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of XTAMPZA ER for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with XTAMPZA ER. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
XTAMPZA ER is administered, twice daily, every 12 hours, and must be taken with food. Instruct patients to take XTAMPZA ER capsules with approximately the same amount of food for every dose in order to ensure consistent plasma levels are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Patients who are unable to swallow XTAMPZA ER should be instructed to sprinkle the capsule contents on soft foods or into a cup and then administer directly into the mouth and immediately swallow. XTAMPZA ER may also be administered through a gastrostomy or nasogastric feeding tube [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].
The maximum daily dose of XTAMPZA ER is 288 mg per day (eight 36 mg capsules, equivalent to 320 mg oxycodone HCl per day) as the safety of the excipients in XTAMPZA ER for doses over 288 mg/day has not been established.
XTAMPZA ER is formulated with oxycodone base. The following table describes the equivalent amount of oxycodone HCl present in other oxycodone products.

### Predictors of postoperative morphine milligram equivalents in cardiac surgery [^114HJYd6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Given both the short- and long-term deleterious effects of opioids, there has been an increased focused on reducing the use of postoperative opioid analgesia. As patients undergoing cardiac surgery often require high levels opioids postoperatively, understanding risk factors for increased postoperative opioid use may be helpful for the development of patient-specific opioid-sparing pain regimens for this patient population.

Design

A retrospective analysis of data from our electronic medical records and the Society of Thoracic Surgeon's database.

Setting

A single-institution study at an academic medical center.

Participants

All patients undergoing open adult cardiac surgery were included. Exclusion criteria were patients with continuous intravenous narcotic drips and operative mortality.

Interventions

As this was a retrospective study, no interventions were conducted on the participants.

Measurements and Main Results

Data for patient postoperative opioid requirements were extracted from the electronic medical record. Total opioid use on postoperative days 0 to 3 was converted to morphine milligram equivalent (MME) via standard conversion factors. The study cohort comprised 1604 patients, including 456 females and 1066 coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) recipients. MME was 31.0% greater in patients undergoing CABG (p < 0.001), 76.3% greater in patients with liver disease (p = 0.005), and 48.8% greater in patients with patient-controlled analgesia (p < 0.001) during postoperative days 0 to 3. Younger age (p < 0.001) and higher body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001) also were associated with increased MME prescription.

Conclusions

CABG, liver disease, patient-controlled analgesia, younger age, and higher BMI are associated with increased narcotic use after cardiac surgery. Implementation of more aggressive perioperative multimodal opioid-sparing regimens should be considered for these patient groups.

### Association of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program with transmucosal fentanyl prescribing [^111TBzhg]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

To calculate the percentage of TIRF prescriptions for patients without known opioid tolerance, we first needed to define opioid tolerance. To do this, we used the definition of opioid tolerance in the approved TIRF-REMS education program, which defines it as those patients receiving opioids averaging 60 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day for at least 7 days, or who have been receiving 30 mg of oxycodone or 8 mg of hydromorphone daily for at least 7 days. We calculated the total MME for each prescription using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published conversion factors (eTable 3 in the Supplement). We then calculated the average daily prescribed MME for each patient using all opioid prescriptions filled in the 7-, 14-, 30-, 60-, and 90-day periods prior to the patient's initial TIRF prescription, including prescriptions for Abstral, Lazanda, and Onsolis. Patients whose daily prescribed average was less than 60 MME in all of the lookback periods and whose average daily dose of oxycodone or hydromorphone was less than 30 mg and 8 mg, respectively, were considered patients without known opioid tolerance. We then calculated the monthly percentage of initial TIRF prescriptions to patients without known opioid tolerance, overall and by brand. Of note, for these analyses, the only brand for which there were prescriptions during each month of the study period to allow for brand-level analysis was Fentora.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^112M9ziQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — breakthrough cancer pain (Recommendation 6.2) states that evidence remains insufficient to recommend a specific, short-acting opioid for breakthrough pain. A 2015 systematic review of oral or nasal fentanyl included 11 RCTs with a total of 1,121 patients and found fentanyl effective compared with placebo but with limited evidence relative to other opioids; subsequent trials found fentanyl noninferior to morphine at 30 minutes in 114 patients and favored fentanyl for pain reduction at 30 minutes in 68 patients. For many patients, clinical interpretation advises regular immediate- or extended-release opioid plus an immediate-release opioid for breakthrough episodes at approximately 10% (ranging from 5% to 20%) of the daily MME dose.

### Implementation interventions to promote healthcare professional uptake of evidence-based opioid prescribing for adults with acute non-cancer pain [^113bfM4A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Where trials use different measures for the same outcome or concept for our continuous outcomes, we will use the reported outcome measure that was the highest in our hierarchy as an index measure. We will transform means and standard deviations (SDs) of other outcome measures to the scale of the index instrument and pool the data using MD as the summary estimate. For MME dose, we will assume mg/day as the index instrument. The daily MME will be determined by first calculating the total daily dose (single‐dose studies will use the stated dose; multiple‐dose studies will multiply the stated dose by the number of doses per day) and then multiplying the daily total by the MME multiplier according to the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) opioid dose equivalence calculation table. For studies describing dosing per body weight, the daily dose will be based on the mean or median body weight reported in the trial, or if not reported, the average body weight from a similar trial or 70 kg for an average adult. For interventions that used dosing ranges (e.g. one to two tablets every four to six hours) without an average number of daily tablets reported, the dose will be calculated as the maximum allowable daily MME. For pain, we will assume the 0 to 10 scale (0 represents no pain) as the index instrument. For function, we will assume the 0 to 100 scale (100 represents best function) as the index instrument. If different scales are used to measure quality of life, we will not nominate an index measure, but we will calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs. The SMD will be re‐expressed as a mean difference on a typical scale by multiplying by a typical among‐person standard deviation (e.g. the standard deviation of the control group at baseline from the most representative trial).

Minimally important differences

When considering continuous outcomes for this review, there are no well‐defined minimal important differences (MIDs) for healthcare prescriber behaviour related to MME dose reduction. As MIDs are not well‐defined for this outcome, we will use 10% MID as the default. For patient‐reported outcome measures, we will assume a MID of 1.5 points for pain measured on a 10‐point scale, and 10 points for function and HRQoL measured on a 100‐point scale. For all other continuous outcomes where there is no published MID, we will use 10% MID as the default.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^1179oybF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Opioid dosing and titration for adults with cancer pain — initial dosing, formulation choice, and adjustments are specified as follows: The initial opioid dose is "a dose of approximately 30 mg of morphine equivalent (MME) per day", and opioids are "usually initiated during a short course of an immediate-release formulation as needed". In stable pain, "the effective dose can often be determined within a few days", and "The US Food and Drug Administration also recommends this practice of as-needed immediate-release opioids before starting regularly scheduled opioids". After the effective dose is determined, extended-release opioids "can be administered by mouth every 12 or 24 hours, or transdermal every 72 hours (fentanyl) or every 7 days (buprenorphine)", whereas immediate-release opioids "need to be administered every 4 hours". For adjustments, "Dose titration can be done a few days after each dose increase or reduction", with changes "calculated as a percentage of the total daily dose (usually approximately 25%-50%)". A practical method is to "add the total daily dose of the regular plus breakthrough opioids and increase this number by 20%-30%", and "keep each dose [of breakthrough opioid] at about 10% (5%-20%) of the regular daily opioid dose".

Objective

Equianalgesic conversion methods are commonly used to switch patients from one opioid to another due to suboptimal pain relief or adverse events. There is no universally accepted opioid conversion method, however, and there is often significant variability between conversion resources. As a result, patients are at risk for undertreated pain and serious adverse events. The purpose of this survey was to compare the equianalgesic conversion estimates between nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and physicians for commonly prescribed opioids.

Methods

A survey form was developed using Survey Monkey. Participation was solicited by providing a link to the survey via social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) and emailing professional organizations for sharing with their members and followers. Data collected included demographics and estimated morphine equivalents (MEQs) of hydrocodone 80 mg, fentanyl transdermal patches 1,800 mcg (as 75 mcg/hour), methadone 40 mg, oxycodone 120 mg, and hydromorphone 48 mg. Participants were also asked to provide their choice of reference utilized to complete the conversions, including personal knowledge. Descriptive analyses were performed using measures of central tendency. Hypothesis testing was performed using Pearson's chi-squared and Fisher's Exact Test for categorical data and the Kruskal-Wallis equality of populations rank test for continuous data to assess differences between median opioid doses by professional groups.

Results

The total number of respondents included in the analysis was 319. Physicians, pharmacists, and nurse practitioners/physician assistants comprised 25.4%, 56.7%, and 16.3%, respectively, of respondents. The overall mean (± standard deviation) MEQ doses for fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, and oxycodone were: 176 (± 117) mg, 88 (± 42) mg, 192 (± 55) mg, 193 (± 201) mg, and 173 (± 39) mg, respectively. For fentanyl, the mean (± standard deviation) MEQ doses were 180 (± 122) mg, 178 (± 128) mg, and 157 (± 68) mg, for physicians, pharmacists, and nurse practitioners/physician assistants, respectively. For all three groups of clinicians, the median MEQ dose for fentanyl was 150 mg. The mean (± standard deviation) MEQ doses of methadone for physicians, pharmacists, and nurse practitioners/physician assistants were: 214 (± 142) mg, 171 (± 107) mg, and 185 (± 129) mg, respectively. The median MEQ dose for methadone was 160 mg for each of the clinician groups.

Conclusions

As evidenced by large standard deviations, there was significant variation in mean opioid conversions to MEQ doses within each profession type, particularly for fentanyl and methadone. The median MEQ doses provided for opioid conversions were the same among each profession. No universal method exists that allows each of the five studied opioids to be accurately and consistently converted to another opioid (i.e., morphine).

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
