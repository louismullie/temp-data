## Question

A 38-year-old woman with a history of recurrent miscarriages presents to the emergency department with sudden onset right-sided weakness and aphasia. Brain MRI confirms an acute left middle cerebral artery infarct. Laboratory testing reveals positive lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibodies on two occasions, 12 weeks apart. She is diagnosed with definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and this is her first arterial thrombotic event. The neurology team asks for your recommendation regarding long-term antithrombotic therapy.

Based on current EULAR guidelines, what is the most appropriate long-term antithrombotic management for this patient, and which therapies should be avoided?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate long-term antithrombotic management for a 38-year-old woman with definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and a first arterial thrombotic event (ischemic stroke), and which therapies should be avoided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the guideline-backed first-line therapy for arterial thrombosis in APS. Next, I will examine the target INR intensity and whether to add low-dose aspirin. After that, I need to check which therapies to avoid, especially DOACs. Finally, I will consider duration of therapy, special situations like recurrent events, and practical implementation details, and I will double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and risk profile. Definite APS requires at least one clinical criterion (here, arterial thrombosis) and persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions 12 weeks apart; she has triple positivity (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I), which places her in a high-risk category for recurrence despite anticoagulation, so I need to ensure we do not under-treat her [^860068fb] [^04a8ba25].

> Next, I should review the first-line therapy for arterial thrombosis in APS. EULAR 2019 explicitly recommends initiating a vitamin K antagonist (VKA, i.e., warfarin) rather than low-dose aspirin alone for a first arterial thrombotic event in definite APS, and this is echoed by contemporary reviews and stroke guidelines that favor VKA over antiplatelet therapy in APS-associated arterial thrombosis, so warfarin is the cornerstone here [^2aa9b6ae] [^6705837a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intensity. I initially thought a higher INR target (3.0–4.0) might be better given the high-risk profile, but wait, let me verify the evidence. High-intensity VKA has not shown superiority and may increase bleeding; EULAR supports a moderate-intensity INR target of 2.0–3.0 for most patients, with consideration of 3.0–4.0 only selectively in recurrent thrombosis despite adequate therapy, so I should correct that impulse and stick to INR 2.0–3.0 for this first event [^860068fb] [^bfa1cfd0] [^c8b84f89].

> I should confirm whether to add low-dose aspirin. EULAR suggests considering VKA plus low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) in patients with definite APS and a first arterial thrombosis, particularly in high-risk profiles; given her triple positivity, adding aspirin is reasonable, but I need to balance bleeding risk and monitor closely, especially if there is thrombocytopenia or other bleeding risks [^860068fb] [^46f478d2].

> Now, I need to ensure we avoid therapies that increase harm in this setting. DOACs are not recommended in APS with arterial thrombosis due to higher recurrence rates, particularly stroke, in randomized and observational data; EULAR advises avoiding DOACs in definite APS with arterial events, and stroke guidelines similarly discourage DOACs in APS, so rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided here [^2b4f0fc1] [^64b02c65] [^06dc6569].

> Let me consider duration and special scenarios. For a first arterial thrombosis in definite APS, lifelong anticoagulation is generally indicated given the high recurrence risk; if she recurs despite therapeutic INR 2.0–3.0, options include intensifying to INR 3.0–4.0, switching to LMWH, or adding low-dose aspirin, but I should confirm that these escalation strategies are reserved for refractory cases after excluding nonadherence and lab variability [^860068fb] [^5fffe297].

> I should double-check practical implementation. Warfarin initiation should follow acute-phase management with LMWH until therapeutic INR is achieved; INR monitoring can be challenging in APS due to lupus anticoagulant effects, so I need to use reliable thromboplastins and consider local lab expertise, and I should reinforce bleeding precautions and drug–drug interactions given the long-term nature of therapy [^860068fb] [^a475f8ee].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is to initiate long-term warfarin with a target INR of 2.0–3.0 and consider adding low-dose aspirin 75–100 mg daily given her triple-positive, high-risk profile, while strictly avoiding DOACs; I will reassess bleeding risk, adherence, and lab monitoring regularly, and escalate intensity or switch strategy only if there is recurrent thrombosis despite adequate VKA therapy [^860068fb] [^2aa9b6ae] [^2b4f0fc1].

For a 38-year-old woman with definite APS and a first arterial thrombotic event (ischemic stroke), **EULAR recommends lifelong VKA therapy with a target INR of 2.0–3.0** [^860068fb] [^2aa9b6ae] as the standard of care [^notfound]. DOACs are **not recommended** [^2b4f0fc1] due to increased risk of recurrent arterial thrombosis, especially in triple-positive patients [^06dc6569] [^ab6e85cf]. Low-dose aspirin may be added for high-risk profiles, but monotherapy is insufficient for arterial events [^860068fb] [^2aa9b6ae]. If recurrent thrombosis occurs despite therapeutic INR, consider intensifying VKA to INR 3.0–4.0, switching to LMWH, or adding low-dose aspirin [^5fffe297].

---

## Recommended long-term antithrombotic therapy

### Vitamin K antagonists (VKA)

- **First-line therapy**: VKAs (e.g. warfarin) are the cornerstone for secondary prevention in APS with arterial thrombosis [^860068fb] [^2aa9b6ae].

- **Target INR**: Moderate-intensity anticoagulation (INR 2.0–3.0) is recommended [^860068fb] [^bfa1cfd0]; high-intensity (INR 3.0–4.0) is not superior and increases bleeding risk [^c8b84f89] [^49aa1f1b].

- **Duration**: Lifelong anticoagulation is advised given the high recurrence risk in APS [^860068fb] [^8161698b].

---

### Addition of low-dose aspirin

In high-risk profiles (e.g. triple positivity), **adding low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) to VKA** may be considered, but evidence is limited and bleeding risk must be weighed [^860068fb] [^49aa1f1b].

---

## Therapies to avoid

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

- **Not recommended**: DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) are not recommended for APS with arterial thrombosis due to increased recurrence risk, especially in triple-positive patients [^2b4f0fc1] [^06dc6569].

- **Evidence**: The TRAPS trial showed higher thrombotic events with rivaroxaban vs warfarin in triple-positive APS; meta-analyses confirm increased arterial events with DOACs [^ab6e85cf] [^06dc6569].

- **Guidelines**: EULAR and ISTH advise against DOACs in APS with arterial events or high-risk profiles [^2b4f0fc1] [^83f02243].

---

### High-intensity VKA (INR 3.0–4.0)

High-intensity VKA is **not recommended** because it does not reduce recurrences versus INR 2.0–3.0 and increases bleeding [^c8b84f89] [^49aa1f1b].

---

## Management of recurrent thrombosis despite therapeutic INR

If recurrence occurs despite INR 2.0–3.0, **EULAR suggests**:

- **Intensify VKA**: Target INR 3.0–4.0 (balance bleeding risk) [^5fffe297].

- **Switch to LMWH**: Consider LMWH for refractory cases [^5fffe297].

- **Add low-dose aspirin**: Combine with VKA in high-risk profiles [^5fffe297].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Therapy** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| VKA (INR 2.0–3.0) | First-line, lifelong | Standard of care; effective secondary prevention [^860068fb] [^2aa9b6ae] |
| Low-dose aspirin + VKA | Consider in high-risk profiles | May reduce recurrence; limited evidence [^860068fb] [^49aa1f1b] |
| DOACs | Avoid | Increased arterial recurrence; especially in triple-positive APS [^2b4f0fc1] [^06dc6569] |
| High-intensity VKA (INR 3.0–4.0) | Avoid | No added benefit; more bleeding [^c8b84f89] [^49aa1f1b] |

---

The most appropriate long-term antithrombotic therapy is **lifelong VKA with INR 2.0–3.0**; DOACs should be avoided, and low-dose aspirin may be added in high-risk patients. If thrombosis recurs despite therapeutic INR, intensify VKA, switch to LMWH, or add low-dose aspirin.

A 24-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset slurred speech and right-side weakness. Ten months previously, she had had an episode of transient consciousness loss. The patient denied smoking, had no history of miscarriage, was not taking oral contraceptives, and had a body mass index of 21.
2. She denied any family history of stroke. On admission, her blood pressure was 103/65 mm Hg in the right arm and 76/40 mm Hg in the left arm. Her body temperature, heartbeat, and respiration rate were within normal limits. Simultaneous palpation of pulses in the 2 arms revealed that the left radial pulse was weak. A neurological examination revealed clinically significant right-side hemiparesis and dysarthria. Other findings of general physical and neurological examinations were normal. The patient’s blood work results were unremarkable, aside from an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Hypercoagulable laboratory studies, chest radiography, transthoracic echocardiography, electrocardiography, and 24-hour Holter monitoring yielded normal findings. Head computed tomography images showed an acute infarct in the left basal ganglia. Head-and-neck CT angiography with digital subtraction angiography revealed left carotid artery occlusion and subclavian artery stenosis. These findings were believed to be consistent with Takayasu arteritis. The patient was given prednisolone. Regular clinical follow-up, including physical examinations, radiographic evaluations, and other medical tests, was performed every 6 to 12 months. Chen L, Cao H, Zhou M.

### What is the appropriate anticoagulation strategy for thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome? [^04a8ba25]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune prothrombotic disorder mediated by a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies collectively known as antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). They include lupus anticoagulant (LA), IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-β2-glycoprotein I (anti-β2GPI) antibodies. It has been shown that those patients with all three aPL (triple positive) are at highest risk of both a first thrombotic event and of a recurrence, despite anticoagulation. In response to publication of a meta-analysis and a randomised controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in triple-positive APS with venous and/or arterial thrombosis, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued recommendations that direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOACs) should not be used for secondary prevention of thrombosis in all APS patients (although they did draw specific attention to the high risk of triple-positive patients). As there is less evidence for patients with single- or dual-positive patients with APS, this may be an over-interpretation of the data. In this review, we explore the available evidence on safety and efficacy of DOACs in thrombotic APS, the problem of detecting LA while on DOAC, and provide some practical guidance for managing this problem.

### Thrombosis and the antiphospholipid syndrome [^1743f8a4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome is an antibody-mediated hypercoagulable state characterized by recurrent venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Several studies have determined that the frequency of antiphospholipid syndrome in patients presenting with a venous thromboembolic event is between 4% and 14%. Because of the high risk for recurrent thromboembolism in these patients, current recommendations suggest a longer, potentially lifelong, course of antithrombotic therapy following an initial event. Although most authorities agree on an extended course of therapy, considerable controversy surrounds the optimal target therapeutic INR for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. For an initial venous thromboembolic event, a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 is supported by two prospective, randomized clinical trials. In contrast, relatively limited data exist for an initial arterial thromboembolic event in patients who have the antiphospholipid syndrome, and therapeutic recommendations range from aspirin to warfarin with a high target INR. Recurrent thromboembolic events can be extremely difficult to treat, and some patients may benefit from the addition of immunosuppressive therapies. Importantly, as many as 50% of the initial thromboembolic events sustained by patients with antiphospholipid antibodies occur in the setting of additional, coincident prothrombotic risk factors, indicating the importance of addressing any additional risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, in these patients. Prospective studies are needed to address the role of thromboprophylactic strategies in asymptomatic individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies in the absence of additional risk factors.

Duration of anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked venous thrombosis

Use of long-term anticoagulation in patients with APS was supported by two small studies (one RCT, one retrospective cohort study)that showed a lower risk of recurrent events among patients on long-term anticoagulation compared with patients treated with VKA for 3–6 months (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.81) (online supplementary table 4). In the RCT, recurrent venous thromboembolism was reported in three patients (20%) who discontinued VKA at 6 months compared with one (5.3%) on long-term oral anticoagulation over 48 months. The risk of bias was high due to the unblinded design. The report did not comment on bleeding complications.

Three additional indirect studies,each of which reported fewer recurrences in the group that received prolonged anticoagulation, included many patients with arterial events and therefore are not directly applicable to patients with first venous thromboembolism (online supplementary table 4). Studies were not restricted to provoked or unprovoked venous thrombosis. A single treatment arm study reported outcomes of 44 patients with APS who discontinued oral anticoagulation for various reasons. Among 25 patients with solely venous events, recurrent thrombosis occurred in 6 (24%) after discontinuation of oral anticoagulation.

Recurrent venous thrombosis despite oral anticoagulation with target INR 2–3

Treatment options for these patients include intensification of anticoagulation with VKA, switch to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or addition of LDA. No studies directly addressed the effectiveness and risks associated with an increase of INR target to 3–4 for patients with recurrent venous thrombosis while anticoagulated to INR 2–3. In one retrospective study, warfarin failure was the reason for switching to LMWH in 9 of 23 patients, but data on patients with venous events specifically were not reported.No patient had recurrent thrombosis on LMWH over a mean follow-up of 36 months, and none had major bleeding. Data from case series indicated no appreciable difference in risk of recurrences between the addition of LDA to VKA versus treatment with VKA alone.However, the timing of addition of LDA was not clearly specified and confounding by indication may have been present.

Thrombosis treatment

The mainstay of treatment of thrombotic APS remains vitamin K antagonists, although with recognised limitations especially in the long-term follow-up,failing to prevent recurrent events. Recommendations on treatment of a first thrombotic event, or a second event while on anticoagulation, both for venous and arterial thrombosis, have been published.However, these recommendations are largely based on expert opinion and randomised controlled clinical trials are mostly lacking. Although several reports suggest that additional drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, rituximab, intravenous Ig and eculizumab, may have a place in the treatment of thrombotic APS, their position in clinical practice is not well defined.Direct acting oral anticoagulants for treatment of APS were investigated with special interest (mainly because of their administration that does not need international normalised ratio (INR) monitoring); these relatively new drugs are considered first-line therapy for atrial fibrillation and deep venous thrombosis in many countries. Unfortunately, at least for rivaroxaban, the efficacy and safety in patients with APS has not been demonstrated.

In patients with APS, long-term anticoagulant treatment is indicated. Treatment withdrawal has been suggested for patients who became antibody negative.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome and recurrent thrombosis – limitations of current treatment strategies [^4b97d011]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder that is characterised by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and a common cause of vascular thromboembolic phenomena. The management of patients with APS is currently directed to antithrombotic medications. The international therapeutic guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation with warfarin indefinitely after the first thrombotic episode. However, therapeutic guidelines lack for a minority group of patients - the patients appropriately anticoagulated with recurrent thromboembolic phenomena. The authors present a clinical report that reveals the therapeutic and diagnostic complexity of this specific group of patients. Regarding recent studies, APS has been revealed as a complex syndrome with multiple pathophysiological mechanisms previously unknown. In this context, new therapeutic approaches have been defended and empirically experienced, with potentially promising results.

### Thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome: a practical guide to diagnosis and management [^37dfd294]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterised by venous, arterial and/or small vessel thrombosis in the context of persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). The diagnosis and management of thrombotic APS continues to prove challenging for clinicians. We provide a practical guide to the diagnosis of APS including who to test for aPL and which tests to do. We also consider clinical practice points on the management of venous, arterial and small vessel thrombosis, in the context of first and recurrent thrombotic events. Non-criteria manifestations of APS are reviewed. An approach to recurrent thrombosis and anticoagulant-refractory APS is discussed, with options including increasing the anticoagulation intensity of vitamin K antagonists, switching to low-molecular-weight-heparin, the use of fondaparinux and/or the addition of antiplatelet treatment. Adjunctive options such as vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine and statins are also addressed.

### New treatments for antiphospholipid syndrome [^1696da92]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Challenges in new drug development for APS include the controversy about the strength of association between aPL and thrombotic events, and unknown mechanism of aPL-induced thrombosis. In the long-term management of patients who have APS, controlled studies with warfarin alternatives (such as antiplatelet agents), the new anticoagulant agents (such as direct and indirect thrombin inhibitors), and newer therapeutic agents are vital. It is highly possible that the current "antithrombotic" approach to patients who are aPL-positive will be replaced by a "more specifically targeted, anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory" approach in the future.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with prior arterial or venous thromboembolism—vitamin K antagonist (VKA) intensity is guided as follows: For patients with antiphospholipid syndrome with previous arterial or venous thromboembolism, we suggest VKA therapy titrated to a moderate-intensity international normalized ratio (INR) range (INR 2.0-3.0) rather than higher intensity (INR 3.0-4.5) (Grade 2B). Supporting comparative data for high- vs moderate-intensity VKA include 220 participants (2 studies) with 3 y follow-up reporting thromboembolism OR 2.33 (0.82-6.66), major bleeding OR 0.70 (0.23-2.16), and mortality OR 1.51 (0.3-7.72).

### Prevention of thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome [^96505e28]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired autoimmune condition characterized by thrombotic events, pregnancy morbidity, and laboratory evidence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Management of these patients includes the prevention of a first thrombotic episode in at-risk patients (primary prevention) and preventing recurrent thrombotic complications in patients with a history of thrombosis (secondary prevention). Assessment of thrombotic risk in these patients, balanced against estimated bleeding risks associated with antithrombotic therapy could assist clinicians in determining whether antithrombotic therapy is warranted. Thrombotic risk can be assessed by evaluating a patient's aPL profile and additional thrombotic risk factors. Although antithrombotic options for secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been evaluated in clinical trials, studies in primary prevention of asymptomatic aPL-positive patients are needed. Primary prevention with aspirin may be considered in asymptomatic patients who have a high-risk aPL profile, particularly if additional risk factors are present. Secondary prevention with long-term anticoagulation is recommended based on estimated risks of VTE recurrence, although routine evaluation of thrombotic risk can assist in determining whether ongoing anticoagulation is warranted. Studies that stratify thrombotic risk in aPL-positive patients, and patients with APS evaluating antithrombotic and non-antithrombotic therapies will be useful in optimizing the management of these patients.

### Recurrent thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and arterial thrombosis on antithrombotic therapy [^b2551de6]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Management for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and arterial thrombosis is controversial. There are no prospective data demonstrating the superiority of high- or moderate-intensity anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists over antiplatelet agents. Using 2 antiphospholipid antibody databases (single center [New York Presbyterian Hospital] and multicenter [Antiphospholipid Syndrome Alliance for Clinical Trials and International Networking]), we retrospectively collected demographic and clinical data of patients with APS and arterial thrombosis. The primary outcome was recurrent thrombosis rate after initial arterial thrombosis in patients with APS treated with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy. We identified 139 patients with a median follow-up time of 4.24 years after initial thrombosis. Thirty-seven patients (27.3%) received anticoagulants, 43 (30.9%) antiplatelets, and 58 (41.7%) combined therapy. Sixteen patients (37.2%) in the antiplatelet group, 9 (23.7%) in the anticoagulant group, and 4 (6.9%) in the combined therapy group experienced recurrent thrombosis. We estimate that 20% of patients will experience a recurrence by 3.4, 7.3, and 16.3 years, respectively, depending on assignment to antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or combined therapy. These results suggest that combined therapy decreases the rate of and increases the time to thrombosis recurrence in patients with APS presenting with arterial thrombosis.

### Management of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: a systematic review [^5259d17e]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Antiphospholipid antibodies are autoantibodies directed against proteins that bind to phospholipid. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) refers to the association between antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis risk or pregnancy morbidity. Patients with APS may be at increased risk of recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis or pregnancy loss.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence for treatment of thrombosis risk in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies or APS.

Evidence Acquisition

Search of MEDLINE (1966 to November 2005) and Cochrane Library electronic databases (2005) and reference lists for randomized trials, meta-analyses of randomized trials, and prospective cohort studies of the treatment of thrombosis risk in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies or APS. Studies were selected on the basis of clinical relevance.

Evidence Synthesis

Among patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, the absolute risk of developing new thrombosis is low (<1% per year) in otherwise healthy patients without prior thrombotic events, may be moderately increased (up to 10% per year) in women with recurrent fetal loss without prior thrombosis, and is highest (>10% in the first year) in patients with a history of venous thrombosis who have discontinued anticoagulant drugs within 6 months. Compared with placebo or untreated control, anticoagulation with moderate-intensity warfarin (adjusted to a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.0-3.0) reduces the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis by 80% to 90% irrespective of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and may be effective for preventing recurrent arterial thrombosis. No evidence exists that high-intensity warfarin (target INR, >3.0) is more effective than moderate-intensity warfarin. For patients with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result and prior stroke, aspirin and moderate-intensity warfarin appear equally effective for preventing recurrent stroke. Treatment issues that have not been addressed in clinical trials, or for which the evidence is conflicting, include the role of antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies without prior thrombosis, the optimal treatment of noncerebrovascular arterial thrombosis, recurrent thrombosis despite warfarin therapy, and treatment of women with antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent fetal loss.

Conclusions

In patients with APS, moderate-intensity warfarin is effective for preventing recurrent venous thrombosis and perhaps also arterial thrombosis. Aspirin appears to be as effective as moderate-intensity warfarin for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke and a single positive test result for antiphospholipid antibody. The optimal treatment of other thrombotic aspects of APS needs to be addressed in well-designed prospective studies.

### Current treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome: lights and shadows [^d213bc5d]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2015). Medium credibility.

For patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), the consensus is to treat those who develop thrombosis with long-term oral anticoagulation therapy and to prevent obstetric manifestations by use of aspirin and heparin. These recommendations are based on data from randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Despite this body of knowledge, areas of uncertainty regarding the management of APS exist where evidence is scarce or nonexistent. In other words, for a subset of patients the course of management is unclear. Some examples are patients with 'seronegative' APS, those who do not fulfil the formal (clinical or serological) classification criteria for definite APS, and those with recurrent thrombotic events despite optimal anticoagulation. Other challenges include the treatment of clinical manifestations not included in the classification criteria, such as haematologic manifestations (thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia), neurologic manifestations (chorea, myelitis and multiple sclerosis-like lesions), and nephropathy and heart valve disease associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), as well as the possible withdrawal of anticoagulation treatment in selected cases of thrombotic APS in which assays for aPL become persistently negative. This Review focuses on the current recommendations for thrombotic and obstetric manifestations of APS, as well as the management of difficult cases. Some aspects of treatment, such as secondary prophylaxis of venous thrombosis, are based on strong evidence--the 'lights' of APS treatment. Conversely, other areas, such as the treatment of non-criteria manifestations of APS, are based only on expert consensus or common sense and remain the 'shadows' of APS therapy.

### Longterm anticoagulation is preferable for patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. result of a decision analysis [^8f18e143]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) have a high risk for rethrombosis. Anticoagulation with warfarin and aspirin reduces the frequency of recurrences. No universally accepted approach regarding the duration and intensity of antithrombotic therapy exists. We investigated the best antithrombotic regimen for patients with APS after the first deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

Methods

We identified 6 anticoagulation regimens used in such patients, the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with bleeding, and the rates of recurrent thrombosis associated with APS by literature search. A decision tree was developed and the expected risks and benefits of each anticoagulation regimen were assessed at 2 different time points: at one year and again 4 years after the initial thrombosis.

Results

Based on the decision analysis, longterm warfarin alone at an international normalization ratio (INR) between 3.0 and 4.0 had the highest expected utility of the 6 antithrombotic regimens, both one year and 4 years after the initial venous thrombotic event. Short term anticoagulation for only 6 months is less beneficial. Combination therapy of warfarin and aspirin (ASA) does not offer an improvement in the expected utility over warfarin alone.

Conclusion

Although the applicability of this analysis to clinical decision-making is not entirely clear, patients with APS presenting with DVT appear to benefit from longterm warfarin (INR 3.0-4.0) that may be superior to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Short term warfarin therapy seems to be less beneficial and the use of ASA does not offer a clear additional benefit. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide a better basis for recommendations for the treatment APS.

Therapeutic INR targets for VKA therapy are defined as follows: For patients treated with VKAs, we recommend a therapeutic INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (target INR of 2.5) rather than a lower (INR < 2) or higher (INR 3.0-5.0) range (Grade 1B). For patients with antiphospholipid syndrome with previous arterial or venous thromboembolism, we suggest VKA therapy targeted to a moderate-intensity INR range (INR 2.0-3.0) rather than higher intensity (INR 3.0-4.5) (Grade 2B).

### How I treat the antiphospholipid syndrome [^fd5ff992]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

This article discusses how we approach medical decision making in the treatment of the various facets of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), including secondary prophylaxis in the setting of venous and arterial thrombosis, as well as treatment for the prevention of recurrent miscarriages and fetal death. The role of primary thromboprophylaxis is also discussed in depth. Great emphasis is given to incorporating the most up-to-date and relevant evidence base both from the APS literature, and from large, recent, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of primary and secondary thrombotic prophylaxis in the general population setting (ie, the population that has not been specifically investigated for APS).

### Anticoagulant therapy for the thrombotic complications of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^72108b3d]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) are at risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE) or venous thromboembolism (VTE). The true strength of the association between APLA and first TE is unknown as there are no prospective studies of a large, well-characterized inception cohort of matched patients with and without APLA. Thus, evidence-based treatment recommendations for primary prophylaxis of TE in such patients cannot be made. Optimal therapy of patients with recent TE and APLA remains controversial; although there is no doubt that some such patients have a malignant hypercoagulable state characterized by resistance to "usual intensity" anticoagulation; recent evidence suggests that most such patients are adequately treated with "usual therapy". After warfarin discontinuation, such patients appear to be at increased risk of recurrent TE, as demonstrated in a series of studies of discontinuation of secondary TE prophylaxis in patients with APLA and venous TE (VTE). Because of this increased risk of recurrent TE, after anticoagulants are discontinued, most "experts" recommend extended duration therapeutic dose warfarin for such patients. This paper will briefly review this evidence.

Treatment with VKA with INR 2–3 versus INR 3–4

Summary of an earlier SLR showed a lower risk for recurrent thrombosis in patients with high-intensity INR anticoagulation treatment versus those with a target INR of 2–3.Analyses of paired comparisons within studies were not reported. Recurrence risk among patients with first arterial thrombosis was not analysed specifically. One RCT with low risk of bias provided stratified data on patients with arterial thrombosis specifically (table 3). Over a mean of 2.6 years, recurrences were higher among those in the target INR 3–4 group than in the INR 2–3 group (8.6/100 py vs 2.6/100 py) but without statistical significance. Bleeding complications were only reported for the treatment groups as a whole (including patients with either venous or arterial events) and were similar. Another RCT compared patients with APS treated to a high target INR (3–4.5) versus moderate target INR,but only 32% of participants had prior arterial events. Over a median follow-up of 3.6 years, recurrent events occurred more frequently in the high INR group (3.1/100 patient-years (py) vs 1.6/100 py). Major bleeding was slightly less common in the high INR group. Results were not stratified by history of venous or arterial events, so these results are only indirectly related to the treatment of patients with arterial thrombosis. Risk of bias was rated as high (table 3).

Studies of intensity of oral anticoagulation treatment in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous arterial thrombosis

Two additional indirect comparison studies included a mixture of patients with histories of venous and arterial events. The first study included 39 patients with venous thrombosis and 31 with arterial thrombosis. Recurrent thrombosis was not observed in the subgroup treated with warfarin INR ≥3 while the rate was 7/100 py in the subgroup of INR 2–3. Methodological quality was intermediate. In the second study of patients with APS with history of thrombosis (54% venous; 46% arterial at diagnosis), recurrent thrombosis was less frequent among patients treated with VKA at INR ≥3 than those with INR <3 (63). All bleeding complications occurred in the high-intensity group (any bleeding 7.1/100 py; major bleeding 1.7/100 py) (table 3). Data from mixed treatment and single treatment arm studies showed substantial variability in thrombosis recurrence(online supplementary table 6).

Secondary thromboprophylaxis in APS

Patients with definite APS and first venous thrombosis

Treatment with VKA at conventional versus high-intensity anticoagulation

One double-blind RCT with low risk of bias presented stratified results on patients with prior venous thrombosis specifically(table 2). Recurrent thrombosis was more frequent in those in the higher intensity (target international normalised ratio (INR) 3–4) warfarin group than in the INR 2–3 group over a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. However, in the group of patients with a target INR 2–3, the INR was above the target range 11% of the time, within range 71% of the time and below range 19% of the time. In the high-intensity group, the corresponding figures were 17%, 40% and 43%.

Table 2 
Studies of intensity of oral anticoagulation treatment in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thrombosis

Pooled data including this RCTand four indirect comparison studies (one RCT, two retrospective cohorts, one prospective cohort)of variable quality did not indicate a difference in risk of recurrent thrombosis between patients on treatment with VKA with a target INR 2–3 and patients with a target INR >3 (RR 0.67 (95% CI 0.05 to 8.20), with high heterogeneity among studies, I 2 =82%) (table 2). The indirect studies included patients with either prior venous or arterial thromboses; the proportion with venous thromboses ranged from 54% to 74% (26–29). High-intensity INR was not significantly associated with an increased risk of major bleeding (RR 1.61; 95% CI 0.34 to 7.56); however, data on bleeding complications were not reported for patients with venous thrombosis specifically in any study.

Nine single treatment arm studiesreported on risks of recurrent thrombosis in cohorts treated with either higher INR targets or conventional INR targets only (online supplementary table 2). Risks in these studies substantially overlapped although appeared to be somewhat lower in the higher INR target studies.

### Viewpoint: provoked thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome [^223fb9aa]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Unprovoked thrombosis (thrombosis occurring without an established environmental factor favouring the episode) is a classic feature of APS. In the general population, provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) is clearly defined and has clinical and therapeutic differences compared with unprovoked VTE. Whether provoked VTE in the context of APS may lead to a limited treatment duration is not well established. Therefore, careful clinical and laboratory evaluation is needed to identify patients eligible for a limited duration of anticoagulation treatment after provoked VTE. Given the uncertainties of available data, the risks and benefits of treatment decisions should be clearly explained. Decisions should be shared by both the patient and physician. Cardiovascular risk factors are common in patients with APS with arterial thrombosis. There are insufficient data suggesting that cardiovascular risk factor control would allow the cessation of anticoagulation. In most instances, arterial thrombosis will require prolonged anticoagulants. A careful analysis of clinical characteristics and laboratory evaluation, particularly the aPL antibody profile, is needed to make decisions on a case-by-case basis.

Treatment with DOACs

Data from a recent open-label RCT (TRAPS trial) showed that thrombosis, mainly arterial, developed in 12% of triple aPL patients with APS randomised to rivaroxaban compared with none of those randomised to warfarin, over a mean follow-up of 569 days.Based on these results, and the data from a previousand an updated systematic reviewof 447 APS cases treated with DOACs reporting that triple aPL positivity and history of arterial thrombosis was associated with higher risk of recurrent thrombosis, rivaroxaban should not be used in the treatment of patients with APS and arterial thrombosis.

Treatment in patients with recurrent arterial thrombosis despite adequate anticoagulation

No studies were identified that directly addressed the effectiveness and risks related to an increase of INR target to 3–4, or switch of VKA treatment to LMWH. Regarding the addition of LDA, a prospective cohort study with 5-year follow-up showed that among 22 patients with at least one arterial event, new thromboses occurred in 2/4 (50%) treated with VKA and one antiplatelet drug compared with 6/18 (33%) treated with VKA alone. The target INR was >3 but achieved INR was not reported, and the timing of antiplatelet treatment relative to events was not clearly specified. Confounding by indication may have been present. The role of dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, HCQ and targeted treatments including B-cell depletion therapy for the management of recurrent arterial events has been mainly examined in small case series and may reflect publication bias. Their potential effect in refractory thrombotic APS should be examined in well-designed prospective studies (Research agenda).

Treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

In a post hoc analysis of patients with APS with venous thrombosis included in three RCTs that compared dabigatran versus warfarin in patients with thrombophilia or APS, the risk of recurrent thrombosis was not significantly different between treatment groups, nor was the risk of major bleeding(online supplementary table 3). Risk of any bleeding was lower among patients treated with dabigatran (20%) compared with warfarin (40.3%) (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.95). Another RCT compared rivaroxaban versus warfarin in 115 patients with venous thrombotic APS.Peak thrombin generation was lower in the rivaroxaban compared with warfarin group (56 nmol/L, 95% CI 47 to 66 vs 86 nmol/L, 72 to 102, treatment effect 0.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8, p=0.0006). Although the primary endpoint was endogenous thrombin potential, no patients in either treatment group had recurrence of thrombosis or major bleeding. Minor bleeding occurred in 18% treated with rivaroxaban and 15% treated with warfarin. However, the follow-up was only 7 months, and patients with a history of arterial thrombosis were excluded from the study. A recent RCT of rivaroxaban versus warfarin that included patients with APS with arterial and/or venous thrombosis and with triple aPL positivity was terminated early due to a higher rate of thrombotic events in the rivaroxaban arm.

Four case series reported on outcomes of patients with APS treated with DOACs but did not include a comparison group.These studies reported individual-patient data, allowing abstraction of data on patients with histories of venous thromboses, but were not restricted to patients with a first venous event only. The percentage with recurrent thrombosis ranged from 0% to 5.2% over follow-ups from 11 to 35 months. In a systematic review of case series and case reports that included 122 patients treated with DOACs, recurrent events occurred in 15.6%, and in 16.6% of those with prior venous events, while any bleeding events were reported in 4.1%.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome [^f05e53cc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by venous or arterial thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity in patients with persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). Catastrophic APS is the most severe form of APS, which is associated with rapid development of microvascular thrombosis resulting in multiorgan failure in patients with aPLs. Patients with APS and catastrophic APS are recognized to have a high risk of recurrent thrombosis that can occur despite anticoagulant therapy. Although antithrombotic therapy remains the mainstay of treatment, bleeding manifestations can complicate management and contribute to increased morbidity. Patients with persistently elevated aPL levels, particularly those who exhibit positive testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2GPI antibodies (triple positivity), appear to be at increased risk for thrombosis and pregnancy complications, whereas isolated positivity for aPLs appears to be associated with low risk. Recognizing that patients with APS have different thrombotic risk profiles may assist clinicians in assessing the risks and benefits of anticoagulation. The optimal type, intensity, and duration of anticoagulation in the treatment of APS remain controversial, particularly for arterial thrombosis and recurrent thrombosis. Future studies that delineate thrombotic risk in APS and evaluate current and novel anticoagulants as well as nonanticoagulant therapies are required.

Regarding preventative measures for antiphospholipid syndrome, more specifically with respect to primary thromboprophylaxis, EULAR 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate prophylactic treatment with low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg daily) in asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibody carriers with a high-risk profile with or without traditional risk factors.

A limitation of RAPS is that it was not designed to confirm clinical efficacy and long-term safety. Rather, the trial was designed with a laboratory surrogate outcome measure to assess the mechanism of action of the interventions in these patients. A trial with a primary endpoint of recurrent thrombosis would require a sample of several thousand patients, which is unfeasible for patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, and a much longer follow-up period. There was an intended selection bias because we excluded patients who had had venous thromboembolism and developed recurrent events while taking standard-intensity anticoagulation (ie, needing higher-intensity anticoagulation) and those with arterial events. Thus, our cohort seemed to have antiphospholipid antibodies that caused clinical disease at the less aggressive end of the range seen in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. Nevertheless, limiting the selection of patients to those with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism leading to treatment with standard intensity warfarin ensured a clinically homogeneous study population which is in contrast to two previous, slightly smaller, randomised controlled trials.This feature is an important strength of RAPS. Thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome is clinically heterogeneous, with the risk of recurrent thrombosis and intensity of anticoagulation being dependent on the clinical phenotype.Thus, trials, such as RAPS, that involve clinically homogeneous thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome populations, maximise clinical applicability for subgroups of patients. We caution, therefore, that our results are not applicable to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and venous thromboembolism who need greater than standard-intensity anticoagulation or with stroke or other arterial thrombosis.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in people with antiphospholipid syndrome [^9ca371e4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis (or both) and/or pregnancy morbidity in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The prevalence is estimated at 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. The most common sites of thrombosis are cerebral arteries and deep veins of the lower limbs. People with a definite APS diagnosis have an increased lifetime risk of recurrent thrombotic events.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, or both, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis, particularly ischemic stroke, in people with antiphospholipid syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2017), CENTRAL (last search February 2017), MEDLINE (from 1948 to February 2017), Embase (from 1980 to February 2017), and several ongoing trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and we contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people diagnosed with APS according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion or by consulting a third review author and, in addition, one review author checked all the extracted data.

Main Results

We included five studies involving 419 randomized participants with APS. Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. One study was at low risk of bias in all domains for objective outcomes but not for quality of life (measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). We judged the other three studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias in three or more domains.The duration of intervention ranged from 180 days to a mean of 3.9 years. One study compared rivaroxaban (a novel oral anticoagulant: NOAC) with standard warfarin treatment and reported no thrombotic or major bleeding events, but it was not powered to detect such differences (low-quality evidence). Investigators reported similar rates of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 8.33; moderate-quality evidence) and minor bleeding (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.83) for participants receiving rivaroxaban and the standard vitamin K antagonists (VKA). This study also reported some small benefit with rivaroxaban over the standard VKA treatment in terms of quality of life health state measured at 180 days with the EQ-5D-5L 100 mm visual analogue scale (mean difference (MD) 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low-quality evidence) but not measured as health utility (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10 [on a scale from 0 to 1]).Two studies compared high dose VKA (warfarin) with moderate/standard intensity VKA and found no differences in the rates of any thrombotic events (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23) or major bleeding (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.25) between the groups (low-quality evidence). Minor bleeding analyzed using the RR and any bleeding using the hazard ratio (HR) were more frequent in participants receiving high-intensity warfarin treatment compared to the standard-intensity therapy (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07; and HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low-quality evidence).In one study, it was not possible to estimate the RR for stroke with a combination of VKA plus antiplatelet agent compared to a single antiplatelet agent, while for major bleeding, a single event occurred in the single antiplatelet agent group. In one study, comparing combined VKA plus antiplatelet agent with dual antiplatelet therapy, the RR of the risk of stroke over three years of observation was 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 98.0). In a single small study, the RR for stroke during one year of observation with a dual antiplatelet therapy compared to single antiplatelet drug was 0.14 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.60).

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence for or against NOACs or for high-intensity VKA compared to the standard VKA therapy in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS. There is some evidence of harm for high-intensity VKA regarding minor and any bleeding. The evidence was also not sufficient to show benefit or harm for VKA plus antiplatelet agent or dual antiplatelet therapy compared to a single antiplatelet drug. Future studies should be adequately powered, with proper adherence to treatment, in order to evaluate the effects of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or both, for secondary thrombosis prevention in APS. We have identified five ongoing trials mainly using NOACs in APS, so increasing experimental efforts are likely to yield additional evidence of clinical relevance in the near future.

Introduction

Current consensus recommendations suggest that patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) are at high risk of recurrent arterial or venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite warfarin administered to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. These recommendations have been called into question by three recently reported studies.

Methods

We sought to determine the current "best practice" for the prevention of recurrent TE in patients with APLA and TE. Data was derived from a MEDLINE search and review of recent conference abstracts. The literature search was confined to studies of treatment to prevent recurrent thrombosis in patients with APLA.

Results

The overall proportion of patients suffering recurrent TE when allocated to moderated-intensity warfarin (target INR of 2.0 to 3.0) was 5/113 (4.4%), and it was 11/110 (10.0%) when such patients were randomized to high-intensity warfarin (target INR of 3.0 to 4.0). APLA-positive patients with noncardioembolic/nonatheroembolic stroke appear to have similar risks of recurrent TE whether they are treated with warfarin or aspirin.

Discussion

Patients with APLA and TE have an acceptable rate of recurrent TE if they are treated with usual-intensity warfarin. Patients with APLA and stroke are probably best treated with aspirin, while those with other forms of arterial TE are likely best treated with moderate-intensity warfarin plus aspirin.

### Seronegative antiphospholipid syndrome: refining the value of "non-criteria" antibodies for diagnosis and clinical management [^b341be0f]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of SN-APS should be formulated only after the exclusion of other causes of inherited and acquired thrombophilic conditions. Although several different antibodies to a number of antigens are involved in SN-APS, the routine testing of these non-criteria antibodies is not recommended, but may be considered in patients with a high clinical suspicion of APS, such as those presenting with recurrent unexplained thrombosis, thrombosis at unusual sites, or women with recurrent pregnancy-related complications. The assessment and interpretation of these non-conventional antibodies should be performed by specialized centers of hemostasis and thrombosis to reduce laboratory variability.

The detection of non-criteria aPL may help guide antithrombotic strategies in SN-APS patients with arterial or venous thrombosis. As an example, patients treated with NOAC for recurrent VTE events, who become positive for non-criteria aPL, may be switched to VKA or LMWH, especially in cases of a recurrent thrombotic events. Moreover, in case of an unprovoked DVT, and among patients who could be withdrawn from anticoagulation, the positivity for a non-criteria aPL may help decide whether or not to continue long-term anticoagulation.

In conclusion, there is growing evidence to suggest a role for non-criteria aPL in those patients defined as “seronegative”.

### Antiphospholipid antibodies in critical illness [^810d6130]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome is defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with recurrent venous or arterial thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity. Antithrombotic therapies are the mainstay of treatment to reduce the risk of recurrent thromboembolism. Among patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, the absolute risk of new thrombosis developing is low in healthy patients without previous thrombotic events. However, the risk of recurrent thrombosis appears to be high in patients with a history of arterial or venous thrombosis. Compared with placebo or untreated control, anticoagulation with warfarin administered to achieve an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 probably reduces the risk of recurrence of thrombotic events. Aspirin and moderate-intensity warfarin appear equally effective for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result and previous stroke. It is unknown how best to prevent first stroke in patients found to be persistently positive for the antiphospholipid syndrome. The catastrophic variant of the antiphospholipid syndrome is a condition characterized by multiple vascular occlusive events, usually affecting small vessels and evolving over a short period of time. This condition has a very high mortality rate. First-line treatment with therapeutic anticoagulation, corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin seems to be effective in reducing mortality and risk of catastrophic thrombotic events in these patients. In conclusion, moderate-intensity warfarin is effective for preventing recurrent thrombotic events in patients with venous thrombosis. Aspirin appears to be as effective as moderate-intensity warfarin for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with previous stroke and a single positive test result for antiphospholipid antibody. The optimal treatment of other clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome needs to be addressed in well-designed prospective studies.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)—aspirin and thrombotic risk: In pooled analyses, aspirin use was associated with lower odds of overall thrombosis without major bleeding (OR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.31–0.98]). In individual patient data, the benefit appeared greater for arterial thrombosis (HR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.20–0.94]) than for venous thrombosis (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.21–1.10]), and most patients studied had a high-risk aPL profile.

### How much warfarin is enough in APS related thrombosis? [^2d5f599f]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Warfarin is the best available, most effective treatment for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients. However, warfarin is cumbersome for both patients and physicians because of risk for bleeding and the need for frequent monitoring. Much detail regarding optimal management of APS patients still lacks an evidence-based approach. Asymptomatic patients should not receive warfarin. An optimal treatment for patients with livedo, cardiac valve disease, leg ulcers or microangiopathic nephropathy is unknown; it is likely that warfarin is ineffective for these manifestations of the APS. In low risk patients who have not previously failed warfarin, moderate intensity anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio [INR] 2.5) is as effective as, and safer than, high intensity anticoagulation (INR 3.5), at least for patients with venous thrombosis. Current recommendations, based on the opinion rather than on documentation, state that warfarin should be prescribed for the APS patient's life; studies that challenge this conclusion for carefully defined low risk patients whose thromboses occurred with trigger events will be welcome, as will be studies examining alternatives to warfarin, including antiplatelet drugs.

### Can we use NOACS in APS? [^cd4f2507]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondary thromboprophylaxis with low molecular heparin or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is recommended in patients with definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) have been approved in different prothrombotic conditions and have numerous advantages compared to VKAs. Whether DOACs can be used for secondary prophylaxis in APS is an open question. Data from the TRAPS randomized controlled Trial, meta-analysis and case reports indicate that we should not treat patients with triple positive APS and/or arterial thrombi with routine doses of DOACS. On the other hand, data from the literature including, case series, meta- analysis and the RAPS trial indicate that there are low risk patients, such as patients who suffered from a venous but not an arterial thromboembolism and are LAC negative who may benefit from the treatment with DOACs. Prospective trials addressing these low risk patients are needed in order to consider DOAC treatment in such patients.

### Antithrombotic therapy in arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in COVID-19: an American College of Chest Physicians expert panel report [^ff0adce1]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Stroke or TIA—epidemiology and rationale: approximately 0.9% to 2.7% of patients with COVID-19 may experience stroke, frequently with large vessel occlusion. Observational data suggested that markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (eg, D-dimer elevation) are associated significantly with thromboembolic events among patients with COVID-19, and an increased positivity of lupus anticoagulant was also observed in patients with COVID-19. In the general population of patients with ischemic stroke or TIA, antiplatelet alone (class 1) is recommended for those with an isolated antiphospholipid antibody who do not fulfill antiphospholipid syndrome criteria, and warfarin (class 2) for those who meet the criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in people with antiphospholipid syndrome [^49aa1f1b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis (or both), and/or pregnancy morbidity in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The prevalence of APS is estimated at 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. The most common sites of thrombosis are cerebral arteries and deep veins of the lower limbs. People with a definite APS diagnosis have an increased lifetime risk of recurrent thrombotic events.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiplatelet (AP) or anticoagulant agents, or both, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis, particularly ischemic stroke, in people with APS.

Search Methods

We last searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, and ongoing trials registers on 22 November 2019. We checked reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines. We also contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or AP agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS, according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently worked on each step of the review, following Cochrane methods. We summarized the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified eight studies including 811 participants that compared different AP or anticoagulant agents. NOAC (non-VKA oral anticoagulant: rivaroxaban 15 or 20 mg/d) versus standard-dose VKA (vitamin K antagonist: warfarin at moderate International Normalized Ratio [INR] - 2.5) or adjusted [INR 2.0-3.0] dose): In three studies there were no differences in any thromboembolic event (including death) and major bleeding (moderate-certainty evidence), but an increased risk of stroke (risk ratio [RR] 14.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87 to 106.8; moderate-certainty evidence). One of the studies reported a small benefit of rivaroxaban in terms of quality of life at 180 days measured as health state on Visual Analogue Scale (mean difference [MD] 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low-certainty evidence), but not measured as health utility on a scale from 0 to 1 (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10; low-certainty evidence). High-dose VKA (warfarin with a target INR of 3.1 to 4.0 [mean 3.3] or 3.5 [mean 3.2]) versus standard-dose VKA (warfarin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 [mean 2.3] or 2.5 [mean 2.5]): In two studies there were no differences in the rates of thrombotic events and major bleeding (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23, low-certainty evidence), but an increased risk of minor bleeding in one study during a mean of 3.4 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.2) of follow-up (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07). In both trials there was evidence of a higher risk of any bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low-certainty evidence) in the high-dose VKA group, and for this outcome (any bleeding) the incidence is not different, only the time to event is showing an effect. Standard-dose VKA plus a single AP agent (warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 plus aspirin 100 mg/d) versus standard-dose VKA (warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0): One high-risk-of-bias study showed an increased risk of any thromboembolic event with combined treatment (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.43; low-certainty evidence) and reported on major bleeding with five cases in the combined treatment group and one case in the standard-dose VKA treatment group, resulting in RR 7.42 (95% CI 0.91 to 60.7; low-certainty evidence) and no differences for secondary outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Single/dual AP agent and standard-dose VKA (pooled results): Two high-risk-of-bias studies compared a combination of AP and VKA (aspirin 100 mg/d plus warfarin or unspecified VKA at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 or 2.0 to 2.5) with a single AP agent (aspirin 100 mg/d), but did not provide any conclusive evidence regarding the effects of those drugs in people with APS (very low-certainty evidence). One of the above-mentioned studies was a three-armed study that compared a combination of AP and VKA (aspirin 100 mg/d plus warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 2.5) with dual AP therapy (aspirin 100 mg/d plus cilostazol 200 mg/d) and dual AP therapy (aspirin 100 mg/d plus cilostazol 200 mg/d) versus a single AP treatment (aspirin 100 mg/d). This study reported on stroke (very low-certainty evidence) but did not report on any thromboembolic events, major bleeding, or any secondary outcomes. We identified two ongoing studies and three studies are awaiting classification.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence identified indicates that NOACs compared with standard-dose VKAs may increase the risk of stroke and do not appear to alter the risk of other outcomes (moderate-certainty evidence). Using high-dose VKA versus standard-dose VKA did not alter the risk of any thromboembolic event or major bleeding but may increase the risk of any form of bleeding (low-certainty evidence). Standard-dose VKA combined with an AP agent compared with standard-dose VKA alone may increase the risk of any thromboembolic event and does not appear to alter the risk of major bleeding or other outcomes (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the benefit or harm of using standard-dose VKA plus AP agents versus single or dual AP therapy, or dual versus single AP therapy, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis in people with APS (very low-certainty evidence).

### Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^512e4627]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is defined by the persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with recurrent venous or arterial thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity. Anti-thrombotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment given the high risk of recurrent thromboembolism that characterizes this condition. Despite the prothrombotic nature of APS, thrombocytopenia is present in a proportion of patients. which can complicate management and limit the use of antithrombotic therapy. The mechanism of APS-associated thrombocytopenia is multifactorial and its relation to thrombotic risk poorly characterized. However, the presence of thrombocytopenia does not appear to reduce thrombotic risk in patients with APS, who can develop thromboembolic complications necessitating antithrombotic treatment. In these cases, treatment of the thrombocytopenia may be necessary to facilitate administration of antithrombotic agents. Clinical trials have demonstrated that patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and venous thromboembolism should be treated with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin); that ischemic stroke may be treated with aspirin or warfarin; and that women with recurrent pregnancy loss should receive prophylactic-dose heparin and aspirin. However, application of these trial results to patients with APS-associated thrombocytopenia can be challenging since there are limited data on the optimal use of antithrombotic agents in this setting. Issues such as determining the platelet threshold at which antithrombotic agents can be safely used and managing patients with both bleeding and thromboembolic complications remain unresolved. Ultimately the risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy, balanced against the severity of the thrombocytopenia and its potential bleeding risks, need to be assessed using an individualized patient approach.

Primary and secondary prevention strategies

Antiphospholipid antibody carriers

In subjects with positivity for aPL in the absence of clinical thrombotic events, primary prevention strategy includes cardiovascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and cigarette smoking (Figure 2). Treatment with low-dose aspirin (LDA, 75-100 mg/die) is still controversialand could be considered in patients at high risk, such as those with triple positivity or persistent positivity with medium-high titer of aCL. Recently, the positivity for IgG aPS/PT has been suggested as a marker of thrombotic risk in aPL carriers in addition to triple positivity (Figure 2).Regarding oral anticoagulation, with or without LDA, the quality of evidence is too low to demonstrate benefit or harm of anticoagulant use in aPL carriers.

Figure 2 
Summary of antithrombotic treatment options in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and seronegative antiphospholipid syndrome.APS: antiphospholipid syndrome; aPL: antiphospholipid antibodies; aCL: anticardiolipin antibodies; VTE: venous thromboembolism; LDA: low-dose aspirin, LMWH: low molecular weight heparin, UFH: unfractionated heparin; INR: international normalized ratio; EULAR: European League Against Rheumatism.

In women with a high-risk aPL profile but no history of thrombosis or pregnancy complications, treatment with LDA (75-100 mg daily) during pregnancy should be considered according to 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations.

Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome

In APS patients with previous arterial or venous thromboembolism, use of unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) is recommended in the acute phasefollowed by long-term treatment with warfarin, with an international normalized ratio (INR) range between 2-3.

Warfarin therapy in APS has several critical points. Indeed, a recent studyshowed that, in the APS population, the management of anticoagulant therapy is more problematic compared to a population of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Thus, APS patients had a shorter time within the therapeutic range than those with AF (53.5% vs. 68%; P =0.001) and needed a higher mean weekly dose of warfarin to reach the therapeutic range.

### Thrombophilia testing: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^b1a1dc5a]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with thrombotic APS, uncertainties remain as to the recurrence risk in patients with an initial unprovoked, compared to provoked, VTE and in those with venous compared to an initial arterial thrombosis.There is increasing evidence that the recurrence risk of VTE provoked by minor risk factors is similar to that with unprovoked VTE.Therefore, such patients may also benefit from extended anticoagulation therapy as in those with unprovoked VTE. As the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies may alter management including choice of antithrombotic therapy in these patients, it may be reasonable to test for antiphospholipid antibodies.

Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a rare, but potentially fatal, variant of APS characterised by sudden onset of extensive microvascular thrombosis at multiple sites leading to multiorgan failure.CAPS tends to occur usually in patients with triple positive APS. Recommendations on the timing of, and indications for, antiphospholipid antibody testing following venous or arterial thrombosis are provided in the Addendum to British Society for Haematology Guidelines on Investigation and Management of Antiphospholipid Syndrome (2020).

In asymptomatic individuals with triple positive antiphospholipid antibodies (mostly identified because of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time or presence of an autoimmune disorder), the incidence of first thrombotic events (which were equally distributed between venous and arterial thrombosis) was estimated to be 5% per year.Lower incidences of thrombosis of 1% and 0.5% annually respectively have been described in asymptomatic single antibody positive individuals and in women with the obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome.

Recommendations

Screening for antiphospholipid antibodies is recommended following unprovoked VTE because this may alter management including choice of antithrombotic therapy (Grade 1B).
Screening for antiphospholipid antibodies is suggested in patients with VTE provoked by a minor risk factor as this may alter management including choice of antithrombotic therapy (Grade 2C).
Patients with acute multiple thrombotic events and evidence of organ failure suggestive of CAPS should be tested for antiphospholipid antibodies (Grade 1A).
As APS is an acquired thrombophilia, screening for antiphospholipid antibodies is not recommended in family members of patients with thrombosis (Grade 1A).

### Lack of efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^1004be53]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have a predictable anticoagulant effect, a rapid onset and offset of action, and fewer drug-drug interactions than vitamin K antagonists (VKA). These compounds have demonstrated similar efficacy and a better safety profile compared to VKA for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE)and for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (FANV)in large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.

Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) require long-term anticoagulation for the secondary prevention of thrombotic events. In this setting, VKA were shown to be more effective than DOACand are therefore recommended by international guidelines.However, the risk of recurrent thrombosis remains high even with VKA treatment, varying from 3% to 24%,, and even increasing the intensity of VKA therapy does not reduce the probability of recurrence.

It is clear that adequate anticoagulation therapy still represents a clinical challenge in patients with APS and further investigation is needed before declaring DOAC ineffective. It has been reported that patients with previous arterial or venous manifestation recur with the same type of thromboses and that the risk of recurrence on DOAC is higher in patients with a history of arterial events.Two randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing DOAC and warfarin in APS have been prematurely interrupted due to the evidence of increased incidence of thrombotic events in the DOAC group,, especially strokes. However, it remains unclear whether VKA are more effective than DOAC also in patients with VTE history and no arterial events. The aim of our study was to provide the best evidence from RCT on the risk of major vascular events and bleeding in patients with APS treated with DOAC versus warfarin and to evaluate if patients with no history of arterial thrombosis may be candidate to treatment with DOAC.

### Digital ulcers as presenting symptom of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome [^c24039c3]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Due to the limited amount of evidence, guidelines for the management of patients with APS have not been standardized. For primary thrombotic prevention, the use of low-dose aspirin (LDA) is controversial, with evidence showing mixed results. In 2019, the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) developed a set of recommendations for the management of APS in adults. These recommendations stratify patients into one of 3 tiers based on aPL titers (low, medium-high, and high risk). For any asymptomatic patient with SLE and aPL positivity and a high-risk designation, LDA is recommended. For patients categorized as low risk, LDA should be considered.This recommendation varies slightly from the proposal of the 16 th International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies Task Force, which suggested that LDA should be considered on a case-by-case basis.In the acute setting, low-molecular-weight heparins, followed by long-term warfarin treatment, is considered standard of care.Warfarin is also recommended for secondary thromboprophylaxis with a goal international normalized ratio of 2-3.,Management of arterial thrombotic events is less established: recommendations include the use of warfarin alone or with LDA. The use of direct oral anticoagulants is contraindicated in patients with arterial thrombotic events, small-vessel thrombosis, aPL-related valvular disease, or triple aPL positivity. Direct oral anticoagulants are not only less effective than warfarin but associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events in patients with a history of arterial thrombosis or triple positive aPL.In a randomized trial, 6 of 23 patients with APS on apixaban experienced a stroke compared to 0 of 25 patients on warfarin.Rituximab, hydroxychloroquine, eculizumab, and statins have been evaluated as alternate or adjunctive therapies and can be considered in cases of catastrophic APS.

### Therapy with direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention of thromboembolic events in the antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^70bfe6d3]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

After a comprehensive literature search, this systematic review and meta-analysis summarises all available RCTs for the use of secondary prophylaxis with DOACs versus VKA in patients with APS, including the latest ASTRO-APS Study. We found no clinical value in choosing DOACs over VKA for secondary thrombosis prophylaxis in patients with APS. In fact, DOACs seem to be less effective, especially to those experiencing incident AT. A change from VKA to DOAC does not occur to be beneficial for the patients with APS in terms of risk of bleeding.

However, a subset of patients with APS with only VT history might benefit from DOAC treatment, but this should be addressed by well-designed trials. We suggest the trial outcomes mentioned above as the core outcome set in this area of research and encourage the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Initiative to further define a core domain set for trials in patients with APS.

### Antiphospholipid thrombosis syndromes [^cb40d339]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated strongly with thrombosis and are the most common of the acquired blood protein defects causing thrombosis. Although the precise mechanisms whereby antiphospholipid antibodies alter hemostasis to induce a hypercoagulable state remain unclear, numerous theories, as previously discussed, have been advanced. The most common thrombotic events associated with ACLAs are deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (type I syndrome), coronary or peripheral artery thrombosis (type II syndrome), or cerebrovascular/retinal vessel thrombosis (type III syndrome), and occasionally patients present with mixtures (type IV syndrome). Patients with type V disease are those with antiphospholipid antibodies and RMS. It is as yet unclear how many seemingly normal individuals who may never develop manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (type VI) harbor asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibodies. The relative frequency of ACLAs in association with arterial and venous thrombosis strongly suggests that they should be looked for in any individual with unexplained thrombosis; all three idiotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be assessed. Also, the type of syndrome (I-VI) should be defined, if possible, because this identification may dictate both the type and the duration of immediate and long-term anticoagulant therapy. Unlike those patients with ACLAs, patients with primary LA-thrombosis syndrome usually have venous thrombosis. Because the aPTT is unreliable in patients with LA (prolonged in only approximately 40%-50% of patients) and usually is not prolonged in patients with ACLAs, definitive tests, including ELISA for ACLA, the dilute Russell's viper venom time for LA, hexagonal phospholipid-neutralization procedure, and B-2-GP-I (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be ordered immediately when suspecting antiphospholipid syndrome or in individuals with otherwise unexplained thrombotic or thromboembolic events. If these test results are negative, subgroups also should be assessedin the appropriate clinical setting. Most patients with antiphospholipid thrombosis syndrome will fail to respond to warfarin therapy, and except for retinal vascular thrombosis, may fail some types of antiplatelet therapy, so it is of major importance to make this diagnosis so patients can be treated with the most effective therapy for secondary prevention-LMWH or unfractionated heparin in most instances and clopidogrel in some instances.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid syndrome: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^06dc6569]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The gold standard for secondary thromboprophylaxis in APS is long term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Because of their widespread use and potential advantages of directs oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over VKAs, they have been prescribed in APS without definitive evidence of their safety and efficacy in this context. Recent specific randomized controlled trials (RCT) in APS and results from pivotal RCTs comparing DOACs vs VKAs are now available. Their results are conflicting but these studies have been conducted in different APS populations.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize available data from RCT and determine risks of recurrent thrombosis and bleeding.

Results

Four studies were included and 23 and 10 thrombotic events were recorded among 282 and 294 APS patients treated with DOACs and warfarin respectively. Overall recurrent thrombotic events were not significantly increased during DOACs treatment (OR = 2.22 [95% CI, 0.58-8.43]) compared to VKAs. However, when different types of thrombosis were analyzed separately, there was an increased risk of recurrent arterial thrombosis (5.17 [95% CI, 1.57-17.04]) with DOACs compared to warfarin but no significant higher risk of venous thrombosis (OR 0.69 [95% CI, 0.23-2.06). No increased risk of bleeding was found.

In Conclusion

In APS patients treated with DOACs compared to those treated with warfarin, no evidence of a higher risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism was found however there was a significantly increased risk of recurrent arterial thrombosis. Moreover risk of recurrent arterial thrombosis tended to be more frequent in patients with a history of arterial thrombosis. These results are in line with international guidelines which recommend not to use DOACs in APS patients with a history of arterial thrombosis but raise the question of the efficacy of DOACs to prevent venous thrombosis in a subset of APS patients without a history of arterial thrombosis.

### Treatment of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome in adults and children [^aab7f7ae]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), more common than once believed, is an autoimmune disease best known for its high risk of incident and recurrent thrombotic events. The approach to treatment potentially differs from treatment of thrombosis in the general population, and this article endeavors to review the latest updates on this topic.

Recent Findings

The epidemiology of APS is being increasingly elucidated by large population-based studies, with APS perhaps affecting as many as 1 in 2000 individuals. Vitamin K antagonists, aspirin, and heparinoids continue to have obvious roles in the management of patients with APS. There has recently been intensive study of direct oral anticoagulants in APS, with the most recent randomized studies raising concerns about their inferiority to vitamin K antagonists, at least in some subgroups. Other approaches to treating APS beyond anticoagulants and antiaggregants are also receiving increased attention in mechanistic and preclinical studies with an eye toward future roles in patients with refractory and/or microvascular disease. Pediatric APS is identified as an area in desperate need of additional prospective research.

Summary

Progress continues to be made in pursuit of improving the lives of individuals afflicted with APS. The most important future directions would seem to involve leveraging modern molecular technologies in order to improve subphenotyping of antiphospholipid antibody-positive individuals. This will help personalize risk profiles and ideally define the optimal approach to therapy based on future risk, rather than past morbid events.

### Epidemiologic notes and reports toxic-shock syndrome – United States (...) [^c285ab56]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Physicians in 8 other states have reported individual cases to CDC or to investigators at the University of Colorado, Denver. Toxic-shock syndrome typically begins suddenly with high fever, vomiting, and profuse watery diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by sore throat, headache, and myalgias. The disease progresses to hypotensive shock within 48 hours, and the patient develops a diffuse, macular, erythematous rash with non-purulent conjunctivitis. Urine output is often decreased, and patients may be disoriented or combative. The adult respiratory distress syndrome or cardiac dysfunction may also be seen. Laboratory studies reveal elevated blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, bilirubin, and creatine phosphokinase levels, and white blood cell counts with marked left shifts. Platelet counts are low in the first week of illness but are usually high in the second week. Patients require large volumes of fluid to maintain perfusion and usually require intensive care.

In the recovery phase, there is desquamation of at least the palms, soles, or digits and often of other skin areas as well. Since October 1, 1979, 55 cases have been reported to CDC. Fifty-two of these have been in women. The mean age is 24. 8 years, with a range of 13-52 years. Seven deaths have occurred, for a case-fatality ratio of 13%. Of 40 patients in whom a menstrual history was obtained, 38 had onset of illness with the 5-day period following onset of menses. Two others had onset of illness 10 days after onset of menses. Moreover, 13 patients have had recurrence of symptoms with a subsequent menstrual period. In 33 of 45 patients cultured, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the throat, cervix, vagina, or rectum. Four of 15 patients tested for Herpesvirus hominis had serologic or cultural evidence of herpes infection.

No evidence for leptospirosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, viral exanthematous diseases, or streptococcal scarlet fever has been found in those patients in whom it has been looked for. , MD, State Epidemiologist, Utah Dept of Health; MH Tanner, MD, Riverview Hospital, Idaho Falls; JK Todd, MD, Children's Hospital, Denver, Colorado; Field Services Div and Special Pathogens Br, Bacterial Diseases Div, Bur of Epidemiology, CDC. editorial Note: Toxic-shock syndrome is a serious disease of unknown etiology. It affects primarily young women of child-bearing age who have been previously healthy, and it has a case-fatality ratio for reported cases of 10%-15%. This ratio is probably high because severe cases are easier to recognize. In Wisconsin, where surveillance has been very active, the case-fatality ratio has been 3. 2%. The syndrome resembles Kawasaki disease in several respects, namely fever, rash with subsequent desquamation, and cardiac involvement.

However, shock, which is prominent in toxic-shock syndrome, is not usually seen in Kawasaki disease. The character of the rash is also different in the 2 diseases: it is a maculopapular one in Kawasaki disease but a non-papular, diffuse erythroderma in toxic-shock syndrome. Azotemia and thrombocytopenia are rarely seen in Kawasaki disease and are common in toxic-shock syndrome. Kawasaki disease classically occurs in children less than 5 years of age; some recently reported cases of "adult Kawasaki disease" may actually be cases of toxic-shock syndrome. Toxic-shock syndrome was first recognized in 7 children aged 8-17 years, 3 of whom were boys. In 5 of the 7, S. aureus was isolated from the nasopharynx, vagina, or localized abscess. At that time it was hypothesized that the syndrome was caused by a toxin elaborated by the staphylococci. Although S.

### Management of thrombotic and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^b6d11b8c]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To perform a systematic literature review (SLR) informing the European Lmmendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in adults.

Methods

A SLR through January 2018 was performed. Research questions were constructed using the Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) format. We included data from articles that reported on each relevant intervention. Summary effect estimates were calculated for direct comparison studies that matched the PICO question exactly, and for studies with the relevant intervention and comparator. When meta-analyses were available, we used these estimates.

Results

From 7534 retrieved articles (+15 from hand searches), 188 articles were included in the review. In individuals with high-risk antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) profile without prior thrombotic or obstetric APS, two meta-analyses showed a protective effect of low-dose aspirin (LDA) against thrombosis. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies showed no additional benefit of treatment with vitamin K antagonists at target international normalised ratio (INR) 3–4 versus INR 2–3 in patients with venous thrombosis. In patients with arterial thrombosis, two RCTs and two cohort studies showed no difference in risk of recurrent thrombosis between the two target INR groups. One open-label trial showed higher rates of thrombosis recurrences in triple aPL-positive patients treated with rivaroxaban than those treated with warfarin. RCTs and cohort studies showed that combination treatment with LDA and heparin was more effective than LDA alone in several types of obstetric APS. SLR results were limited by the indirect evidence and the heterogeneity of patient groups for some treatments, and only a few high-quality RCTs.

Conclusion

Well-designed studies of homogeneous APS patient populations are needed.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^6705837a]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome—Evidence and testing considerations for secondary stroke prevention: In a WARSS (Warfarin-Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study) subgroup, investigators found no differential stroke risk reduction in people with a 1-time positive antiphospholipid antibody with warfarin (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.75–1.31]) or aspirin (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.70–1.28]; treatment-by-antiphospholipid interaction, P=0.91), and therefore aspirin is more preferable than warfarin because of the lower risk of bleeding with aspirin. Approximately 13% of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have stroke as the initial clinical manifestation of the disease. In patients with cryptogenic stroke and a history of thrombosis or rheumatological disease, it would seem reasonable to consider testing for antiphospholipid antibodies, whereas in older populations with increasing frequency of vascular risk factors, there is no evidence supporting the systematic testing for antiphospholipid antibodies. Although no trials of antithrombotic intervention have been performed exclusively in stroke patients, the available evidence favors anticoagulation with VKA compared with aspirin to reduce recurrent arterial thromboses; an INR with a target range of 2 to 3 is preferable over an INR with a target range >3, and when anticoagulation has been tested against aspirin, an INR of 2 to 3 is a typical range to be used as a comparison arm. Limited evidence also notes that in a small (N=20) RCT comparing a single-antiplatelet arm versus a triple-therapy arm (dual antiplatelets plus anticoagulation), participants with single antiplatelets had a higher risk of recurrent stroke (log-rank test, P=0.026) with similar rates of hemorrhage during a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, and the clinical consensus favors using only anticoagulation.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome [^9d64113d]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome causes venous, arterial, and small-vessel thrombosis; pregnancy loss; and preterm delivery for patients with severe pre-eclampsia or placental insufficiency. Other clinical manifestations are cardiac valvular disease, renal thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, and cognitive impairment. Antiphospholipid antibodies promote activation of endothelial cells, monocytes, and platelets; and overproduction of tissue factor and thromboxane A2. Complement activation might have a central pathogenetic role. Of the different antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant is the strongest predictor of features related to antiphospholipid syndrome. Therapy of thrombosis is based on long-term oral anticoagulation and patients with arterial events should be treated aggressively. Primary thromboprophylaxis is recommended in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and probably in purely obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome. Obstetric care is based on combined medical-obstetric high-risk management and treatment with aspirin and heparin. Hydroxychloroquine is a potential additional treatment for this syndrome. Possible future therapies for non-pregnant patients with antiphospholipid syndrome are statins, rituximab, and new anticoagulant drugs.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^5d1c8b74]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Primary prevention of stroke—antiphospholipid syndrome/systemic lupus erythematosus: Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus without a history of stroke or unprovoked venous thromboembolism to prevent stroke, and patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who have had a prior unprovoked venous thrombosis likely benefit from vitamin K antagonist therapy (target international normalized ratio, 2–3) over direct oral anticoagulants.

### Management of thrombotic and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^41c85039]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease characterised by recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity in association with persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs).The major goal of the management of APS is the prevention of first or recurrent thrombotic or obstetric complications. Oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is the cornerstone of the treatment of thrombotic APS; however, several aspects of its use such as the intensity of treatment, and the efficacy and safety of alternative treatments, remain controversial. Additionally, although combination treatment with low-dose aspirin (LDA) and heparin has been commonly used in pregnant women with recurrent pregnancy losses and those with prior thrombotic APS, use of this combination in different clinical expressions of obstetric APS is still debated.

Here, we report the results of the systematic literature review (SLR) that informed the ‘EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults’,focused on primary and secondary prevention of thrombotic APS and the management of obstetric APS. We do not include here studies of thrombotic risk stratification and modification, because these informed the overarching principles, and studies of catastrophic APS, because these focused on precipitating factors.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome management: a 2023 update and practical algorithm-based approach [^7c076f79]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired thrombo-inflammatory disease that has morbid and sometimes devastating effects on patients and their families. This review will discuss the most recent international societal treatment guidelines and propose practical management algorithms for various APS sub-types.

Recent Findings

APS represents a disease spectrum. Although thrombosis and pregnancy morbidities are traditional hallmarks of APS, a variety of extra-criteria clinical phenotypes can often be seen, which makes clinical management more challenging. Primary APS thrombosis prophylaxis should take a risk-stratified approach. Although vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or heparin/low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) remain the preferred treatment for secondary APS thrombosis prophylaxis, some international society guidelines support the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in certain circumstances. Careful monitoring and individualized obstetric care with the use of aspirin and heparin/LMWH will improve pregnancy outcomes among pregnant individuals with APS. Treatment of microvascular and catastrophic APS remains challenging. While the addition of various immunosuppressive agents is often utilized, further systemic evaluations of their use are warranted before definitive recommendations can be made. Several new therapeutic strategies are on the horizon that might enable more personalized and targeted APS management in the near future.

Summary

Although the knowledge of APS pathogenesis has grown in recent years, the management principles and strategies are largely unchanged. There is an unmet need for evaluating pharmacological agents, beyond anticoagulants, that target diverse thromboinflammatory pathways.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^64b02c65]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome secondary prevention—direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): In an open-label, noninferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT), “rivaroxaban was associated with higher risk of thrombotic events,” and “a similar result in favor of VKA over rivaroxaban was reported in an open-label RCT of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.” Observational data “also suggest a high risk of recurrent thrombosis among patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who receive DOACs,” and the guideline states “we do not recommend the use of DOACs in general and, specifically, rivaroxaban for antiphospholipid syndrome.” There is also “a knowledge gap with respect to the role of dual antiplatelets in antiphospholipid syndrome,” and “the absence of definitive data prevents us from providing a stronger recommendation at this point.”

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid syndrome [^a475f8ee]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are therapeutic alternatives to warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and constitute the standard of care for many indications. VKAs constitute the conventional therapy for the treatment and secondary thromboprophylaxis of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), but are often problematic, owing to the variable sensitivity of thromboplastins to lupus anticoagulant. Thus, the International Normalized Ratio may not accurately reflect anticoagulation intensity, or be clinically effective. Definition of the current role of DOACs in the treatment of APS is based on limited clinical trial data and information from other sources, including manufacturers' data, case series or cohort studies, and expert consensus. The Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (RAPS) randomized controlled trial (RCT), which had a laboratory surrogate primary outcome measure, suggests that rivaroxaban has the potential to be an effective and convenient alternative to warfarin in thrombotic APS patients with a single venous thromboembolism event requiring standard-intensity anticoagulation. However, further studies, in particular to provide better long-term efficacy and safety data, are needed before it can be widely recommended. APS patients are clinically heterogeneous, with the risk of recurrent thrombosis and the intensity of anticoagulation being influenced by their clinical phenotype and risk profile. DOAC trials involving homogeneous thrombotic APS populations, with the antiphospholipid antibody status well defined, will help to optimize the appropriate treatment in APS patient subgroups. Ongoing and emerging DOAC RCTs should provide further information to guide the use of DOACs in APS patients. Optimal identification of APS patients is a key step in working towards improved therapeutic strategies in these individuals.

### Anticoagulating patients with high-risk acquired thrombophilias [^0aacb9d3]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria are 3 acquired thrombophilias that carry a high risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism. Management of these conditions has largely included anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist after an initial period of a parenteral anticoagulant, for as long as the thrombotic risk is still present. The available evidence for the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is limited and primarily consists of case series and cohort studies, which are summarized in this chapter. Randomized trials evaluating DOACs in patients with APS are reviewed. Further research is needed prior to widely adopting DOACs for use in these high-risk acquired thrombophilias; however, there may be selected low-risk subgroups where DOAC use is possible after careful consideration and patient discussion.

### Moyamoya syndrome with intraventricular hemorrhage in an adult with factor V Leiden mutation (...) [^cc0bb86e]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Objective To report a case of proximal occlusion of 2 major cerebral vessels associated with moyamoya network circulation that manifested by spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage. Design Case report. Patient and Results. A 36-year-old Syrian man presented with symptoms of sudden-onset headache, neck stiffness, and confusion. The computed tomography scan of his brain showed intraventricular bleeding, and the subsequent 4 vessel angiographies revealed occlusion of the left middle and anterior cerebral arteries with moyamoya appearance in the terminal branches. The coagulation profile showed the presence of heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. The patient was treated conservatively until resolution of his blood clot, and later he was started on oral anticoagulation. Conclusion Factor V Leiden mutation may cause large cerebral vessel occlusion with moyamoya syndrome in adults.

Factor V Leiden mutation that is associated with resistance to activated protein C is a risk marker for venous and arterial thrombosis. 1 Although individuals with factor V Leiden mutation showed a trend toward a higher frequency of central nervous system thrombosis in premature neonates, 2, 3 infants, and children4 as well as in young adults, 5, 6 this complication was not found in older age groups. Furthermore, factor V Leiden mutation may predispose to large brain infarcts. 7 In addition, heterozygosity for factor V Leiden mutation seems to increase the risk of stroke in children by almost 5-fold. 8, 9. Stenotic disease of large cerebral vessels due to atherothrombotic lesion may lead to the development of moyamoya-type collateral circulation and may present as intracerebral hemorrhage.

10 Herein we report a case of large vessel occlusion associated with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation and complicated by moyamoya appearance on cerebral angiographies, manifesting with intraventricular hemorrhage in a middle-age patient. Report of a case A 36-year-old, Syrian, nonhypertensive man was referred to our facility at the American University of Beirut Medical Center for evaluation and further management of an intraventricular hemorrhage. In March 2002, the patient developed sudden onset of severe global headache associated with nausea and projectile vomiting. His past medical illness was negative except for smoking and a positive family history of coronary artery disease. The physical examination upon admission to our hospital 1 week later revealed a low-grade fever and meningeal signs, with confusion and agitation; otherwise, the physical examination findings were normal.

A computed tomography scan of the brain done prior to admission showed an intraventricular hemorrhage involving the lateral and third ventricles. Four vessel cerebral angiographies performed under fluoroscopic control and through a right femoral artery approach showed total occlusion of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries at their proximal portions on the left side. The terminal branches of the occluded vessels were filling from collaterals derived from the posterior circulation and thalamic branches, giving the angiographic appearance of moyamoya vessels. The right anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries were patent. The aortic and extracranial vessels in the neck showed no other stenotic lesions. Computed tomography scan of brain showing the intraventricular hemorrhage. A, Right internal carotid angiogram showing patent anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral vessels.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^b8f5f481]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare disease characterised by venous and/or arterial thrombosis, pregnancy complications and the presence of specific autoantibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies. This review aims to identify existing clinical practice guidelines (CPG) as part of the ERN ReCONNET project, aimed at evaluating existing CPGs or recommendations in rare and complex diseases. Seventeen papers providing important data were identified; however, the literature search highlighted the scarceness of reliable clinical data to develop CPGs. With no formal clinical guidelines in place, diagnosis and treatment of APS is largely based on consensus and expert opinion. Patients’ unmet need refers to the understanding of the disease and its clinical picture and implications, the need of education for patients, family members and healthcare providers, as well as to the development of monitoring pathways involving multiple healthcare providers.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^8161698b]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome after unprovoked venous thrombosis—vitamin K antagonist (VKA) strategy: Recurrence rates without VKA therapy are high, so anticoagulation should be continued lifelong. Higher-intensity warfarin showed no added efficacy over a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2–3; targets of 3 to 4 (versus 2–3) did not add benefit, and high-intensity warfarin was associated with a nonstatistically increased bleeding risk (HR, 2.18 [95% CI, 0.92–5.15]). When compared with aspirin, an INR of 2 to 3 has been shown to be effective.

### Lack of efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^f02146b4]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that the use of DOAC may be considered in some selected cases of APS, such as individuals with a history of a single venous thrombosis or with a low-risk APL antibody profile, but, until now, no studies are available to support this hypothesis.

We found that DOAC therapy is associated with an increased risk of arterial events, particularly stroke, also in “high-risk” APS patients treated for prior venous thrombotic events or miscarriages. Arterial events were also reported in patients with “low-risk” APL antibody profile, but only few patients with these characteristics were included in the studies selected for our meta-analysis, and, thus, no conclusions can be drawn.

Given the high risk of arterial events in APS patients, alternative approaches may be considered in future studies. One of these includes the association of DOAC and low dose aspirin (LDA), for which there are currently insufficient data to provide any recommendation. LDA, in combination with prophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is the standard of treatment during pregnancy for obstetric APSand the use of LDA has been associated with the same risk of first event compared with LDA plus warfarin in primary prevention of patients positive for antiphospholipid antibodies.Few data exist on the association of LDA and warfarin for the secondary prevention of thrombotic events in APS. In a small cohort of patients, this drug combination was associated with increased risk of bleeding and no effect on thrombosis recurrence.Yet, this strategy is recommended by the European Alliance Of Association For Rheumatology guidelines as an option following a first arterial thrombosis or recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis in APS patients.

In conclusion, the use of DOAC as a single therapeutic approach appears to be insufficiently effective in high risk patients with APS, even without a history of arterial thrombosis. Since in patients treated with VKA the risk of thrombosis remains non-negligible,further studies are needed to assess alternative approaches in this setting.

### High intensity anticoagulation in the prevention of the recurrence of arterial thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome:' PROS' and' CONS' [^1b718374]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The use of high intensity anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrence of arterial thrombosis related to the Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is still controversial. This paper reports a debate that took place at the CORA meeting (Controversies in Rheumatology and Autoimmunity), held in Florence in March 2011. Major points of discussion were: 1) the paucity of prospective randomized clinical trials; retrospective studies were the main source supporting the use of high intensity anticoagulation; 2) heterogeneity in antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) definition, due to the lack of standardization of aPL assays and to the failure to distinguish patients with a high risk profile ("triple positive") from those a low risk profile; 3) bleeding is a major concern about high intensity anticoagulation; however, studies are not concordant in reporting an increased risk compared to the standard regimen; 4) practical issues consist of difficulties in keeping a stable PT-INR over 3 and the possibility for interference by aPL on the thromboplastins used for PT-INR measurement. In conclusion, there is currently a lack of consensus on the use of high intensity anticoagulation for the secondary prophylaxis of arterial thrombosis. However, such a treatment may be particularly recommended in those APS patients who have a high risk aPL profile and other concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, provided that the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding.

### Management of thrombotic and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^bf4a4415]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This SLR provides a summary of the evidence that informed the EULAR recommendations for the management of both thrombotic and obstetric APS in adults. Data from meta-analyses and cohort studies showed that LDA is effective as primary thromboprophylaxis treatment in aPL-positive individuals. Use of VKA at INR 2–3 is protective against thrombosis recurrences in patients with venous thrombosis. In patients with prior arterial thrombosis, no difference in the risk of new thrombotic events was found between VKA treatment at INR 2–3 and INR 3–4. According to the currently available data, rivaroxaban should not be used in high-risk patients with APS such as those with triple aPL positivity. For patients with either recurrent miscarriages or fetal loss, use of combination treatment with LDA and heparin is more effective than LDA alone.

The main limitation of this SLR is that it included a few high-quality RCTs, primarily due to the rarity of the syndrome and the heterogeneity of APS subsets. Performing RCTs in obstetric APS is even more difficult because of ethical regulations of research involving pregnant women and the reluctance of patients to be randomised during pregnancy. Existing literature is limited by heterogeneous patient groups that may have different outcomes and, importantly, different responses to treatment, including, for example, patients with high-risk aPL profile compared with those with low-risk aPL profile, and patients with arterial versus venous thrombotic events. Stratifying patients by risk is crucial to avoid overtreatment and risk of bleeding in some patients, or undertreatment and risk of thrombotic recurrences in others. In addition, reporting of side effects needs improvement. Bleeding complications must be reported in all studies in order to judge the risks of treatment. In obstetric APS studies, maternal thrombosis during pregnancy or post partum is also important and not only pregnancy outcomes.

### Insights into the 2023 ACR / EULAR antiphospholipid syndrome classification criteria: findings from a cohort of 205 patients with primary APS [^0d1dcee4]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Excluding patients who were positive for IgM isotype alone and those with antibody levels lower than 40 units, we showed that 16.6% of our PAPS patients defined according to Sydney classification criteria would not be classified as PAPS. In clinical practice, where classification criteria might inappropriately be used as diagnostic criteria, especially in non-dedicated settings, this might result in the lack of antithrombotic therapy administration. As we know that the quality of life of PAPS patients has significantly improved as a result of an early diagnosis and effective treatment, some concerns regarding these recently updated criteria arise, which are due to the analysis of data performed in our real-life experience. The recurrence of thrombotic events in our patients with isolated IgM aPL isotype and in those with aPL titers below the cut-off of 40 units, with a similar proportion of thrombotic relapses in these patients and in those classified as PAPS by the ACR/EULAR classification criteria, strengthens our perspective. Furthermore, the low prevalence of high-risk factors for venous and arterial events suggests that the presence of traditional cardiovascular and VTE risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, were not the primary drivers of thrombotic events and recurrences of thrombosis in our cohort and underscores the predominant role of aPL in the development of the thrombotic events, both in patients who were and were not classified according to the new classification criteria.

Interestingly, we did not observe a significant difference in the type of first thrombotic event (venous or arterial) between classified and unclassified patients, nor differences were observed between patients who developed or not a thrombotic recurrence during the follow-up, confirming the difficulty in stratifying the risk in PAPS patients.

In this regard, it is important to underline that unclassified patients more frequently had additional cardiovascular risk factors other than aPL. Thrombotic events in our cohort were carefully evaluated at the time of occurrence by experienced clinicians with significant expertise in the management of PAPS. These clinicians conducted a thorough clinical assessment to attribute the thrombotic events to APS or other potential contributing factors, such as uncontrolled comorbidities. This evaluation process ensured that each event was appropriately classified, taking into account the full clinical context, including the presence or absence of CV risk factors. This applies also to patients exhibiting a low aPL profile (as per the new APS classification criteria), where the decision to attribute new thrombotic events to relapsing APS was based on a comprehensive clinical evaluation rather than a single factor.

### Therapy with direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention of thromboembolic events in the antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^e3a2eb80]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The results might partly be biased by the heterogeneity regarding thrombosis history and autoantibody profile in the trial populations, for example, patients in Goldhaber et al and RAPShad a history of only VT and unknown antibody profile, whereas patients in the TRAPS trialhad previous VT or AT and were triple aPL positive. In the as-treated analysis of thrombotic events in Woller et al,after excluding patients with a history of AT, the rate of events in the DOAC arm was one-third of the ITT analysis. Through subgroup analyses, we found the risk of thrombosis in patients with a history of AT to be twice as high as those with a history of VT, but with reservations that some patients had a history of both AT and VT. In short, this might indicate a potential role of DOACs in selected populations with APS, and the choice of treatment may be stratified according to aPL profile and/or whether the thromboembolic history included venous or arterial events.

The follow-up time in the included studies varies from 7 months in RAPS and Goldhaber et al to 36 months in Ordi-Ros et al, the latter reporting the highest number of thromboembolic events and bleeding events. Indeed, the APS ACTION registry showed that even though higher than the general population, incident thrombotic events in APS are rare, 2.09 events per 100 patient-years based on almost 4000 patient-years of follow-up.Hence, more events might potentially have been observed in the other trials, if patients had been followed for a longer period of time.

Due to the limited number of available publications in this area, it is not surprising that a core outcome set has not yet been developed. Nevertheless, the major core outcomes were measured in all five included studies. Inspired by table 2, we suggest the following three tiers of outcome measurements for future trials: tier 1 core outcomes: new thrombotic event (venous/arterial/microvascular), bleeding (clinically relevant, major/minor), all-cause death and cardiovascular death. Tier 2 consideration for most trials: quality of life/patient satisfaction, anatomical location of thrombotic event, anatomical location of bleeding event, compliance, catastrophic APS. Tier 3 consideration for some trials: time in therapeutic range for VKA, significant decrease in haemoglobin level, need for blood transfusion.

### Management of thrombotic and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^c8fb210d]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Non-pregnant women with a history of obstetric APS only (no prior thrombotic events), with or without SLE

In five studiesincluded in a meta-analysisthat reported on primary prevention with LDA among women with a history of obstetric APS, use of LDA was associated with a lower risk of thrombosis (table 1). In two primary studies,patients with SLE comprised 24% and 27% of patients, and a third studyreported 38% of women had secondary APS, so the results mainly pertain to women without SLE. Methodological quality of the primary studies was judged to be adequate overall. Indirect evidence was provided by a retrospective study of 370 patients with aPL, 57% of whom had obstetric APS.Long-term treatment with LDA in 130 patients (nine also with oral anticoagulation) was associated with a lower risk of first thrombosis (5.7% vs 9.5%), although the treatment results were not specific to the subset of women with past obstetric APS. Losses to follow-up were not reported in this study (table 1). Three studiesreported outcomes of treatment with LDA without a comparison treatment arm (online supplementary table 1).

### Recognition and management of antiphospholipid syndrome [^e95557fc]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article summarizes the recent developments in the recognition and management of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

Recent Findings

Five Task Forces, created as part of the 14th International Congress on antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), published their systematic reviews. 'For the recognition of APS': the assessment of aPL profile is crucial for risk stratification; lupus anticoagulant positivity, especially in the context of 'triple aPL positivity' displays the highest risk; a panel of criteria and noncriteria aPL tests may help better risk-stratify the aPL-positive in the future. 'For the management of APS': direct oral anticoagulants are not currently recommended; statins ameliorate the proinflammator/thrombotic markers, whereas hydroxychloroquine reduces the risk of thrombosis in experimental models and lupus patients, which justify their use as an adjunctive treatment in refractory cases; B-cell inhibition may have a role in difficult-to-treat patients with hematologic and microthrombotic/angiopathic manifestations; and complement and mammalian targets of rapamycin complex pathway inhibition are promising targets in APS.

Summary

Warfarin, heparin, and/or antiplatelet drugs are the standard of care for aPL-positive patients. Recent studies suggest novel approaches that target new coagulation and immunomodulatory pathways; mechanistic and/or controlled clinical studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these novel approaches.

### Management of thrombotic and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^29ba0d55]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations of previous SLRs on thrombotic APS included mixed populations and the lack of separate analysis of outcomes for venous and arterial thrombosis.In obstetric APS, SLRs have pooled data from different patient groups such as women with aPL only and women with definite APS.In two Cochrane reviews, data on different obstetric APS subgroups were not reported separately, and data from studies of women with only one aPL measurement or only one miscarriage were included, respectively.

One of the strengths of this SLR is that it included the most common and important questions impacting patient care. An additional strength of the SLR was the methodological rigour of the process we followed. The full-text review, the data abstraction and risk of bias assessments were independently performed by multiple reviewers (physicians in charge for literature search (LA, ML), convenor (MGGT) and methodologist (MMW)). In addition, a detailed presentation of the results from both direct and indirect comparison studies in the tables can help the readers of the SLR (clinicians and researchers) to better interpret the separately published EULAR recommendations for the management of APS in adults.

### Therapy with direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention of thromboembolic events in the antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^051c3bc2]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterised by venous thrombosis (VT) or arterial thrombosis (AT) and/or pregnancy morbidity in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. The aPL include lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody or anti-β2 glycoprotein I IgG or IgM antibodies.APS occurs as a primary condition, or secondary in the presence of, for example, SLE.Evidence suggests that the aPL profile is prognostic, and triple positivity increases the risk of thromboembolic events.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recommends for secondary prophylaxis of thrombosis APS ‘treatment with VKAs (vitamin K antagonists) with INR (internationalised normalised ratio) 2–3 or INR 3–4’ considering the individual’s risk of bleeding and recurrent thrombosis. Treatment with VKA with INR 2–3 plus low-dose aspirin may also be considered.

The pharmacodynamics of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are inhibition of either factor IIa (thrombin; for example, dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban, edoxaban or apixaban). DOACs are easy to use with simple dosing, anticoagulation monitoring is not indicated and drug plasma levels should not be followed. However, dosage should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal or liver function.

### Recurrent thrombosis with direct oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^de0058e1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The treatment of thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) usually requires long-term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. The effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in APS has not been fully addressed. The purpose of this research was to analyze the efficacy (thrombotic event-free time) and tolerability (bleeding events) of DOACs in patients with APS.

Methods

We performed a descriptive analysis of a systematic review of data from patients with APS treated with DOACs reported in the literature, via EMBASE, PubMed, and the European League Against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology congresses. After systematic review, a meta-analysis of data from clinical trials was performed.

Findings

A total of 728 patients, accounting for 731 courses of treatment with DOACs, were identified. The majority (48.3%) presented with triple anti-phospholipid antibody positivity. The prevalence of thrombosis during DOAC treatment was 13.9%. Analysis of risk factors for recurrent thrombosis suggested that a higher mean (SD) number of prior thrombotic events (1.80 [0.87] vs 1.67 [1.45]; P = 0.012), history of combined arterial and venous thrombosis (27.3% vs 9.2% [P < 0.0001]; odds ratio [OR] = 3.72 [95% CI, 1.91-7.25]), previous treatment with LMWH (9.8% vs 1.1% [P = 0.04]; OR = 9.95 [95% CI, 1.08-91.97]), use of immunosuppressant treatment (41.7% vs 12.7% [P = 0.03]; OR = 4.9 [95% CI, 1.21-19.76]), and no reason to switch anticoagulant treatment other than patient's decision (32% vs 2.8% [P = 0.001]; OR = 16.24 [95% CI, 3.16-83.52]) were associated with a high risk for re-thrombosis. Meta-Analysis did not show statistically relevant difference in risk of thrombosis or bleeding comparing warfarin with DOACs.

Implications

The findings from this systematic literature review and meta-analysis suggest that patients treated with DOACs and having risk factors such as history of recurrent thrombosis, a history of combined arterial and venous thrombosis, or a need for immunosuppressant treatment, may have higer ratio of thrombotic recurrence. There are limited data to inform decisions on the use of DOACs in patients with APS with different or no risk factors.

### Increased risk of thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants. results from an international patient-level data meta-analysis [^47d7400d]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are widely used for secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) but their clinical efficacy and safety are not established in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) patients. There is only one randomized controlled trial published while others are still ongoing. Many non-randomized studies have been published in this field with conflicting opinions.

Purpose Of Review

We conducted a systematic review using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from 2000 until March 2018 regarding APS patients treated with DOACs. We performed a patient-level data meta-analysis to a) estimate the prevalence of recurrent thrombosis in APS patients treated with DOACs in the literature, and b) identify variables associated with recurrent thrombosis.

Results

We identified 47 studies corresponding to 447 APS patients treated with DOACs. Three commercially available DOACs were analyzed: rivaroxaban (n = 290), dabigatran etexilate (n = 144) and apixaban (n = 13). A total of 73 out of 447 patients (16%) experienced a recurrent thrombosis while on DOACs with a mean duration until thrombosis of 12.5 months. Rates of recurrent thromboses were 16.9% and 15% in APS patients receiving either anti-Xa inhibitors or dabigatran respectively. Triple positivity (positivity for all three antiphospholipid antibodies) was associated with a four-fold increased risk of recurrent thrombosis (56% vs 23%; OR = 4.3 [95%CI; 2.3-7.7], p < 0.0001) as well as a higher number of clinical criteria for APS classification. In patients treated with anti-Xa inhibitors, history of arterial thrombosis was associated with a higher risk of recurrent thrombosis (32% vs 14%; OR = 2.8 [95%CI; 1.4-5.7], p = 0.006). In conclusion, DOACs are not effective in all APS patients and should not be used routinely in these patients. Randomized controlled trials assessing clinical efficacy and safety as primary endpoints are underway. In the meantime, a registry of APS patients on DOACs could be proposed to establish in which APS subgroups DOACs would be a safe alternative to warfarin.

### How I treat anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome [^91735e88]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

The standard treatment of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is lifelong oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), generally warfarin. A minority of patients with APS rethrombose despite seemingly adequate anticoagulation. These patients are deemed anticoagulant refractory. The management of anticoagulant-refractory APS is largely empirical and extrapolated from other clinically similar situations. Further options include increased VKA anticoagulation intensity or alternative antithrombotic strategies, including low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, the addition of antiplatelet therapy, and consideration of vascular options. Patients with anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic APS may have APS-associated thrombocytopenia, which necessitates balancing the risk of recurrent thrombosis vs bleeding to achieve adequate anticoagulation. The multiple mechanisms involved in the generation of the thrombotic phenotype in APS suggest that anticoagulation alone may not control thrombosis. Thus, other modalities, including adjunctive treatment (hydroxychloroquine, statins, and vitamin D) for APS-related thrombosis, merit consideration, as do immunomodulatory therapy and complement inhibition. Patients with APS may have coexistent systemic lupus erythematosus, which adds to the complexity of managing their thromboembolic disease. However, with attention to detail and judicious application of the limited data, it is possible to minimize the morbidity resulting from anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic APS. Multicenter studies are required to guide the sequence of interventions and their comparative efficacy in patients with anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic APS.

This is the best evidence available and until more robust evidence is published, physicians need to choose which drug benefits the most their patients based on this reality.

Currently, two more RCTs are ongoing: ASTRO-APS (apixaban for secondary prevention of TE among patients with APS) and RISAPS (rivaroxaban for patients who had stroke with APS, with or without SLE, follows the results of RAPS trial,with estimated completion dates for 2021 and 2023, respectively. The ASTRO-APS will include only a strict set of patients with APS with history of venous TE. In this study, patients with previous arterial thrombosis were excluded as these events may be a marker of higher thrombogenicity, recurrent events and potential DOACs treatment non-response.The RISAPS trial aims to study higher intensity anticoagulation with rivaroxaban (15 mg, two times a day, a dose recommended for the acute treatment of VTE) and warfarin (target INR 3.5)—these being the novelties of this study.

Notwithstanding our data, the ongoing trials, despite the existing differences in the population (stricter in ATRO-APS), will inform more robustly about the possible class effect of DOACs in APS. The need of further trials depends on these results.

In conclusion, our review suggests that DOACs use, particularly rivaroxaban, among patients with APS, appears to be less effective than VKA, since it is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events. In fact, some authorsreport patients, mostly triple-positive, who experienced catastrophic APS—microthromboses involving at least three organs within a week—after rivaroxaban introduction. Despite our results advising against DOACs, particularly rivaroxaban, judgements concerning other DOACs should be more watchful considering the ongoing trials, namely ASTRO-APS, that might provide additional data on this regard and consequently change the present approach to this class of drugs in patients with APS.

In the case of low-quality therapy with warfarin or recurrent thrombosis, two possible therapeutic approaches could be considered. The first is to adopt a higher intensity warfarin therapy with target INR 3-4, which is, however, not current practice given its association with a reduced risk of thrombosis in the majority of patients. A second approach is represented by the addition of LDA to anticoagulation, which should, however, be reserved for high-risk patients, particularly after an arterial thrombotic event.

More recently, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have been investigated in patients with APS with divergent results.Following the results from the Trial on Rivaroxaban in AntiPhospholipid Syndrome (TRAPS),which included triple positive thrombotic APS, rivaroxaban is contraindicated in APS patients with triple aPL positivity.An analysis from the RE-COVER/RE-COVER II and RE-MEDY trials showed similar safety and efficacy of dabigatran in patients with thrombophilia and previous venous thromboembolic events, in whom APS represented the second most common inherited disorders, accounting for 20% of all patients.These results need to be confirmed in real-world studies. A randomized trial investigating the efficacy and safety of apixaban in APS patients is currently ongoing;this study will include patients with both venous and arterial thrombosis. Laboratory testing of NOAC may be useful in patients with APS as no pre-clinical data in this patient population are available.

Recently, new drugs have been administered in APS patients with thrombotic events. A first example is represented by mTOR inhibitors; these were found to reduce the onset of new vascular lesions after transplantation in patients with APS nephropathy.Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab(anti-CD20 agent) and eculizumab(anti-C5 agent) are currently administrated to manage non-criteria symptoms refractory to standard therapy and to add-on in catastrophic APS and kidney transplantation in APS patients, respectively. Despite these findings, the use of these drugs should be avoided due to lack of strong evidence in APS patients; their use could be considered in patients with refractory C-APS, as suggested by EULAR guidelines.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (acquired thrombophilia)

The following list of risk factors for APS can be used to determine when a diagnosis should be considered and investigated (box 1).

Box 1 
Risk factors for antiphospholipid syndrome

History of systemic lupus erythematosus or another autoimmune disease.
Presence of livedo reticularis.
Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time prior to starting anticoagulation.
Recurrent thrombosis.
Venous thromboembolism at unusual sites.
History of arterial thrombosis without clear risk factors.
Thrombocytopaenia.
Recurrent miscarriages, stillbirth and/or severe pre-eclampsia.
Cardiac valve abnormalities in the absence of other explanations.

A diagnosis of APS is given if patients meet at least one clinical criteria and at least one laboratory criteria from the Sapporo classification of APS (box 2).Laboratory testing should only be conducted if the clinical criteria are met.It should be noted that, while all anticoagulants interfere with clotting assays, lupus anticoagulant testing is particularly prone to high rates of false positives in patients treated with VKAs and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)and also if tested at the time of the acute VTE.

Box 2 
Clinical and laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome

The 2023 American College of Rheumatology/EULAR (European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology) classification criteria for APS were designed as highly specific criteria for use in observational studies and trials and, as such, have higher specificity (but lower sensitivity) than the Sapporo classification criteria.
