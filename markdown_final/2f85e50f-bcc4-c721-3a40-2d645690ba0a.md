## Question

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) medications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic class and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the strength and certainty of evidence for efficacy in major depressive disorder. Next, I will examine dose-response and tolerability, followed by comparative effectiveness versus SSRIs. After that, I need to review off-label indications like neuropathic pain, headache prevention, and functional GI disorders. I will then assess safety, overdose management, and special populations, and finally synthesize practical prescribing principles and a bottom-line clinical recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic class and mechanism. TCAs are nonselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors that primarily block norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake, while also exerting anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-adrenergic antagonism, which explains many adverse effects and overdose toxicities, including sodium channel blockade in the heart [^295b5daf] [^823fb9a5].

> I will now examine efficacy in major depressive disorder. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and certainty of benefit. A 2024 high-credibility systematic review and meta-analysis of 103 trials including 10,590 adults found a mean reduction of 3.77 HDRS-17 points versus placebo, exceeding the predefined minimal important difference of 3 points, but with high risk of bias across trials and very low to low certainty of evidence, so the clinical significance remains uncertain despite statistical significance [^77d1afa4] [^8ffe9962]. Earlier, a Cochrane review of low-dose TCAs showed response rates around 1.65 times placebo at 4 weeks and 1.47 times placebo at 6–8 weeks, supporting efficacy at lower doses, though again with methodological limitations [^f8ae6a69] [^a60b44d0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose-response. I should double-check whether higher doses improve outcomes. A 2022 meta-analysis of randomized dose comparisons found no consistent dose-response gradient across studies, with only isolated contrasts showing superiority at very high doses, and higher doses were associated with more adverse effects, suggesting that escalation should be cautious and individualized rather than assumed beneficial [^3c02b89c]. This aligns with the low-dose efficacy signal seen in earlier reviews and supports starting low and going slow in practice [^f8ae6a69].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness versus SSRIs. Head-to-head meta-analyses show no overall difference in response between TCAs and SSRIs, indicating similar efficacy on average, though TCAs generally have poorer tolerability and more adverse effects, which often drives discontinuation [^83ea9b0e] [^0f06d4c9]. But wait, what if amitriptyline is an exception? Some analyses suggest amitriptyline may have a small efficacy edge over comparators, offset by higher side-effect burden, reinforcing that drug choice should balance benefit, tolerability, and patient preference rather than assume class superiority [^0f06d4c9] [^8f1bdcdb].

> I need to check off-label indications where TCAs remain clinically relevant. For neuropathic pain, multiple systematic reviews and overviews conclude TCAs are effective, with an NNT around 3–4 for moderate pain relief, and amitriptyline has the most robust evidence, though SSRIs are less effective and SNRIs like venlafaxine also show benefit [^083fea14] [^d2e07af1] [^afd252c9]. For headache prevention, meta-analyses show TCAs reduce frequency and intensity of tension-type and migraine headaches, with effects increasing over time and superiority to SSRIs in some comparisons, though adverse effects are more common and dose optimization remains uncertain [^52736ff3] [^392ee0ab] [^611faa12]. For irritable bowel syndrome, ACG guidelines support TCAs for global symptom improvement in IBS, particularly for diarrhea-predominant symptoms and abdominal pain, reflecting neuromodulatory effects [^d20b69e0]. For insomnia, low-dose doxepin has moderate-quality evidence for improved sleep quality and duration, though long-term safety data are limited and amitriptyline evidence is sparse in this context [^a09ba34c].

> Now, I should review safety and tolerability carefully. TCAs have a narrow therapeutic index and meaningful toxicity risk even at therapeutic doses in susceptible patients, including orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, and cardiac conduction effects, with particular caution in older adults and those with cardiovascular disease [^9f9244c3] [^898c9d38]. I should confirm overdose risk: significant toxicity can occur around 5 mg/kg depending on the agent, with QRS widening and arrhythmias as key markers of severity; emergency management hinges on airway protection, sodium bicarbonate for cardiotoxicity, benzodiazepines for seizures, and vasopressors for refractory hypotension, with epinephrine favored by some guidelines and lipid emulsion as rescue in refractory cases [^5ccb6696] [^823fb9a5] [^56dd28ff] [^515257d8]. Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interactions: CYP2D6 inhibition and serotonergic combinations increase toxicity risk, and pharmacogenetic-guided dosing can accelerate attainment of therapeutic plasma levels and may reduce adverse effects, though replication is needed [^152cb555] [^5ccb6696].

> Let me consider special populations. In older adults, TCAs are on Beers due to anticholinergic burden, orthostatic hypotension, and fall risk; if used, secondary amines like nortriptyline are preferred at low doses with ECG screening when indicated, and SSRIs or bupropion are often safer alternatives to discuss [^898c9d38] [^2a90ed18]. In pregnancy, data are limited and risk–benefit discussions should weigh maternal depression severity and alternatives. In pediatrics, TCAs are not effective for pediatric depression and carry higher adverse effect rates, so SSRIs are first-line when pharmacotherapy is indicated, with close monitoring for suicidality [^3a33acd2]. For patients with cardiovascular disease, therapeutic doses are generally safe if carefully selected and monitored, but overdose risk and conduction effects necessitate conservative dosing and patient education [^9f9244c3].

> I should double-check practical prescribing principles. Start low, titrate slowly, and monitor for anticholinergic effects, orthostasis, and cardiac symptoms. Consider baseline ECG in patients over 50 or with cardiac risk factors. Limit quantities in patients at suicide risk. And reassess adherence and adverse effects frequently, as real-world adherence is often suboptimal and underreported [^f9f6bbf2] [^5be737ce] [^32d22434]. For neuropathic pain and headache prevention, typical effective doses are often lower than for depression, which can mitigate adverse effects while preserving benefit, though individual titration is essential [^d2e07af1] [^52736ff3].

> But wait, what about long-term outcomes and withdrawal? I need to ensure we acknowledge gaps. Most TCA trials are 6–12 weeks with high risk of bias, so durability, relapse prevention, and withdrawal syndromes remain inadequately characterized; abrupt discontinuation can precipitate withdrawal, and long-term adverse effect profiles, including metabolic and cardiac effects, warrant cautious, indication-specific use with periodic reassessment of risk–benefit [^77d1afa4] [^5ccb6696].

> Let me synthesize a bottom line. TCAs remain effective options for major depressive disorder, particularly melancholic or treatment-resistant presentations, with a likely clinically meaningful short-term benefit but a less favorable tolerability profile than SSRIs. They are especially valuable for neuropathic pain, headache prevention, and select functional GI disorders, where benefits can outweigh harms when dosed thoughtfully and monitored closely [^48229380] [^083fea14] [^52736ff3] [^d20b69e0]. Given narrow therapeutic index and overdose risk, use the lowest effective dose, avoid in high-risk patients when alternatives suffice, and employ ECG screening and suicide risk mitigation as indicated. In older adults, prioritize non-TCA options when possible, and if a TCA is necessary, choose a secondary amine and start conservatively [^5be737ce] [^898c9d38] [^2a90ed18].

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are **effective for major depression** [^48229380] and neuropathic pain [^083fea14], but are **limited by anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects** [^9f9244c3] and overdose risk [^823fb9a5]. They are generally reserved for **second-line or adjunctive use**, with SSRIs/SNRIs preferred first-line due to better tolerability [^44bf5987]. TCAs require **careful dosing, ECG monitoring in at-risk patients** [^f9f6bbf2], and vigilance for drug interactions and overdose toxicity [^5ccb6696].

---

## Mechanism of action

TCAs **primarily inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake**, increasing synaptic levels and enhancing neurotransmission [^50e5ae90]. They also block muscarinic, histamine H1, and alpha-adrenergic receptors, contributing to anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects [^a5d80ec3].

---

## Clinical indications

TCAs are indicated for:

- **Major depressive disorder (MDD)**: Effective, especially for melancholic or treatment-resistant depression [^77d1afa4] [^075bdecd].
- **Neuropathic pain**: Particularly amitriptyline and nortriptyline [^083fea14] [^d2e07af1].
- **Chronic pain syndromes**: Including fibromyalgia and chronic low back pain [^f9f6bbf2].
- **Migraine and tension-type headache prophylaxis**: Effective in reducing frequency and severity [^52736ff3] [^392ee0ab].
- **Insomnia**: Low-dose doxepin is FDA-approved for insomnia [^a09ba34c].

---

## Efficacy

TCAs are **effective for MDD** [^48229380], with meta-analyses showing significant symptom reduction versus placebo [^8ffe9962]. They are also **effective for neuropathic pain** [^083fea14] and headache prevention [^52736ff3], with NNTs around 2–3 for pain relief [^d2e07af1].

---

## Safety and tolerability

TCAs have a **less favorable tolerability profile** than newer antidepressants [^0f06d4c9]:

- **Anticholinergic effects**: Dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, cognitive impairment [^f0999767].
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, QT prolongation, arrhythmias [^9f9244c3].
- **Sedation and weight gain**: Common, especially with tertiary amines (e.g. amitriptyline) [^3a24f58f].
- **Overdose risk**: Narrow therapeutic index; significant toxicity at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg, including seizures, arrhythmias, and coma [^b14b905b] [^823fb9a5].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **recent myocardial infarction**, arrhythmias, severe cardiovascular disease, narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, and concurrent MAOI use. Precautions include **use in elderly patients** (increased fall risk, cognitive impairment) [^898c9d38], patients with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, or hepatic impairment, and during pregnancy and lactation.

---

## Drug interactions

TCAs have **significant interactions**:

- **CYP450 inhibitors**: Fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, cimetidine increase TCA levels and toxicity risk.
- **MAOIs**: Risk of serotonin syndrome and severe cardiovascular reactions.
- **Sympathomimetics**: Increased risk of arrhythmias and hypertension.
- **Anticholinergic drugs**: Additive anticholinergic effects [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend TCAs as **second-line or adjunctive therapy** for MDD, particularly in treatment-resistant cases or when SSRIs/SNRIs are ineffective or contraindicated [^77d1afa4]. They are **first-line for neuropathic pain** [^083fea14] and headache prophylaxis [^52736ff3]. Careful monitoring, including ECG in patients with cardiac risk factors, is advised [^f9f6bbf2].

---

## Patient counseling

Patients should be counseled on:

- **Adherence**: Importance of consistent dosing and gradual tapering to avoid withdrawal [^notfound].
- **Side effects**: Common anticholinergic and cardiovascular effects [^f0999767].
- **Overdose risk**: Immediate medical attention for overdose; keep medications secure [^b14b905b].
- **Alcohol and drug interactions**: Avoid alcohol and inform clinicians of all medications and supplements [^notfound].

---

Tricyclic antidepressants remain **valuable for select indications**, especially neuropathic pain and treatment-resistant depression, but require **careful patient selection, dosing, and monitoring** due to side effects and overdose risk [^083fea14] [^48229380] [^5be737ce].

### Low dosage tricyclic antidepressants for depression [^a60b44d0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Tricyclic antidepressants are still extensively prescribed worldwide. Evidence for the recommended dosage of tricyclics, however, is poor.

Objectives

To compare the effects and side effects of low dosage tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and with standard dosage tricyclics in acute phase treatment of depression.

Search Strategy

Electronic search of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), incorporating results of group searches of MEDLINE (1966-), EMBASE (1980-), CINAHL (1982-), PsycLIT (1974-), PSYNDEX (1977-) and LILACS (1982–1999) and hand searches of major psychiatric and medical journals. Reference search and SciSearch of the identified studies. Personal contact with authors of significant papers.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials 1) comparing low dosage TCA (= < 100 mg/d on average at the end of trial) with placebo or 2) comparing low and standard dosages of the same TCA, in acute phase treatment of depressive disorder

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers examined eligibility of the identified studies, and extracted data for outcomes at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6–8 weeks and later. Main outcome measures were relative risk of response in depression (random effects model), according to the original authors' definition but usually defined as 50% or greater reduction in severity of depression according to the last-observation-carried-forward intention-to-treat method, and relative risks of overall dropouts and dropouts due to side effects. Other outcome measures included worst-case-scenario intention-to-treat analysis of response as defined above (in which dropouts were considered non-responders in the active treatment group and as responders in the comparison group), and standardised weighted mean scores of continuous depression severity scales (usually calculated by last-observation-carried-forward method).

Main Results

35 studies (2013 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with placebo, and six studies (551 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with standard dosage tricyclics. Low dosage tricyclics, mostly between 75 and 100 mg/day, were 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.0) and 1.47 (1.12 to 1.94) times more likely than placebo to bring about response at 4 weeks and 6–8 weeks, respectively. Standard dosage tricyclics failed, however, to bring about more response but produced more dropouts due to side effects than low dosage tricyclics.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Treatment of depression in adults with low dose tricyclics is justified. However, more rigorous studies are needed to definitively establish the relative benefits and harms of varying dosages.

### Biomarkers as predictors of treatment response to tricyclic antidepressants in major depressive disorder: a systematic review [^d8ef8006]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are frequently prescribed in case of non-response to first-line antidepressants in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Treatment of MDD often entails a trial-and-error process of finding a suitable antidepressant and its appropriate dose. Nowadays, a shift is seen towards a more personalized treatment strategy in MDD to increase treatment efficacy. One of these strategies involves the use of biomarkers for the prediction of antidepressant treatment response. We aimed to summarize biomarkers for prediction of TCA specific (i.e. per agent, not for the TCA as a drug class) treatment response in unipolar nonpsychotic MDD. We performed a systematic search in PubMed and MEDLINE. After full-text screening, 36 papers were included. Seven genetic biomarkers were identified for nortriptyline treatment response. For desipramine, we identified two biomarkers; one genetic and one nongenetic. Three nongenetic biomarkers were identified for imipramine. None of these biomarkers were replicated. Quality assessment demonstrated that biomarker studies vary in endpoint definitions and frequently lack power calculations. None of the biomarkers can be confirmed as a predictor for TCA treatment response. Despite the necessity for TCA treatment optimization, biomarker studies reporting drug-specific results for TCAs are limited and adequate replication studies are lacking. Moreover, biomarker studies generally use small sample sizes. To move forward, larger cohorts, pooled data or biomarkers combined with other clinical characteristics should be used to improve predictive power.

### Tricyclic antidepressant use and risk of fractures: a meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies [^99f32e12]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

Because studies of the association between tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) treatment and risk of fracture have shown inconsistent findings, we sought to assess whether people who take TCAs are at increased risk of fracture. Relevant studies published by June 2012 were identified through database searches of Scopus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, and WorldCat Dissertations and Theses from their inception, and manual searching of reference lists. Only original studies that examined the association between TCA treatment and risk of fracture were included. Two investigators independently conducted literature searches, study selection, study appraisal, and data abstraction using a standardized protocol. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. Because of the heterogeneity of these studies, random-effects models were used to pool estimates of effect. Overall, TCA use was associated with significantly increased fracture risk (relative risk [RR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31–1.60; p < 0.001). Increased fracture risk associated with TCA use was also observed in studies that adjusted for bone mineral density (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.24–1.90; p < 0.001) or depression (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.28–1.67; p < 0.001). Strength of association with TCA exposure duration ≥ 6 weeks (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00–1.28) was substantially weaker than association with TCA exposure duration < 6 weeks (RR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.41–4.08). Prior TCA exposure had no significant effect on fracture risk (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.86–1.26; p = 0.70). After accounting for publication bias, we found the overall association between TCA use and fracture risk to be slightly weaker (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.24–1.50) but still significant (p < 0.001). Findings of this meta-analysis indicate that treatment with TCAs may convey an increased risk of fracture, independent of depression and bone mineral density.

### Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^b14b905b]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A review of U.S. poison center data for 2004 showed over 12,000 exposures to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce healthcare costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate prehospital triage and management of patients with suspected ingestions of TCAs by 1) describing the manner in which an ingestion of a TCA might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of TCA ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to ingestion of TCAs alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on their combined toxicities. This guideline is based on the assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) Patients with suspected self-harm or who are the victims of malicious administration of a TCA should be referred to an emergency department immediately (Grade D). 2) Patients with acute TCA ingestions who are less than 6 years of age and other patients without evidence of self-harm should have further evaluation including standard history taking and determination of the presence of co-ingestants (especially other psychopharmaceutical agents) and underlying exacerbating conditions, such as convulsions or cardiac arrhythmias. Ingestion of a TCA in combination with other drugs might warrant referral to an emergency department. The ingestion of a TCA by a patient with significant underlying cardiovascular or neurological disease should cause referral to an emergency department at a lower dose than for other individuals. Because of the potential severity of TCA poisoning, transportation by EMS, with close monitoring of clinical status and vital signs en route, should be considered (Grade D). 3) Patients who are symptomatic (e.g., weak, drowsy, dizzy, tremulous, palpitations) after a TCA ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade B). 4) Ingestion of either of the following amounts (whichever is lower) would warrant consideration of referral to an emergency department: an amount that exceeds the usual maximum single therapeutic dose or an amount equal to or greater than the lowest reported toxic dose. For all TCAs except desipramine, nortriptyline, trimipramine, and protriptyline, this dose is > 5 mg/kg. For despiramine it is > 2.5 mg/kg; for nortriptyline it is > 2.5 mg/kg; for trimipramine it is > 2.5 mg/kg; and for protriptyline it is > 1 mg/kg. This recommendation applies to both patients who are naïve to the specific TCA and to patients currently taking cyclic antidepressants who take extra doses, in which case the extra doses should be added to the daily dose taken and then compared to the threshold dose for referral to an emergency department (Grades B/C). 5) Do not induce emesis (Grade D). 6) The risk-to-benefit ratio of prehospital activated charcoal for gastrointestinal decontamination in TCA poisoning is unknown. Prehospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grades B/D). 7) For unintentional poisonings, asymptomatic patients are unlikely to develop symptoms if the interval between the ingestion and the initial call to a poison center is greater than 6 hours. These patients do not need referral to an emergency department facility (Grade C). 8) Follow-up calls to determine the outcome for a TCA ingestions ideally should be made within 4 hours of the initial call to a poison center and then at appropriate intervals thereafter based on the clinical judgment of the poison center staff (Grade D). 9) An ECG or rhythm strip, if available, should be checked during the prehospital assessment of a TCA overdose patient. A wide-complex arrhythmia with a QRS duration longer than 100 msec is an indicator that the patient should be immediately stabilized, given sodium bicarbonate if there is a protocol for its use, and transported to an emergency department (Grade B). 10) Symptomatic patients with TCA poisoning might require prehospital interventions, such as intravenous fluids, cardiovascular agents, and respiratory support, in accordance with standard ACLS guidelines (Grade D). 11) Administration of sodium bicarbonate might be beneficial for patients with severe or life-threatening TCA toxicity if there is a prehospital protocol for its use (Grades B/D). 12) For TCA-associated convulsions, benzodiazepines are recommended (Grade D). 13) Flumazenil is not recommended for patients with TCA poisoning (Grade D).

### Dose effects of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of acute depression – A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^3c02b89c]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) continue to be an important group of drugs, but it is unclear whether a dose-response relationship is supported by high-level evidence.

Methods

Systematic review in the Cochrane Collaboration's Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) of studies randomizing patients to at least two doses of one TCA, complemented by searches in Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo. In multilevel regression, we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) in antidepressant efficacy per mg TCA dose increase, and we analyzed drop-outs due to adverse events. Finally, we computed random effects meta-analyses of all dose comparisons investigated in a minimum of two studies.

Results

Out of 5365 studies screened, we included 15 randomized trials on 24 comparisons of 14 different dose contrasts. We found a statistically non-significant positive effect of increasing the dose: 0.34 SMD with 100 mg/d dose increase ([-0.03; 0.70] p = 0.073). While several comparisons showed no clear signal of a dose gradient, 300 mg of imipramine/desipramine is statistically significantly superior to 150 mg (SMD: 0.80 [0.28; 1.33], p = 0.003, I²: 0%). Drop-outs increased with higher doses, albeit not statistically significantly: Odds ratio (OR) of 1.44 with 100 mg dose increase [0.54; 3.86]. Overall, risk of bias was high.

Limitations

Limited number of studies with mainly high risk of bias.

Conclusions

So far, data on a dose-response relationship in TCAs from direct dose comparisons are inconclusive. Clinically, escalation to high doses may be justified if side effects are bearable.

### Direct comparison of tricyclic and serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressants in randomized head-to-head trials in acute major depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^83ea9b0e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A comparison across trials conducted over several decades suggested superior efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) over selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, this outcome may reflect a selective secular decline of responses after randomization to placebo. Remaining uncertainty encouraged direct comparison of the drug-types in trials involving randomized, head-to-head comparisons.

Methods

We systematically identified reports of randomized trials of TCAs versus SSRIs for major depression in several digital databases, and applied standard meta-analytic and multiple-factor regression methods to analyze and pool the findings.

Results

In 89 head-to-head trials, there was no detectable overall difference in responder rates or percent-improvement between TCAs and SSRIs. In addition to non-difference between drug-types, outcomes were unrelated to reporting-year, trial-size or nominal duration, proportion of women participants, initial depression ratings, rating scales, subjects/arm, imipramine-equivalent mg/day drug dose, or dropout rate. Trial size and duration increased significantly over the years 1980–2016.

Conclusions

Previous evidence suggesting superior benefits of TCAs over SSRIs for the treatment of acute major depression is probably an artifact of a selective secular decline in responses to placebo, as no difference was found in a large series of direct comparisons of these antidepressant-types.

### Management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults: evidence review [^fa84f099]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

3.2.1 Should tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) be used as prophylactic therapy in adults with CVS?

Key message

There is very low certainty in the evidence that TCAs should be used as prophylactic therapy in CVS. See Table 3 for full evidence profile.

Table 3
Should TCAs be used as prophylactic therapy in adults with CVS?

Potential benefits/harms

Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and were used to inform this question: These included 2 randomized trials and 12 observational studies. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Data from the randomized trials were converted to a single‐arm cohort of amitriptyline for inclusion into a summary estimate for amitriptyline's symptomatic effect. A summary estimate from all included data revealed that approximately 70% of patients with CVS exhibited a symptom response (variably defined for variable durations). Six studies were from pediatric populations, four studies from adult populations, and four studies from mixed adult/pediatric populations (see Table 2 a, b). Across these studies, 413/600 (70%) of patients reported complete or partial improvement with a decrease in frequency, duration, or severity of CVS symptoms when treated with a TCA, most commonly amitriptyline. Hejazi et al. in an open‐label study of 46 adult patients demonstrated not only a marked reduction in the number of CVS episodes from 17 to 3, and in the duration of a CVS episode from 6 to 2 days, but also a reduction in the number of ED visits/hospitalizations from 15 to 3.3 with AT. Nine studies reported on adverse events, the most common being sedation and weight gain. Boles et al. 2010 had one of the largest patient cohorts and noted that 72/139 pediatric patients and 39/54 (72%) adults experienced TCA‐related side effects and 29/137 pediatric patients and 13/61 (21%) adult patients discontinued amitriptyline because of side effects. 7 However, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were not systematically reported across the studies.

Certainty of evidence

The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low. Risk of bias was a concern (lack of control group and possible selection bias in the observational studies, and lack of obvious blinding and an intention to treat analysis in the randomized trials). There was also concern regarding inconsistency, indirectness (many of the studies included only pediatric patients), and imprecision (for a few of the outcomes).

### Tricyclic antidepressants for the treatment of ADHD in… [^d4e82519]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do tricyclic antidepressants effectively treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents. Evidence-Based Answer TCAs, specifically desipramine and nortriptyline, are superior to placebo at reducing ADHD symptoms in the short term; however, the quality of evidence is low. Increased heart rate and diastolic blood pressure may be noted with treatment. This review included six double-blind, randomized controlled trials with a total of 216 patients treated for ADHD with desipramine, clomipramine, and nortriptyline. Two of the trials had coexisting tic disorder or Tourette syndrome as inclusion criteria, and in one of these, clonidine was compared with desipramine.

Because of the range of outcomes and the variety of instruments used to rate those outcomes, making comparisons was challenging. However, three trials compared TCAs with placebo using the same rating scale, the CGI. These three trials included 125 participants and found that desipramine and nortriptyline were more effective than placebo in improving core ADHD symptoms. The number needed to treat to benefit one additional person was two. Although no serious adverse effects were noted, desipramine was associated with mild increases in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, as well as higher rates of appetite suppression compared with placebo. Other adverse effects included dry mouth, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, sedation, fatigue, headache, confusion, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention. None of the studies looked at long-term adverse effects of chronic use.

Treatment discontinuation was similar for desipramine and placebo. Current guidelines recommend the use of medications approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for patients diagnosed with ADHD. 7 TCAs are not FDA-approved for children, and further study is warranted to determine if they are an appropriate treatment for patients with ADHD.

### Response to tricyclic antidepressants: independent of gender? [^88098e84]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors examined gender differences in response to tricyclic antidepressants.

Method

A total of 30 randomized, placebo-controlled trials that included 3,886 patients (1,555 men and 2,331 women), submitted between 1979 and 1991 in order to obtain marketing authorization, were reviewed. Gender differences in response to treatment were tested in various multiple regression models using a variety of response definitions.

Results

Different response definitions all pointed to no gender difference in the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants. The estimated effect size was similar for women younger and older than age 50 and for men.

Conclusions

Tricyclic antidepressant response is independent of gender.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^075bdecd]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Tricyclic antidepressants are used to treat major depressive disorder worldwide.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders recommend tricyclic antidepressants for patients with chronic or melancholic depression or as an alternative for patients who do not benefit from newer antidepressants.
Previous reviews have not systematically assessed all adverse effects for all tricyclic antidepressants, so it remains unclear whether the potential benefits outweigh the harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants.

### Risk of fractures with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants [^e7b7207d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature associating the risk of fracture during antidepressant therapy.

Data Sources

Literature was identified via MEDLINE (1970-August 2008) using the search terms selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antidepressants, and fracture. Reference citations from publications identified were also reviewed. All articles in English identified from the data sources were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally prescribed over other classes of antidepressants because they are considered to be relatively safer. Recent evidence, however, suggests that SSRIs may be associated with an increased risk of fractures. Thirteen clinical studies were identified in the literature search (7 case controls, 5 prospective cohorts, 1 cross-sectional). Most studies compared SSRIs with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and found similar or greater risk of fracture associated with use of an SSRI. This risk appeared to be highest at the beginning of therapy with TCAs and eventually diminished. SSRI risk tended to increase slightly over time. No risk was seen with other classes of antidepressants. However, the number of patients using antidepressants was low.

Conclusions

There may be a possible correlation with SSRI or TCA use and risk of fracture. Prospective, randomized controlled trials with sufficient patient samples are needed to verify this finding.

### Are one or two dangerous? Tricyclic antidepressant exposure in toddlers [^e0ccd144]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), increasingly prescribed for multiple indications in children and adults, are responsible for many pediatric poisonings. Though the majority of TCA exposures in this age group remain asymptomatic, several reports in the English language literature reveal significant morbidity as well as fatalities in toddlers, primarily from imipramine and desipramine. These few cases indicate that doses of 10–20 mg/kg (one to two pills) have the potential for toxicity and fatalities. More recent studies have focused on the relative safety of small exposures suggesting that with doses less than 5 mg/kg the patient may be safely observed at home. Though further studies are necessary to determine the exact dosing that places the child at risk, the authors recommend a 6-h Emergency Department observation period for children who ingest more than 5 mg/kg of most TCAs, as clinical toxicity becomes evident within this time frame.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^48229380]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Question

Tricyclic antidepressants are used to treat depression worldwide, but the adverse effects have not been systematically assessed. Our objective was to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of all tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder.

Study selection and analysis

We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and other sources from inception to January 2023 for randomised clinical trials comparing tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo or 'active placebo' for adults with major depressive disorder. The primary outcomes were depressive symptoms measured on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), serious adverse events and quality of life. The minimal important difference was defined as three points on the HDRS-17.

Findings

We included 103 trials randomising 10 590 participants. All results were at high risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence was very low or low. All trials only assessed outcomes at the end of the treatment period at a maximum of 12 weeks after randomisation. Meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis showed evidence of a beneficial effect of tricyclic antidepressants compared with placebo (mean difference −3.77 HDRS-17 points; 95% CI −5.91 to −1.63; 17 trials). Meta-analysis showed evidence of a harmful effect of tricyclic antidepressants compared with placebo on serious adverse events (OR 2.78; 95% CI 2.18 to 3.55; 35 trials), but the required information size was not reached. Only 2 out of 103 trials reported on quality of life and t-tests showed no evidence of a difference.

Conclusions

The long-term effects of tricyclic antidepressants and the effects on quality of life are unknown. Short-term results suggest that tricyclic antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms while also increasing the risks of serious adverse events, but these results were based on low and very low certainty evidence.

### WITHDRAWN: treatment discontinuation with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) [^edf13858]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are thought to have better discontinuation rates (i.e. less people dropping out) than tricyclic and heterocyclic antidepressant drugs. It is important to quantify the drop-out rates of different antidepressant drugs in order to have a better understanding of the relative tolerability of these drugs.

Objectives

To assess the comparative tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressant drugs.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Registers (1997 to 1999), MEDLINE (1966 to 1999), EMBASE (1974 to 1999) We also searched specialist journals, the reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews, conference abstracts and government documents. Representatives of the pharmaceutical industry were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Parallel group randomised controlled trials comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with tricyclic or heterocyclic antidepressants in people with depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and a third reviewer checked any cases of disagreement.

Main Results

We included 136 trials. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors showed less participants dropping out compared to the tricyclic/heterocyclic group (odds ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.30). A statistically significant difference was found in total drop-outs between the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the old tricyclics as well as the newer tricyclics. When the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were compared to the heterocyclic antidepressants, there was a non significant difference favouring the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The poor tolerability profile of the old tricyclics was explained by differences in drop-outs for side-effects, but not for inefficacy.

Authors' Conclusions

Whilst selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors do appear to show an advantage over tricyclic drugs in terms of total drop-outs, this advantage is relatively modest. This has implications for pharmaco-economic models, some of which may have overestimated the difference of drop-out rates between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. These results are based on short-term randomised controlled trials, and may not generalise into clinical practice.

### Guidelines in Emergency Medicine Network (GEMNet): guideline for the management of tricyclic antidepressant overdose [^a5d80ec3]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on tricyclic antidepressant overdose:

- **Definition**: TCA overdose is deﬁned as ingestion of TCA at above the recommended therapeutic dose.
- **Pathophysiology**: TCA overdose may be accidental or intentional, including as part of suicide attempts.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of TCA overdose is estimated at 3.8 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: TCAs block α-adrenergic receptors and have anticholinergic effects, leading to tachycardia, hypotension, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias. TCAs also exert a number of effects on the CNS, which may lead to drowsiness, coma, respiratory depression, seizures, and delirium.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hospital admission and intensive care support are required in several patients. Fatality rates of up to 6% have been reported in patients with severe overdose.

### Meta-analysis of effects and side effects of low dosage tricyclic antidepressants in depression: systematic review [^f8ae6a69]. BMJ (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects and side effects of low dosage tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and with standard dosage tricyclics in acute phase treatment of depression.

Design

Systematic review of randomised trials comparing low dosage tricyclics (≤ 100 mg/day) with placebo or with standard dosage tricyclics in adults with depression.

Main Outcome Measures

Relative risk of response in depression (random effects model), according to the original authors' definition but usually defined as 50% or greater reduction in severity of depression. Relative risks of overall dropouts and dropouts due to side effects.

Results

35 studies (2013 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with placebo, and six studies (551 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with standard dosage tricyclics. Low dosage tricyclics, mostly between 75 and 100 mg/day, were 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.0) and 1.47 (1.12 to 1.94) times more likely than placebo to bring about response at 4 weeks and 6–8 weeks, respectively. Standard dosage tricyclics failed, however, to bring about more response but produced more dropouts due to side effects than low dosage tricyclics.

Conclusions

Treatment of depression in adults with low dose tricyclics is justified. However, more rigorous studies are needed to definitively establish the relative benefits and harms of various dosages.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^5ccdf161]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

It is difficult to reach firm conclusions on the relative efficacy of tricyclics compared with other treatment modalities. There were relatively few studies and most were underpowered to assess clinical equivalence.

Tricyclics seem equally effective for tension-type, migraine, and mixed headaches. This is useful information for clinicians as differentiating these headache types may not always be straightforward, especially in patients with frequent headaches. While this similar efficacy lends support to the clinical practice of using the same treatment approaches for recurrent tension, mixed and migraine headache, it does not address important underlying theoretical issues. A similarity in the magnitude of effect does not prove that the mechanisms underlying these headache types are the same, that they converge on some final common pathway, or that the different classes of antidepressants act through some common mechanism. Neither the studies we examined, nor this study, were designed to resolve issues of nosology and mechanism.

We also found evidence that the benefit of tricyclics for headaches increased with longer study duration. This is consistent with clinical practice and treatment recommendations suggesting that tricyclics need to be taken for several months before reaching any conclusion on effectiveness for any given patient. The scarcity of studies with longer duration is problematic and casts suspicion on the reliability of any conclusions about the long term efficacy of tricyclics.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^77d1afa4]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder is a psychiatric condition characterised by depressed mood and diminished interest or pleasure. Major depressive disorder is estimated to affect more than 264 million people globallyand is associated with a high risk of suicidal behaviour. Tricyclic antidepressants are used in the treatment of major depressive disorder worldwide. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are generally recommended as first-line treatment for major depressive disorder, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders recommend tricyclic antidepressants for patients with chronic or melancholic depression or as an alternative for patients who do not benefit from newer antidepressants. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines also includes the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline as one of just two essential antidepressants for the treatment of depressive disorders.

It has previously been shown that antidepressants reduce depressive symptoms with statistically significant effects, but it is uncertain how important these effects are to patients and whether they represent genuine pharmacological effects or just amplified placebo effects. One systematic review suggests that amitriptyline has larger effects than other antidepressants compared with placebo. However, previous reviews have not systematically assessed suicides, suicide attempts and all serious and non-serious adverse events for all tricyclic antidepressants, so it remains unclear whether the harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants outweigh the potential beneficial effects.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^f9f6bbf2]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain — tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have uncertain benefit; for patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against tricyclic antidepressants (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). The evidence for the use of TCAs demonstrates limited benefit with low to very low quality evidence, and a systematic review showed no benefit for either function or pain, although older studies reported improvement in pain intensity with a moderate effect size of 0.43 but were inconclusive for function, quality of life (QoL), or healthcare utilization. Providers should use caution when prescribing TCAs to patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or a family history of sudden death; a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is indicated in patients who are aged > 50 years or with significant cardiac risk factors. When used in patients aged ≥ 65 years, the anticholinergic burden should also be considered and secondary amines such as nortriptyline or desipramine may be warranted due to decreased anticholinergic burden; some subpopulations may be at greater risk of sedation and falls, and there is also a risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly when combining with other medications (e.g., antidepressants).

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^df9a5dc9]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions and clinical implications

The long-term effects of tricyclic antidepressants and the effects on quality of life and suicides or suicide attempts are unknown. Short-term results suggest that tricyclic antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms while also increasing the risks of adverse events, but these results were based on low and very low certainty evidence. It is a cause for concern that there are no data on the long-term adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants given that so many people use these drugs for several years.

### Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder [^cbdede39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that was synthesised in 1960 and introduced as early as 1961 in the USA, but is still regularly used. It has also been frequently used as an active comparator in trials on newer antidepressants and can therefore be called a 'benchmark' antidepressant. However, its efficacy and safety compared to placebo in the treatment of major depression has not been assessed in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of amitriptyline compared to placebo or no treatment for major depressive disorder in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) to August 2012. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). The reference lists of reports of all included studies were screened and manufacturers of amitriptyline contacted for details of additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amitriptyline with placebo or no treatment in patients with major depressive disorder as diagnosed by operationalised criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used a random-effects model throughout.

Main Results

The review includes 39 trials with a total of 3509 participants. Study duration ranged between three and 12 weeks. Amitriptyline was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving acute response (18 RCTs, n = 1987, OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.21 to 3.23). Significantly fewer participants allocated to amitriptyline than to placebo withdrew from trials due to inefficacy of treatment (19 RCTs, n = 2017, OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.28), but more amitriptyline-treated participants withdrew due to side effects (19 RCTs, n = 2174, OR 4.15, 95% CI 2.71 to 6.35). Amitriptyline also caused more anticholinergic side effects, tachycardia, dizziness, nervousness, sedation, tremor, dyspepsia, sedation, sexual dysfunction and weight gain. In subgroup and meta-regression analyses the results of the primary outcome were robust towards publication year (1971 to 1997), mean participant age at baseline, mean amitriptyline dose, study duration in weeks, pharmaceutical sponsor, inpatient versus outpatient setting and two-arm versus three-arm design. However, higher severity at baseline was associated with higher superiority of amitriptyline (P = 0.02), while higher responder rates in the placebo groups were associated with lower superiority of amitriptyline (P = 0.05). The results of the primary outcome were rather homogeneous, reflecting comparability of the trials. However, methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were usually poorly reported. Not all studies used intention-to-treat analyses and in many of them standard deviations were not reported and often had to be imputed. Funnel plots suggested a possible publication bias, but the trim and fill method did not change the overall effect size much (seven adjusted studies, OR 2.64, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.10).

Authors' Conclusions

Amitriptyline is an efficacious antidepressant drug. It is, however, also associated with a number of side effects. Degree of placebo response and severity of depression at baseline may moderate drug-placebo efficacy differences.

### Selective versus multi-transmitter antidepressants: are two mechanisms better than one? [^50e5ae90]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The issue of selectivity versus efficacy has now reappeared as newer agents have emerged that are less selective than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) but more selective than the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). This article provides a critical examination of the clinical literature concerning what evidence there is for differential efficacy. Two broad areas will be discussed: (1) comparisons of SSRIs to TCAs and (2) comparisons of the SSRIs to a somewhat more selective compound (by comparison to the TCAs), venlafaxine. This review should caution one in accepting claims of superiority of any agent based on purported mechanism of action.

### Tricyclic antidepressants: is your patient taking them? Observations on adherence and unreported use using prescriber-reported medication lists and urine drug testing [^32d22434]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. Despite widespread use, many health care providers do not know which patients are currently taking TCAs. The objective of this retrospective data analysis was to determine adherence rates to amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or imipramine. The rate at which patients used TCAs (confirmed by presence of TCA in the urine) but did not inform their health care provider is also reported (non-informed prescriber rate). Finally, the effects of age, sex, and number of prescriptions on adherence and non-informed prescriber rates were assessed.

Methods

Urinary excretion data were obtained from 55,296 patients with pain and were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in a multiplex assay which included amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and imipramine.

Results

The adherence rate was 66% (1,407/2,137); the rate of non-informed prescribers was 3% (1,547/55,296) among the general population, and 52% (1,547/2,954) when only TCA users were considered. While adherence was higher among older and female subjects, the number of other medications did not affect adherence rate.

Conclusions

This analysis reveals that many prescribers are not informed when patients start and stop using TCAs.

### Effectiveness of genotype-specific tricyclic antidepressant dosing in patients with major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^152cb555]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Currently, several guidelines are available for optimizing pharmacotherapy by pharmacogenetic testing, among which the guidelines by the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium are internationally well recognized. To date, antidepressant treatment informed by these guidelines has not been compared with standard treatment in RCTs conducted in the clinical practice setting. Especially for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), pharmacogenetics may be of interest because therapeutic TCA plasma concentrations are well defined and treatment is frequently accompanied by a high burden of adverse effects. For attainment of a therapeutic TCA plasma concentration, multiple dosage adjustments over multiple weeks based on therapeutic drug monitoring are typically necessary. Meanwhile, suboptimal treatment can worsen depressive symptoms and suicidality, prolong treatment duration, and increase health-related costs.

In the present study, we aimed to examine whether dosing based on pharmacogenetics according to the DPWG guidelines resulted in faster attainment of therapeutic TCA plasma concentrations compared with usual treatment. Furthermore, we investigated whether faster attainment of therapeutic concentrations was associated with higher effectiveness and fewer and less severe adverse effects. We hypothesized that application of the DPWG guidelines would result in faster attainment of therapeutic plasma concentrations, higher effectiveness, and a lower rate of adverse effects.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs compared with placebo for treatment of depression in primary care: a meta-analysis [^f26a4784]. Annals of Family Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Depression is common in primary care. There are no systematic reviews of depression treatment comparing antidepressants with placebo; hence, we do not know whether these medications are effective in primary care.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group register of controlled trials, MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical abstracts, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Abstracts of potential studies were reviewed independently by 2 authors. Studies needed to include randomized controlled trials of either a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), or both, and placebo in a primary care setting. The data and quality of the studies were extracted and assessed by 2 authors blind to the other's choice. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The main outcome measures were the standardized mean difference and weighted mean difference of the final mean depression scores, the relative risk of improvement, and the number withdrawing because of side effects. Pooling of results was done using Review Manager 4.2.2.

Results

There were 10 studies in which TCAs were compared with placebo, 3 in which SSRIs were compared with placebo, and 2 with both compared with placebo. One half of the studies were of low methodological quality, and nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6 to 8 weeks. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed a relative risk of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.12–1.42) for improvement with TCAs compared with placebo; For SSRIs, relative risk was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.21–1.55). Most patients, 56% to 60%, responded well to active treatment compared with 42% to 47% for placebo. The number needed to treat for TCAs was about 4, and for SSRIs it was 6. The numbers needed to harm (for withdrawal caused by side effects) ranged from 5 to 11 for TCAs and 21 to 94 for SSRIs. Low-dose (100 mg or 75 mg) as well as high-dose TCAs were effective.

Conclusion

This systematic review is the first comparing antidepressants with placebo for treatment of depression in primary care. Both TCAs and SSRIs are effective. This review is also the first to show that low-dose TCAs are effective in primary care. Prescribing antidepressants in primary care is a more effective clinical activity than prescribing placebo.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^392ee0ab]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Headaches are common and cause distress and disability. The prevalence of migraine headaches ranges between 8.4% and 18% worldwide. Tension-type headaches are even more common, occurring in 16–30% of people worldwide, with 3% having headaches for more than 180 days a year. Migraine headaches alone cost the United States $1bn (£0.64bn; €0.75bn) in medical costs and $13bn in lost productivity a year.

Tricyclic antidepressants were first shown to be effective in preventing headaches in 1964and have become a standard modality in headache prevention. Based on current standards for preventive treatment in the United States, 43% of males and 34% of females who are candidates for such treatment are not receiving it. This may result from insufficient understanding of the magnitude of beneficial effects, an overestimation of adverse effects, or the presumption that efficacy is only confined to migraine headaches. In a previous meta-analysis of antidepressants for headaches, we found that antidepressants were effective in preventing headaches, equally for tension-type headaches and migraine headaches. This meta-analysis was limited by the relatively small number of available studies at the time. To expand on our previous systematic review we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of tricyclics in reducing the headache burden among adults with migraine or tension-type headache. We also compared tricyclics with other treatment modalities to assess whether the efficacy of tricyclics varies by type of headache, dose, and duration of treatment.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus tricyclic antidepressants in young patients: a meta-analysis of efficacy and acceptability [^dfd66eda]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

A meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and acceptability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in depressed children, adolescents, and young adults was performed.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was conducted from 1970 to December 2013. Only clinical trials that randomly assigned one SSRI or TCA to patients aged 7 to 25 years who met the diagnostic criteria for unipolar depressive disorder were included. Primary efficacy was determined by the pooling of standardized mean differences (SMDs) calculated from the difference in the reduction in mean depression rating scale scores for the 2 antidepressants. Acceptability was determined by pooling the risk ratios (RRs) of dropouts for all reasons and for adverse effects as well as the suicide-risk outcome.

Findings

Five trials with a total of 422 patients were considered to be eligible for inclusion. SSRIs were significantly more effective than TCAs in primary efficacy (SMD = -0.52; 95% CI, -0.81 to -0.24; P = 0.0003). Patients taking SSRIs had a significantly greater response to depressive symptoms than patients taking TCAs (RR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.29; P = 0.03). On an individual SSRI basis, fluoxetine had a significantly greater efficacy than TCAs (SMD = -0.82; 95% CI, -1.34 to -0.29; P = 0.003). On an individual TCA basis, only imipramine was not significantly worse than SSRIs (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI, -0.56 to 0.02; P = 0.06). Significantly more patients taking TCAs discontinued treatment than patients taking SSRIs (35.8% vs 25.1%; RR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.93; P = 0.02).

Implications

SSRI therapy has a superior efficacy and is better tolerated compared with TCA therapy in young patients.

Fig 2 Effect of tricyclic antidepressants on burden of headache for tension-type and migraine headaches compared with placebo. Trials of mixed and migraine headaches are combined

The number of headaches per month among studies reporting it were reduced on average by 6.9 for tension-type headaches (95% confidence interval −21.6 to 7.7, three studies) and 1.4 for migraine headaches (−3.3 to 0.5, four studies). For both headache types this beneficial effect increased over time (tension-type: β = −0.16, 95% confidence interval −0.23 to −0.10, P < 0.0005, migraine: β = −0.09, −0.14 to −0.04, P = 0.001, fig 3). Therefore for every additional week of treatment with a tricyclic, the number of headaches were reduced by 0.16 standard deviations. Among these trials, a range of tricyclic doses was used, with an average dose that was 50% of the maximum for the particular tricyclic studied. The effect of doses less than 50% of the maximum dose was lower than those with higher doses (average standardised mean difference −0.73, 95% confidence interval −1.14 to −0.32 v −0.92, −1.50 to −0.34), although the difference was not significant (P = 0.34).

Fig 3 Effect of tricyclic antidepressants compared with placebo over time. SMD = standardised mean difference

Patients taking tricyclics were more likely to experience at least 50% improvement in their headaches than those taking placebo for both tension-type headaches (relative risk 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.89, four studies, I² = 48.8%) and migraine headaches (1.80, 1.24 to 2.62, four studies, I² = 0.0%, fig 4). Therefore, patients treated with tricyclics had a 40% and 80% increase in the probability of having 50% improvement in tension-type and migraine headaches, respectively. Overall, tricyclics improved the likelihood of achieving 50% improvement in headaches (1.53, 1.16 to 2.01, eight studies, I² = 26.1%).

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^44bf5987]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Antidepressants

Antidepressant use is considerable, especially in the Western world, and is on the rise in several countries. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey published in 2017 showed that during 2011–2014 about one in eight people aged 12 and over in the USA reported taking antidepressants during the previous month. Antidepressant use increased nearly 65% over a 15-year time frame, and more than 60% of people in the USA taking antidepressants have been taking them for more than 2 years. Antidepressants for major depressive disorder, either alone or in combination with psychotherapy, are recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the American Psychiatric Association, as well as guidelines. Furthermore, psychiatrists and general practitioners worldwide routinely use antidepressants in the treatment of depression.

Several different antidepressants exist (see box 1). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most widely prescribed class of antidepressants and are often first-line treatment for depression.

Box 1
Types of antidepressants

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline).
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, venlafaxine, duloxetine and milnacipran).
Tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline, imipramine and nortriptyline).
Atypical antidepressants (eg, mirtazapine, agomelatine and bupropion).
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (eg, isocarboxazid and phenelzine).

### Sertraline versus other antidepressive agents for depression [^da2b2327]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical practice guideline on the treatment of depressive disorder recommended that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be the first-line option when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Preliminary evidence suggested that sertraline might be slightly superior in terms of effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to July 2008. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to sertraline versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved with another member of the team. A double-entry procedure was employed by two reviewers. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side-effects).

Main Results

A total of 59 studies, mostly of low quality, were included in the review, involving multiple treatment comparisons between sertraline and other antidepressant agents. Evidence favouring sertraline over some other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression was found, either in terms of efficacy (fluoxetine) or acceptability/tolerability (amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine and mirtazapine). However, some differences favouring newer antidepressants in terms of efficacy (mirtazapine) and acceptability (bupropion) were also found. In terms of individual side effects, sertraline was generally associated with a higher rate of participants experiencing diarrhoea.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressive agents both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, using 95% confidence intervals and a conservative approach, with a random effects analysis. However, the included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians were not reported in any of the included studies.

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^5be737ce]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder — tricyclic antidepressant safety and dispensing: Given the low therapeutic index of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), toxicity is much more likely than with other antidepressants, is a serious potential risk that can be fatal, and manifestations include cardiovascular, central nervous system, and anticholinergic toxicity (refractory hypotension, ventricular arrhythmia, seizure, and coma); depending on the TCA, significant toxicity can occur at doses of 5 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg). To reduce risk, the Work Group recommends limiting the patient's supply of medication, and TCAs should be used cautiously and dispensed in limited quantities in patients at risk for suicide.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^5ccb6696]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Tricyclic antidepressants, including doxepin hydrochloride, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. This risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin. Withdrawal syndrome occurred after stopping doxepin hydrochloride. The following adverse reaction has been reported with use with other tricyclic antidepressants: decreased blood glucose. Table 2 describe the clinically significant drug interactions of doxepin hydrochloride with other drugs or classes.

Signs and symptoms of TCA toxicity develop rapidly after TCA overdose. Other signs of TCA overdose may include confusion, disturbed concentration, transient visual hallucinations, dilated pupils, agitation, hyperactive reflexes, stupor, drowsiness, muscle rigidity, vomiting, hypothermia, or hyperpyrexia. There are reports of patients succumbing to fatal dysrhythmia late after TCA overdose. A pH > 7. 6 or a pCO2 < 20 mm Hg is undesirable. Dysrhythmias unresponsive to intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy/hyperventilation may respond to lidocaine therapy. Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated in the setting of TCA overdose. Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced diuresis generally have been reported as ineffective in TCA overdose due to high tissue and protein binding of doxepin.

CNS Toxicity Management: In patients with TCA overdose who have CNS depression, early intubation is recommended because of the potential for abrupt deterioration. Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines, or if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants. Avoid use of physostigmine to treat TCA overdose.

### Effectiveness of antidepressants compared with placebo… [^5850e3b3]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the effectiveness of antidepressants compared with placebo for the treatment of depression in primary care settings. Evidence-Based Answer Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are more effective than placebo for the treatment of depression in primary care settings. Compared with placebo, TCAs showed greater improvement in depression scores and a greater clinical response to remission, assessed by primary care physicians or psychiatrists. The number needed to harm ranged from 4 to 30 in participants taking TCAs who discontinued treatment because of adverse effects. SSRIs showed a clinical benefit for improvement in depression scores.

More patients in the SSRI group withdrew from trials because of adverse effects compared with placebo, but fewer patients in the SSRI group withdrew because of treatment failure. Other reviews have shown higher drop-out rates related to tolerability in participants taking SSRIs. The American College of Physicians recommends that when physicians choose pharmacologic therapy to treat patients with acute major depression, they select second-generation antidepressants on the basis of adverse effect profiles, cost, and patient preference.

2 The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement states that SSRIs — as well as venlafaxine, duloxetine, mirtazapine, and bupropion — are often chosen as first-line antidepressant treatment options because of the quality and quantity of published data for these medications; their relative tolerability of adverse effects compared with TCAs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors; and their overall relative safety. 3.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^8ffe9962]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Our meta-analysis showed a mean difference between tricyclic antidepressants and placebo of −3.77 HDRS points or −3.16 HDRS points when an outlier was removed. We predefined the minimal important difference on HDRS as three points, but it has been questioned whether the true minimal important difference is in fact closer to seven points. Moreover, the effect was not above our minimal important difference in the one trial using an 'active placebo'. The high risk of bias of the included trials and the low certainty of the evidence make our results inadequate to determine whether tricyclic antidepressants have a genuine and meaningful short-term antidepressant effect rather than an amplified placebo effect.

Our systematic review has several strengths. Our results are novel, as this is the first systematic review assessing all adverse effects for all tricyclic antidepressants in adults with major depressive disorder. Data on adverse effects are essential for enabling patients and clinician to make informed decisions about the use of any treatment. The predefined methodology was based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, PRISMA, trial sequential analysis, the eight-step procedure by Jakobsen et al, the GRADE approach, and risks of systematic and random errors, external validity, publication bias and heterogeneity were taken into account. We increased the statistical power by pooling all tricyclic antidepressants, and we compared the effects of different types of tricyclic antidepressants in subgroup analyses. Furthermore, we searched for both published trials and unpublished data to increase the validity of our results.

### Antidepressants for neuropathic pain [^d2e07af1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.

Objectives

To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain. Migraine and headache studies were not considered.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2003); EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2003); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 1; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Fifty trials of 19 antidepressants were considered eligible (2515 patients) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) estimates and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects.

Main Results

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline has an NNT of 2 (95%CI 1.7 to 2.5) RR 4.1(95%CI 2.9–5.9) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs (SSRIs). There were insufficient data for an assessment of evidence of effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort, venlafaxine and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95%CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4(95%CI 5.2–29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.2 (95%CI 1.7 to 3.1), RR 4.8(95%CI 2.5–9.5)(three studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm(NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 16 (95%CI: 10–45). The NNH for minor adverse effects was 4.6 (95%CI 3.3–6.7)

Authors' Conclusions

Antidepressants are effective for a variety of neuropathic pains. The best evidence available is for amitriptyline. There are only limited data for the effectiveness of SSRIs. It is not possible to identify the most effective antidepressant until more studies of SSRIs are conducted.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^52736ff3]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and relative adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of migraine, tension-type, and mixed headaches.

Design

Meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Trials Registry, and PsycLIT. Studies reviewed Randomised trials of adults receiving tricyclics as only treatment for a minimum of four weeks.

Data Extraction

Frequency of headaches (number of headache attacks for migraine and number of days with headache for tension-type headaches), intensity of headache, and headache index.

Results

37 studies met the inclusion criteria. Tricyclics significantly reduced the number of days with tension-type headache and number of headache attacks from migraine than placebo (average standardised mean difference -1.29, 95% confidence interval -2.18 to -0.39 and -0.70, -0.93 to -0.48) but not compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (-0.80, -2.63 to 0.02 and -0.20, -0.60 to 0.19). The effect of tricyclics increased with longer duration of treatment (β = -0.11, 95% confidence interval -0.63 to -0.15; P < 0.0005). Tricyclics were also more likely to reduce the intensity of headaches by at least 50% than either placebo (tension-type: relative risk 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.89; migraine: 1.80, 1.24 to 2.62) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (1.73, 1.34 to 2.22 and 1.72, 1.15 to 2.55). Tricyclics were more likely to cause adverse effects than placebo (1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 2.12) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (2.22, 1.52 to 3.32), including dry mouth (P < 0.0005 for both), drowsiness (P < 0.0005 for both), and weight gain (P < 0.001 for both), but did not increase dropout rates (placebo: 1.22, 0.83 to 1.80, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: 1.16, 0.81 to 2.97).

Conclusions

Tricyclic antidepressants are effective in preventing migraine and tension-type headaches and are more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, although with greater adverse effects. The effectiveness of tricyclics seems to increase over time.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^e3884807]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

A fourth limitation is the lack of reporting on concomitant use of direct, "as needed", drugs. Although most of the studies included patient diaries on the use of analgesics during or before the study period, only four placebo controlled studies and two comparisons with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors provide any results, all showing insignificantly greater reduction in analgesic use among patients receiving tricyclics. When data are combined across headache types, there is evidence of reduction in analgesic use. However, it is possible that other trials collected but did not report their data; there may be a bias against presenting data suggesting less treatment benefit. Reducing the need for patient use of analgesics is an important goal of prophylactic therapy in general, and has the additional benefit of helping to prevent "rebound" or drug overuse headaches.

A fifth limitation is that it is impossible to tell from our data what the optimal dose is for preventing headaches. Meta-analysis is limited by the problem of aggregate data. Optimal dosing is a question that could be answered only with the availability of patient level data, given the relatively large number of trials that have been carried out and the fact that nearly all trials included titration of tricyclics.

### Tricyclic drugs for depression in children and adolescents [^3a33acd2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a need to identify effective and safe treatments for depression in children and adolescents. While tricyclic drugs are effective in treating depression in adults, individual studies involving children and adolescents have been equivocal. Prescribing of tricyclic drugs for depression in children and adolescents is now uncommon, but an accurate estimate of their efficacy is helpful as a comparator for other drug treatments for depression in this age group. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and updated in 2002, 2006 and 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effects of tricyclic drugs compared with placebo for depression in children and adolescents and to determine whether there are differential responses to tricyclic drugs between child and adolescent patient populations.

Search Methods

We conducted a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (to 12 April 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years), EMBASE (1974-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1967-). The bibliographies of previously published reviews and papers describing original research were cross-checked. We contacted authors of relevant abstracts in conference proceedings of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and we handsearched the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1978 to 1999).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of orally administered tricyclic drugs with placebo in depressed people aged 6 to 18 years.

Data Collection and Analysis

One of two review authors selected the trials, assessed their quality, and extracted trial and outcome data. A second review author assessed quality and checked accuracy of extracted data. Most studies reported multiple outcome measures including depression scales and clinical global impression scales. For each study, we took the best available depression measure as the index measure of depression outcome. We established predetermined criteria to assist in the ranking of measures. Where study authors reported categorical outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled risk ratios for non-improvement in treated compared with control subjects. For continuous outcomes, we calculated pooled effect sizes as the number of standard deviations by which the change in depression scores for the treatment group exceeded those for the control group.

Main Results

Fourteen trials (590 participants) were included. No overall difference was found for the primary outcome of response to treatment compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.26; 9 trials, N = 454). There was a small reduction in depression symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.32, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.04; 13 trials, N = 533), but the evidence was of low quality. Subgroup analyses suggested a small reduction in depression symptoms among adolescents (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.007), and negligible change among children (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.64). Treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant caused more vertigo (RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.73 to 4.43; 5 trials, N = 324), orthostatic hypotension (RR 4.86, 95% CI 1.69 to 13.97; 5 trials, N = 324), tremor (RR 5.43, 95% CI 1.64 to 17.98; 4 trials, N = 308) and dry mouth (RR 3.35, 95% CI 1.98 to 5.64; 5 trials, N = 324) than did placebo, but no differences were found for other possible adverse effects. Wide CIs and the probability of selective reporting mean that there was very low-quality evidence for adverse events. There was heterogeneity across the studies in the age of participants, treatment setting, tricyclic drug administered and outcome measures. Statistical heterogeneity was identified for reduction in depressive symptoms, but not for rates of remission or response. As such, the findings from analyses of pooled data should be interpreted with caution. We judged none of these trials to be at low risk of bias, with limited information about many aspects of risk of bias, high dropout rates, and issues regarding measurement instruments and the clinical usefulness of outcomes, which were often variously defined across trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Data suggest tricyclic drugs are not useful in treating depression in children. There is marginal evidence to support the use of tricyclic drugs in the treatment of depression in adolescents.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) for chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) with gastrointestinal symptoms have limited evidence, with TCAs versus placebo (one study; n = 34) showing no difference in outcomes and dropout due to side effects not significantly higher (RR: 1.92; 95% CI: 0.89 to 4.17; p = 0.10). Side effects are more common than with placebo but are usually mild (e.g., sedation, anticholinergic effects), and this class should be avoided in populations at a high risk of suicide or the elderly. The Work Group's confidence in the evidence was very low, the benefits slightly outweighed the harms/burden, and Providers should consider TCAs for patients with CMI and abdominal pain and diarrheal symptoms and avoid TCAs for populations at high risk of suicide or the elderly, concluding with a Neither for nor against recommendation.

### Antidepressants for depressed elderly [^898580a4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a relatively common experience in older adults. The syndrome is associated with considerable distress, morbidity and service commitment. Approximately two thirds of patients presenting with severe forms will respond to antidepressant treatment and the last twenty years has witnessed a great increase in the number of these drugs. Older, frail people are particularly vulnerable to side effects.

Objectives

The aims of this review were to examine the efficacy of antidepressant classes, to compare the withdrawal rates associated with each class and describe the side effect profile of antidepressant drugs for treating depression in patients described as elderly, geriatric, senile or older adults, aged 55 or over.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies) was searched (2003-08-13). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand searched for published reports and citations of unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Trials had to compare at least two active antidepressant drugs in the treatment of depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Reviewers extracted data independently. In examining efficacy, the reviewers assumed that people who died or dropped out had no improvement. Withdrawal rates irrespective of cause and specifically due to side effects were compared between drug classes. Relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Qualitative side effect data were reported in terms of ratios of side effects and percentage of patients experiencing specific side effects.

Main Results

A total of 29 trials provided data for inclusion in the review. We were unable to find any differences in efficacy when comparing classes of antidepressants. However, as the trials contained relatively small numbers of patients, these findings may be explained by a type two error. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) compared less favourably with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of numbers of patients withdrawn irrespective of reason (RR: 1.24, CI 1.04, 1.47) and number withdrawn due to side effects (RR: 1.30, CI 1.02, 1.64). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that TCA related antidepressants had similar withdrawal rates to SSRIs irrespective of reason of withdrawal (RR: 1.49, CI 0.74, 2.98) or withdrawal due to side effects (RR: 1.07, CI 0.43, 2.70). The qualitative analysis of side effects showed a small increased profile of gastro-intestinal and neuropsychiatric side effects associated with classical TCAs.

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings suggest that SSRIs and TCAs are of the same efficacy. However, we have found some evidence suggesting that TCA related antidepressants and classical TCAs may have different side effect profiles and are associated with differing withdrawal rates when compared with SSRIs. The review suggests that classical TCAs are associated with a higher withdrawal rate due to side effect experience, although these results must be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small size of the review and the heterogeneity of the drugs and patient populations.

### Cardiovascular effects of therapeutic doses of tricyclic antidepressants… [^9f9244c3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Overdoses of tricyclic antidepressants leave no doubt that TCA drugs at high concentrations have serious cardiac effects. It has been assumed that, to a lesser extent, these effects would occur at usual therapeutic concentration. Recent prospective, plasma-level-controlled studies have improved our understanding of these drugs and proved these assumptions to be inaccurate. The most common serious cardiovascular complication of most tricyclic drugs is orthostatic hypotension. Tricyclic antidepressants are essentially free of any other serious adverse effects in depressed patients without cardiovascular disease. In patients with preexisting bundlebranch disease, there is a risk of heart block. On the other hand, patients with ventricular arrhythmias are likely to have their arrhythmias improve with TCA therapy. Finally, therapeutic doses of TCA have little adverse effect on left ventricular performance.

As a result, TCA drugs can often be used to benefit depressed patients with overt heart disease. Glassman AH, Bigger JT. Cardiovascular Effects of Therapeutic Doses of Tricyclic Antidepressants: A Review. Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1981; 38: 815–820.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^e64cc2a9]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Our systematic review also has limitations. First, the included trials only reported results at the end of treatment at a maximum of 12 weeks, so the long-term effects of tricyclic antidepressants are unknown. There is a need for trials with long-term follow-up to assess the benefits and harms since, for example, half of patients on antidepressants in the UK and 70% of patients in the USA have used them for more than 2 years. This is particularly pertinent for medications that are associated with tolerance and withdrawal effects, which tend to show diminishing effects over time. Second, all included trials were assessed at overall high risk of bias particularly driven by risk of bias due to missing data, lack of blinding of outcome assessors, risk of unblinding due to adverse effects, inappropriate analysis methods and the reporting of the included trials was generally poor. The reporting and assessment of adverse events were especially inadequate. None of the trials assessed adverse events based on the ICH-GCP guidelines, and serious adverse events were generally not systematically assessed. Studies have shown that the adverse effects are generally under-reported in published trials compared with unpublished data, and we therefore aimed to include unpublished data. However, in spite of searching systematically for unpublished data, we were only able to identify unpublished data for one trial. Our results are therefore prone to overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms. Third, only five of the included trials reported on suicides or suicide attempts, and there was not enough information to confirm or reject the effects of tricyclic antidepressants on suicides or suicide attempts. This is particularly problematic since major depressive disorder is associated with increased risks of suicidal behaviour. There is a need for larger trials at low risk of bias to assess the risks of suicides and suicide attempts. Fourth, only two trials had publicly available protocols or trial registrations, and the certainty of the evidence was very low or low for all outcome results. Fifth, we planned several outcome comparisons, which increased the risk of type I errors. To control the risks of random errors, we adjusted our threshold for significance according to the number of primary and secondary outcomes, but we did not adjust the thresholds for significance according to the total number of comparisons, including exploratory outcomes, subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Sixth, due to poor reporting of the tricyclic antidepressant doses used in the included trials, it was not possible to define meaningful dose subgroups to compare the effects of different doses. Seventh, since we only identified one trial using 'active placebo', we could not adequately assess whether the nature of control intervention impacted results. Eighth, we included one trial using citalopram as a co-intervention, which may lead to different RRs for adverse events compared with other trials, but we assessed the potential differences with subgroup analyses. Ninth, we did not test the inter-rater reliability for our RoB 2 assessments. Tenth, since the included trials did not report serious adverse events according to the ICH-GCP definition and because the definition of serious adverse events was unclear, it was necessary to make a subjective assessment of the severity of the adverse events to decide if each event should be classified as a serious adverse event. However, the subjective assessments may be inaccurate as they rely on the specific adverse events chosen to be reported by the trialists — other serious adverse events might have occurred that the trialists did not assess or report. The information provided by the trialists about specific adverse events was often sparse (ie, adverse events were often only reported in tables and there was rarely information about the patients' specific events). Hence, the present results presumably underestimate the harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants. A subjective assessment of adverse events based on such information is therefore likely to be incomplete, but nevertheless, important data on adverse effects would not be available without this process. We believe that the present analysis of serious adverse events, a critical outcome of any drug trial, provides useful information regarding the adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants, and we have assessed serious adverse events using this methodology in several systematic reviews for over a decade. Still, the above-mentioned limitations should be considered when interpreting our results.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tricyclic antidepressant overdose, more specifically with respect to ECG, GEMNet 2011 guidelines recommend to examine serial ECG recordings for the presence of the following features that mark an increased risk of complications following TCA overdose:

- QRS prolongation (> 100 ms)

- QTc prolongation (> 430 ms)

- R/S ratio > 0.7 in lead aVR.

### The effects of tricyclic antidepressants on breast cancer risk [^3a9075f0]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We found that increasing exposure to any TCAs during years 11–15 was associated with a trend towards an increasing RR for breast cancer (Table 2). Post hoc analyses based on classifying the drugs according to their genotoxicity in Drosophila suggest that the use of genotoxic TCAs was responsible for the increased risk (amoxapine, clomipramine, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, trimipramine), while the use of the nongenotoxic TCAs was not associated with an increased risk (amitriptyline, maprotiline, nortriptyline, protriptyline).

Because our accrual of cases from the source population was nearly complete and our exposure data were collected routinely before the index date, there was little potential for selection and recall bias concerning exposure.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^041a0b27]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study

This study's strengths include its methodological rigor and the care taken in study design, data abstraction, and data analysis. However, our meta-analysis has several limitations. Firstly, one of the most important questions is whether tricyclics are better than other commonly used prophylactic treatments, such as β blockers or anticonvulsants. Unfortunately, few trials compare tricyclics head to head against other modalities and many of these comparisons seem to have been designed to put tricyclics at a disadvantage — for example, the average dose of tricyclics used in the comparison with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is lower than most clinicians would use in treating headaches. More comparative effectiveness trials are needed.

Secondly, because of the large number of analyses, caution is required in interpreting our finding of an association between treatment duration and efficacy. This analysis should be viewed as exploratory rather than definitive. Moreover, most trials were relatively short, particularly since headaches tend to be a chronic problem. The average duration of the trials in our study was 11 weeks and the longest only 26 weeks; consequently our timeline was constrained to four to 26 weeks. This finding is consistent with clinical experience. Many clinicians encourage their patients to take tricyclics for several months, during which the dose is slowly increased, before deciding to try a different prophylactic agent. This also suggests that treatment trials of longer duration are urgently needed.

Thirdly, it is impossible to differentiate whether treatment effect was independent of depression. The relation between depression and physical symptoms is well described. Patients with depression have more physical symptoms and report those symptoms as more severe and disabling than patients without depression. Depressed patients experience improvement in somatic problems when underlying depression is successfully treated. Patients with depression have also been found to have more headaches, although others have argued that this is a result of chronic underlying pain rather than the cause of it. The effects of tricyclic antidepressants on pain syndromes that are considered unrelated to depression, such as neuropathy, have led investigators to suggest a direct analgesic effect. Serotonin has been found to be an active neurotransmitter in the central modulation of pain, so there is a possible effect on pain mechanisms other than through depression. Given the short duration and low doses of tricyclics used for headaches compared with those needed to treat depression, it seems unlikely that the mechanism for the success of headache treatment in these trials is entirely due to the treatment of depression.

### Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care [^720feaa1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Concern has been expressed about the relevance of secondary care studies to primary care patients specifically about the effectiveness of antidepressant medication. There is a need to review the evidence of only those studies that have been conducted comparing antidepressant efficacy with placebo in primary care-based samples.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants in patients (under the age of 65 years) with depression in primary care.

Search Strategy

All searches were conducted in September 2007. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Controlled Trials Register was searched, together with a supplementary search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL and PSYNDEX. Abstracts of all possible studies for inclusion were assessed independently by two reviewers. Further trials were sought through searching the reference lists of studies initially identified and by scrutinising other relevant review papers. Selected authors and experts were also contacted.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected if they were randomised controlled trials of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo in adults. Older patients (over 65 years) were excluded. Patients had to be recruited from a primary care setting. For continuous outcomes the Hamilton Depression scale of the Montgomery Asberg Scale was requred.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted using data extraction forms by two reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion. A similar process was used for the validity assessment. Pooling of results was done using Review Manager 5. The primary outcome was depression reduction, based on a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using relative risk (RR), and on a continuous measure of depression symptoms, using the mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

There were fourteen studies (16 comparisons) with extractable data included in the review, of which ten studies examined TCAs, two examined SSRIs and two included both classes, all compared with placebo. The number of participants in the intervention groups was 1364 and in the placebo groups 919. Nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6–8 weeks. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed an RR of 1.24, 95% CI 1.11–1.38 in favour of TCAs against placebo. For SSRIs this was 1.28, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.43. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs ranged from 7 to 16 {median NNT 9} patient expected event rate ranged from 63% to 26% respectively) and for SSRIs from 7 to 8 {median NNT 7} (patient expected event rate ranged from 48% to 42% respectively). The numbers needed to harm (NNH for withdrawal due to side effects) ranged from 4 to 30 for TCAs (excluding three studies with no harmful events leading to withdrawal) and 20 to 90 for SSRIs.

Authors' Conclusions

Both TCAs and SSRIs are effective for depression treated in primary care.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants in the acute treatment of chronic depression and dysthymia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0388e04d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic depression represents a substantial portion of depressive disorders and is associated with severe consequences. This review examined the efficacy and acceptability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in the treatment of chronic depression. Additionally, the comparative effectiveness of the two types of antidepressants has been examined.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted in the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Primary efficacy outcome was a response to treatment; primary acceptance outcome was dropping out of the study. Only randomized controlled trials were considered.

Results

We identified 20 studies with 22 relevant comparisons. 19 studies focused on samples with a majority of dysthymic patients. Both SSRIs and TCAs are efficacious in terms of response rates when compared to placebo (Benefit Ratio [BR] = 1.49; p < 0.001 for SSRIs and BR = 1.74; p < 0.001 for TCAs) and no statistically significant differences between the active drugs and placebo in terms of dropout rates could be found. No differences in effectiveness were found between SSRIs and TCAs in terms of response rates (BR = 1.01; p = 0.91), yet, SSRIs showed statistically better acceptability in terms of dropout rates than TCAs (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.41; p = 0.02).

Limitations

The methodological quality of the primary studies was evaluated as unclear in many cases and more evidence is needed to assess the efficacy of SSRIs and TCAs in patients suffering from chronic forms of depression other than dysthymia.

Conclusions

This systematic review provides evidence for the efficacy of both SSRIs and TCAs in the treatment of chronic depression and showed a better acceptability of SSRIs.

### Antidepressants for neuropathic pain [^083fea14]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2005 of The Cochrane Library. For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.

Objectives

To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 2005); EMBASE (1980 to Oct 2005); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators.

Selection Criteria

RCTs reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Sixty one trials of 20 antidepressants were considered eligible (3293 participants) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects. This update includes 11 additional studies (778 participants).

Main Results

Sixty one RCTs were included in total. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective and have an NNT of 3.6 (95% CI 3 to 4.5) RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer SSRIs but no studies of SNRIs were found. Venlafaxine (three studies) has an NNT of 3.1 (95% CI 2.2 to 5.1) RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.1). There were insufficient data to assess effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4 (95% CI 5.2 to 29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.7 (95% CI 2 to 4.1), RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.1) (four studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm (NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 28 (95% CI 17.6 to 68.9) for amitriptyline and 16.2 (95% CI 8 to 436) for venlafaxine. The NNH for minor adverse effects was 6 (95% CI 4.2 to 10.7) for amitriptyline and 9.6 (95% CI 3.5 to 13) for venlafaxine.

Authors' Conclusions

This update has provided additional confirmation on the effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant - venlafaxine. There is still limited evidence for the role of SSRIs. Whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain (pre-emptive use) is still unclear. Both TCAs and venlafaxine have NNTs of approximately three. This means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs. SSRIs are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required.

### Antidepressants plus benzodiazepines for adults with major depression [^6c332e3c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anxiety frequently coexists with depression and adding benzodiazepines to antidepressant treatment is common practice to treat people with major depression. However, more evidence is needed to determine whether this combined treatment is more effective and not any more harmful than antidepressants alone. It has been suggested that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long-term administration and their chronic use carries risks of dependence. This is the 2019 updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2005. This update follows a new protocol to conform with the most recent Cochrane methodology guidelines, with the inclusion of 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE evaluations for quality of evidence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of combining antidepressants with benzodiazepines compared with antidepressants alone for major depression in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to May 2019. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any additional unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine treatment with antidepressants alone for adults with major depression. We excluded studies administering psychosocial therapies targeted at depression and anxiety disorders concurrently. Antidepressants had to be prescribed, on average, at or above the minimum effective dose as presented by Hansen 2009 or according to the North American or European regulations. The combination therapy had to last at least four weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We entered data into Review Manager 5. We used intention-to-treat data. We combined continuous outcome variables of depressive and anxiety severity using standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Regarding the primary outcome of acceptability, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies.

Main Results

We identified 10 studies published between 1978 to 2002 involving 731 participants. Six studies used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), two studies used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), one study used another heterocyclic antidepressant and one study used TCA or heterocyclic antidepressant. Combined therapy of benzodiazepines plus antidepressants was more effective than antidepressants alone for depressive severity in the early phase (four weeks) (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.03; 10 studies, 598 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was no difference between treatments in the acute phase (five to 12 weeks) (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.03; 7 studies, 347 participants; low-quality evidence) or in the continuous phase (more than 12 weeks) (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.35; 1 study, 50 participants; low-quality evidence). For acceptability of treatment, there was no difference in the dropouts due to any reason between combined therapy and antidepressants alone (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate-quality evidence). For response in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58; 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.35; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.29; 1 study, 52 participants). For remission in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.90, 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.16; 1 study, 52 participants). There was no evidence of a difference between combined therapy and antidepressants alone for anxiety severity in the early phase (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.67 to 0.14; 3 studies, 129 participants) or in the acute phase (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.10; 3 studies, 129 participants). No studies measured severity of insomnia. In terms of adverse effects, the dropout rates due to adverse events were lower for combined therapy than for antidepressants alone (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, participants in the combined therapy group reported at least one adverse effect more often than participants who received antidepressants alone (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23; 7 studies, 510 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Most domains of risk of bias in the majority of the included studies were unclear. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and selective outcome reporting were problematic due to insufficient details reported in most of the included studies and lack of availability of the study protocols. The greatest limitation in the quality of evidence was issues with attrition.

Authors' Conclusions

Combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in improving depression severity, response in depression and remission in depression in the early phase. However, these effects were not maintained in the acute or the continuous phase. Combined therapy resulted in fewer dropouts due to adverse events than antidepressants alone, but combined therapy was associated with a greater proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. The moderate quality evidence of benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant in the early phase must be balanced judiciously against possible harms and consideration given to other alternative treatment strategies when antidepressant monotherapy may be considered inadequate. We need long-term, pragmatic randomised controlled trials to compare combination therapy against the monotherapy of antidepressant in major depression.

Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)

There is " insufficient evidence" to make any conclusion on the efficacy of amitriptyline for the treatment of depression in PD. 2 Similar significant benefits were reported in the amitriptyline and sertraline arms of an open‐label randomized trial, which did not include a placebo arm. 2 Moreover, a recent review on the use of antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults 81 concluded, based on data from head‐to‐head studies, that amitriptyline was more effective than other antidepressants. The practice implications have been changed so that treatment of depression with TCAs is now considered " possibly useful". 81

### Modulation of neuroimmune cytokine networks by antidepressants: implications in mood regulation [^295b5daf]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

Despite the general mechanism of tricyclics involving the blockade of NE and, to a lesser extent, 5-HT reuptake, the individual molecules within this class exhibit heterogeneity. They enhance noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission across different spectrums, and each molecule blocks M1, α1, and H1 receptors with varying affinities, potentially influencing immunomodulation. This complexity makes it challenging to distinguish the effects of individual neurotransmitter systems on cytokine production within this class of drugs.

Notably, desipramine, a potent TCA, has been shown to inhibit TNF-α production and increase the release of IL-10, favoring a Th2 response. Studies on TCAs (imipramine, clomipramine) indicate that this class of molecules inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-2, TNF-α, and IFNγ. Likewise, Obuchowicz et al. demonstrated that amitriptyline and nortriptyline similarly reduced the release of IL-1β and TNF-α by rat glial cells when stimulated in vitro by LPS.

However, the effects on IL-6 seem to vary, with one clinical study reporting an increase in IL-6 following TCA administration, while other preclinical studies show reductions, and others indicating no change. On the other hand, TCAs stimulate the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

Study selection and data abstraction

We selected articles for inclusion in two stages. In the first stage two researchers (PGO'M, KJD) independently reviewed titles and abstracts to select full text articles for retrieval. A priori we decided to include all articles recommended by either reviewer for full text retrieval. Agreement was only modest during this stage (κ = 0.66). During the second stage two other researchers (LS, MD) independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria using standardised forms. Agreement was good (κ = 0.86); during this stage, disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Two authors (WS, JLJ) independently abstracted data using standardised forms. Data abstracted included information about the study (setting, country, language, inclusion and exclusion criteria), information about the intervention (design, characteristics of treatment, such as dose and duration), characteristics of the participants (age, sex, ethnicity, assessment of comorbid psychiatric disease), and treatment related patient reported outcomes for headache (frequency, intensity or severity, duration, global improvement or relief, analgesics used, adverse events). For continuous outcomes we abstracted the number of participants, the mean, and the variance. We calculated missing variances from reported P values. For dichotomous outcomes we abstracted data into 2×2 tables, requiring at least 50% clinical improvement in headache. Studies reporting less than 50% improvement were not abstracted. We assessed article quality independently and in duplicate (DB, JLJ) using the risk of bias assessment tool developed by the Cochrane collaboration, with good inter-rater agreement (Cochrane: κ = 0.83). Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Efficacy of venlafaxine compared with tricyclic antidepressants in depressive disorder: a meta-analysis [^4ff09734]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

With respect to the pharmacological characteristic, venlafaxine is comparable with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and venlafaxine might be comparable in efficacy. We performed a systematic review investigating the relative efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine compared with TCAs (imipramine, clomipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline and desipramine). Relevant double-blind randomised trials were identified from systematic searches of electronic databases. An exact analysis of the estimated odds ratios of response of the TCA relative to venlafaxine showed no overall significance of treatment effect (P = 0.38). The odds ratios were not homogenous across studies (P = 0.0213). The average dose of venlafaxine was 103.5 mg/day and for the TCA 106.1 mg/day. An exact analysis of the estimated odds ratios of the withdrawals and side effects in the trials with a TCA relative to venlafaxine showed no overall significance of withdrawal. From our review, no significant difference in treatment effect between low dose of both venlafaxine and the TCAs could be found. In our opinion, because of the heterogeneity of the odds ratios, one cannot conclude that they are of equal efficacy.

### Extracorporeal treatment for tricyclic antidepressant poisoning: recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^823fb9a5]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Overview of Tricyclic Antidepressant Poisoning

TCAs continue to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in poisoned patients and are responsible for nearly half of all fatalities reported due to antidepressants.

The clinical features of TCA poisoning are largely an extension of their pharmacologic actions described above. Antihistaminic- and anticholinergic- mediated effects typically result in altered mental status ranging from agitation and delirium to central nervous system depression and coma. Other anticholinergic effects (dry flushed skin, tachycardia, ileus, mydriasis, urinary retention, and hyperthermia) are usually present. Seizures result from anticholinergic and GABA-A antagonism, while the cardiovascular effects are caused by muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic blockade. These effects are manifested by tachycardia, peripheral vasodilation, and hypotension. Sodium channel blockade and the resulting delayed depolarization can cause wide complex arrhythmias, AV conduction disturbances, and myocardial depression, which are the primary cause of death in TCA overdose. Most deaths occur in the prehospital environment and are reported in the first few hours after presentation.

Many exposures to TCA will result in benign courses requiring little or no treatment at all. The incidence of severe rhythm disturbances is rare, while hypotension and coma and seizures are more frequent. Predicting which patients will develop severe toxicity is still debated. A range of toxic doses of approximately 5–20 mg/kg is often cited, but the reported ingested dose of TCA is neither reliable nor a good predictor of outcome. Serum testing is not generally routinely available and concentrations are less predictive than electrocardiogram (ECG) findings to identify high-risk patients: QRS duration is a better predictor of seizures and ventricular arrhythmia than serum concentrationsand an R wave in aVR of more than 3 mm had a good predictive value for seizures or arrhythmias.

The management of patients poisoned with TCAs includes general proactive care directed at securing the patient's airway and treating seizures with benzodiazepines. Hypotension can be a consequence of decreased vascular resistance and should be initially treated with fluid challenges, or secondary to myocardial depression and arrhythmias. An ECG should be performed to identify hallmarks of TCA sodium channel blockade (ventricular arrhythmia, QRS widening, Brugada-like pattern, or terminal axis deviation of the QRS, e.g. prominent R wave in aVR). Gastrointestinal decontamination may be indicated if the patient presents early after ingestion, and is discussed more extensively elsewhere–.

### Amitriptyline versus other types of pharmacotherapy for depression [^0f06d4c9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For many years amitriptyline has been considered one of the reference compounds for the pharmacological treatment of depression. However, new tricyclic drugs, heterocyclic compounds and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been introduced on the market with the claim of a more favourable tolerability/efficacy profile.

Objectives

The aim of the present systematic review was to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of amitriptyline in comparison with the other tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressants and with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (2002–3) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched. Key journals and conference abstracts were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies were contacted for information on unpublished materials.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Study participants were of either sex and any age with a primary diagnosis of depression. Included trials compared amitriptyline with another tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressant or with one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted using a standardised form. The number of patients undergoing the randomisation procedure, the number of patients who completed the study and the number of improved patients were extracted. In addition, group mean scores at the end of the trial on Hamilton Depression Scale or any other depression scale were extracted. In the tolerability analysis, the number of patients failing to complete the study and the number of patients complaining of side-effects was extracted.

Main Results

The estimate of the overall odds ratio for responders showed that more subjects responded to amitriptyline in comparison with the control antidepressant group (odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.23, number needed to treat 50). The estimate of the efficacy of amitriptyline and control agents on a continuous outcome revealed an effect size which also significantly favoured amitriptyline (Standardised Mean Difference 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.04, 0.23). Whilst these differences are statistically significant, their clinical significance is less clear. When the efficacy analysis was stratified by drug class, no difference in outcome emerged between amitriptyline and either tricyclic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor comparators. The dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and control agents was similar; however, the estimate of the proportion of patients who experienced side-effects significantly favoured control agents in comparison with amitriptyline (odds ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.56, 0.71). When the tolerability analysis was stratified by drug class, the dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors significantly favoured the latter (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.75,0.95, number needed to harm 40). When the responder analysis was stratified by study setting amitriptyline was more effective than control ADs in inpatients (odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.42, number needed to treat 24), but not in outpatients (odds ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.88, 1.17, number needed to treat = 200).

Reviewer's Conclusions

This present systematic review indicates that amitriptyline is at least as efficacious as other tricyclics or newer compounds. However, the burden of side-effects in patients receiving it was greater. In comparison with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors amitriptyline was less well tolerated, and although counterbalanced by a higher proportion of responders, the difference was not statistically significant.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^763edeb3]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Tricyclics versus other drugs

Few studies compared tricyclics with other modalities. No studies compared β blockers and tricyclics for tension-type headaches; among three studies of migraine headaches, tricyclics and β blockers did not differ in reduction of number of headaches or attacks (average standardised mean difference 0.90, 95% confidence interval −0.38 to 2.18, I² = 93.8%) and in two studies did not differ in the likelihood of experiencing at least 50% reduction in the number of headaches (relative risk 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 1.44, I² = 0.0%). Three of the studies used amitriptyline and one used clomipramine; the average dose for both was 100 mg.

Two studies of tension-type headaches compared tricyclics with buspirone (amitriptyline 50 mg) and found no differences (buspirone: average standardised mean difference −1.01, 95% confidence interval −1.83 to −0.18, I² = 0.00%, table 4). Two studies compared tricyclics (amitriptyline 25 mg, clomipramine 150 mg) with tetracyclics and found no difference (average standardised mean difference −0.21, −0.65 to 0.22, I² = 32.8%). A single study of tension-type headache found no difference between low dose amitriptyline (25 mg) and the serotonin antagonist ritanserin (−0.49, −1.70 to 0.71). One study found that amitriptyline (75 mg) was better than timed release dihydroergotamine for migraines (−6.57, −8.44 to −4.71). In addition, two trials compared amitriptyline (maximum doses 100 mg and 150 mg) with the anticonvulsant topiramate (0.05, −0.32 to 0.33, I² = 29.2%, table 4) and one (amitriptyline 75 mg) with the calcium channel blocker flunarazine (relative risk 1.60, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 3.10, table 5) in migraine headaches, and found no differences.

### What is the role of lidocaine or phenytoin in tricyclic antidepressant-induced cardiotoxicity? [^e0499fdf]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) poisoning is a relatively common occurrence and remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. Deaths from TCA toxicity are typically due to cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias and hypotension. Cardiovascular toxicity may be multifactorial. However, the primary mechanism is a TCA-induced membrane-depressant or "quinidine-like" effect on the myocardium resulting in slowing down of phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential and subsequent impairment of conduction through the His-Purkinje system and myocardium. This effect is manifest as QRS prolongation on the EKG, atrioventricular (AV) block, and impairment in automaticity leading to hypotension and ventricular dysrhythmia. Primary treatment strategies include sodium bicarbonate, hypertonic saline, and correction of any conditions that may aggravate this toxicity such as acidosis, hyperthermia, and hypotension. In cases of severe TCA toxicity, administration of sodium bicarbonate may be insufficient to correct the cardiac conduction defects. Use of lidocaine or phenytoin, both Vaughan Williams Class IB antiarrhythmic agents, has been reported as an effective adjunctive therapy in cases of severe cardiotoxicity.

Methods

Thirty articles of interest were identified by searching PubMed, abstracts from meetings, and the reference sections of related primary and review articles and toxicological texts. ROLE OF LIDOCAINE AND PHENYTOIN: Lidocaine and phenytoin also cause sodium channel blockade, but unlike Class IA or IC agents do not depress phase 0 depolarization in healthy cardiac tissue. Lidocaine and phenytoin dissociate relatively quickly from cardiac sodium channels. Sodium channels have faster recovery times after exposure to lidocaine (1–2 s) and phenytoin (0.71 s), than with some TCAs such as amitriptyline (13.6 s), but not others (e.g., imipramine at 1.6 s). In experimental models of amitriptyline poisoning, lidocaine co-administration resulted in decreased sodium channel blockade compared to amitriptyline alone. This correlated with clinical improvement, including normalization of QRS interval, improved hypotension, and decreased mortality. It is postulated that lidocaine's rapid binding to the sodium channel may directly displace slower acting agents from the channel, leaving more channels unbound, and therefore be able to facilitate cardiac conduction. Phenytoin may act through a similar mechanism as lidocaine, although experimental studies suggest that it does not compete directly for the same sodium channel binding site as TCAs. Allosteric modulation of the TCA binding site may occur in the setting of phenytoin use. The evidence for using phenytoin in treating TCA-induced sodium channel blockade is less convincing than that for lidocaine. Human trials are limited to case series and, in most human exposures in which there appeared to be efficacy, the toxicity was not severe.

Conclusions

Although there appears to be more evidence for the use of lidocaine than phenytoin as adjunctive treatment for TCA-associated cardiotoxicity, specific clinical indications and dosing recommendations remain to be defined. We recommend the use of lidocaine in cases in which cardiotoxicity (arrhythmias, hypotension) is refractory to treatment with sodium bicarbonate or hypertonic saline, or in which physiological derangement (e.g., severe alkalosis or hypernatremia) limits effective use of these primary strategies.

### Guidelines in Emergency Medicine Network (GEMNet): guideline for the management of tricyclic antidepressant overdose [^56dd28ff]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for tricyclic antidepressant overdose, more specifically with respect to management of hypotension, GEMNet 2011 guidelines recommend to consider using epinephrine as a first-line vasopressor in patients with TCA overdose, as it may be superior to norepinephrine for treating refractory hypotension and preventing arrhythmias.

### Antidepressants for insomnia in adults [^a09ba34c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Insomnia disorder is a subjective condition of unsatisfactory sleep (e.g. sleep onset, maintenance, early waking, impairment of daytime functioning). Insomnia disorder impairs quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of physical and mental health problems including anxiety, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and increased health service use. hypnotic medications (e.g. benzodiazepines and 'Z' drugs) are licensed for sleep promotion, but can induce tolerance and dependence, although many people remain on long-term treatment. Antidepressant use for insomnia is widespread, but none is licensed for insomnia and the evidence for their efficacy is unclear. This use of unlicensed medications may be driven by concern over longer-term use of hypnotics and the limited availability of psychological treatments.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of antidepressants for insomnia in adults.

Search Methods

This review incorporated the results of searches to July 2015 conducted on electronic bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to 2015), Embase (1980 to 2015) and PsycINFO (1806 to 2015). We updated the searches to December 2017, but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (aged 18 years or older) with a primary diagnosis of insomnia and all participant types including people with comorbidities. Any antidepressant as monotherapy at any dose whether compared with placebo, other medications for insomnia (e.g. benzodiazepines and 'Z' drugs), a different antidepressant, waiting list control or treatment as usual.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data using a data extraction form. A third review author resolved disagreements on inclusion or data extraction.

Main Results

The search identified 23 RCTs (2806 participants). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo: three studies (135 participants) compared SSRIs with placebo. Combining results was not possible. Two paroxetine studies showed significant improvements in subjective sleep measures at six (60 participants, P = 0.03) and 12 weeks (27 participants, P < 0.001). There was no difference in the fluoxetine study (low quality evidence). There were either no adverse events or they were not reported (very low quality evidence). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) compared with placebo: six studies (812 participants) compared TCA with placebo; five used doxepin and one used trimipramine. We found no studies of amitriptyline. Four studies (518 participants) could be pooled, showing a moderate improvement in subjective sleep quality over placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.21) (moderate quality evidence). Moderate quality evidence suggested that TCAs possibly improved sleep efficiency (mean difference (MD) 6.29 percentage points, 95% CI 3.17 to 9.41; 4 studies; 510 participants) and increased sleep time (MD 22.88 minutes, 95% CI 13.17 to 32.59; 4 studies; 510 participants). There may have been little or no impact on sleep latency (MD -4.27 minutes, 95% CI -9.01 to 0.48; 4 studies; 510 participants). There may have been little or no difference in adverse events between TCAs and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; 6 studies; 812 participants) (low quality evidence)'. ther' antidepressants with placebo: eight studies compared other antidepressants with placebo (one used mianserin and seven used trazodone). Three studies (370 participants) of trazodone could be pooled, indicating a moderate improvement in subjective sleep outcomes over placebo (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.02). Two studies of trazodone measured polysomnography and found little or no difference in sleep efficiency (MD 1.38 percentage points, 95% CI -2.87 to 5.63; 169 participants) (low quality evidence). There was low quality evidence from two studies of more adverse effects with trazodone than placebo (i.e. morning grogginess, increased dry mouth and thirst).

Authors' Conclusions

We identified relatively few, mostly small studies with short-term follow-up and design limitations. The effects of SSRIs compared with placebo are uncertain with too few studies to draw clear conclusions. There may be a small improvement in sleep quality with short-term use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone compared with placebo. The tolerability and safety of antidepressants for insomnia is uncertain due to limited reporting of adverse events. There was no evidence for amitriptyline (despite common use in clinical practice) or for long-term antidepressant use for insomnia. High-quality trials of antidepressants for insomnia are needed.

### Amitriptyline for depression [^8f1bdcdb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

For many years amitriptyline has been considered one of the reference compounds for the pharmacological treatment of depression. However, new tricyclic drugs, heterocyclic compounds and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been introduced on the market with the claim of a more favourable tolerability/efficacy profile.

Objectives

The aim of the present systematic review was to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of amitriptyline in comparison with the other tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressants and with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies) was searched on 28-11-2005. Reference lists of all included studies were checked.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Study participants were of either sex and any age with a primary diagnosis of depression. Included trials compared amitriptyline with another tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressant or with one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted using a standardised form. The number of patients undergoing the randomisation procedure, the number of patients who completed the study and the number of improved patients were extracted. In addition, group mean scores at the end of the trial on Hamilton Depression Scale or any other depression scale were extracted. In the tolerability analysis, the number of patients failing to complete the study and the number of patients complaining of side-effects were extracted.

Main Results

A total number of 194 studies were included in the review. The estimate of the overall odds ratio (OR) for responders showed that more subjects responded to amitriptyline in comparison with the control antidepressant group (OR 1.12 to 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.23, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 50). The estimate of the efficacy of amitriptyline and control agents on a continuous outcome revealed an effect size which also significantly favoured amitriptyline (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.23). Whilst these differences are statistically significant, their clinical significance is less clear. When the efficacy analysis was stratified by drug class, no difference in outcome emerged between amitriptyline and either tricyclic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor comparators. The dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and control agents was similar; however, the estimate of the proportion of patients who experienced side-effects significantly favoured control agents in comparison with amitriptyline (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74). When the tolerability analysis was stratified by drug class, the dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors significantly favoured the latter (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 40). When the responder analysis was stratified by study setting amitriptyline was more effective than control antidepressants in inpatients (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42, NNTB = 24), but not in outpatients (OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.88 to 1.17, NNTB = 200).

Authors' Conclusions

This present systematic review indicates that amitriptyline is at least as efficacious as other tricyclics or newer compounds. However, the burden of side-effects in patients receiving it was greater. In comparison with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors amitriptyline was less well tolerated, and although counterbalanced by a higher proportion of responders, the difference was not statistically significant.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^db76e6ed]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Because reported measures for headache varied, a priori we preferentially abstracted and pooled data on headache measures in this order: frequency of headache, intensity of headache, and headache index, per the recommendations of the reviewers of our Cochrane protocol. For frequency we used the number of headache attacks for migraines and number of days with headache for tension-type headaches. Intensity was abstracted in the scale used by each study; some studies used visual analogue scales, others used other continuous measures of intensity. Many studies used a "headache index" to sum aspects of the burden of headache, usually derived by multiplying the frequency of the headache by intensity. In addition we pooled analgesic use. Because of differences in measurement of headache burden between studies, we pooled standardised differences between studies, a measure also known as an effect size. By convention, effect sizes greater than 0.8 are considered as large, those between 0.6 and 0.8 as moderate, and those between 0.2 and 0.6 as small.

Fig 4 Likelihood of experiencing at least 50% reduction in tension-type and migraine headaches compared with placebo. Trials of mixed and migraine headaches are combined

Tricyclics also reduced the number of doses of analgesics taken for acute headache pain for both tension-type headaches (average standardised mean difference −1.71, 95% confidence interval −3.37 to −0.05, six studies, I² = 14.5%) and migraine headaches (−0.94, −1.87 to −0.02, four studies, I² = 32.6%).

Individual adverse effects of tricyclics compared with placebo were variably reported among the studies. In seven comparison arms, patients taking tricyclics were more likely to report "any" side effect than those taking placebo (relative risk 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 3.02, I² = 85.9%, fig 5). Among 10 individual adverse effects, only dry mouth (2.34, 1.63 to 3.35, I² = 43.3%) and drowsiness (1.87, 1.25 to 2.70, I² = 55.1%) were statistically more frequent in patients receiving tricyclics than in those receiving placebo (table 3). The likelihood of withdrawing due to adverse effects, however, did not differ among 16 placebo controlled trials (1.21, 0.80 to 1.82, I² = 74.1%, fig 5).

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^60c4ab4b]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Findings

A total of 103 trials randomising 10 590 participants were included (figure 1). Most trials (92/103) included both men and women between 18 and 65 years of age with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (online supplemental table S1). Ten trials only included elderly participants (defined by trialists as above 50–65 years). The mean HDRS baseline scores ranged from 17.4 to 45.5 (online supplemental table S1). Both the experimental and the control participants in eight trials also received a co-intervention, such as psychotherapy or other drugs. The included trials assessed the effects of different tricyclic antidepressants: imipramine (50 trials), amitriptyline (31 trials), nortriptyline (8 trials), desipramine (6 trials), dothiepin (4 trials), tianeptine (4 trial), doxepin (3 trials), clomipramine (2 trials), amoxapine (1 trial), cianopramine (1 trial), lofepramine (1 trial)and maprotiline (1 trial). Inert placebos were used in 102 trials, while only one trial used 'active placebo' as control intervention. All trials were assessed at overall high risk of bias (figure 2). Ninety-four trials (91%) were at risk of for-profit bias (online supplemental table S1). Most trials did not adequately report the proportion of participants with missing data at follow-up, and it was therefore not possible to perform 'best-worst/worst-best' sensitivity analyses.

Risk of bias (RoB) assessments.

Eleven of the included trials assessed outcomes after an extended period of treatment. However, in these trials it was either optional to extend the treatment and follow-up period or there were no available data. The trial authors excluded participants from the follow-ups in the extended phase, if they did not wish to extend their treatment, and we therefore chose to exclude these potentially biased data in our analyses. Four other trials assessed outcomes up to 18 months after treatment completion, but no relevant outcomes were reported at these time points.

The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. In one analysis, tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) benefits were no longer statistically significant when limited to studies with ≥ 50 patients per treatment group, and the population studied was predominantly female with indirectness as the population had FMS and not CMI. The benefits to pain relief and improvements in QoL outweighed AEs except for amitriptyline, which had more AEs than placebo but most were mild. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation.

### Paroxetine versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^3561e5b9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, these comparative studies provided contrasting findings and systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to paroxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of paroxetine in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs and newer or non-conventional agents.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents in alleviating the acute symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder.2. To review acceptability of treatment with paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.3. To investigate the adverse effects of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 30 September 2012), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing paroxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials allocating participants with major depression to paroxetine versus any other antidepressants (ADs), both conventional (such as TCAs, SSRIs) and newer or non-conventional (such as hypericum). For trials which had a cross-over design, only results from the first randomisation period were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were then entered in RevMan 5.2 with a double-entry procedure. Information extracted included study and participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and efficacy, acceptability and tolerability measures.

Main Results

A total of 115 randomised controlled trials (26,134 participants) were included. In 54 studies paroxetine was compared with older ADs, in 21 studies with another SSRI, and in 40 studies with a newer or non-conventional antidepressant other than SSRIs. For the primary outcome (patients who responded to treatment), paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine at increasing patients who responded early to treatment (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.66, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.87, number needed to treat to provide benefit (NNTb) = 16, 95% CI 10 to 50, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 1375 participants, moderate quality of evidence), and less effective than mirtazapine (OR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.02, NNTb = 8, 95% CI 5 to 14, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 726 participants, moderate quality of evidence). Paroxetine was less effective than citalopram in improving response to treatment (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.28, NNTb = 9, 95% CI 5 to 102, at six to 12 weeks, 1 RCT, 406 participants, moderate quality of evidence). We found no clear evidence that paroxetine was more or less effective compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at acute (six to 12 weeks), early (one to four weeks), or longer term follow-up (four to six months). Paroxetine was associated with a lower rate of adverse events than amitriptyline, imipramine and older ADs as a class, but was less well tolerated than agomelatine and hypericum. Included studies were generally at unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete reporting of outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Some possibly clinically meaningful differences between paroxetine and other ADs exist, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these findings. In terms of response, there was a moderate quality of evidence that citalopram was better than paroxetine in the acute phase (six to 12 weeks), although only one study contributed data. In terms of early response to treatment (one to four weeks) there was moderate quality of evidence that mirtazapine was better than paroxetine and that paroxetine was better than reboxetine. However there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any time point. Even if some differences were identified, the findings from this review are better thought as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be reassuring to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Finally, most of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias, and were sponsored by the drug industry. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind.

### Fluoxetine versus other types of pharmacotherapy for depression [^9d190c63]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is common in primary care and it is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload. Treatment is predominantly pharmaceutical or psychological. Fluoxetine, the first of a group of antidepressant (AD) agents known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in comparison with tricyclic (TCA), heterocyclic and related ADs, and other SSRIs. These comparative studies provided contrasting findings. In addition, systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to fluoxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of fluoxetine in comparison with TCAs, SSRIs and newer agents.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine, compared with other ADs, in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression, and to review its acceptability.

Search Strategy

Relevant studies were located by searching the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline (1966–2004) and Embase (1974–2004). Non-English language articles were included.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs were included. For trials which have a crossover design only results from the first randomisation period were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two reviewers using a standard form. Responders to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: drop-outs were always included in this analysis. When data on drop-outs were carried forward and included in the efficacy evaluation, they were analysed according to the primary studies; when dropouts were excluded from any assessment in the primary studies, they were considered as treatment failures. Scores from continuous outcomes were analysed including patients with a final assessment or with the last observation carried forward. Tolerability data were analysed by calculating the proportion of patients who failed to complete the study and who experienced adverse reactions out of the total number of randomised patients. The primary analyses used a fixed effects approach, and presented Peto Odds Ratio (PetoOR) and Standardised Mean Difference (SMD).

Main Results

On a dichotomous outcome fluoxetine was less effective than dothiepin (PetoOR: 2.09, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.05), sertraline (PetoOR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.76), mirtazapine (PetoOR: 1.64, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.65) and venlafaxine (Peto OR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.70). On a continuous outcome, fluoxetine was more effective than ABT-200 (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) random effects: - 1.85, 95% CI - 2.25 to - 1.45) and milnacipran (SMD random effects: - 0.38, 95% CI - 0.71 to - 0.06); conversely, it was less effective than venlafaxine (SMD random effect: 0.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23), however these figures were of borderline statistical significance. Fluoxetine was better tolerated than TCAs considered as a group (PetoOR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89), and was better tolerated in comparison with individual ADs, in particular than amitriptyline (PetoOR: 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85) and imipramine (PetoOR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99), and among newer ADs than ABT-200 (PetoOR: 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.41), pramipexole (PetoOR: 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.47) and reboxetine (PetoOR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94).

Authors' Conclusions

There are statistically significant differences in terms of efficacy and tolerability between fluoxetine and certain ADs, but the clinical meaning of these differences is uncertain, and no definitive implications for clinical practice can be drawn. From a clinical point of view the analysis of antidepressants' safety profile (adverse effect and suicide risk) remains of crucial importance and more reliable data about these outcomes are needed. Waiting for more robust evidence, treatment decisions should be based on considerations of clinical history, drug toxicity, patient acceptability, and cost. We need for large, pragmatic trials, enrolling heterogeneous populations of patients with depression to generate clinically relevant information on the benefits and harms of competitive pharmacological options. A meta-analysis of individual patient data from the randomised trials is clearly necessary.

### Antidepressants and suicide risk in the United States, 1985–1999 [^f13a5662]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The role of antidepressants in suicide prevention is a major public health question. An association was hypothesized between the increase in the use of non-tricyclic antidepressant medications in the United States and the decline in the suicide rate during the years 1985–1999.

Method

The relationships between the suicide, antidepressant prescription, unemployment, and alcoholic beverage consumption rates were studied using generalized linear models. Suicide rates by antidepressant overdose were compared in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).

Results

From 1985 to 1999, the suicide rate fell 13.5%, with a greater decline among women, and antidepressant prescription rates increased over 4-fold, with the increase mostly due to SSRIs. Prescription rates for SSRIs and other second-generation antidepressants were both inversely associated with suicide rates (p = .03 and p = .02, respectively). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for unemployment and alcoholic beverage consumption rates, SSRI antidepressant prescription rates remained inversely associated with the national suicide rate (p = .03). Females received twice as many antidepressant prescriptions compared with males. The commonest prescription indication was mood disorders, the condition most often associated with suicide. SSRIs were associated with a lower risk of suicide by antidepressant overdose compared with TCAs.

Conclusion

The decline in the national suicide rate (1985–1999) appears to be associated with greater use of non-tricyclic antidepressants. Treatment of a greater proportion of mood disorders with SSRIs and other second-generation non-tricyclic antidepressants may further reduce the suicide rate. Controlled studies of the antisuicidal properties of antidepressants are needed in high-risk depressed patient populations.

Results

Characteristics of included reviews

Overall, 1732 records were identified, of which 948 were duplicates and therefore excluded. The remaining 784 records were screened by title and abstract, and the full texts of 184 potentially eligible reviews were read. After the exclusion of a further 158 reviews (see supplementary file 2 for reasons), 26 studies were included (fig 1).

Fig 1
Flow of studies through review

The 26 reviews, published between 2012 and 2022, included 156 unique trials and > 25 000 participants and covered 22 distinct pain conditions representing 42 distinct antidepressant versus placebo comparisons. Each condition was covered by one review, except for fibromyalgia (five reviews), neuropathic pain (two reviews), and chronic tension-type headache (two reviews). For these three conditions, each review provided data for a different antidepressant class. Table 1 describes the included reviews. In only three of the 156 trials did data overlap in more than one review (see supplementary file 7), yielding a corrected covered area of 0.07%. We explored the effect of removing the overlapping trials from the treatment effect estimates in the reviews in which they were included (see supplementary file 9).

Table 1
Characteristics of included reviews (n = 26)

SNRI = serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; TCA = tricyclic antidepressants; NDRI = noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitors; SARI = serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors; MAOI = monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

Treatment regimens

The 26 reviews provided efficacy estimates for eight classes of antidepressants. Efficacy estimates for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were provided in 12 reviews, followed by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in 11 reviews, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in eight reviews, tetracyclic/atypical antidepressants in four reviews, serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) in two reviews, and noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs)and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)in one trial each.

### Pain assessment and treatment in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system [^6a3f8037]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) — use and cautions in neuropathic pain for children with SNI: Nortriptyline and amitriptyline have been used to treat peripheral neuropathic pain, central neuropathic pain, and visceral hyperalgesia, with mechanisms including presynaptic reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin and anticholinergic properties that can cause sedation, constipation, and urinary retention; adverse effects can be lessened with a slow titration to the initial goal dose, and TCAs should be used cautiously with other medications that can result in serotonin syndrome and with awareness of potential cardiac dysrhythmia, including prolonged QT interval. Nortriptyline has a lower anticholinergic effect, although it is unclear whether this is clinically significant in children. Nortriptyline and amitriptyline are considered first- or second-line treatment of neuropathic pain in adults and have the benefit of once- or twice-daily dosing; given the lack of evidence in children with SNI and potential adverse effects, a TCA might be a reasonable second-line medication after a trial with a gabapentinoid in such children with recurrent pain behaviors, and a TCA can be started while continuing gabapentin, supported by 1 study identifying greater benefit with the combination of gabapentin and nortriptyline over either alone in adults.
