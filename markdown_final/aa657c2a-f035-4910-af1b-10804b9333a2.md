## Question

A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-day history of fever and neck pain that radiates to the jaw and ears. She has also noticed swelling in the front part of her throat since the onset of the pain. She reports feeling anxious and sweating profusely over the past 2 days. She has no history of major illness and takes no medication. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 140/70 mm Hg. Examination shows moist palms and a bilateral fine resting tremor of the outstretched hands. Examination of the neck shows a thyroid gland that is tender, firm, and enlarged. Serum studies show:\\nHemoglobin 12.7 g/dL\\nESR 65 mm/h\\nSerum\\nCreatinine 0.7 mg/dL\\nThyroid-stimulating hormone 0.063 μU/mL\\nTriiodothyronine (T3) 218 ng/dL\\nThyroxine (T4) 88 μg/dL\\n123I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of decreased uptake. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?'
A. Subacute thyroiditis
B. Thyroid lymphoma
C. Struma ovarii
D. Factitious hyperthyroidism

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis best fits a 33-year-old woman with fever, neck pain radiating to jaw and ears, a tender enlarged thyroid, thyrotoxicosis, elevated ESR, and a 123I scan showing low uptake. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical syndrome and whether it fits subacute thyroiditis. Then, I should verify the laboratory pattern of thyrotoxicosis and whether it reflects increased synthesis versus destructive release. Next, I will review the imaging findings, especially radioiodine uptake and ultrasound expectations. After that, I need to consider key differentials such as Graves' disease, thyroid lymphoma, struma ovarii, and factitious hyperthyroidism, and check which features exclude them. Finally, I will synthesize the diagnosis and outline immediate management implications with guideline support.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. The combination of fever, neck pain radiating to the jaw and ears, and a tender, firm, diffusely enlarged thyroid strongly suggests subacute thyroiditis, which is classically painful and often follows a viral prodrome; the patient's age and sex also fit the typical demographic of SAT, and the presence of adrenergic symptoms (anxiety, sweating, tremor) aligns with thyrotoxicosis from destructive thyroiditis rather than primary hyperthyroidism [^115Szv29].

> Wait, let me verify the laboratory pattern before I jump ahead. Suppressed TSH with elevated free T4 and T3 supports thyrotoxicosis, but I need to check whether this reflects increased synthesis versus hormone release from follicular destruction; in SAT, the thyrotoxicosis is due to unregulated release of preformed hormone, often with a relatively greater rise in T4 than T3, and inflammatory markers such as ESR are typically elevated, which matches this case with ESR 65 mm/h and a T4-predominant pattern on the reported values, although I should double-check the exact free hormone assays to confirm the ratio [^117E4w72].

> I will now examine the imaging. The 123I scan showing multiple areas of decreased uptake is highly characteristic of SAT, reflecting impaired iodine organification and transport due to follicular cell damage; in contrast, Graves' disease typically shows diffusely increased uptake, so this low-uptake pattern argues strongly for destructive thyroiditis rather than hyperthyroidism from increased synthesis [^117E4w72] [^112Xv2Rw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the differential and actively exclude alternatives. Graves' disease would usually present with painless goiter, ophthalmopathy or dermopathy, and diffusely increased radioiodine uptake, none of which are present here, making Graves' unlikely despite the thyrotoxic labs; thyroid lymphoma can rarely mimic SAT with pain and elevated ESR, but it is uncommon at this age and would more often present as a fixed, non-tender mass without the classic migratory pain and low uptake pattern, so it remains less likely here; struma ovarii would not explain a tender thyroid or low neck uptake; factitious hyperthyroidism typically shows suppressed thyroglobulin and a clinical picture inconsistent with a painful goiter and low uptake, so that does not fit either [^117E4w72] [^112ovPJu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if the low uptake could reflect iodine contamination or recent contrast, but I should confirm whether there is any such history here; the vignette does not suggest excess iodine exposure, and the constellation of tender goiter, elevated ESR, and thyrotoxicosis with low uptake remains pathognomonic for SAT even without explicit iodine history, reinforcing the diagnosis in this context [^117E4w72] [^112Xv2Rw].

> Let me synthesize. The diagnosis is subacute thyroiditis, given the classic painful goiter with migratory radiation, thyrotoxicosis from destructive release, markedly elevated ESR, and diffusely low radioiodine uptake; management should focus on symptomatic relief with NSAIDs and beta-blockade, reserving corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe symptoms, and anticipating a transient hypothyroid phase in some patients with periodic thyroid function monitoring over 6–12 months [^117E4w72] [^112Xv2Rw].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **subacute thyroiditis** (de Quervain's thyroiditis) [^117E4w72], given the classic triad of painful thyroiditis, elevated inflammatory markers, and a low radioiodine uptake scan [^112Xv2Rw] with biochemical thyrotoxicosis from hormone release rather than increased synthesis [^117E4w72]. The other options are inconsistent: thyroid lymphoma lacks the typical thyrotoxicosis and scan pattern [^notfound]; struma ovarii would not cause a tender goiter or low uptake; and factitious hyperthyroidism would show low thyroglobulin and no goiter [^notfound].

## Clinical features supporting subacute thyroiditis

- **Neck pain radiating to jaw and ears**: Characteristic of subacute thyroiditis, often severe and migratory [^112Xv2Rw] [^1154iuQB].
- **Tender, firm, enlarged thyroid**: Typical on exam [^1154iuQB] [^1178Ld6q].
- **Fever and systemic symptoms**: Common in subacute thyroiditis [^112Xv2Rw] [^111rFbYX].
- **Hyperthyroid symptoms**: Anxiety, sweating, tremor, and tachycardia reflect released hormone, not increased synthesis [^117E4w72] [^113GTR64].

---

## Laboratory findings supporting subacute thyroiditis

- **Suppressed TSH with elevated T3 and T4**: Indicates thyrotoxicosis from hormone release [^117E4w72].
- **Elevated ESR**: Reflects inflammation; typical in subacute thyroiditis [^112Xv2Rw] [^111teRv5].
- **Normal creatinine and hemoglobin**: No renal failure or significant anemia, supporting inflammatory thyroiditis [^notfound].

---

## Imaging findings supporting subacute thyroiditis

Imaging findings supporting subacute thyroiditis include an **enlarged thyroid with multiple areas of decreased uptake** on the 123I scan, which is classic for subacute thyroiditis [^notfound]. Ultrasound typically shows **diffuse hypoechogenicity with reduced vascularity**, consistent with inflammatory thyroiditis [^111Sy8Qv] [^111teRv5].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

| **Diagnosis** | **Reasons for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| Thyroid lymphoma | - Rare <br/> - Typically painless <br/> - No thyrotoxicosis <br/> - Scan not typical [^notfound] |
| Struma ovarii | - Ovarian teratoma with thyroid tissue <br/> - No thyroid tenderness or goiter <br/> - Scan pattern differs [^notfound] |
| Factitious hyperthyroidism | - No goiter <br/> - Low thyroglobulin <br/> - History of thyroid hormone ingestion [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The diagnosis is **subacute thyroiditis** [^117E4w72]. Management is supportive — NSAIDs, beta-blockers for symptoms, and corticosteroids if needed — with monitoring for transient hypothyroidism [^112Xv2Rw].

Case presentation

A 27-year-old women in the 17 th week of gestation in her first pregnancy presented to the Endocrinology Department of our hospital complaining of neck pain for one month that had intensified in the last five days. The neck pain appeared at the 12 th week of gestation, which was on the left side without any obvious cause and radiated to the jaw. It was initially tolerable, and there were no other symptoms, such as chills, fever, palpitations, tremor, or sweating. The pain gradually shifted to the right side and the patient requested no medication for her discomfort. In the 17 th week of gestation, the patient suffered from severe neck pain, which seriously affected quality of life and sleep and she expressed a strong willingness to undergo treatment.

The patient had throat pain for 3 days before pregnancy, which improved without treatment and had no personal or family history of thyroid disease. Her menstrual cycle was regular before pregnancy. She had an axillary temperature of 37.4 °C, increased resting heart rate of 98 beats/min, and normal blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg in our hospital. Physical examination revealed bilateral enlargement of the thyroid gland that was firm and tender to palpation.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnosis and management include characteristic pain radiating to the ears, jaw, or throat with malaise, low-grade fever, and fatigue; laboratory markers show that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein is elevated, mild anemia is common, RAIU is low, and ultrasonography shows diffuse heterogeneity with decreased or normal color-flow Doppler. Patients with mild symptomatic subacute thyroiditis should be treated initially with beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and those failing to respond or with moderate-to-severe symptoms should be treated with corticosteroids. 1/+00 NSAIDs should be considered first-line therapy; if full doses over several days fail, use corticosteroids such as prednisone 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer depending upon clinical response. During the hypothyroid stage, levothyroxine may be employed but should be withdrawn after 3–6 months with recovery of normal function verified by thyroid function testing.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 60-year-old man, long time smoker, presents with a one month history of marked pain and swelling of the left side of his neck. The pain radiated to the left ear and to the sternum area. In the neck, there was a hard, painful tumour, about 6 cm in diameter. The patient denied any other symptoms, including fever and dyspnoea. Three weeks earlier, the patient was diagnosed with SAT by an internal medicine specialists at an outpatient clinic. The diagnosis was based only on the neck pain and ESR up to 84 mm/h. Neither US nor other additional diagnostic procedures were performed. A treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) was started, but no improvement of the patient's condition was achieved. Thus, the patient decided to come to the emergency room of our hospital. The laboratory results obtained in our Department are presented in Table 1.

### Subacute thyroiditis after sars-COV-2 infection [^116sZiHr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a thyroid disease of viral or postviral origin. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly worldwide and Italy has been severely affected by this outbreak.

Objectives

The objective of this work is to report the first case of SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of an 18-year-old woman who came to our attention for fever, neck pain radiated to the jaw, and palpitations occurring 15 days after a SARS-CoV-2-positive oropharyngeal swab. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been mild and the patient had completely recovered in a few days.

Results

At physical examination the patient presented with a slightly increased heart rate and a painful and enlarged thyroid on palpation. At laboratory exams free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine were high, thyrotropin undetectable, and inflammatory markers and white blood cell count elevated. Bilateral and diffuse hypoechoic areas were detected at neck ultrasound. One month earlier, thyroid function and imaging both were normal. We diagnosed SAT and the patient started prednisone. Neck pain and fever recovered within 2 days and the remaining symptoms within 1 week. Thyroid function and inflammatory markers normalized in 40 days.

Conclusions

We report the first case of SAT after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We alert clinicians to additional and unreported clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis-time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^112ovPJu]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

The cases presented in the paper clearly indicate that primary thyroid tumours with poor prognosis, in particular anaplastic cancer, may be clinically similar to SAT. Typical symptoms include neck pain, radiating to the ear, mandible and/or chest with increased ESR. Differentiated thyroid cancers progress much slower than anaplastic cancers, rarely give extensive infiltration of neck tissues and usually are not associated with significant ESR. However, Prakash et al. described a case of follicular thyroid cancer that manifested as hard, tender right thyroid lobe enlargement, associated with modest elevation of thyroid hormone levels and suppressed thyroid RAIU. Unfortunately, no ESR result of this patient is available in that paper. In such cases, pain is caused by rapid tumour growth which is, however, not characteristic for the follicular thyroid cancer.

SAT-like symptoms may be caused by a non-thyroid cancer that infiltrates the thyroid or metastasizes to the thyroid gland. An example of neoplastic extension to the thyroid was presented by Meier and Nagle, who reported 19-year-old man with neck pain and swelling. On examination, there was firm and tender 4 cm mass in the region of right thyroid lobe and isthmus. White blood count (WBC) and ESR were increased. FNAB procedure was painful and did not provide adequate material. A tentative diagnosis of SAT was made and the patient received initial dose 60 mg of prednisone with a definite improvement. After a month of tapering the dose the thyroid mass was still hard. Repeated FNAB revealed Hodgkin's disease. CT images showed 7 cm mediastinal mass which extended into right thyroid lobe. In this case, the initial SAT diagnosis significantly delayed proper treatment, similarly to most of our patients presented above. Most cases of thyroid lymphomas are non-Hodgkin's ones. Hamburger reported a few cases of painful thyroid lymphomas, which may be difficult to differentiate from SAT on the basis of pain and ESR. Gochu at al. described a HIV positive patient who presented with diffusely enlarged, firm and extremely tender thyroid gland, tachycardia and tremor of the fingers suggested hyperthyroid state. Laboratory features of thyrotoxicosis were present and ESR was 45 mm/h. All these findings were suggestive of SAT. Fortunately, further diagnostics was carried out. Two FNABs revealed only necrotic material and were non-diagnostic. An open biopsy demonstrated malignant lymphoma (diffuse large cell type). Chemotherapy with bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone was introduced with a dramatic reduction of the goitre and rapid normalization of thyroid tests.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^115tou2c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old woman with no history of thyroid disease visited our outpatient endocrine clinic on July 27, 2012. Two weeks prior, she had developed symptoms of pain in the left neck and fatigue. Physical examination revealed a focal nodule of the left thyroid lobe that had a diameter of approximately 1.5 cm without local redness or lymph node enlargement, which was painful and tender upon examination. There was no fever or signs of hyperthyroidism such as tachycardia, insomnia, or tremors. The patient's thyroid function tests were normal (thyroid stimulating hormone = 1.25 mU/L, normal range: 0.27–4.2 mU/L; free triiodothyronine = 5.59 pmmol/L, normal range: 3.1–6.8 pmmol/L; free thyroxine = 18.80 pmmol/L, normal range: 12–22 pmmol/L) and tests for anti-thyroglobulin (< 10 KIU/L, normal range: 0–115 KIU/L), anti-thyroid peroxidase (10.54 KIU/L, normal range: 0–35 KIU/L), and anti-thyrotropin-receptor antibodies (< 1 U/L, normal range: 0–2 U/L) were negative. The patient's serum thyroglobulin levels were normal (61.32 ug/L, normal range: 1.40–78 ug/L); her white cell count was 5.2 × 10 9 /L with a normal differential, and her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 20 mm/hour (normal range: 0–38 mm/h).

### Painful acute radiation thyroiditis induced by 131I treatment of Graves' disease [^111555f4]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 44-year-old woman, chronic smoker with Graves' disease was treated with radioactive iodine ablation (RAI). One week after the treatment, she presented with severe pain in the anterior neck with radiation to the angle of the jaw associated with fatigue, tremor and odynophagia. Physical examination demonstrated an asymmetric and exquisitely tender thyroid gland. There was no laboratory evidence of thyrotoxicosis. Acute radiation thyroiditis was diagnosed. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hydrocodone-acetaminophen started initially were ineffective for pain control. Prednisone provided relief and was continued for 1 month with a tapering dose. Symptoms completely resolved after 1 month at which time the thyroid remained diffusely enlarged and non-tender. Three months following RAI ablation she developed hypothyroid symptoms. Levothyroxine was initiated. The patient has remained asymptomatic on continued follow-up care.

Case 3

A 73-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department because of a swollen and tender resistance in the neck for five days, and fever of 38 °C the last two days. She had difficulties to swallow. Two years earlier she had had the same experience, FNA at that time was normal and the swollenness subsided spontaneously. Epipharynx, hypopharynx and larynx were normal at inspection. CRP was 104 mg/L (< 3), ESR 40 mm/hr (< 30) and thyroid function tests were normal. The left part of the thyroid was enlarged, tender and an erythema 10–15 cm in diameter was seen in the anterior neck. Ultrasound revealed a 30x30x30 mm mass in the thyroid with low echogenicity, and a deep puncture for culture and drainage was performed and brownish fluid was extracted. She was treated with oral clindamycin 300 mg tds and oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid. The following day she continued to have high fever (38.6 °C). Thyroid surgery was considered. Due to a tick bite a week prior borrelia infection was excluded. Fever, local symptoms and laboratory subsided, she was admitted for four days and antibiotics were continued for in total 10 days. All cultures were negative. A FNA two weeks after discharge showed a colloid cyst, and she had no longer difficulties to swallow. She is still euthyroid without medication four years after this episode.

### Acute suppurative thyroiditis with thyroid abscess in adults: clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes [^111sdDmw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 48-year-old woman with hypertension and goitre presented with three weeks of on and off fever together with symptoms from the urinary tract and gut. She presented to the Emergency Department with a fever of 40 °C, cough, tachycardia and pain located to the left ear and to the anterior neck. The goitre was tender and to some extent hard but not fluctuating at palpation. From the left lung crepitations were heard on auscultation. The blood biochemical investigations revealed: ESR 28 mm/hr (normal < 20), CRP 180 mg/L (< 3), alanine aminotransferase 2.25 μkat/L (< 0.76), aspartate aminotransferase 1.31 μkat/L (< 0.61), potassium 3.3 mmol/L (3.6–4.6), TSH 0.1 mIU/L (0.4–4.7), free T4 15 pmol/L (12–23) and free T3 3.9 pmol/L (3.0–6.5). No TRAb or TPOab were detected, and other blood tests were normal as were a chest X-ray. She received treatment with prednisolone 30 mg due to suspicion of a subacute thyroiditis, was discharged due to social reasons, and were planned to return the following day. As fever persisted the next day she was admitted, blood cultures were drawn and a FNA from the thyroid performed. Prednisolone was continued with addition of iv cloxacillin 2 g tds and iv benzylpenicillin 3 g tds. Cytology showed granulocytes and a few lymphocytes together with macrophages, colloid and blood. Blood cultures were positive for streptococcus pneumonia, and cloxacillin and prednisolone were withheld. After six days with improvements, CRP had decreased to 80 mg/L, iv benzylpenicillin was changed to per oral phenoxymethylpenicillin 2 g tds for an additional week. The dental status was normal. The conclusion was sepsis with acute thyroiditis and she was discharged after 12 days. Three weeks later she was well but had a foul taste in mouth. MRI was performed but this could not reveal any fistula or branchial arch anomalies. There had been no recurrence at last follow-up 11 years later.

### Is subacute thyroiditis an underestimated manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection? Insights from a case series [^116xhjNX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 18 million people worldwide and the pandemic is still spreading. After the first case we reported, we observed 4 additional cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Objectives

The objective of this work is to describe additional cases of SAT associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection to alert physicians that SAT may be a manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

We describe clinical, biochemical, and imaging features of 4 patients with SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results

All patients were female (age, 29–46 years). SAT developed 16 to 36 days after the resolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neck pain radiated to the jaw and palpitations were the main presenting symptoms and were associated with fever and asthenia. One patient was hospitalized because of atrial fibrillation. Thyroid function tests (available for 3 individuals) were suggestive of destructive thyroiditis, and inflammatory markers were high. At neck ultrasound the thyroid was enlarged, with diffuse and bilateral hypoechoic areas and (in 3 patients) absent vascularization at color Doppler. Symptoms disappeared a few days after commencement of treatment (prednisone in 3 patients and ibuprofen in 1). Six weeks after the onset of SAT, all patients were asymptomatic and inflammatory markers had returned to normal range. Two patients were euthyroid, whereas 2 were diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

SAT may be an underestimated manifestation of COVID-19. Clinicians should keep in mind the possible occurrence of SAT during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^1127KxWY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck mass — patient handout risk indicators and evaluation — Common symptoms in patients with a neck mass at increased risk for malignancy include the mass lasting longer than 2–3 weeks, voice change, trouble or pain with swallowing, trouble hearing or ear pain on the same side as the neck mass, sore throat, unexplained weight loss, and fever > 101°F. For next steps, your provider will ask about medical history and examine your head and neck, may order tests or refer you to a specialist, and will want to make sure you have a thorough evaluation, testing, and follow-up within a short period of time with a plan for follow-up after testing, and it is important for you to follow this neck mass until it goes away or until you have a diagnosis.

### Subacute thyroiditis in a single lobe [^112dPWeb]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old woman with no history of thyroid disease reported pain in her neck and a sore throat. On physical examination, the thyroid gland was palpable. Serum T3 and T4 levels were increased, and the thyroid-stimulating hormone level was decreased. Thyroid scintigraphy with Tc-99m pertechnetate revealed nonvisualization of the left lobe of the thyroid. Ultrasonographic examination confirmed the presence of the left thyroid lobe. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy revealed thyroiditis of the left lobe of the thyroid. The patient was started on an anti-inflammatory drug. The follow-up thyroid scan showed a normal thyroid gland.

### Subacute thyroiditis as a presenting manifestation of COVID-19: a report of an exceedingly rare clinical entity [^114dJdUh]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 has wreaked havoc globally and has claimed innumerable lives all over the world. The symptoms of this disease may range from mild influenza-like symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. With improved diagnostic techniques and better disease understanding, an increased number of cases are being reported with extrapulmonary manifestations of this disease ranging from renal and gastrointestinal to cardiac, hepatic, neurological and haematological dysfunction. Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limiting and painful thyroid gland inflammation most often secondary to viral infections. We report a case of subacute thyroiditis in a 58-year-old gentleman presenting with a painful swelling in the neck who was subsequently detected to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. We seek to highlight the broad clinical spectrum of the COVID-19 by reporting probably the first case of subacute thyroiditis possibly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection from India.

### Acute tuberculous abscess of the thyroid gland [^117USEdE]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The authors are presenting our experience of managing an interesting case of a 28-year-old woman who presented to our clinic with a midline neck swelling of 1-month duration. There was a rapid increase in the degree of swelling associated with erythema, pain and fever 7 days before seeking medical help. Plain and contrast-enhanced CT scans of the neck were done. Diagnosis of acute suppurative abscess was made and the patient underwent emergency incision and drainage. Histopathological examination of the abscess wall showed epitheloid and Langhans' giant cells. The findings were suggestive of tuberculosis. Subsequently, a positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was obtained on Lowenstein-Jenson medium. The patient was started on antituberculous chemotherapy for 6 months. On a 6-month clinical follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and euthyroid. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of this case as well as a review of the literature.

### Simultaneous occurrence of subacute thyroiditis and Graves' disease [^116kmfxY]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Rare cases of Graves' disease occurring years after subacute thyroiditis (SAT) have been reported. Here, we present the first known case of simultaneous occurrence of Graves' disease and SAT.

Patient Findings

A 41-year-old woman presented with 10 days of neck pain, dysphagia, and hyperthyroid symptoms. Neck pain had initially started at the base of the right anterior neck and gradually spread to her upper chest, the left side of her neck, and bilateral ears. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 110 beats/minute and a diffusely enlarged tender thyroid gland without evidence of orbitopathy. There was a resting tremor of the fingers and brisk deep tendon reflexes. Laboratory values: thyrotropin < 0.01mcIU/mL (nL 0.39–5.33), free thyroxine 2.0ng/dL (nL 0.59–1.60), free T3 6.6pg/mL (nL 2.3–4.2), thyroglobulin 20.1ng/mL (nL 2.0–35.0), thyroglobulin antibody 843IU/mL (nL 0–80), thyroperoxidase antibody 130IU/mL (nL 0–29), thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody 22.90IU/L (nL < 1.22), thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins 299 units (nL < 140), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 120mm/h (nL 0–20), and C-reactive protein 1.117mg/dL (nL 0–0.5). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing revealed DRB1, DR8, B35, B39, DQB1, DQ4, and DQ5. A thyroid ultrasound showed an enlarged heterogeneous gland with mild hypervascularity. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies of both thyroid lobes revealed granulomatous thyroiditis. The thyroid scan showed a diffusely enlarged gland and heterogeneous trapping. There was a focal area of relatively increased radiotracer accumulation in the right upper pole. The 5-hour uptake ((123)I) was 6.6% (nL 4–15). The patient was symptomatically treated. Over the next several weeks, she developed hypothyroidism requiring levothyroxine treatment.

Summary

This case illustrates a rare simultaneous occurrence of Graves' disease and SAT. Previous case studies have shown that Graves' disease may develop months to years after an episode of SAT. A strong family history of autoimmune thyroid disorders was noted in this patient. Genetic predilection was also shown by HLA typing.

Conclusion

Although the occurrence of SAT with Graves' disease may be coincidental, SAT-induced autoimmune alteration may promote the development of Graves' disease in susceptible patients. Genetically mediated mechanisms, as seen in this patient by HLA typing and a strong family history, may also be involved.

### Neck swelling and airway narrowing as an initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis [^1165jAFT]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

An 87-year-old woman presented repeatedly to the Launceston General Hospital with a history of neck swelling (figure 1). The acute onset of swelling started at the left angle of her jaw and spread inferoanteriorly to her neck. This was associated with trismus-like sensation and dyspnoea. She denied any recent respiratory illness or dysphagia.

Figure 1
Initial presentation with face and neck swelling (A: frontal, B: lateral).

The patient's medical history included hypertension treated with irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, hypercholesterolemia on atorvastatin and osteoporosis on denosumab. In addition, she had been taking aspirin for primary prevention of ischaemic heart disease. There were no medication changes in the preceding 3 years.

During the initial presentation, the patient had a low-grade temperature of 37.8°C and remained haemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 170/80 mm Hg and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. There was no change in voice, stridor, palpable neck nodules or collection on physical examination. The patient was tender over her temporomandibular joints bilaterally and had normal mouth opening to three finger breadths despite sensation of trismus.

Blood investigation revealed normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin of 88 g/L and mean cell volume (MCV) of 89 fL), an elevated white cell count of 17.5×10 9 /L (14.2×10 9 /L neutrophils, 1.4×10 9 /L lymphocyte) and a platelet count of 371×10 9 /L. C reactive protein was elevated at 115 mg/L with a normal antinuclear antibody titre. Thyroid, renal and liver function tests were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck did not reveal any structural abnormality of the oral cavity, tongue, larynx, thyroid, carotids or lymph nodes other than mild subcutaneous oedema.

The patient was managed as potentially having Ludwig's angina by the local ear, nose and throat team and was commenced on intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin). A throat swab was obtained, which did not isolate any beta-haemolytic Streptococcus sp. The patient completed 3 days of intravenous antibiotic treatment and was discharged with an oral course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin Duo forte).

Case 2

A 45-year-old man, long time tobacco smoker, presented with two week history of marked thyroid pain and swelling. He also reported fever (up to 39 °C), weight loss and hoarseness. The patient's GP initially diagnosed SAT based on the pain, fever and high ERS and started treatment with NSAID with initial pain relief. After a few days the severe pain relapsed despite treatment, and the patient was referred to hospital. In our Department his ESR was 93 mm/h and biochemical features of thyrotoxicosis were present, which may indeed strongly suggest SAT. In the neck, there was a hard, painful tumour, about 7 cm in size. The laboratory results obtained in our Department are presented in Table 1. US revealed slightly enlarged right thyroid lobe and significantly enlarged left lobe (65 × 57 × 101 mm) dominated by a heterogeneous tumour size of 55 × 50 × 72 mm, with numerous calcifications and a heterogeneous fluid space corresponding to abscess (Fig. 4). Tumour vascularisation was reduced. Almost the entire left lobe showed a faded structure of the parenchyma, with no evidently visible capsule, with features of infiltration of the neck structures. FNAB confirmed the presence of abscess, and after introduction of antibiotic therapy, the concentration of free thyroxine (FT4) gradually normalized. In the remaining FNAB material only blood and numerous granulocytes and macrophages were described. Neck CT revealed large tumour of the thyroid, with visible compression and displacement of the trachea and infiltration of the surrounding structures (Fig. 5). In chest CT, in both lungs, numerous milk-glass areas were present and the CT image corresponded to the diagnosis of lympangiosis carcinomatosa. The patient was referred to a surgery clinic, where only a small piece (20 mm) of the neck tumour was wedged to release the trachea; the complete surgery was impossible due to the extent of infiltration and hardness of the tumour. Histopathologically purulent necrosis was mostly observed, but together with clinical features, anaplastic thyroid cancer was suggested. The patient died a few months after diagnosis. Anaplastic thyroid cancer was confirmed.

Case Report

A 16-year-old female with asthma presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. Four weeks prior, she had 2 days of fever, congestion, and headache (Figure 1). Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was positive. Symptoms resolved with supportive care. Three weeks later (1 week prior to presentation), she developed 4 days of fever, headache, neck pain, and fatigue. She presented to an outside emergency department (ED) with concern for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Laboratory evaluation showed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 142 mg/L (normal: 0–20 mg/L) and ferritin of 277 ng/mL (normal: 20–90 ng/mL). As she did not meet criteria for MIS-C and laboratory findings were otherwise reassuring, she was discharged home with supportive care. While running in a track competition later that week, she developed acute chest pain, dizziness, and shortness of breath, prompting presentation to the ED.

Educational Objectives

There is growing evidence that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus can cause a broad spectrum of thyroid disease in children, including subacute thyroiditis.
Thyrotoxicosis symptoms can overlap with those of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and physicians must be discerning if MIS-C diagnostic criteria are not fully met.

### Fever and neck pain in an adolescent: a case report [^112MwEjM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Most studies of thyroid disease related to infection with SARS-CoV-2 include only adult patients. Few cases have been reported in children. - Our patient initially presented with an undetectable TSH, elevated FT4 and T3, and positive TPO antibody. She went on to develop a period of hypothyroidism, followed by a euthyroid state. Her positive antibody titer could reflect an underlying diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis; however, this test was collected following IVIG administration, which may have interfered with the results. With her antibody titer being negative shortly afterward, as well as her initial presentation with neck pain, her clinical picture is more aligned with a diagnosis of SAT.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, cases of SAT have been reported either as coinciding with or subsequent to infection. Several systematic reviews have been conducted in adult patients. The majority (up to 83.3%) of cases are diagnosed following COVID-19 infection. The onset of SAT symptoms in relation to infection ranges from 3 to 49 days. Patients are predominantly adult females. Neck pain is found in 92.6%, malaise in 85.2%, palpitations in 81.5%, and fever in 74.1%. Laboratory abnormalities reflect those found in patients with SAT prior to the pandemic; however, there is some evidence to suggest that the disease may be more severe when related to SARS-CoV-2. Brancatella et al found that FT4, CRP, and thyroglobulin were higher in COVID-positive than COVID-negative patients with SAT. COVID-positive patients were also more likely to have hypothyroidism at 3 months. However, the largest single-center study of post-COVID SAT found that the majority (82%) of patients achieve euthyroidism. Trimboli et al found that the most common reported treatment was corticosteroids. They hypothesize that this could be related to the overlapping symptoms with COVID-19 infection and the use of steroids as a treatment modality for viral illness. Additional studies are needed to further define this disease process and appropriate management in children, as existing studies are limited to adults.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis-time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^114aUeLL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the largest group of patients with thyroid anaplastic cancers mimicking SAT, described so far.

The problem of distinguishing the causes of painful goitre with accompanying other features of SAT is scarcely discussed in the literature. Meier and Nagle reported 49-year-old men with severe pain of enlarged left thyroid lobe, which was firm and tender. Lab results revealed ERS 50 mm/h and features of thyrotoxicosis. f The diagnosis of SAT was made and the patient was treated with prednisone in high doses with initial clinical improvement. However, after 10 days his pain worsened and FNAB was performed revealing purulent material The large painful abscess appeared to arise from an extension of laryngeal carcinoma. This case, as well as our Patient No. 2 presented above, are important examples that thyroid abscess in an adult should always trigger diagnostic alertness, as it is often the first symptom of an advanced cancer disease. It should also be emphasized that neck abscess is extremely difficult to distinguish from SAT based only on clinical symptoms and ESR, thus US is mandatory in all cases.

Case 3

A 71-year-old woman, presented with a history of rapidly growing tender thyroid gland. Earlier, she was treated with radioiodine (131 I) due to Graves' disease. Initially, the patient denied any other new symptoms, including fever and dyspnoea. She was consulted by her GP about two weeks before, and the initial diagnosis of SAT was made based on the hard painful thyroid tumour, increased CRP and low TSH. A treatment with NSAID was introduced and she was referred to our Department. Unfortunately, she did not report to the hospital immediately, but waited for two weeks for the treatment effect. In our Department her ESR was 94 mm/h and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 0.02 mIU/l, which might have suggested SAT. In the neck, there was a hard, tender, huge goitre. The laboratory results obtained in our Department are presented in Table 1. US revealed huge nodular goitre with several hypoechoic nodules. On the right side of the neck pathological lymph nodes were visible, which raised a suspicion of malignancy. In all FNAB samples (right lobe, left lobe, lymph nodes) groups, patches and shreds of tissues formed of anaplastic epithelial cells, partially spindle-shaped, necrotic masses and granulocytes were described which confirmed diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (Fig. 6). At that time, she reported difficulty when swallowing. The patient was referred to a surgery clinic for palliative surgery. Total thyroidectomy was impossible to perform due to the infiltration of all adjacent structures including muscles, blood vessels, trachea and oesophagus. Only a part of the tumour was excised to release trachea and oesophagus. She died a few months later.

Case 4

A 44-year-old woman had a FNA done because of a lump in the right side of the thyroid. Brownish fluid was evacuated, and the lump diminished. Thyroid function tests were normal. Two weeks later the lump increased in size and she presented to Emergency Department. She complained of pain during swallowing, difficulty in eating and experienced dyspnoea when lying down. Fever was fluctuating up to 39 °C. In the right side of the thyroid a 2 × 4 cm hard and tender lump was palpated. CRP was 87 mg/L (< 3), ESR 26 mm/hr (< 20) and leukocytes 12.9 × 10(9)/L (3.5–8.8). A new FNA with deep culture was done from the thyroid and 10 mL brownish fluid was drained. Iv cefuroxime 1.5 g tds was commenced. CT neck showed a 30x27x34 mm mass in the right thyroid lobe. Cultures from blood and thyroid tissue were all negative. After three days, local symptoms had much improved, CRP was 42 mg/L and ESR 29 mm/hr. Antibiotics were changed to po sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 800/160 mg bid for another week, and all symptoms subsided. The length of admission was four days. Six month later she represented to Emergency Department with symptoms from the thyroid gland, but the thyroid ultrasound only showed a 14 × 8 mm cyst. She continued to be euthyroid and well four years after the first presentation.

We report a case of a hospitalised patient with COVID-19 who developed subacute thyroiditis in association with SARS-COV-2 infection. The patient presented with tachycardia, anterior neck pain and thyroid function tests revealing hyperthyroidism together with consistent ultrasonographic evidence suggesting subacute thyroiditis. Treatment with corticosteroids resulted in rapid clinical resolution. This case illustrates that subacute thyroiditis associated with viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 should be recognised as a complication of COVID-19 and considered as a differential diagnosis when infected patients present with tachycardia without evidence of progression of COVID-19 illness.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^113GwwCb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, giant-cell thyroiditis, or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, is a spontaneously remitting inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland. Subacute thyroiditis is generally caused by viral infection and is the most common cause of a painful thyroid. Patients with subacute thyroiditis usually have a history of antecedent viral infection and subsequently suffer from neck pain, thyroid tenderness, fever, and fatigue. Upon physical examination, the thyroid of the patient is often tender and diffusely enlarged.

In most cases, a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is usually self-evident and can be made based on patient history, physical and laboratory findings, and the clinical course of the disease. In some cases, in addition to the clinical course and features, fine needle aspiration cytology, ultrasound, and scintigraphy analyses may support the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. For example, thyroid radioisotope scanning generally demonstrates a low uptake of Technetium-99 m (99 m-Tc) or 131I. However, patients with subacute thyroiditis sometimes present with puzzling clinical features that can escape early recognition. Here, a patient with subacute thyroiditis, who presented with a solitary painful thyroid nodule in the absence of typical laboratory test characteristics that would suggest subacute thyroiditis and whose 99 m-Tc thyroid scan revealed a hot nodule in the left lobe of thyroid, is described. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of a hot nodule in a patient with subacute thyroiditis has not been previously reported.

### Subacute thyroiditis presenting as simple acute headache was misdiagnosed as meningitis: case report and literature review [^115Wq16x]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a self-limiting disease with common clinical manifestations of neck pain spreading to the jaw or ears, accompanied by mild to moderate fever, and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis with tenderness on palpation of the thyroid gland. The etiology of SAT is still unknown, and virus infections such as coxsackie virus, adenovirus and influenza virus were previously thought to be the predisposing factors of SAT. A small number of atypical SAT cases without neck pain or tenderness have been reported in the literature. Thus, attention should be paid to SAT in clinical practice.

Herein, we report a patient with simple acute headache who did not have typical thyroid pain and was misdiagnosed as meningitis. His headache symptoms were associated with SAT, and his symptoms gradually resolved with SAT treatment. At present, headache caused by Graves' disease and painless thyroiditis has occasionally been reported, but no detailed cases of headache caused by SAT have been reported.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^115vQ676]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

SAT diagnosis is based on the patient's medical history, symptoms, physical and laboratory fingings along with exclusion of other reasons for hyperthyroidism. Our patient presented with SAT symptoms in the 12 th week of gestation, in accordance with previously published case reports of SAT during early pregnancy (sixth to 13 th week). It is important to recognize thyroid dysfunction caused by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the first trimester. HCG levels increase significantly in early pregnancy and its structure is homologous to TSH, which leads to a transient rise in free thyroxin (FT4) and suppression of TSH; however, there is no neck pain during normal early pregnancy.

The physical findings of neck pain favors SAT in the differential diagnosis of SAT from other causes of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism during pregnancy. However, in some patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid cancer or primary thyroid lymphoma, or even Graves' disease may also have neck pain and tenderness of the thyroid gland in some cases. Importantly, all of the previously reported 7 patients with SAT during pregnancy had neck pain. Pain from SAT can be initially confined to or begin from the lateral gland, and then transferred to the contralateral gland. In our case, the patient's neck pain was found to be transferable and consistent with SAT. Importantly, additional clinical symptoms, such as fever and fatigue, were also observed.

Hyperthyroidism during SAT in pregnant women, manifested as low TSH and increased T3 and T4, needs to be differentiated from Graves' disease. SAT patients also have a high ESR or CRP but poor radionuclide uptake in thyroid scintigraphy, although fine-needle aspiration biopsy may also be considered as a diagnostic method. Howerver, pregnant women are not recommended to undergo thyroid scintigraphy and fine-needle aspiration biopsy has a higher inherent risk, which may contribute to the challenge of diagnosing pregnancy complicated with SAT.SAT is characterized by a low ratio of TT3 (ng/dL) to TT4 (µg/dL) < 20, FT3 to FT4 < 0.3 and peripheral-blood eosinophil/monocyte (Eo/Mo) ratio < 0.2. These indicators are valuable for distinguishing SAT from Graves' disease. In this case, TT3/TT4 = 12.12, FT3/FT4 = 0.46, and Eo/Mo = 0.076, consistent with the literature, with the exception of FT3/FT4.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis-time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^1154iuQB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Typical symptoms of subacute thyroiditis are neck pain and thyroid tenderness, which are accompanied by significantly elevated ESR. Pain can affect the whole thyroid or only one lobe, and the location of the pain can change over time. The occupied part of the thyroid gland is usually enlarged and hard in consistency. The inflammation causes destruction of thyroid follicles and a release of thyroid hormones into blood, which – in turn – results in elevation of free thyroid hormones and reduction of TSH level. Follicular cell damage causes an impaired transport of iodine, so RAIU is low in the affected parts of the thyroid.

However there are other aetiologies of painful goitre, including primary fast growing thyroid neoplasms or thyroid metastases. Rapid enlargement of the thyroid causes painful stretching of the gland capsule. Very aggressive tumours quickly infiltrate surrounding tissues, including neck muscles, which also causes pain with exactly the same radiation as in SAT. These tumours, similarly to the inflammation in SAT, are hard in consistency. Rapidly growing primary thyroid carcinomas, including mainly very poorly prognostic anaplastic cancer, are characterized by a fulminant course of the disease, and delayed diagnosis - even a week or two - can dramatically reduce the patient's life expectancy and deteriorate life quality. Thyroid metastases can also grow rapidly, stretching the capsule, and infiltrate surrounding tissues, which result in the same neck pain. Thyroid abscess is difficult to distinguish from SAT and one should remember that thyroid abscess is a very rare condition which may be the result of infection of decaying necrotic tissues in anaplastic thyroid cancer, as it occurred in Patient No. 2. All of the above causes of painful goitre are accompanied by significantly increased ESR resulting from progressive cancer disease. ESR in the thyroid abscess is always very high, regardless of whether it is accompanied by cancer or occurs as a separate disease entity. Even the accompanying biochemical hyperthyroidism cannot be the basis for the exclusion of malignant tumour, because both inflammation and rapidly progressive cancer infiltration can cause destruction of thyroid follicles and the release of hormones, as it was in Patients No. 2, 3 and 4.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and associazione medici endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules – 2016 update [^113YaYwj]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules — clinical presentation and examination — Most patients with thyroid nodules are asymptomatic or report symptoms that cannot be readily related to the nodule; in symptomatic patients, a detailed history and complete physical examination may guide the selection of appropriate clinical and laboratory investigations. Slow growth over years may be present in benign nodules, whereas progressive nodule growth (during weeks or months) deserves attention because this pattern may suggest malignancy, and the sudden appearance of a lump in the thyroid region associated with pain is commonly due to hemorrhage in a cystic nodule. In patients with progressive and painful enlargement of a thyroid nodule, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, rare forms of chronic thyroiditis (e.g. Riedel disease), and primary lymphoma of the thyroid should be considered, and coexistence of fever, dysphagia, and malaise with thyroid tenderness is suggestive of subacute thyroiditis. Slow-onset cervical symptoms from compression usually occur only when nodules are embedded within large goiters, and tracheal compression (cough and dyspnoea) may suggest malignancy; therefore, surgical treatment should be considered in patients with growth of a thyroid mass and vocal cord paresis, even when cytologic results are negative for malignancy. Thyroid carcinomas rarely cause airway obstruction, vocal cord paralysis, or esophageal symptoms and are more frequently devoid of local symptoms, and a firm or hard, solitary, or dominant thyroid nodule that clearly differs from the rest of the gland suggests an increased risk of malignancy. Despite the low predictive value of palpation, careful inspection and palpation of the thyroid gland and the anterior and lateral nodal compartments of the neck are always strongly recommended.

### Acute thyroid swelling and elevated C reactive protein [^113LzDYh]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 34-year-old lady presented with a painful swelling of the left thyroid lobe since 1 week and elevated C reactive protein (CRP) above 100 mg/L. An ultrasound examination revealed a thyroid cyst with partly solid component, suitable with a haemorrhage into a cyst. The serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), as well as peripheral thyroid hormones, was in the normal range. The acute swelling could be well explained by a haemorrhage, but not an elevated CRP. Her medical history was uneventful apart from a tooth extraction 2 weeks ago due to an infection. Therefore, our hypothesis was a haemorrhage into a pre-existing thyroid cyst during bacteraemia caused by the tooth infection. Conservative treatment with the aim of delayed hemithyreoidectomy failed due to a second episode of haemorrhage. During surgical resection pus drained out of the cyst and the histological report afterwards confirmed our tentative diagnosis. The patient was discharged 2 days later.

Materials and methods

Participants

This case-control study recruited a total of 59 patients diagnosed with SAT and 50 healthy volunteers from the Endocrinology and Metabolism Outpatient Clinic. The patients ranged in age from 20 to 73 years, with a mean age of 40.41 ± 13.14 years in the control group, and from 30 to 78 years, with a mean age of 44.36 ± 11.01 years in the SAT group. SAT was diagnosed based on the 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines, using medical history, physical examination, laboratory findings and thyroid ultrasonography results. SAT was suspected in patients presenting with anterior neck pain radiating to the jaw and ears, and fever, and those exhibiting tenderness and pain in the thyroid lobe during physical examination. It has long been recognized that no significant differences exist among various pain measurement methods when assessing pain. Given its ease of application, we opted for the numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).

Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytosis, and thyrotoxicosis were accepted as laboratory values consistent with SAT. Focal or diffuse, hypoechoic-heterogeneous areas with reduced vascularity that were painful when probed by ultrasound were considered as indicative of SAT. The control group consisted of individuals who underwent a check-up during the same period and had no pathology detected in their test results. Prior to study inclusion, participants were screened for the presence of chronic diseases, previous thyroid diseases, smoking, and alcohol use. Only individuals without a history of chronic diseases or previous thyroid diseases and who did not smoke or drink alcohol were included in the study. None of the participants were taking selenium-containing supplements. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all the study participants.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis-time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^111Sy8Qv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on our own experience and literature review, the authors suggest that thyroid gland US should be necessarily included in the main criteria of SAT diagnosis, together with FNAB result excluding the presence of malignant tumour, if only it is possible to perform a diagnostic FNAB. If FNAB does not provide a diagnostic result, and there are even slight suspicious of malignancy, thyroid surgery should be considered to obtain definitive diagnosis, because only the correct diagnosis allows to extend the life expectancy of a patient with a malignant tumour of poor prognosis. One should always remember that thyroid primary or metastatic cancer can clinically mimic SAT, so SAT diagnosis can be made only after exclusion of malignancy.

Taking into account the above observations, we propose the following SAT recognition criteria:
Elevation of ESR or at least C-reactive protein.
Hypoechoic area/areas with blurred margin and decreased vascularisation in US.
FNAB confirmation of SAT or at least FNAB exclusion of malignancy.
Hard thyroid swelling.
Pain and tenderness of the thyroid gland/lobe.
Elevation of serum FT4 and suppression of TSH.
Decreased RAIU.

To undoubtedly diagnose SAT the first 3 criteria should be met, together with at least one other criterion.

Case 5

An 80-year-old woman presented with rapidly enlarging tender right thyroid lobe. In the neck, there was a hard, slightly tender nodule of the right lobe. Her ESR was 38 mm/h thus SAT was initially suspected in our Department. Other laboratory results obtained after admission are presented in Table 1. US revealed right lobe tumour 40 × 40 × 57 mm in size, hypoechoic with blurred margins and a few microcalcifications. Without those microcalcifications, the sonographic pattern of the tumour could be considered as SAT-typical, and the presence of microcalcifications was the first significant symptom of malignancy. FNAB revealed polymorphic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei, with large nucleoli, dispersed, in groups and lobes, and numerous shreds of necrotic tissues. In the background of smears few lymphocytes and small groups of monomorphic cells of follicular origin were visible. The description corresponds to anaplastic thyroid cancer. The patient was referred to a surgery clinic for surgery. Unfortunately, the surgery occurred to be only palliative due to the excessive involvement of lymph nodes and adjacent structures. Further progression of the disease was very dynamic, and, despite the treatment, the patient died a few months later.

Three patients experienced subacute thyroiditis. Patient 1: A 61-year-old female liver cancer patient developed subacute thyroiditis after 3 months of sintilimab therapy. She presented with a sore throat, fever (up to 40℃), and a palpable, hard, and tender thyroid gland. Initially, she was treated with Chinese medicine; ten days later, clinical and biochemical thyrotoxicosis occurred, accompanied by elevated ESR (> 50 mm/h) and increased CRP, while her TRAb, TgAb, and TPOAb were negative. After 2.7 months, she progressed to hypothyroidism and started taking levothyroxine sodium. Patient 2: A 64-year-old male liver cancer patient developed subacute thyroiditis after 4 months of tirelizumab treatment. He presented with neck pain, fever (maximum temperature 38.7℃), and thyrotoxicosis, with elevated ESR (> 50 mm/h). TRAb, TgAb, and TPOAb were negative. After 1.7 months, he progressed to hypothyroidism and received levothyroxine sodium treatment. Patient 3: A 66-year-old male lung cancer patient developed subacute thyroiditis 10 days after initiating tirelizumab therapy. He presented with neck pain and fever, followed by overt thyrotoxicosis 15 days later. Laboratory tests showed elevated ESR (> 50 mm/h) and negative TRAb. After 2 months, he progressed to subclinical hypothyroidism and subsequently received levothyroxine sodium treatment.

Severity of thyroid IrAEs

According to the 2017 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Evaluation Criteria for Time Events of Common Adverse Reactions (CTCAE 5.0), 209 patients (81.3%) developed grade 1 thyroid irAEs after receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors treatment, and all patients were asymptomatic and did not require medical intervention. 43 patients (16.7%) had grade 2 thyroid irAEs, with mild symptoms, and received treatment with methimazole or levothyroxine sodium. Their thyroid function returned to normal afterwords without suspension of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment. Five patients experienced grade 3 and need to suspend the treatment of PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

All reports for the 38 cases described SAT symptoms. The most frequent SAT symptom was neck pain (27 cases), followed by fever (22 cases). Of the 25 cases with information on the duration between onset of COVID-19 symptoms and onset of SAT symptoms, as mentioned in the text or able to be calculated, the shortest was simultaneous occurrence (0 days) and the longest was 4 months. In most cases, patients developed SAT at several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19.

We confirmed that the thyroid state was described for 22 cases. Enlarged thyroid was the most common state (11 cases), followed by any tenderness (nine cases). We further confirmed that 37 patients had thyrotoxicosis, evaluated by detection of free T4, free T3, or thyroid-stimulating hormone. One article did not mention the actual serum levels of thyroid hormones, but we concluded that the patient experienced SAT from the following text: "Thyroid function tests were consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism". The states for thyroglobulin, thyroglobulin antibody, antithyroid peroxidase antibody, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody were mentioned in 27 cases. We further extracted the results of biological examinations reported for 35 cases. Of these 35 cases, 31 cases had increased C-reactive protein, and 30 cases had confirmed elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Interleukin-6 was measured in only one case and was found to be elevated. Ultrasound analysis of the thyroid was carried out in 14 cases and revealed hypoechoic areas in an enlarged thyroid in most cases. These findings were consistent with SAT.

Management of SAT was reported for 30 cases. Twenty-five patients were treated with corticosteroids such as prednisone. All patients recovered from both COVID-19 and SAT, although four patients suffered from hypothyroidism after SAT.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^116GgiCq]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is readily considered when patients present with a particular set of typical clinical characteristics. Subacute thyroiditis sometimes presents as a solitary cold nodule; however, the presence of a hot nodule in patients with subacute thyroiditis is exceedingly rare.

Case Presentation

Here, the case of a 57-year-old woman complaining of pain in the left neck and fatigue for two weeks is presented. Physical examination revealed a painful and tender nodule with a diameter of approximately 1.5 cm in the left neck, although all laboratory tests, including white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), thyroid function, and thyroglobin levels, were normal. A neck ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass (1.5×0.8 cm) in the left thyroid, and thyroid scintigraphy of the left thyroid with Technetium-99 m (99 m-Tc) demonstrated a focal accumulation of radiotracer. Furthermore, fine-needle aspiration biopsy from the nodule revealed the presence of multinuclear giant cells. The patient was well; there was no cervical mass detected upon palpation following two months of prednisone treatment, and follow-up ultrasound screening and scintigraphy demonstrated the disappearance of the nodule.

Conclusion

This case, presenting with a localized painful hot nodule, normal thyroid function, normal ESR, and normal serum thyroglobulin levels, is a rare case of subacute thyroiditis, which should be considered during differential diagnosis.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^116HXc74]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Subacute thyroiditis is the most common cause of non-autoimmune thyroiditis. In addition to the typical clinical signs, characteristic ultrasound findings of subacute thyroiditis include the presence of an ill-defined hypoechoic area with a nonhomogeneous pattern. Recently, Ruchala et al. demonstrated the usefulness of sonoelastography for the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. The cytological features found during thyroid fine-needle aspiration include the presence of large multinucleated giant cells or epithelioid granulomas, but the absence of these findings does not exclude the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. Generally speaking, elevated serum thyroid hormones, a tender enlarged thyroid, and low radioiodine thyroid uptake are characteristic of subacute thyroiditis. Although cases with these typical signs may present little difficulty for a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis, this disorder does not always present in a classic fashion and may lead to difficulties during diagnosis. Sometimes the diagnosis may be less clear, particularly when the primary presenting symptom is a solitary thyroid nodule in conjunction with normal thyroid function, thyroglobulin levels, and a normal ESR.

### A rare presentation of acute suppurative thyroiditis [^113MqPre]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 17-year-old female patient initially presented with symptoms of anterior neck pain. After multiple emergency department visits, she was found to have unilateral enlargement of her thyroid gland. Laboratory studies were consistent with hyperthyroidism. Symptoms were initially attributed to subacute thyroiditis, and she was discharged with steroids and propranolol. She presented again 1 week later with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. She was readmitted and developed sepsis with multiorgan system infection and Lemierre syndrome. Further imaging revealed acute suppurative thyroiditis as the likely source. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy revealed ulceration of the anterior esophageal wall, a fistulous tract to the thyroid, and copious purulent drainage. Esophageal biopsies with immunostaining established a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus esophagitis as the likely cause of esophageal perforation, fistula development, and acute suppurative thyroiditis.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: a literature review [^111zKxmD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has devastated the world since its emergence in 2019. Although the leading cause of death associated with COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome, other complications associated with COVID-19 have been reported, including acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, acute myocarditis, and septic shock.

Currently, subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially invoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been reported as a possible complication associated with COVID-19. SAT can be caused by multiple triggers, including viral infection, post-inflammatory processes, and autoimmunity. Patients with SAT exhibit fever, neck pain, and a tender diffuse goiter as well as abnormalities in serum thyroid hormones. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined.

In the present study, we gathered information on SAT after COVID-19 from case reports available in digital databases and described its clinical practice patterns, clinical symptoms, and outcomes. We aimed to examine the collected data on SAT after COVID-19 to further understand the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

### Hypercalcemia due to subacute thyroiditis [^116w1g7n]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a patient who had hypercalcemia attributable to subacute thyroiditis.

Methods

A case history, including detailed results of laboratory tests, is presented, and the findings are discussed.

Results

A young woman with neck pain and fever was found to have increased free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels but a decreased thyrotropin value. Concurrently, the serum calcium concentration was increased. Subacute thyroiditis was diagnosed. Within 1 month, the free thyroxine and serum calcium levels were normal.

Conclusion

Thyrotoxicosis is a known cause of hypercalcemia. All previously reported cases of hypercalcemia due to hyperthyroidism involved Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, or a toxic adenoma as the cause of the hyperthyroidism. The current case shows that short-term subacute thyroiditis can cause hypercalcemia.

### Riedel thyroiditis [^1171HJ1J]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Riedel thyroiditis (RT) is a rare inflammatory autoimmune disease that is often a clinically diagnostic dilemma because of its insidious presentation and nonspecific symptoms.

Objective

The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis is to clarify the presentation, management, and outcomes of RT.

Study Selection

A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant reports published up to September 2019.

Data Extraction

First author, country, patient sex, ethnicity, presentation, biochemical status, duration of symptoms, histology, treatment, follow-up duration, and short- and long-term outcomes.

Data Synthesis

Data from 212 RT patients were retrieved. The mean age was 47 years with a predominantly female population (81%). Neck swelling (89%), dyspnea (50%), and neck pain (41%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Inflammatory markers were elevated in 70% to 97% and thyroid antibody positivity was present in less than 50%. Up to 82% underwent surgical intervention, with the most common being total thyroidectomy in 34% of individuals. Glucocorticoids were used in 70% of individuals with median duration 3 months. Prognosis was reasonable with 90% having resolution or improvement of symptoms.

Conclusions

This analysis is the largest and most comprehensive to date of RT and provides clinicians with vital information on the common presentation features that may alert to the diagnosis and highlight management options.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114AD7pq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Presumed infectious lymphadenopathy in adults — empiric antibiotics and follow-up: While some sources acknowledge that resolution of inflammatory lymphadenopathy may take 6 to 12 weeks, most sources recommend observation limited to 2 weeks and do not advise delaying further evaluation beyond the initial 2-week period; it is reasonable to prescribe a single course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic for a neck mass that appears infectious provided the patient is followed, and a patient treated with antibiotics should be reassessed within 2 weeks; if the mass has not completely resolved, further workup for possible malignancy is recommended and partial resolution requires additional evaluation; if infectious lymphadenopathy resolves, the patient should be reassessed once more in 2 to 4 weeks to monitor for recurrence; in the absence of signs and symptoms suggesting infection, empiric antibiotics should be avoided and the mass should undergo further workup.

### A 59-year-old man with a rash and hearing loss [^117EQfse]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 59-year-old man who initially had a sore throat, a truncal rash, and fever. Two weeks later, arthralgias and abrupt bilateral hearing loss developed. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Cervical epidural abscess associated with massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [^117RY11x]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We present a case of an elderly woman who presented with neck pain, low-grade fever, bandemia, and a massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) who had a cervical epidural abscess. We believe that the selective use of ESR assisted in narrowing the differential diagnosis, as the patient had no neurological deficits and no predisposing factors such as distal infection, immunosuppression, trauma, or recent surgery. Furthermore, in the literature, an elevated ESR is consistently found in patients with epidural abscesses, whereas clinical findings such as fever, leukocytosis, and neurological deficits are only variably present.

### A rare case of subacute thyroiditis causing thyroid storm [^117YTUwU]. Thyroid (2007). Low credibility.

Thyroid storm is a rare but potentially fatal condition that is most frequently associated with Graves' disease. We present the case of a young woman who presented in thyroid storm, later diagnosed as being due to severe subacute thyroiditis. We discuss the diagnostic approach to thyroid storm, the initial management, and eventual treatment and course of subacute thyroiditis. This case illustrates the necessity to include subacute thyroiditis in the differential diagnosis of severe thyrotoxicosis and thyroid storm.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^112ziH9g]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck mass in adults — suspicious history criteria: Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy when the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥ 2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration; Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. Supporting details state that in the setting of a neck mass without recent infection, the clinician should establish the duration, that a noninfectious neck mass present ≥ 2 weeks without signs of improvement is concerning for malignancy, that unknown duration should be considered a persistent mass at increased risk for malignancy, and that the mere presence of a neck mass present ≥ 2 weeks without signs of improvement is suspicious even without other risk factors.

### IJV thrombophlebitis: be wary of the occult [^113k3DuV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 43-year-old woman was referred to the Ear, Nose and Throat Department with a 3-day history of left-sided neck pain and swelling associated with fevers and night sweats. She also reported a cough, oral thrush and a dental extraction more than a month previously. A CT scan of the neck with contrast revealed left internal jugular vein (IJV) thrombophlebitis and the patient was initially managed for suspected Lemierre's syndrome. Subsequent investigations revealed a locally advanced metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma as the cause of her thrombosis, which was deemed inoperable. The patient was referred to oncology and commenced on palliative chemotherapy. The incidence of thrombophlebitis in patients with cancer is high. Although the IJV is a relatively uncommon site of thrombus formation, IJV thrombophlebitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. As it may be the first manifestation of an occult malignancy, a neoplastic cause should always be considered.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^112eYET2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of maternal thyroid disorders remains high during pregnancy, with hypothyroidism affecting up to 2% — 3% of all pregnancies and hyperthyroidism affecting 0.1% — 0.4%. Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) accounts for 5% of patients with thyroid disease, Pregnant women with clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism increased the risk of preterm delivery by 4.4 times — 3.0 times respectively. Clinical hyperthyroidism is also significantly associated with fetal distress. SAT is also called granulomatous thyroiditis or giant cell thyroiditis, and is regarded as a self-limiting inflammatory disorder.

The majority of SAT patients are women between the ages of 30 and 50 years. SAT is secondary to virus infection and is frequently accompanied by neck pain, fever, fatigue, and myalgia, followed by diffuse enlargement and tenderness of the thyroid gland. Laboratory examination tends to show an increase in the level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and other indicators of infection, coupled with the low echogenicity of nodules on ultrasound and decreased iodine absorption rate. SAT in pregnancy is extremely rare and is frequently misdiagnosed as hyperthyroidism. While 25% of patients have hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, hyperthyroidism caused by SAT during pregnancy is uncommon, with only 7 cases reported to date.

Herein, we present a case of SAT diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy in the Endocrinology Department of the Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province (Yunnan, China).

### Lingual thyroid: can we' wait and see'? [^115X6bTH]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 42-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a sensation of fullness in the throat and dry cough of 1-month duration. Physical examination showed a mass located in the midline of the tongue base. Cervical ultrasound confirmed the absence of thyroid gland tissue in the normal position. MRI of the neck showed a mass suggestive of lingual thyroid and scintigraphy confirmed the diagnosis. Thyroid function was normal. Despite normal thyroid function, to decrease the size of the mass and perhaps solve the problem, we decided to start levothyroxine suppression therapy. The patient had palpitations and one episode of angina pectoris as a side effect, resulting in the medication being interrupted. After 3 years of follow-up, she remains in clinical surveillance and without symptoms.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: a literature review [^1157AC8s]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has been reported as a complication of COVID-19 since 2020. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Therefore, we aimed to collect and survey case reports of SAT after COVID-19. We performed a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The keywords and MeSH terms used for the searches were "subacute thyroiditis" and "COVID-19". A total of 38 patients from 26 case reports, case series, and letters on SAT associated with COVID-19 were included and analyzed. The most frequent SAT symptom was neck pain (27 cases), followed by fever (22 cases). Of the 25 cases with information on the duration between onset of COVID-19 symptoms and onset of SAT symptoms, the shortest was simultaneous occurrence, and the longest was 4 months. In most cases, patients developed SAT at several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19. All patients with SAT recovered with no severe complications or sequelae. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SAT development in patients with neck pain and fever following COVID-19. Further research is necessary to determine the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

### Sodium iodide I-131 [^113kDBau]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Radiation-induced Thyroiditis

Sodium iodide I 131 may cause thyroiditis with release of thyroid hormone, which may aggravate hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxic cardiac disease [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. When treating hyperthyroidism, consider pre-treatment anti-thyroid medication to help deplete the thyroid hormone. Discontinue the anti-thyroid therapy three days before administration of sodium iodide I 131 [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider a beta-blocker pre or post-treatment to minimize the risk of hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm.

The thyroiditis may cause gland enlargement resulting in tenderness and swelling of the neck, pain on swallowing, sore throat, and cough; which may occur approximately the third day after sodium iodide I 131 administration. Consider management with pain-reliever or anti-inflammatory medications.

5.2 Radiation-induced Toxicities

Sodium Iodide I 131 may cause radiation induced toxicities [see Adverse Reactions (6)]:

Dose-dependent fatalities (bone marrow suppression, malignancy).
Dose-dependent hematopoietic suppression which manifests as a transient thrombocytopenia or neutropenia 3–5 weeks following sodium iodide I 131 administrations, may lead to increased susceptibility to infections or bleeding.
Salivary gland toxicity: sialadenitis, xerostomia.
Lacrimal gland toxicity: conjunctivitis, xerophthalmia, and epiphora.
Increased risk of developing new solid tumors and leukemias.

Obtain a complete blood count within one month of therapy. If patients show leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, dosimetry should be used to determine a safe sodium iodide I 131 activity, while delivering less than 2 Gy to the bone marrow.

Advise good hydration for one week following sodium iodide I 131 administration and stimulate salivary flow via a sialagogue (e.g. sugar-free candy or gum, pilocarpine, and ascorbic acid) to reduce radiation exposure to the salivary glands.

Advise patients to void frequently after administration of radioiodide to enhance excretion.

5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis may occur in patients who receive sodium iodide I 131. Although iodide is not considered an allergen, hypersensitivity reactions may occur in relation with excipients or chemical component of the capsule, such as sodium thiosulfate. Obtain and document an allergy history, particularly a sulfite allergy. Emergency resuscitation equipment and personnel should be immediately available [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information to aid in the safe and effective use of LEVOTHROID®:

Notify your physician if you are allergic to any foods or medicines, are pregnant or intend to become pregnant, are breast-feeding or are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations.
Notify your physician of any other medical conditions you may have, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems. Your dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while you are taking LEVOTHROID®. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood and/or urinary glucose levels as directed by your physician and immediately report any changes to your physician. If you are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), your clotting status should be checked frequently.
Use LEVOTHROID®only as prescribed by your physician. Do not discontinue or change the amount you take or how often you take it, unless directed to do so by your physician.
The levothyroxine in LEVOTHROID®is intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by your thyroid gland. Generally, replacement therapy is to be taken for life, except in cases of transient hypothyroidism, which is usually associated with an inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis).
Take LEVOTHROID®as a single dose, preferably on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. Levothyroxine absorption is increased on an empty stomach.
It may take several weeks before you notice an improvement in your symptoms.
Notify your physician if you experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event.
Notify your physician if you become pregnant while taking LEVOTHROID®. It is likely that your dose of LEVOTHROID®will need to be increased while you are pregnant.
Notify your physician or dentist that you are taking LEVOTHROID®prior to any surgery.
Partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of LEVOTHROID®therapy, but this is usually temporary.
LEVOTHROID®should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program.
Keep LEVOTHROID®out of the reach of children. Store LEVOTHROID®away from heat, moisture, and light.
Agents such as iron and calcium supplements and antacids can decrease the absorption of levothyroxine sodium tablets. Therefore, levothyroxine sodium tablets should not be administered within 4 hrs of these agents.

### Severe acute pharyngitis caused by group C Streptococcus [^111CEMN1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adult group C beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis has a prevalence of approximately 5%. It can present with a broad spectrum of severity.

Case Report

We report a 30-year-old woman who presented with severe Group C streptococcal pharyngitis.

Discussion

She presented with a 9-day history of progressive symptoms, including fever, sore throat, neck swelling, and recent onset of hoarseness. In the 9 days before the emergency room (ER) presentation, the patient had visited the ER twice complaining of a sore throat. At both visits, the physicians performed rapid antigen strep testing. Each time her test was negative and the physicians recommended symptomatic therapy. Her symptoms continued to worsen leading to her repeat presentation. At this time she had severe pharyngitis with markedly enlarged tonsils. Neck CT excluded peritonsillar abscess. Rapid strep testing was again negative, but her throat culture grew group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Conclusion

This presentation illustrates the importance of a systematic approach to evaluating patients with negative rapid strep tests and worsening pharyngitis.

### Thyroid abscess associated with transient hyperthyroidism in an adolescent girl: a rare case report and review of the literature [^116pnaRP]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To report an unusual case of thyroid abscess associated with thyroid dysfunction in an adolescent girl who has a normal anatomic structure of the thyroid gland.

Case Presentation

A 15-year-old adolescent girl presented with a history of fever, sore throat, and neck swelling for 10 days duration. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography neck showed findings suggestive of an abscess involving the left lobe of the thyroid gland. She had low TSH and elevated T3 and T4 levels. Here, we report a case of thyroid abscess associated with transient hyperthyroidism in an immunocompetent girl who was successfully managed with parental antibiotics without incision and drainage.

Conclusions

Thyroid abscess can present with hyperthyroidism in children. So it is important to monitor all children who have thyroid abscesses for the development of permanent hypothyroidism later on. It's important to diagnose this condition as soon as possible and begin antibiotic therapy appropriately.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis-time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^111xXZPH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is based mainly on the presence of painful thyroid goitre and a significant increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Proceeding according to these diagnostic criteria may lead to an incorrect diagnosis and treatment. Extremely dangerous is the situation when the diagnosis of SAT is erroneously made based on criteria other than ultrasound (US) image and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), which leads to delayed diagnosis of malignant tumour with poor prognosis.

Case Presentation

Five patients with typical SAT symptoms are presented. In all of them, anaplastic thyroid cancer or metastatic thyroid tumours were finally diagnosed as the cause of the initial symptoms resembling SAT. Most of the patients were initially misdiagnosed and the proper diagnosis of malignancy was delayed.

Conclusions

The authors have proposed the new diagnostic criteria for SAT, and strongly suggest that thyroid gland US should be included in the main criteria of SAT diagnosis, together with FNAB result excluding the presence of malignant tumour.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^1179C7ma]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Previously, thyroid nodules have been identified in association with subacute thyroiditis and, in some patients with subacute thyroiditis, only one nodule is present. For example, Liel reported a case that presented with the coexistence of subacute thyroiditis and an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule. More often, localized forms of subacute thyroiditis present as painful and tender "cold" thyroid nodules, which disappear following recovery. However, subacute thyroiditis that presents as a painful "hot" nodule is exceedingly rare and has not been reported. In this case, laboratory tests, including white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, thyroid function, thyroglobin levels, and ESR, were normal and non-diagnostic but the clinical findings (neck pain, thyroid tenderness, and fatigue) led to the consideration of a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. Therefore, further work-ups were completed including an ultrasound examination of the neck, thyroid scintigraphy with 99 m-Tc, and fine needle aspiration cytology of the nodule. Ultrasound examination demonstrated a dyshomogeneous and hypoechoic mass in the thyroid, which was characteristic of subacute thyroiditis, and thyroid scintigraphy showed a focal accumulation of radiotracer uptake in the thyroid nodule. The histological features of the nodule were also typical of subacute thyroiditis. Therefore, a diagnosis of localized subacute thyroiditis was given and the patient was prescribed prednisone, which resulted in the disappearance of the hot thyroid nodule. The treatment of subacute thyroiditis is essentially symptomatic and includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or, occasionally, glucocorticoids if the symptoms are prolonged or severe. In the current case, treatment with steroids resulted in an amelioration of the patient's symptoms and the disappearance of the thyroid nodule after 2 months.

### An unusual form of Riedel's thyroiditis: a case report and review of the literature [^117Siseq]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 36-year old woman with a history of long-term fever associated with a biologic inflammatory syndrome that was not corrected by several courses of corticosteroid treatment. The only remarkable result during previous investigations was the presence of a positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology. Clinical examination revealed an heterogenous thyroid with a nodule on the right lobe. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration was normal. The levels of antiperoxidase antibodies and thyrocalcitonin were normal. Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a 3-cm hypoechogenous nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid. A total thyroidectomy was performed. Histopathologic findings led to the diagnosis of Riedel's thyroiditis. We observed a dramatic improvement after surgery with absence of fever and normalization of inflammatory parameters. The role of EBV infection in the process of this unusual form of Riedel's thyroiditis is discussed.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: a literature review [^113CVXt3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has been reported as a complication of COVID-19 since 2020. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Therefore, we aimed to collect and survey case reports of SAT after COVID-19. We performed a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The keywords and MeSH terms used for the searches were "subacute thyroiditis" and "COVID-19". A total of 38 patients from 26 case reports, case series, and letters on SAT associated with COVID-19 were included and analyzed. The most frequent SAT symptom was neck pain (27 cases), followed by fever (22 cases). Of the 25 cases with information on the duration between onset of COVID-19 symptoms and onset of SAT symptoms, the shortest was simultaneous occurrence, and the longest was 4 months. In most cases, patients developed SAT at several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19. All patients with SAT recovered with no severe complications or sequelae. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SAT development in patients with neck pain and fever following COVID-19. Further research is necessary to determine the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

### Subacute thyroiditis-is it really linked to viral infection? [^112Ci631]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous cases of SAT have been published with temporal relation not only to SARS-CoV-2 infections but also to vaccinations. In some of these publications, the temporal connection was defined strictly for cases of SAT occurring simultaneously with COVID-19, while other publications chose a generous definition with an interval of up to several months between COVID-19 and SAT. In several reported cases, an atypical clinical pattern lacking neck pain is described, which however may be related to nonthyroidal illness syndrome in critically ill patients, or to thyroidal tissue damage due to infection of the thyroid gland with SARS-CoV-2. A recent study reported on 258 cases of SAT occurring within 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and found no clinical difference compared to 98 cases of SAT occurring within 3 months after COVID-19 or 455 control patients.

In this study, we analyze national registry data of hospitalized patients from Germany during the years 2015 to 2022, as well as surveillance data on respiratory and several other infections.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnostic and natural history features include an initial thyrotoxic phase in about 50% of patients due to unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone; the serum TSH level is suppressed and the free T4 level may be elevated preferentially compared to the total T3 level; radioiodine uptake is low; and inflammatory markers are commonly elevated with mild anemia and elevated WBC count, while up to 25% have low antithyroid antibodies. The thyrotoxic phase usually lasts 3–6 weeks, about 30% subsequently enter a hypothyroid phase that can last up to 6 months, most patients become euthyroid within 12 months although 5%–15% have persistent hypothyroidism, and recurrence rates of 1%–4% have been reported.

### COVID-19-related thyroiditis: a novel disease entity? [^1119eUJR]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

The literature on COVID-19-related thyroid complications has accumulated over the past year or so as the pandemic has accelerated throughout the world. In particular, several recent case reports have been published describing a possible correlation between COVID-19 disease and subacute thyroiditis (SAT). In this review, we briefly present one of our own patients and review the current published literature in this area up to January 2021, including analyses of major series of thyroid function tests in patients with significant COVID-19 infection. We conclude that while the great majority of patients with severe COVID-19 infection may show manifestations of the sick euthyroid syndrome, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SAT, especially in the early weeks and months following even mild COVID-19 infection.

### Relapsing polychondritis: an unusual cause of sore throat, painful ear swelling and bilateral costal margin pain [^112T1yMx]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 54-year-old Chinese woman presented with a 3-month history of sore throat and dry cough, which was treated as chronic pharyngitis with minimal improvement. One month ago, she presented with painful right ear swelling without signs or symptoms of otitis media or otitis externa. She was treated with antibiotics and antiviral drugs without any improvement. Two weeks prior to her presentation to hospital, she developed bilateral costal margin pain with raised C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), mild chronic pharyngitis and painful right ear swelling. All other investigations including bloods and imaging were non-specific. Her painful right auricle swelling prompted the diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis (RP), which was supported by clinical improvement with high-dose corticosteroids. RP is a clinical diagnosis with non-specific inflammation of affected cartilage. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and early diagnosis can be made by the most common presenting feature of auricular chondritis.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^116eCLf2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is rarely diagnosed in pregnant women, and only 7 cases have been reported to date. Thyroid dysfunction, especially hyperthyroidism, during pregnancy has been associated with both maternal and neonatal complications. Thus, the early diagnosis and treatment of SAT during pregnancy may be beneficial. We present a case report and literature review to complement the diagnostic evaluation and management of SAT during pregnancy.

Case Presentation

A 27-year-old woman presented in gestational week 17 of her first pregnancy and had a negative prior medical history. She presented to the Endocrinology Department complaining of neck pain for one month that had intensified in the last five days. Physical examination revealed a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland that was firm and tender on palpation. The patient also had an elevated temperature and heart rate. The increasing and long-lasting pain coupled with a decreased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone indicated hyperthyroidism. Ultrasound findings were indicative of SAT. Importantly, the pain was so severe that 10 mg of oral prednisone per day was administered in gestational week 18, which was increased to 15 mg/d after 10 days that was discontinued in week 28. Levothyroxine was started in gestational week 24 and administered throughout the pregnancy. The patient responded well to the treatments, and her neck pain disappeared in gestational week 21. She gave birth to a healthy male in gestational week 41.

Conclusion

SAT can be diagnosed and effectively managed during pregnancy, thus benefiting mothers and infants.

### Thyroiditis: an integrated approach [^115Szv29]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroiditis is a general term that encompasses several clinical disorders characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common is Hashimoto thyroiditis; patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size. Postpartum thyroiditis is transient or persistent thyroid dysfunction that occurs within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism. This may be followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism as a result of depletion of thyroid hormone stores and destruction of thyroid hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can treat symptoms in the initial hyperthyroid phase; in the subsequent hypothyroid phase, levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 mIU per L, or in women with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4 to 10 mIU per L who are symptomatic or desire fertility. Subacute thyroiditis is a transient thyrotoxic state characterized by anterior neck pain, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scanning. Many cases of subacute thyroiditis follow an upper respiratory viral illness, which is thought to trigger an inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles. In most cases, the thyroid gland spontaneously resumes normal thyroid hormone production after several months. Treatment with high-dose acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is directed toward relief of thyroid pain.

### HLA typing of patients who developed subacute thyroiditis and Graves' disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: a case report [^113w3diV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Initially, the site of tenderness coincided with the left lobe of the thyroid gland. However, the site of tenderness changed during follow-up. At the time the patient sought medical attention at our hospital, tenderness occurred in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a slightly enlarged right lobe of the thyroid gland and focal hypoechoic area with decreased blood flow (Fig. 1 B), which coincided with the site of tenderness. Of special note were the facts that thyroid ultrasonography revealed reduced blood flow (an imaging characteristic of SAT) but not any findings suggestive of GD. The volume of both lobes was calculated using the aforementioned method. The volumes of the right and left lobes were 10.2 mL and 8.4 mL, respectively. The patient was diagnosed with SAT because of severe tenderness at the thyroid gland site, elevated CRP levels, findings indicating thyrotoxicosis in thyroid function tests, and SAT-related findings during ultrasonography. On the day when the patient sought medical attention at our hospital, oral thiamazole administration (15 mg/day) was discontinued and oral PSL administration at a dose of 20 mg/day was initiated. We dithered over discontinuing thiamazole because she had increased TRAb levels, although we considered the presence of SAT based on ultrasonography findings and did not consider GD when attempting to make a precise diagnosis. We wanted to observe if improvements occurred by treating her only for SAT. After explaining this to the patient and obtaining her consent, we decided to discontinue thiamazole. Subsequently, the patient's symptoms improved. Blood chemistry tests on day 51 after the second vaccination indicated normalized serum FT3 and FT4 levels (Table 1). The PSL dose was tapered when the symptoms resolved, and oral PSL administration was discontinued during week 7 after its initiation. However, palpitations and mild fever (37.0–37.3 °C) occurred 2 days after PSL discontinuation. Thyroid gland tenderness did not recur at that time or thereafter. Thyroid function tests at week 1 after oral PSL discontinuation revealed a decreased serum TSH level of < 0.01 μIU/mL, normal serum FT4 level of 1.67 ng/dL, and an increased serum FT3 level of 5.92 pg/mL. Thyroid scintigraphy with 99m technetium (Tc) pertechnetate, which was conducted on the same day, indicated the accumulation of the artificial radioactive element in the thyroid gland with an uptake rate of 2.21% 20 minutes after administration (Fig. 1 C). At our hospital where this test is performed under conditions of a low TSH value and thyrotoxicosis, we diagnose destructive thyroiditis (SAT or silent thyroiditis) when the uptake rate is ≤ 0.5%, and GD when the uptake rate is ≥ 1%. Based on these findings, we diagnosed the patient with GD and prescribed 10 mg of oral thiamazole daily. Subsequently, the patient became euthyroid.

Case summary

A 54 year-old female presented with new onset chest pain radiating to her upper back, associated with recurrent abdominal pain, general malaise, and a 3-days history of nausea and vomiting. Notably, she was hospitalized 2-months ago for abdominal pain, and diagnosed with acute bilateral renal infarcts (left > right) of unknown etiology. Other comorbidities included: recent COVID-19 infection, bronchitis, beta-thalassemia, migraines, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, inflammatory arthritis consistent with psoriatic arthritis. Her past medical history was otherwise significant for previously elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, oral corticosteroid use (> 1 year ago), and occasional corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain. Her family history was negative for any aneurysms, dissections, early or sudden death, and connective tissue diseases. The patient is a lifelong non-smoker, and had no relevant past surgical history, recent travel, allergies, history of infectious diseases, including syphilis. Review of systems was positive for headache, jaw pain, rhinitis, and fatigue. There was no history of salivary/lacrimal gland enlargement, dry eyes, lymphadenopathy, limb claudication, pancreatitis, cholangitis, oral or genital ulcers, rash, fevers, night sweats, or weight loss.

### Thyroiditis [^111njwau]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland that may be painful and tender when caused by infection, radiation, or trauma, or painless when caused by autoimmune conditions, medications, or an idiopathic fibrotic process. The most common forms are Hashimoto's disease, subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis, and drug-induced thyroiditis (caused by amiodarone, interferon-alfa, interleukin-2, or lithium). Patients may have euthyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism, or may evolve from one condition to another over time. Diagnosis is by clinical context and findings, including the presence or absence of pain, tenderness, and autoantibodies. In addition, the degree of radioactive iodine uptake by the gland is reduced in most patients with viral, radiation-induced, traumatic, autoimmune, or drug-induced inflammation of the thyroid. Treatment primarily is directed at symptomatic relief of thyroid pain and tenderness, if present, and restoration of euthyroidism.

- Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy
- Palatal petechiae
- Pharyngeal and tonsillar erythema
- Tonsillar hypertrophy with or without exudates Patients with group A strep pharyngitis may also present with a scarlatiniform rash. The resulting syndrome is scarlet fever. Keep ReadingClinical Guidance for Scarlet Fever. Less common symptoms Other symptoms, especially among children, may include:

- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting Subacute illness Respiratory disease caused by group A strep infection in children younger than 3 years of age rarely manifests as acute pharyngitis.

Instead, these children usually have what is called "streptococcal fever" or "streptococcosis, " which involves mucopurulent rhinitis followed by:

- Anorexia
- Fever
- Irritability. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of acute pharyngitis includes multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis in all age groups. Experts estimate that group A strep, the most common bacterial cause, causes
- 20% to 30% of pharyngitis episodes in children
- 5% to 15% of pharyngitis infections in adults Clinical examination only with viral symptoms Healthcare providers can use history and clinical examination to diagnose viral pharyngitis when clear viral symptoms are present. These patients don't need testing for group A strep bacteria. Positive RADT or culture Healthcare providers can use a positive RADT or throat culture as confirmation of group A strep pharyngitis.

Treatment Patients, regardless of age, who have a positive RADT or throat culture need antibiotics. Don't treat viral pharyngitis with antibiotics. Benefits of antibiotics Using a recommended antibiotic regimen to treat group A strep pharyngitis:

- Shortens the duration of symptoms
- Reduces the likelihood of transmission to close contacts

### About infectious mononucleosis (mono) | EBV and mono… [^113MdZ4T]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Infectious mononucleosis, also called "mono, " is a contagious disease.
- Most people with mono get better in 2 to 4 weeks, but some may feel fatigued for several more weeks.
- There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis. Sign and symptoms Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis include:

- Extreme fatigue
- Fever
- Sore throat
- Headaches and body aches
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits
- Swollen liver or spleen or both
- Rash Enlarged spleen and a swollen liver are less common symptoms. For some people, their liver or spleen or both may remain enlarged even after their fatigue ends. While most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks, some may feel fatigued for several more weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis can last for 6 months or longer. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers typically diagnose infectious mononucleosis based on symptoms.

Laboratory tests are not usually needed to diagnose infectious mononucleosis. However, specific tests may be needed for patients who do not have a typical case of infectious mononucleosis. The blood work of patients who have infectious mononucleosis due to EBV infection may show:

- More white blood cells than normal
- Unusual looking white blood cells
- Fewer than normal neutrophils or platelets
- Abnormal liver function Public HealthLaboratory Testing for Epstein-Barr Virus. Treatment and recovery Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. You can help relieve symptoms of infectious mononucleosis by:

- Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
- Getting plenty of rest
- Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever Do not take penicillin antibiotics If you have infectious mononucleosis, you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin.

Based on the severity of the symptoms, a healthcare provider may recommend treatment of specific organ systems affected by infectious mononucleosis. Avoid contact sports Because your spleen may become enlarged as a result of infectious mononucleosis, you should avoid contact sports until you fully recover. Participating in contact sports can be strenuous and may cause the spleen to rupture.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults… [^116PXbDX]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

The lack of a standard diagnostic workup leads to frustration for physicians and patients, and numerous noninvasive and invasive procedures are often performed without arriving at a definitive diagnosis. 1, 3 Currently, the most widely accepted definition of FUO requires only a clinically documented temperature of 101°F or higher on several occasions and an unrevealing diagnostic workup. 2, 4 Previous definitions have provided suggested minimal time frames for investigation; however, these were acknowledged to be arbitrary and are not included in the current consensus definition. 2, 4. Evaluation INITIAL EVALUATION Early identification and precise localization of the cause are key because diagnostic delay worsens outcomes and contributes to deaths. 7, 8 At a minimum, physical examination should include evaluation of the skin, oropharynx, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, and genitalia.

8, 9 It is important to rule out factitious fever, which has been reported in up to 9% of cases. 10 It should be suspected in cases of fever lasting longer than six months and in medical personnel. Signs such as high temperatures without tachycardia or skin warmth or unusual fever patterns should also bring the diagnosis of factitious fever to mind. 1, 2, 8, 10 It is important to confirm the presence of fever and any temporal pattern it may exhibit. Several infectious etiologies, including malaria and tuberculosis, follow classic fever patterns. 8, 10 Table 2 summarizes physical examination findings that may help in narrowing the potential etiology of the FUO. 8 If one or more of these signs are present, associated conditions should be ruled out before initiating a more general evaluation.

Although these signs are found in as many as 97% of patients, they lead to a diagnosis in only 62% of patients with FUO. 4, 11, 12. Up to 75% of patients with FUO will have spontaneous resolution of their fevers. 1, 11, 12, 38 If after at least an initial workup, no diagnosis is determined and the fever persists, infectious disease, rheumatology, or hematology/oncology consultation may be appropriate. The exact timing of consultation should be based on the patient's clinical condition and evaluation findings.
