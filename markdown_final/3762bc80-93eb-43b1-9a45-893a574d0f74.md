## Question

Possible causes for a 7 year old male patient with fluctuating fever that reaches 103.9, coughing fits, and diarrhea. Fever has persisted for 6 days and usually responds to tylenol/ibuprofen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about possible causes for a 7-year-old with 6 days of high fever (up to 103.9°F), coughing fits, and diarrhea, with fever that usually responds to tylenol/ibuprofen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the illness script and whether this is still an acute febrile illness versus fever of unknown origin. Then, I should structure a prioritized differential that accounts for respiratory and gastrointestinal involvement in a school-aged child. Next, I will verify key discriminators that separate common viral causes from atypical bacterial pathogens and enteric infections. After that, I need to outline an evidence-informed diagnostic plan, making sure I do not over-apply infant guidelines to a 7-year-old. Finally, I will consider management, including antivirals, antibiotics when indicated, and supportive care with safe antipyretic dosing, and close with a clear next-step plan with red flags to monitor [^115QePFm] [^112h3Wip] [^114enpVx] [^112n5aQW] [^114MPr7w] [^111tdbZg] [^112R1AoS] [^114rvsRR] [^1167qeW9] [^112vZzjA].

> Let me first confirm the syndrome classification and duration threshold. This is an acute febrile illness with combined respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations in a school-aged child, now on day 6 of fever, which exceeds the usual 3 to 5 days for many uncomplicated viral URIs but does not, strictly speaking, meet classic fever of unknown origin criteria. Wait, I initially thought an inpatient one-week duration could qualify, but I should correct that: modern FUO definitions still anchor on fever for at least 3 weeks with unrevealing initial evaluation, so this case has not reached FUO by standard criteria, though the persistent high fevers do justify a focused evaluation beyond simple watchful waiting [^115QePFm] [^112h3Wip].

> I will now examine the most likely diagnosis given the triad of high fever, cough, and diarrhea in a 7-year-old. Influenza rises to the top because children commonly have gastrointestinal symptoms with influenza, alongside abrupt fever and cough, and typical illness spans about 5 to 7 days, which fits the current 6-day course. Hold on, let me verify GI frequency in pediatric influenza and the time course: reviews confirm GI symptoms are common in children, and viral shedding spans approximately one day before symptoms through 5 to 7 days after onset, aligning with this trajectory. The adult Tamiflu trials define the symptomatic phenotype used for treatment studies, reinforcing the fever plus respiratory and systemic symptom complex consistent with influenza-like illness, though pediatric confirmation should rely on testing rather than adult efficacy data alone [^114enpVx] [^112n5aQW] [^111UzcX2] [^114rvsRR] [^115vHiqY].

> Next, I should review atypical bacterial etiologies, especially Mycoplasma pneumoniae, given the description of coughing "fits" and the prolonged fever beyond several days. Let me consider extrapulmonary features. Mycoplasma in children often produces persistent cough and fever and can present with diverse, noncharacteristic systemic manifestations, including gastrointestinal symptoms through immune-mediated mechanisms, and PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab is a practical diagnostic approach. Wait, I need to ensure I do not overcall severe lower respiratory tract disease without imaging or auscultatory findings; the case series also cautions that lack of awareness can lead to excessive CT and invasive procedures, so I should recommend stepwise, minimally invasive testing first [^114MPr7w].

> But wait, what if this is enteric fever. Enteric fever presents with high fevers that plateau toward the end of the first week and often includes diarrhea and abdominal pain, and cough is recognized as a concomitant symptom. I need to check for epidemiologic risk such as travel, exposures, and vaccination history, because absent those, the pretest probability in a typical school-aged child in many settings is lower. Still, on day 6 with high fever and diarrhea, enteric fever remains a reasonable consideration if there is a compatible exposure history, and blood and stool cultures would then be appropriate [^111tdbZg].

> I should double-check other viral possibilities. SARS-CoV-2 can cause fever, cough, and in some cases gastrointestinal symptoms in children, though many pediatric illnesses are mild and epidemiology drives pretest probability. Hold on, I should not overgeneralize from adult guidance, but regulatory summaries and systematic reviews document the symptom spectrum sufficiently to justify a SARS-CoV-2 PCR if community transmission or exposure exists. Adenovirus and other respiratory viruses can also cause febrile respiratory and gastrointestinal syndromes; however, without specific local epidemiology or antigen testing, they are supporting, not leading, diagnoses at present [^111231ZL] [^114Z1RPs].

> Let me reconsider noninfectious and periodic fever syndromes briefly so I do not miss them. PFAPA classically presents with recurrent, stereotyped febrile episodes and accompanying aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis; a single 6-day febrile illness with cough and diarrhea does not fit that pattern, making PFAPA unlikely here. I initially listed Kawasaki disease as a possibility because the fever is beyond 5 days, but hold on, I should verify supportive mucocutaneous criteria; in the absence of conjunctival injection, mucosal changes, extremity changes, rash, or cervical lymphadenopathy, KD is not supported by the current information, though continued fever beyond 7 days without a source would warrant re-assessment for inflammatory etiologies [^113g28VJ] [^116ppWeG].

> Next, I should review an evidence-aligned initial diagnostic approach that balances yield and invasiveness. First, confirm or refute leading viral etiologies with a respiratory panel or targeted PCRs for influenza and SARS-CoV-2, noting that rapid influenza tests can be informative when influenza is circulating. Second, obtain Mycoplasma PCR from the nasopharynx if cough persists or atypical features are suspected. Third, if there is epidemiologic risk for enteric fever or prominent gastrointestinal involvement, obtain blood cultures and consider stool culture. Fourth, order basic labs including CBC with differential and inflammatory markers to stratify viral versus bacterial patterns, reserving a chest radiograph for persistent cough, hypoxia, focal chest findings, or clinical concern for pneumonia. Wait, I almost reflexively suggested universal urinalysis based on infant algorithms; I should correct that: ACEP guidance about routine urine testing targets 2 to 24 months, so for a 7-year-old, UA should be symptom-driven rather than routine, unless there are urinary symptoms or other risk factors [^112n5aQW] [^114MPr7w] [^111tdbZg] [^112R1AoS].

> I need to ensure the therapeutic plan is both timely and proportionate to likelihoods and severity. For suspected or confirmed influenza, antiviral therapy with oseltamivir provides modest reductions in symptom duration and may reduce complications, with the greatest benefit when started within 48 hours, though treatment beyond 48 hours can be considered in severe or hospitalized cases after clinical judgment. Hold on, let me verify that I am not overgeneralizing from adult data; the labeling and guidance derive much of their effect estimates from adult trials, so for a stable outpatient 7-year-old beyond 48 hours, shared decision-making is reasonable, while a positive test early in illness or high-risk features would favor treatment. For Mycoplasma pneumoniae, macrolides are first-line if there is clinical, radiographic, or microbiologic support, recognizing that some pediatric cases are self-limited. Supportive care remains central: use weight-based acetaminophen 10 to 15 mg/kg orally every 4 to 6 hours, not exceeding 75 mg/kg per day, encourage oral hydration, and rest. Hold on, I should caution about alternating antipyretics; evidence for alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen offers small temperature advantages but remains limited and should be used cautiously if at all, with clear dosing schedules to avoid overdose [^112vZzjA] [^114rvsRR] [^115vHiqY] [^114MPr7w] [^1167qeW9] [^112aUmL6] [^115nSKA2].

> I should confirm red flags and safety-netting. Persistent fever beyond 7 days without a source, new focal respiratory signs, dehydration from diarrhea, rash evolution, altered mental status, or signs of respiratory distress should prompt re-evaluation and possible escalation, including imaging or broader infectious workup, while avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures when noninvasive testing can clarify the diagnosis. Let me verify that minimizing unnecessary CT and bronchoscopy is supported; yes, the Mycoplasma series explicitly warns about overuse when atypical presentations are misinterpreted, supporting a stepwise diagnostic strategy [^114MPr7w] [^115QePFm].

> Pulling this together, my prioritized differential is influenza virus infection as most likely, given the day-6 high fever, cough, and pediatric GI involvement, followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae as a close alternative in the setting of persistent cough and fever, and enteric fever as a context-dependent third if epidemiology supports exposure, with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses as additional considerations guided by local transmission. Immediate next steps are to obtain rapid influenza and SARS-CoV-2 testing, consider Mycoplasma PCR if cough persists, add blood and stool cultures when enteric fever risk is present, and initiate supportive care now, with antiviral or antibiotic therapy tailored to positive findings or high clinical suspicion while monitoring for red flags that would change management trajectory [^114enpVx] [^112n5aQW] [^114MPr7w] [^111tdbZg] [^111231ZL] [^112vZzjA] [^1167qeW9].

The most likely causes for a 7-year-old male with **fluctuating high fever, coughing fits, and diarrhea** persisting for 6 days are **viral infections** (influenza [^112n5aQW], COVID-19 [^111231ZL], adenovirus, enterovirus [^1172mhXc]) or **atypical bacterial pneumonia** (Mycoplasma pneumoniae [^114MPr7w], Chlamydia pneumoniae). Consider **bacterial enteritis** (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, Yersinia) if diarrhea predominates, and **pertussis** if coughing fits are severe. Less common causes include tuberculosis [^117WamrK], melioidosis [^111drUUN], Q fever [^114RDEA9], and PFAPA [^113g28VJ]. Initial workup should include **CBC, CRP/ESR, blood and stool cultures, a respiratory viral panel, chest X-ray, and COVID-19 testing** [^116cm1RL]; if unrevealing, escalate to a broader infectious, autoimmune, and malignancy evaluation [^115QePFm] [^112h3Wip].

## Infectious causes

### Viral infections

- **Influenza virus**: High fever [^114enpVx], cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea) are common in pediatric influenza [^112n5aQW].

- **COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)**: Fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, are well-documented in pediatric COVID-19 cases [^116cm1RL].

- **Adenovirus**: Can cause respiratory symptoms, high fever, and diarrhea in children.

- **Enterovirus**: Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, are common presentations.

---

### Bacterial infections

- **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**: Atypical pneumonia presenting with persistent fever, cough, and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms [^114MPr7w].

- **Chlamydia pneumoniae**: Similar presentation to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, with persistent fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Pertussis (Bordetella pertussis)**: Characterized by severe coughing fits, persistent fever, and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Bacterial enteritis**: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Yersinia can cause high fever, diarrhea, and occasionally respiratory symptoms.

---

### Other infectious causes

Other infectious causes include **tuberculosis**, presenting with persistent fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms — particularly in endemic areas or in immunocompromised patients [^117WamrK]. **Melioidosis** (Burkholderia pseudomallei) can cause high fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms in endemic regions [^111drUUN]. **Q fever** (Coxiella burnetii) may also present with persistent fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

---

## Non-infectious causes

### Autoimmune and inflammatory conditions

- **PFAPA syndrome**: Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis, and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms [^116ppWeG].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Persistent fever, diarrhea, and occasionally respiratory symptoms [^112h3Wip].

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Persistent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and occasionally respiratory symptoms [^112DjDK3].

---

### Malignancies

Among malignancies, **leukemia** and **lymphoma** can present with persistent fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms, often due to immunosuppression and secondary infections [^112h3Wip].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Given the broad differential, a **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential [^115QePFm], beginning with initial laboratory tests (CBC, CRP, ESR, blood cultures, stool cultures, respiratory viral panel, and COVID-19 testing [^116cm1RL]) and imaging such as chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia or other respiratory infections [^112h3Wip]. If these are inconclusive, pursue further investigations, including autoimmune screening (ANA, anti-dsDNA), tuberculosis testing (PPD, IGRA) [^117WamrK], and evaluation for malignancy (bone marrow biopsy, imaging studies).

---

## Management considerations

Management includes **supportive care** [^112vZzjA] — antipyretics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) [^112aUmL6], hydration, and monitoring for complications — plus targeted therapy based on the identified etiology (appropriate antiviral, antibiotic, or immunosuppressive therapy). Consider hospitalization if the patient becomes clinically unstable, develops complications, or if outpatient management is insufficient [^115QePFm].

In summary, the most likely causes in a 7-year-old with fluctuating fever, coughing fits, and diarrhea include viral infections (influenza, COVID-19, adenovirus, enterovirus); bacterial infections (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, pertussis, bacterial enteritis); and, less commonly, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions (PFAPA, IBD, SLE) or malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma). A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause and guide appropriate management.

The main microbiologic finding was a nasopharyngeal swab positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Since the general clinical conditions of the patient were improving and the fever disappeared 6 days after admission, we did not prescribe a specific macrolide treatment. We repeated a lung ultrasound 1 month after the beginning of the clinical manifestations in an outpatient setting; the result was normal.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children can cause different and noncharacteristic clinical, laboratory, and radiologic manifestations. It is often responsible for self-limited community-acquired pneumonia but sometimes is the pathogen of severe lower respiratory tract inflammation, causing atelectasis and massive lung infiltration. In this article, we report the cases of two children who came to our attention for persistent fever and with evidence of basal hypophonesis on respiratory auscultation. In both cases, CT scans showed parenchymal hypoventilation, areas with a ground-glass appearance, and centrilobular micronodules, some of which had a tree-in-bud aspect, compatible with the suspicion of tuberculosis. Interestingly, both had severe mediastinal lymph node swelling. In a retrospective audit, we acknowledge the excessive diagnostic procedures, including invasive ones like CT and bronchoalveolar lavage, due to lack of awareness of this possible Mycoplasma pneumoniae localization and the social risk factors for TB.

Pediatric mediastinal lymphadenitis has been rarely reported in the literature as a possible radiographic pattern of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Lee et al. analyzed

### Influenza [^114enpVx]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Influenza is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, dry cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion (Fig 1). Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are also common. The incubation period of influenza, or the time from infection to the development of symptoms, is 1 to 4 days. Viral shedding, when the virus is infectious, usually occurs from one day before the onset of symptoms to 5–7 days after.

Fig 1: Symptoms and complications of influenza. Complicated influenza is defined as an infection that requires hospital admission.

Influenza can cause severe illness or death, particularly in high-risk populations. Mortality is higher among individuals with complicated influenza — illness necessitating hospital admission or an exacerbation of an underlying chronic illness — across all age groups, but it is highest in infants aged 6 months or younger.

### Gohibic [^111231ZL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to worsen. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to worsen.

Gohibic is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Gohibic is investigational because it is still being studied. It is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

Influenza virus infection can be associated with a wide range of symptoms and conditions. These include a runny nose, cough, chills, fever, and acute onset of symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and headache. Patients may also experience malaise, diffuse aches, and flu-like symptoms. Obesity can complicate the course of the disease, and there may be evidence of immunocompromising conditions. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea can occur, along with sore throats and sneezing. Chronic disease patients may present with elevated serum CK levels and decreased blood lymphocyte counts. A rapid influenza test is often indicative of the infection's presence.

### Mekinist [^115HYaf5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Serious febrile reactions**: Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure can occur when Mekinist is administered with dabrafenib.

- **Mekinist administered with dabrafenib (adult)**: In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in < 1% of patients.

- **Mekinist administered with dabrafenib (pediatric)**: In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients.

Withhold Mekinist when used as monotherapy, and both Mekinist and dabrafenib when used in combination, if the patient's temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia. If appropriate, Mekinist, or both Mekinist and dabrafenib when used in combination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for at least 24 hours, either at the same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The disease, PFAPA syndrome, can be associated with a variety of symptoms. These include flu-like symptoms, arthralgia, irritability, fever, vomiting, decreased blood lymphocyte count, and abdominal pain. Patients may also experience aphthous ulcers, skin rash, cough, increased WBC count, and pharyngeal exudate. Additional symptoms include fatigue, headache, increased ESR, cervical lymphadenopathy, chills, malaise, increased serum CRP, diarrhea, increased blood neutrophil count, monocytosis, sore throat, oral ulcers, pharyngitis, pharyngeal erythema, and recurrent episodes mainly affecting children.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^114Z1RPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with SARS‐CoV‐2. The key target condition for this review was COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms include breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia); or critical (requiring respiratory support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease) require distinctive patient management, and it is important to be able to identify these patients. In this review, we focus on COVID‐19, without making the distinction between mild to moderate and severe disease.

- **Index test(s)**: We collated evidence on all routine biomarker tests reported in the identified studies. These can be classified into: full blood count, hemoglobin and red blood cells; coagulation markers; liver markers, cardiac markers, and kidney function markers; general inflammatory markers; and metabolic markers.

### A case of periodic fever and persistent splenomegaly in a 2-year-old boy [^112uRgH1]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

We report an unusual case of periodic fever associated with persistent splenomegaly in a 2-year-old boy. Febrile episodes occurred at regular two-week intervals, each lasting for 1–2 days. Following the resolution of the fever on each occasion, the patient developed neck stiffness for 1–2 days. The periodic febrile episodes, as well as the splenomegaly, spontaneously resolved nine months after the disease's onset. Infectious and malignant causes were ruled out as far as possible. This patient's clinical features are unusual and do not match any known category of periodic fevers in childhood. We believe this case highlights the diagnostic challenges that periodic fevers commonly represent.

### A 5-month-old infant with a complicated holiday souvenir [^117EtkhX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

A 5-month-old Dutch male infant from non-consanguineous parents was referred to an academic children's hospital in the Netherlands due to a fever of unknown origin lasting 2 weeks, accompanied by progressive pancytopenia. His previous medical history was unremarkable, and he had been adequately vaccinated for his age. The travel history included a visit to Morocco at the age of 2 months.

Prior to presentation at our hospital, empirical sepsis treatment was initiated. However, blood cultures were negative, and the child remained febrile after 48 hours of antibiotic treatment.

Upon referral, the child was hemodynamically stable but appeared pale, inactive, and mildly dehydrated on physical examination. His body temperature was 39.6°C. Further physical examination revealed an enlarged spleen, but was otherwise unremarkable. Splenomegaly was confirmed by ultrasound, showing a total spleen size of 8 cm (suggested upper limit value at age 3–6 months: 6.5 cm).

Laboratory tests revealed the following:

- **White blood cell count**: 2.4 × 10⁹/L (reference: 6.0–15.0 × 10⁹/L).
- **Hemoglobin**: 7.9 g/dL (reference: 9.02–12.73 g/dL).
- **Platelet count**: 67 × 10⁹/L (reference: 229–597 × 10⁹/L).
- **C-reactive protein**: 10 mg/dL (reference: < 1 mg/dL).
- **Ferritin**: 4662 µg/L (reference: 30–240 µg/L).
- **Lactate dehydrogenase**: 1053 U/L (reference: < 610 U/L).
- **Aspartate aminotransferase**: 154 U/L (reference: < 89 U/L).
- **Alanine transaminase**: 43 U/L (reference: < 60 U/L).

A serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were negative. A bone marrow biopsy was performed. The microscopy is shown in Figure 1.

### Tamiflu [^114rvsRR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of Tamiflu were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the US, for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had a fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), while influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral Tamiflu or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of the 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of these 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of the onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received Tamiflu 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo.

### The pathogenesis of influenza virus infections: the contributions of virus and host factors [^115g7Qd2]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Influenza viruses cause acute respiratory inflammation in humans and symptoms such as high fever, body aches, and fatigue. Usually, these symptoms improve after several days; however, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [influenza A(H1N1) 2009] is more pathogenic than seasonal influenza viruses, and the pathogenicity of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses is still higher. The 1918 influenza pandemic virus caused severe pneumonia, resulting in an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide. Several virulence factors have been identified in these virus strains, but host factors are also responsible for the pathogenesis of infections caused by virulent viruses. Here, we review the contributions of both virus and host factors to the pathogenesis of these viral infections.

### From telemedicine to the ICU-fever and rash in a 9-year-old girl [^112eQ5mZ]. Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

A 9-year-old girl presented to her primary care pediatrician via telemedicine during the initial months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of 4 days of warmth perceived by her mother, decreased energy, and a new rash on her upper extremities. After 10 additional days of documented fever > 38°C, worsening fatigue, and 1 day of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, she was allowed to schedule an in-person visit with her pediatrician after testing negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. She appeared ill on arrival to the clinic, and her pediatrician recommended evaluation in an emergency department.

Her initial laboratory testing revealed a nonspecific elevation in several inflammatory markers and leukopenia, and she responded well to intravenous hydration. Over the next 2 weeks, her fever persisted, constitutional symptoms worsened, and she developed progressively painful cervical lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. She was evaluated in the clinic by several specialists and eventually was urged to present to the emergency department again, at which time she was admitted to the PICU.

After consulting additional specialists and waiting for laboratory results, the team reached a definitive diagnosis and initiated therapy; however, she experienced rapid clinical decline shortly thereafter. The specialists who assisted with identification of the underlying etiology of her symptoms were able to work together to manage the subsequent complications.

### Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis and planning for the future [^1147ASda]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In late 2019, a new virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, causing an infectious disease that would later be named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020. This disease quickly spread across the globe, with a very rapid increase in new cases noted in many European countries and the United States between early February and early March 2020. On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of COVID-19 a global pandemic. As of May 29, 2020, a total of 5,657,529 cases of COVID-19 were registered worldwide, with 356,254 confirmed deaths. In the United States alone, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 28, 2020, was 1,698,523, and 100,446 Americans had died of this disease.

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) - A call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^115QePFm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, the classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis, management, and diagnostic testing over the last three decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

### The origin of COVID-19 and why it matters [^113oYanx]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic: The agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, was named after the genetically related SARS-CoV (more recently distinguished by some as SARS-CoV-1), which caused a deadly near-pandemic in 2002–2003. Before 2019, neither SARS-CoV-2 nor its genetic sequences had ever been identified in viruses of humans or animals.

Even so, scientific research conducted over the last two decades provides clues about how and why the COVID-19 pandemic appeared. We must understand these critically important scientific findings so that we can better address significant existential risks we will continue to face for the foreseeable future.

### Update in COVID-19 2020 [^113htLP8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

As 2020 evolved, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presented the greatest global health crisis in a century, affecting medical, social, and economic systems (Figure 1). Despite challenging society with new ways of living, working, and communicating, its significant clinical, research, and public health impact was admirably managed by clinicians and scientists worldwide against a backdrop of continually evolving evidence. In this update, we review important publications from the American Thoracic Society journals and others that provide insight into pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment advances of COVID-19 disease, while also considering broader societal effects. Throughout the update, we use "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)" when referencing the virus and use "COVID-19" in relation to the associated illness.

### Preparing for pandemics: A systematic review of pandemic influenza clinical management guidelines [^115S1SYe]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Influenza pandemics are one of the greatest global health threats, potentially causing millions of deaths and significant socioeconomic disruption. The ever-present threat of pandemic influenza and experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic emphasize the critical importance of pandemic preparedness.

The 1918 influenza pandemic, previously labeled "the deadliest pandemic of modern age", illustrated how fatal an influenza pandemic can be, with an estimated 50–100 million deaths globally. The more recent influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic, despite a lower case-fatality rate than predicted, reminded us of the risk to human health from a novel virus. Most recently, the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, with more than six million deaths reported (as of 11th May 2022), highlights our ongoing global vulnerability to emerging viral infections and the need to incorporate lessons learned to strengthen our preparedness for future outbreaks.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a reminder of how rapidly respiratory infections can transmit globally, resulting in morbidity, mortality, and economic, societal, and health system disruptions. It has further demonstrated that we are still not adequately prepared for a global pandemic response, as the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board highlighted in October 2019.

### Vivotif-b [^113ns5xx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

One capsule is to be swallowed approximately 1 hour before a meal with a cold or lukewarm drink (temperature not to exceed body temperature, e.g. 37 °C or 98.6 °F) on alternate days, such as days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Immunization, which involves the ingestion of all 4 doses of Vivotif (Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a), should be completed at least 1 week prior to potential exposure to S. typhi.

The blister containing the vaccine capsules should be inspected to ensure that the foil seal and capsules are intact. The vaccine capsule should not be chewed and should be swallowed as soon after placing it in the mouth as possible. A complete immunization schedule consists of the ingestion of 4 vaccine capsules as described above.

- **Re-immunization**: The optimum booster schedule for Vivotif® has not been determined. Efficacy has been shown to persist for at least 5 years. Furthermore, there is no experience with Vivotif as a booster in persons previously immunized with parenteral typhoid vaccine. It is recommended that a re-immunization dose consisting of four vaccine capsules taken on alternate days be given every 5 years under conditions of repeated or continued exposure to typhoid fever.

### Tamiflu [^115vHiqY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of Tamiflu were conducted in adults aged 18 to 65 years, one in the U.S. and one outside the US, for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had a fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (such as cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (including myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), while influenza virus was confirmed to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral Tamiflu or a placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects could also take fever-reducing medications.

Of the 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) were influenza-infected (median age of 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Among these influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with an unknown type of influenza.

Study medication was initiated within 40 hours of symptom onset and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects self-assessed influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the initiation of treatment to the point when all symptoms were reported as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received Tamiflu 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to those who received a placebo.

### Fever, rash, and cough in a 7-year-old boy [^113vpQNh]. Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and a morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital but then returned to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake.

He was then admitted, and a more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

### Etiology and resource use of fever of unknown origin in hospitalized children [^112h3Wip]. Hospital Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a well-known pediatric presentation. The primary studies determining the causes of prolonged fever in children were performed four decades ago, before major advances in laboratory and diagnostic testing. Given that the distribution of diagnosed causes of adult FUO has changed in recent decades, we hypothesized that the etiology of FUO in children has concordantly changed and also may be impacted by a definition that includes a shorter required duration of fever.

- **Methods**: A single-center, retrospective review was conducted of patients aged 6 months to 18 years admitted to the North Carolina Children's Hospital from January 1, 2002, to December 21, 2012. These patients had an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis of fever, a documented fever duration of more than seven days before admission, and a previous physician evaluation of each patient's illness.

- **Results**: A total of 1164 patients were identified, and 102 met the inclusion criteria for FUO. Etiologic categories included infectious (42 out of 102 patients), autoimmune (28 out of 102 patients), oncologic (18 out of 102 patients), and other or unknown (14 out of 102 patients). Several clinical factors were statistically and significantly different between etiologic categories, including fever length, laboratory values, imaging performed, length of stay, and hospital costs.

- **Conclusions**: Unlike adult studies, the categorical distribution of diagnoses for pediatric FUO has marginally shifted compared to previously reported pediatric studies. Patients hospitalized with FUO un

### Alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the treatment of febrile children: a pilot study [^115nSKA2]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the treatment of febrile children is a prevalent practice among physicians and parents, despite the lack of evidence on effectiveness or safety. This randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to compare the antipyretic effectiveness and safety of a single administration of alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen doses to that of ibuprofen monotherapy in febrile children.

- **Methods**: Seventy febrile children were randomly allocated to receive either a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg ibuprofen and 15 mg/kg oral acetaminophen after 4 hours, or a similar dose of ibuprofen and placebo at 4 hours. Rectal temperature was measured at baseline and at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours later. Endpoints included proportions of afebrile children at 6, 7, and 8 hours, maximum decline in temperature, time to recurrence of fever, and change in temperature from baseline at each time point. Intent-to-treat analysis was planned with statistical significance set at P < 0.05.

- **Results**: A higher proportion of subjects in the intervention group (83.3%) became afebrile at 6 hours than in the control group (57.6%); P = 0.018. This difference was accentuated at 7 and 8 hours (P < 0.001) with a significantly longer time to recurrence of fever in the intervention group (mean ± SD of 7.4 ± 1.3 versus 5.7 ± 2.2 hours), P < 0.001. Odds ratios (95% CI) for defervescence were 5.6 (1.3; 23.8), 19.5 (3.5; 108.9), and 15.3 (3.4; 68.3) at 6, 7, and 8 hours respectively. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures over time revealed a significantly large…

### A 2-year-old with 4 weeks of daily fever [^113X6UB3]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old female presents for evaluation of 4 weeks of daily fevers. When the fevers began, she had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which quickly resolved. The fevers persisted, however, with a maximum of 40°C. The child's review of symptoms was significant for a 1-kg weight loss over the past month. Ten months before presentation, she had moved from Saudi Arabia with her family. One week before the onset of symptoms, she had visited a petting zoo. During episodes of fever, the patient was ill-appearing and had an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate. On examination, she was found to be thin, febrile, tachycardic, and with scattered lymphadenopathy. Results of laboratory tests were remarkable for an elevated white blood cell count of 16,100 cells per uL with a neutrophilic predominance. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 99 mm/h and 27 mg/dL, respectively. A chest radiograph indicated a small amount of fluid in the interlobar fissures. Our expert panel examines her case, offers a definition of fever of unknown origin, and makes diagnostic considerations.

### Enteric fever [^111tdbZg]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Patients present with a gradual onset of fever, which typically rises to a plateau of 39–40°C (102–104°F) towards the end of a week. This slow rise in fever contrasts with the intermittent high fever and rigors seen in malaria.

Abdominal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common as per a systematic review on the clinical profile of enteric fever. Abdominal pain is diffuse and poorly localized but occasionally intense in the right iliac fossa, mimicking appendicitis. Patients may also have headache, cough, and malaise. Children under 5 years old frequently present with only fever, and the diagnosis may be missed unless they have complications.

Symptoms start 7–14 days after exposure (range 3–60 days). Paratyphoid fever has a shorter incubation period (4–5 days), but symptoms are indistinguishable from those of typhoid fever.

After two months, he was admitted to the intensive care unit due to hypovolemic shock caused by sudden vomiting and required non-invasive ventilation. His laboratory results indicated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), leading to corticosteroid treatment (1g/1.73m²) for five days, which resulted in a good response. At the end of the treatment, he relapsed with new features of HLH and was subsequently treated with anti-IL1. Since then, he has demonstrated no signs of inflammation.

- **Second case report**: A 17-year-old female presented with fever, a decline in general health, and hepatomegaly. She had no medical history. Her blood test revealed moderate inflammation with CRP = 55 mg/L, leukopenia of 2210/mm³, and anemia with Hb 9 g/dL. Her viral markers and antibodies were also negative. A PET TDM showed multiple hypermetabolic lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm and heterogeneous splenic hypermetabolism. An axillary lymph node biopsy revealed numerous histiocytes and macrophages with few large immunoblastic-looking cells and early necrosis, confirming the diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). She had normal cardiac and abdominal ultrasounds and a TAP CT. Initially, she was treated with IV antibiotics for one month. Three weeks after the onset of fever, she displayed biological signs of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, leading to corticosteroid treatment (1mg/kg) with a good response and early remission. She has not relapsed since.

Most studies have shown that Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is primarily located in the neck, and the outcome is typically positive, with frequent resolution.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^112R1AoS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for febrile infants, specifically concerning urine tests, ACEP 2016 guidelines recommend considering obtaining urinalysis and urine culture to identify urinary tract infections (UTIs) in well-appearing infants and pediatric patients aged 2 months to 2 years with a fever (≥ 38.0 °C or 100.4 °F). This is particularly important for those at higher risk for UTIs, such as females aged less than 12 months, non-circumcised males, and children with urinary symptoms. Additional risk factors include a history of UTI, a fever lasting more than 24 hours, a higher fever of ≥ 39 °C, a negative test result for respiratory pathogens, and no obvious source of infection.

### Still new chronic Q fever cases diagnosed 8 years following a large Q fever outbreak [^114RDEA9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic Q fever typically develops within two years following primary infection with *Coxiella burnetii*. We determined the interval between acute Q fever and diagnosis of chronic infection, assessed the factors contributing to a longer interval, and evaluated long-term follow-up.

- **Methods**: From 2007 to 2018, patients with chronic Q fever were included from 45 participating hospitals. The interval between acute and chronic infection was calculated in patients with a known day of first symptoms and/or serological confirmation of acute Q fever. Two investigators assessed chronic Q fever-related complications and mortality based on predefined criteria.

- **Results**: In total, 313 (60.3%) proven, 81 (15.6%) probable, and 125 (24.1%) possible chronic Q fever patients were identified. The date of acute Q fever was known in 200 patients. In 45 (22.5%) of these cases, the interval was longer than two years, with the longest observed interval being 9.2 years. Patients with serological follow-up after acute Q fever were diagnosed less often after this two-year interval (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.54). Chronic Q fever-related complications occurred in 216 patients (41.6%). Chronic Q fever-related mortality occurred in 83 (26.5%) of proven and 3 (3.7%) of probable chronic Q fever patients.

- **Conclusions**: Chronic Q fever is still being diagnosed, and mortality continues to occur eight years following a large outbreak. Intervals between acute Q fever and diagnosis of chronic infection can exceed nine years. We urge physicians to perform microbiological testing for chronic Q fever in patients post-infection.

### Synergies between communicable and noncommunicable disease programs to enhance global health security [^1137pBf9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

The presence of clinical links between noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and communicable diseases implies that the optimal path to communicable disease control may require consideration of NCDs. The proliferation of NCD risk factors associated with demographic trends in longevity and urbanization can raise a population's baseline susceptibility to infection-related health security risks. The detrimental effect of uncontrolled NCDs and NCD risk factors on health security concerns can be illustrated by the examples of diabetes and tobacco use.

Diabetes has been shown to increase the severity of endemic diseases such as tuberculosis, melioidosis, dengue, and malaria. Diabetes also interferes with tuberculosis treatment, threatening the progress of global tuberculosis control in countries with high rates of both illnesses, such as China and India.

Tobacco smoking, besides playing a primary role in all leading NCDs, is a notable risk factor for the acquisition and accelerated progression of a variety of infectious diseases, including influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia, sexually transmitted diseases, and hospital-acquired infections. Tobacco use is also among the factors facilitating the convergence of infectious and chronic illnesses in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), compounding the role of other factors, such as urbanization and displacement, in worsening health outcomes. Urbanization in China and India, in particular, has resulted in large groups of rural migrants who are increasingly affected by lifestyle-associated chronic conditions.

### Pemgarda [^114cruda]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pemgarda is an investigational medicine authorized for use in pre-exposure prophylaxis to help prevent COVID-19 in adults and children 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg). It is intended for individuals who are not currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, have not been exposed to someone infected with the virus, and have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to a medical condition or because they receive medicines or treatments that suppress the immune system, making them unlikely to have an adequate response to COVID-19 vaccination.

Pemgarda is considered investigational because it is still under study. There is limited information regarding its safety and effectiveness for the prevention of COVID-19. The FDA has authorized its emergency use for pre-exposure prophylaxis under an EUA. For more information on the EUA, please see the "What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?" section at the end of this fact sheet.

Pemgarda is not authorized for the following:

- **Treatment of COVID-19**: It is not approved to treat COVID-19 infections.
- **Post-exposure prophylaxis**: It is not authorized to prevent COVID-19 after exposure to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2.
- **Use in children under 12 years of age or weighing less than 88 pounds (40 kg)**: Its use is restricted to older children and those meeting the weight requirement.

### Central cord syndrome in a 7-year-old boy secondary to standing high jump [^1173URDF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acute traumatic central cord syndrome is commonly associated with major trauma such as falling and motor vehicle crashes, but minor or nontraumatic causes are very rare in children. Consequently, most physicians frequently overlook children presenting with complaints of arm weakness when there is no history of definite major trauma, especially in the emergency department.

We present the case of a 7-year-old boy experiencing weakness in both arms following a standing high jump with his head tilted back at school. He had no history of definite trauma and no evidence of bone abnormalities on plain radiography and computed tomography of the cervical spine. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed observable swelling with increased signal intensity at the C1 to C4 levels.

This case demonstrates a spinal cord injury caused by a standing high jump with neck extension alone. Therefore, physicians must consider the possibility of spinal cord injury even without any history of major trauma.

### Combined and alternating paracetamol and ibuprofen therapy for febrile children [^112aUmL6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Health professionals frequently recommend fever treatment regimens for children that either combine paracetamol and ibuprofen or alternate them. However, there is uncertainty about whether these regimens are better than the use of single agents and about the adverse effect profile of combination regimens.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects and side effects of combining paracetamol and ibuprofen, or alternating them on consecutive treatments, compared with monotherapy for treating fever in children.

- **Search methods**: In September 2013, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2009–2011).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing alternating or combined paracetamol and ibuprofen regimens with monotherapy in children with fever.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One review author and two assistants independently screened the searches and applied inclusion criteria. Two authors assessed risk of bias and graded the evidence independently. We conducted separate analyses for different comparison groups (combined therapy versus monotherapy, alternating therapy versus monotherapy, combined therapy versus alternating therapy).

- **Main results**: Six studies, enrolling 915 participants, are included. Compared to giving a single antipyretic alone, giving combined paracetamol and ibuprofen to febrile children can result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after treatment (MD -0.27 °Celsius, 95% CI) [End truncated].

### Child melioidosis deaths caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei-contaminated borehole water, Vietnam, 2019 [^111drUUN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

In November 2019, the Preventive Health Center of Soc Son district in Vietnam reported the deaths of three children from one family. The first child, a 7-year-old girl, developed a high fever and abdominal pain on April 6, 2019. She was admitted to a local hospital two days later and subsequently transferred to St. Paul Hospital in Hanoi, where septic shock was diagnosed. Tragically, she died on April 9, shortly after admission and before any diagnostic tests could be performed.

On October 27, 2019, the second child, a 5-year-old boy, experienced a high fever and abdominal pain around the umbilicus. He was admitted to Vietnam National Children's Hospital in Hanoi on October 28, where septic shock was diagnosed. Despite undergoing abdominal and chest radiographs and an abdominal ultrasound, the results were unremarkable. His blood culture grew B. pseudomallei, and he unfortunately passed away on October 31.

The third child, a 13-month-old boy, exhibited a high fever and poor appetite on November 10, 2019. According to his grandparents, he had black stool similar to his siblings. He was admitted to Vietnam National Children's Hospital; while chest radiography results were unremarkable, B. pseudomallei was cultured from his blood sample. He died on November 16.

Laboratory findings from all hospitals where these children were admitted revealed leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels in all blood samples. Liver dysfunction was diagnosed in all three children, with kidney dysfunction identified in the two older children. No identifiable risk factors were detected [see Table 1, which was not included].

### Influenza [^111UzcX2]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Low credibility.

During the autumn-winter months (influenza seasons), influenza circulates more frequently, causing a greater proportion of influenza-like illness and sometimes serious seasonal epidemics. The incidence of symptoms related to influenza, as well as influenza-like illness, depends on the underlying immunity of the population.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of vaccines to prevent influenza? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: A pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^116Mwvu7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old patient with no history of severe infections presented with sudden onset of dyspnea, fever, and acute respiratory insufficiency. Although this clinical condition is usually associated with an acute respiratory infection, a rare primary immunodeficiency was eventually diagnosed. The borderline growth represented the only finding indicative of possible chronicity. Because the respiratory failure did not respond to first-line therapeutic approaches, a detailed pulmonary evaluation was performed, revealing acute diffuse lung parenchymal disease.

While the chest CT pattern can usually narrow the otherwise extensive differential diagnoses, in our case, the lung involvement combined with skin involvement required an extensive workup to exclude a range of diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and vasculitis. The diffuse nodular pattern with hilar lymphadenopathy also warranted an oncologic screening in search of possible malignancy. Finally, the history of mold and mulch exposure and high levels of specific IgG antibodies against molds, together with the corresponding CT pattern, suggested the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP).

However, at the initial stage, several aspects were unclear. First, the association of HP with skin lesions was elusive. Second, an ongoing fungal lung infection had to be thoroughly assessed, particularly as the targeted examinations were inconclusive. Third, although the CMV positivity in BAL did not match the short history of symptoms, CMV infection may, in rare cases, present as a diffuse parenchymal pattern on CT.

### Tafinlar [^116wRyC4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tafinlar administered with trametinib (pediatric): In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients. Withhold Tafinlar when used as monotherapy, and both Tafinlar and trametinib when used in combination, if the patient's temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia.

If appropriate, Tafinlar, or both Tafinlar and trametinib when used in combination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for at least 24 hours, either at the same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Administer antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming Tafinlar if the patient had a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with complications. Administer corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5 days for second or subsequent pyrexia if temperature does not return to baseline within 3 days of onset of pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as dehydration, hypotension, renal failure, or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence of active infection.

### Influenza [^112vZzjA]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

What treatments are available for influenza?

Influenza is usually self-limiting in healthy individuals. Treatment of uncomplicated disease in these individuals is supportive and includes antipyretics, adequate fluid intake, rest, and staying off work or school until 24 hours after the resolution of fever to limit the spread to others.

Most randomized trials of antiviral drugs have been conducted among otherwise healthy individuals and have shown modest reductions in symptom duration (0.7 days). Fewer studies have been conducted among individuals at risk of complicated influenza. Data from observational studies and trials suggest that antiviral treatment may reduce adverse outcomes. For example, a meta-analysis from 2015 reported fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics after oseltamivir treatment compared with placebo (risk difference −3.8%) and fewer hospital admissions (risk difference −1.1%). NICE, Public Health England, UK Chief Medical Officers, and the WHO recommend treatment of suspected and confirmed influenza for individuals at risk of complicated influenza. General practitioners considering the prescription of antivirals should discuss with patients the likely benefits, as well as possible harms, including nausea (number treated to cause nausea in one patient = 28) and vomiting (number treated to cause vomiting in one patient = 22).

Individuals with complicated influenza may benefit from antiviral treatment. Treatment is most effective if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, and it should not be delayed while awaiting the results of investigations.

### The COVID-19 pandemic: diverse contexts; different epidemics-how and why [^113ZtAAc]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

It is very exceptional that a new disease becomes a true pandemic. Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, has spread to nearly all countries of the world in only a few months. However, in different countries, the COVID-19 epidemic takes variable shapes and forms in how it affects communities. Until now, the insights gained on COVID-19 have been largely dominated by the COVID-19 epidemics and the lockdowns in China, Europe, and the United States. But this variety of global trajectories is little described, analyzed, or understood. In only a few months, an enormous amount of scientific evidence on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 has been uncovered. But important knowledge gaps remain. Learning from the variety of ways the COVID-19 epidemic is unfolding across the globe can potentially contribute to solving the COVID-19 puzzle. This paper tries to make sense of this variability by exploring the important role that context plays in these different COVID-19 epidemics, by comparing COVID-19 epidemics with other respiratory diseases, including other coronaviruses that circulate continuously, and by highlighting the critical unknowns and uncertainties that remain. These unknowns and uncertainties require a deeper understanding of the variable trajectories of COVID-19. Unraveling them will be important for discerning potential future scenarios, such as the first wave in virgin territories still untouched by COVID-19 and for future waves elsewhere.

### Etiological spectrum of persistent fever in the tropics and predictors of ubiquitous infections: A prospective four-country study with pooled analysis [^114wPLcr]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In total, 704 (36.6%) participants were immediately admitted to the hospital, particularly in Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). At inclusion, antibiotics were prescribed to more than 70% of patients with persistent fever, except in the DRC where about half received antimalarials. Data on the final assessment at 12 weeks post-inclusion were incomplete for 475 (24.7%) participants. In almost all these cases, data on the 4-week follow-up visit were also missing. Sixty-three patients died, corresponding to 3.3% of the whole cohort or 4.4% (63/1447) of those participants for whom outcome data were complete. This proportion was particularly high in Cambodia, with 42 out of 305 patients (13.8%) experiencing fatalities. Another 187 patients (9.7%) did not report any significant improvement or suffered some sequelae at the final assessment.

### Bartonella quintana transmission from mite to family with high socioeconomic status [^114X38Bd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Urban trench fever caused by Bartonella quintana has been reported in persons who abuse alcohol and in homeless individuals in large cities worldwide. Symptoms vary from asymptomatic intermittent bacteremia to serious complications. Pediculus humanus lice, the known vector of the infection, are not always identified, which raises the possibility that other vectors might also be involved. We report on an outbreak of B. quintana infection among a young family of high socioeconomic status and their visiting relatives.

The family resides in a regional city (population 104,000) in northern Czech Republic in an old, renovated apartment located on the top floor, just under the roof. In the summer of 2007, hundreds of ectoparasitic mites migrated from a hole in the roof and settled on the inner side of a permanently open window before infesting family members. Two weeks later (day 1 of symptom onset), a papular rash and pruritic vesicular lesions were noted by the parents on the body and legs of their two children, a 1-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy. On day 3, the girl's body temperature rose to 38.0°C, and the boy's temperature rose to 39.5°C. The rash resolved in approximately 10 days in both children, while vesicular lesions on the girl's buccal mucosal membrane resolved in 5 days. Excoriated areas resulting from spontaneous rupture of lesions or scratching were still visible on day 14.

On day 4, a fever (temperature 38.5°C) and intense tibialgia, which persisted for 5 days, developed in the 33-year-old father of the infected children. On day 5, a vesicular rash, which resolved in [content incomplete].

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111vEpTV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, particularly in the context of primary prevention, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend not testing for GAS pharyngitis in pediatric patients under 3 years old. This is due to the rarity of acute rheumatic fever in this age group, along with the uncommon incidence and classic presentation of streptococcal pharyngitis. Testing may be considered for selected patients in this age group when risk factors are present, such as having an older sibling with a group A streptococcal infection.

### The role of asymptomatic infections in influenza transmission: What do we really know [^111EKoXd]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of asymptomatic influenza virus infections in influenza transmission was uncertain. However, the importance of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 for onward transmission of COVID-19 has led experts to question whether the role of asymptomatic influenza virus infections in transmission had been underappreciated. We discuss the existing evidence on the frequency of asymptomatic influenza virus infections, the extent to which they contribute to infection transmission, and remaining knowledge gaps. We propose priority areas for further evaluation, study designs, and case definitions to address these existing knowledge gaps.

### TB or not TB: that is no longer the question [^117WamrK]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a devastating infectious disease and, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant forms, represents a major global threat. Much of our understanding of pathogenic and immunologic mechanisms in TB has derived from studies in experimental animals. However, it is becoming increasingly clear in TB, as well as in other inflammatory diseases, that there are substantial differences in immunological responses of humans not found or predicted by animal studies. Thus, it is critically important to understand mechanisms of pathogenesis and immunological protection in humans.

In this review, we address the key immunological question: What are the necessary and sufficient immune responses required for protection against TB infection and disease in people? Specifically, we explore protection against infection, protection against the establishment of latency or persistence, and protection against transitioning from latent infection to active disease.

### Pemgarda [^115P5edA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

You may need to receive additional doses of PEMGARDA for ongoing protection from COVID-19. Viruses can change over time (mutate) and develop into a slightly different form of the virus, called a variant. Based on what we know about SARS-CoV-2 variants, you may need to receive additional doses of PEMGARDA every 3 months.

- **Who should generally not take PEMGARDA**: Do not take PEMGARDA if you have had a severe allergic reaction to PEMGARDA or any ingredient in PEMGARDA. See the end of this fact sheet for a complete list of ingredients in PEMGARDA.

- **What are the important possible side effects of PEMGARDA**: Allergic and infusion-related reactions are common and can sometimes be severe or life-threatening. Allergic and infusion-related reactions can happen during and after your infusion of PEMGARDA. You may have an increased risk of allergic reaction with PEMGARDA if you have had a severe allergic reaction to a COVID‑19 vaccine. PEMGARDA contains polysorbate 80, an ingredient in some COVID‑19 vaccines. Also, polysorbate 80 is similar to polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is an ingredient in other COVID‑19 vaccines. Your healthcare provider may consult with a healthcare provider who specializes in allergy and immunology before giving you PEMGARDA if you have had a serious allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for allergic reactions during the infusion and for at least 2 hours after you receive PEMGARDA.

### Acute gastroenteritis due to in an adolescent boy [^111XAjZZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis with persistent vomiting, high fever, and blood-streaked stools often suggests a bacterial etiology in children. The authors report a 13-year-old boy presenting with acute watery diarrhea, persistent vomiting, a fever of 103°F, abdominal cramps, and blood-streaked stools, who failed to respond to parenteral third-generation cephalosporin for 72 hours. Stool examination revealed numerous cystic and amoeboid forms of Blastocystis hominis. Metronidazole was started, and the boy promptly responded within 24 hours. There was no recurrence of symptoms thereafter. This case highlights the crucial role of stool examination in acute diarrheal disease for identifying rare etiologies.

### Proceedings of the 29th European paediatric rheumatology congress [^116ppWeG]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Results: 207 patients were diagnosed with PFAPA. Of these, 56 (27%) patients experienced a resolution of periodic fever, 115 (56%) remained active with ongoing symptoms, and 36 (17%) patients were lost to follow-up and could not be contacted. In the resolved fever group, the median time from first contact with the center to the last follow-up was 6.5 years (Q1-Q3: 4.7–8.8) and from the last febrile episode to the last update was 3.3 years (Q1-Q3: 2.0–4.4). The median duration of symptoms was 5.0 years (Q1-Q3: 2.8–8.1), and the median age at the last febrile episode was 8.3 years (Q1-Q3: 5.2–9.9). No correlation was identified between the age of onset and the duration of symptoms (Spearman r = -0.41, p = 0.002).

Tonsillectomy was performed on 8 patients, where 4 experienced complete resolution of episodes, 3 experienced temporary remission, and 1 experienced a short period of spaced episodes before resuming. Only 2 patients in this group received colchicine treatment, which did not show efficacy. Among the 115 patients with persistent fever, 10 initially considered recovered relapsed following a median remission period of 32 months (Q1-Q3: 25–39).

We present data from a large cohort of PFAPA patients followed in a reference center for autoinflammatory diseases. In the resolved fever group, most last febrile episodes occurred before adolescence. The duration of symptoms is variable and does not correlate with the age of onset. The identification of relapses after at least 12 months without a febrile episode raises questions about the definition of recovery. Further investigation is warranted.

### SARS-CoV-2: A comprehensive review from pathogenicity of the virus to clinical consequences [^115X6K6f]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

Nowadays, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, is a worldwide challenge. The virus is highly contagious, and clinical consequences are very diverse. It is estimated that if no effective action is taken, COVID-19 could affect 90% of the world's population and result in over 40 million deaths. Therefore, it is essential to understand the virus's pathogenicity and follow preventive methods to control the high morbidity and mortality rates.

Our knowledge of COVID-19 is still limited, despite the hard efforts of scientists and clinicians over the last few months. In this review article, we have collected the latest data about the characteristics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic methods of SARS-CoV-2.

A 12-year-old boy presented to the outpatient clinic of Tabarak Allah Rural Hospital in Gedaref State in October 2013, with complaints of fever, chills, headache, dry cough, and vomiting for one week, and with anorexia for the last two days. The patient had no history of visceral leishmaniasis, but he came from Barbar El Fugara village in the Atbara River area (lat. 13°34′47.7″N, long. 36°18′30.6″E), the most endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis in Sudan.

He was enrolled in a clinical study called "Neglected Infectious Diseases Diagnosis" (NIDIAG) and underwent standard history taking, physical examination, and a set of diagnostic tests targeting severe and treatable infectious causes of persistent fever such as visceral leishmaniasis, malaria, tuberculosis, enteric fever, brucellosis, amebic liver abscess, relapsing fever, rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The NIDIAG project did not interfere with the choice of treatment for the included patients but ensured that essential medicines for the target conditions were present at the study site.

### Estimating the burden of total knee replacement in the United States [^112QLAY3]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

In the last decade, the number of total knee replacements performed annually in the United States has doubled, with disproportionate increases among younger adults. While total knee replacement is a highly effective treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis, recipients can experience persistent pain and severe complications. We are aware of no estimates of the prevalence of total knee replacement among adults in the U.S.

- **Methods**: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a validated computer simulation model of knee osteoarthritis, and data on annual total knee replacement utilization to estimate the prevalence of primary and revision total knee replacement among adults fifty years of age or older in the U.S. We combined these prevalence estimates with U.S. Census data to estimate the number of adults in the U.S. currently living with total knee replacement. The annual incidence of total knee replacement was derived from two longitudinal knee osteoarthritis cohorts and ranged from 1.6% to 11.9% in males and from 2.0% to 10.9% in females.

- **Results**: We estimated that 4.0 million (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.6 million to 4.4 million) adults in the U.S. currently live with a total knee replacement, representing 4.2% (95% CI: 3.7% to 4.6%) of the population fifty years of age or older. The prevalence was higher among females (4.8%) than among males (3.4%) and increased with age. The lifetime risk of primary total knee replacement from the age of twenty-five years was 7.0% (95% CI: 6.1% to 7.8%) for males and 9.5% (95% CI: 8.5% to 9.5%) for females.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, specifically with respect to primary prevention, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend that diagnostic studies for GAS pharyngitis are not indicated for children under 3 years old. This is because acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is rare in children under 3, and both the incidence and classic presentation of streptococcal pharyngitis are uncommon in this age group. However, selected children under 3 who have other risk factors, such as an older sibling with a GAS infection, may be considered for testing.
