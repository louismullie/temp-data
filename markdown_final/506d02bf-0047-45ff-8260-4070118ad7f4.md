## Question

What are the risks of using vasopressors in beta-blocker poisoning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the specific risks of using vasopressors are in beta-blocker poisoning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of beta-blocker overdose and the hemodynamic phenotype. Then, I should verify the evidence on vasopressors in this specific toxidrome, including any direct experimental data. Next, I will analyze mechanistic reasons vasopressors might worsen outcomes, followed by a check of general vasopressor risks. After that, I should review consensus recommendations and how they differ between beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker poisoning. Then, I will synthesize the concrete risks attributed to vasopressor use in beta-blocker poisoning. Finally, I will outline evidence-supported alternatives, define limited scenarios where vasopressors may be considered as adjuncts or bridges, and end with practical bedside considerations and escalation pathways.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology: beta-blocker toxicity blunts β-adrenergic signaling, producing bradycardia, impaired AV conduction, markedly reduced contractility, and cardiogenic shock with low cardiac output as the dominant lesion rather than primary vasoplegia, which also means endogenous catecholamine responsiveness is diminished, so "more catecholamine" may not translate into "more output" in this context [^115wbehn] [^116yJD7N].

> I need to check what traditional sources say about vasopressors here; labeling and ACLS-style teaching often suggest dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or even epinephrine to counteract bradycardia and hypotension in beta-blocker toxicity, but these recommendations largely extrapolate from general pharmacology or non-poisoning settings and are not grounded in outcome-oriented poisoning trials, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret them as evidence-based solutions for this toxidrome [^116yJD7N] [^1162ywmY] [^114C9jgA].

> Now, let me examine direct evidence; the porcine propranolol model compared vasopressin plus epinephrine, high-dose insulin, and placebo after inducing cardiogenic shock, and reported 0% survival with vasopressors versus 50% with placebo and 100% with high-dose insulin, along with progressive declines in heart rate and cardiac output in the vasopressor arm and a parabolic change in MAP and SVR, which initially fooled me into thinking of "high-quality direct evidence" of harm, but wait, I should correct myself: it is high-quality within an animal, prospective, controlled framework yet has limited external validity to humans, even though its internal validity strongly signals potential harm from vasopressor-driven afterload in pure beta-blocker cardiodepression [^1154UrrR].

> I will now analyze why vasopressors might be harmful mechanistically; with β-receptors blocked, α-agonism becomes unopposed, so norepinephrine or epinephrine can generate intense vasoconstriction without restoring contractility, raising afterload and further depressing stroke volume, while catecholamines also carry proarrhythmic potential and can worsen myocardial oxygen supply–demand balance, and in propranolol-treated patients, epinephrine may precipitate severe hypertensive reactions via unopposed α-effects, all of which align with the observed fall in cardiac output in the animal model and the known warnings on epinephrine labeling [^1155zZWy] [^117GnjR4].

> Next, I should review general vasopressor risks outside toxicology because they inform risk amplification in this setting; in a surgical ICU cohort, catecholamine vasopressors were associated with a 48% rate of adverse cardiac events, including frequent tachyarrhythmias and higher mortality, and drug labeling underscores dose-related hypertensive crises, arrhythmias, ischemia, and end-organ complications with dopamine, dobutamine, and epinephrine, which a failing, β-blocked myocardium is ill-equipped to tolerate [^116DiyB7] [^117JrGym] [^116VbEZQ] [^117GnjR4].

> Hold on, I should verify how guidelines frame this; toxin-focused reviews prioritize glucagon, calcium, and especially high-dose insulin early for beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker poisoning, whereas some emergency medicine reviews suggest starting vasopressors simultaneously with high-dose insulin, a position influenced by practice patterns and CCB literature more than beta-blocker–specific outcome data, while broader cardiogenic shock guidance does allow norepinephrine to secure perfusion pressure but is not tailored to drug-induced β-blockade, so applying it wholesale risks pathophysiologic mismatch [^114SsnCv] [^115XEjy2] [^114KwXEg].

> Let me synthesize the specific risks of vasopressors in beta-blocker poisoning so I don't overstate or understate them; the animal model signals increased mortality with vasopressors compared to placebo, paradoxical hemodynamic deterioration with falling cardiac output and heart rate despite transient MAP increases, and mechanistic plausibility for ischemia and arrhythmias, while human critical care data and labeling document catecholamine-related cardiac complications that likely compound in this toxidrome, making vasopressors potential drivers of worsening cardiogenic shock rather than relief when used as primary therapy [^1154UrrR] [^116DiyB7] [^117GnjR4].

> Evidence — wait, I already started Step 8; let me reframe this as safer, evidence-supported alternatives first and then circle back to role definition; early glucagon can transiently improve heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output even during β-blockade, though effects may be modest and short-lived, high-dose insulin euglycemia improves myocardial metabolism and contractility and outperformed vasopressors in the porcine propranolol model, calcium salts may aid if mixed CCB–BB exposure or membrane stabilization is contributory, intravenous lipid emulsion has case-level support for lipophilic beta-blockers, and in refractory cardiogenic shock, early consultation for venoarterial ECMO as a bridge to recovery is a key salvage strategy [^113KMaTJ] [^112WWfxH] [^1154UrrR] [^111vrN1T] [^114z1sEj].

> But wait, what if there is a vasoplegic component or mixed toxidrome; this is where I should be precise about when vasopressors might be considered as adjuncts rather than primary therapy, for example, in profound vasodilation despite improving inotropy under high-dose insulin, brief norepinephrine to secure perfusion pressure may be reasonable as a bridge to definitive therapies or mechanical circulatory support, and while my initial note said "Norepinephrine may be preferred over ep… ", hold on, I should verify and complete that thought: norepinephrine is generally preferred over epinephrine to limit tachyarrhythmias and lactate generation in cardiogenic shock frameworks, and if inotropy is needed under β-blockade, non–β-receptor dependent strategies such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors can be considered in select cases given their preserved effect during β-blockade, with any catecholamine use kept to the lowest effective dose under invasive monitoring and reassessed frequently [^114KwXEg] [^112gjPAe].

> I should also consider non-catecholamine adjuncts in special situations to avoid catecholamine stacking; in profoundly vasoplegic, catecholamine-refractory overdoses, small case series suggest angiotensin II can raise MAP and reduce catecholamine requirements, and in extreme vasoplegia, methylene blue has been used as salvage, but both should be reserved for toxicology-guided, refractory cases after core therapies are underway and with awareness of their limited evidence base in poisoning [^112E7V7X] [^116bBdy8] [^111Zdv39].

> Let me not forget bedside safety and human factors; vasoactives should be delivered on pumps with clear labeling and preferably central access when ongoing infusion is needed, because push-dose or improvised infusions have resulted in catastrophic norepinephrine overdoses and cardiac arrest during transport and handoff, so I need to ensure closed-loop communication and strict medication safety practices in these high-risk resuscitations [^1121UvhF] [^115cqCpC].

> To conclude, I should double-check that my practical approach aligns with the evidence: prioritize airway and circulation, treat bradycardia with atropine and pacing if needed, initiate glucagon and early high-dose insulin with dextrose and electrolyte monitoring, consider calcium and lipid emulsion for appropriate agents, add vasopressors only as tightly titrated adjuncts in documented vasoplegia or as a bridge to ECMO when cardiogenic shock persists despite optimal inotropic-metabolic therapy, and involve a medical toxicologist or regional poison center early to guide escalation and rescue options [^114SsnCv] [^114z1sEj].

Vasopressors in beta-blocker poisoning carry significant risks due to **unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation** [^1155zZWy] and **reduced beta-agonist efficacy** [^112gjPAe]. These risks include severe hypertension, reflex bradycardia, and ischemia from unopposed alpha effects [^117GnjR4]; limited hemodynamic benefit from beta-agonists [^1154UrrR]; and increased arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and end-organ hypoperfusion with high-dose catecholamines [^116DiyB7]. Norepinephrine is preferred for vasoplegic shock, but **high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy** is often more effective [^115XEjy2] and should be started early [^114SsnCv]; vasopressors should be titrated cautiously with close monitoring for adverse effects [^116DiyB7].

---

## Pharmacological rationale and risks

### Unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation

Beta-blockade blunts beta-agonist effects, leaving alpha-mediated vasoconstriction unopposed, which can cause severe hypertension, reflex bradycardia, and ischemia [^117GnjR4]. Animal models show vasopressin plus epinephrine **worsens outcomes** versus placebo in propranolol toxicity, likely from unopposed alpha effects [^1154UrrR].

---

### Reduced efficacy of beta-agonist vasopressors

Beta-blockade limits the inotropic and chronotropic effects of beta-agonists (e.g. epinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine), reducing hemodynamic benefit [^112gjPAe]; thus these agents may be **ineffective or harmful** in beta-blocker poisoning, with little improvement in cardiac output or blood pressure [^1154UrrR].

---

### Increased risk of arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia

High-dose catecholamines increase myocardial oxygen demand and **arrhythmogenicity**, particularly in the setting of beta-blocker toxicity [^116VbEZQ]. Catecholamine vasopressors are associated with higher rates of tachyarrhythmias, myocardial injury, and ischemia in critically ill patients [^116DiyB7].

---

### End-organ hypoperfusion and ischemia

Excessive vasoconstriction can **reduce perfusion** to the kidneys, gut, and extremities, causing ischemic injury. High-dose vasopressors can precipitate end-organ ischemia, particularly with prolonged infusions or high doses [^117ATa9Z].

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

Given these risks, **alternative and adjunctive therapies are recommended**:

- **High-dose insulin euglycemia therapy (HIE)**: Improves cardiac output and perfusion; often superior to vasopressors in beta-blocker poisoning [^115XEjy2] [^116WNPQy].

- **Glucagon**: Increases intracellular cAMP independently of beta-receptors, improving contractility and heart rate [^113KMaTJ].

- **Calcium**: Useful in mixed beta-blocker/calcium channel blocker toxicity [^114C9jgA].

- **Mechanical support**: VA-ECMO or intra-aortic balloon pump for refractory shock [^114z1sEj].

---

## Clinical recommendations and monitoring

- **Vasopressor selection**: Prefer norepinephrine for vasoplegic shock; avoid high-dose beta-agonists due to limited efficacy and higher risk [^112gjPAe].

- **Monitoring**: Continuous ECG, blood pressure, and end-organ perfusion monitoring are essential to detect complications early [^116DiyB7].

- **Dose titration**: Start low and titrate cautiously to minimize adverse effects [^117JrGym].

---

Vasopressors in beta-blocker poisoning can cause severe hypertension, arrhythmias, and ischemia due to unopposed alpha stimulation [^1155zZWy] and reduced beta-agonist efficacy [^112gjPAe]. Norepinephrine is preferred for vasoplegic shock, but high-dose insulin therapy is often more effective; **use vasopressors cautiously** with close monitoring [^115XEjy2] [^116DiyB7].

### Adverse cardiac events during catecholamine vasopressor therapy: a prospective observational study [^116DiyB7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

To determine the incidence of and risk factors for adverse cardiac events during catecholamine vasopressor therapy in surgical intensive care unit patients with cardiovascular failure, the study prospectively recorded the occurrence of seven predefined adverse cardiac events. These events included prolonged elevated heart rate, tachyarrhythmia, myocardial cell damage, acute cardiac arrest or death, pulmonary hypertension-induced right heart dysfunction, and reduction of systemic blood flow during catecholamine vasopressor therapy lasting at least 12 hours.

In the results, 54 of 112 study patients developed a total of 114 adverse cardiac events, reflecting an incidence of 48.2% (95% CI, 38.8–57.6%). New-onset tachyarrhythmia (49.1%), prolonged elevated heart rate (23.7%), and myocardial cell damage (17.5%) occurred most frequently. Aside from chronic liver diseases, factors independently associated with the occurrence of adverse cardiac events included the need for renal replacement therapy, disease severity assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, the number of catecholamine vasopressors (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.08–2.77; p = 0.02), and the duration of catecholamine vasopressor therapy (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1–1.01; p = 0.002). Patients developing adverse cardiac events were on catecholamine vasopressors (p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) for longer duration, had longer intensive care unit stays (p < 0.001), and experienced greater mortality (25.9% vs. 1.7%; p < 0.001) than those who did not.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^116WNPQy]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Observational studies, case series, and animal studies document an improvement in contractility, blood pressure, and a potential increase in survival with the use of high-dose insulin in patients poisoned by calcium channel blockers (CCB). Considering that high-dose insulin seems to have a direct positive inotropic effect, the workgroup recommended its use in the face of documented myocardial dysfunction. However, they still suggested it even if myocardial dysfunction is not documented because case series have shown hemodynamic improvement even with dihydropyridine poisoning.

Despite the fact that high-dose insulin requires intensive monitoring, its benefits were thought to outweigh the risks, such as hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, or volume overload. The proposed dose regimen of high-dose insulin (regular insulin) includes a bolus of 1 U/kg followed by an infusion of 1 U/kg/hr, while maintaining euglycemia with a dextrose infusion as needed and close monitoring of serum potassium. Since titration of high-dose insulin to response up to 10 U/kg/hr is supported only by case series, the workgroup suggests using this dosage only for patients who do not respond to first-line therapies.

The selection of vasopressors should be guided by the type of shock. Based on the mechanism of action, the workgroup recommended the use of norepinephrine to increase blood pressure in vasoplegic shock or if myocardial function has not yet been assessed. The use of epinephrine is also recommended for a CCB-poisoned patient in shock to increase contractility and heart rate. In the presence of confirmed myocardial dysfunction, clinicians can…

### Cardiotoxic medication poisoning [^115XEjy2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers result in a disproportionate number of fatalities from cardiac medication overdoses and share similar characteristics. High-dose insulin is a superior therapy for both overdoses, but it is likely synergistic with vasopressors; therefore, we recommend starting vasopressors and high-dose insulin simultaneously. Digoxin remains an important cardiac poison and can likely be safely treated with smaller doses of fab fragments than in the past, except for patients in extremis. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an invasive but promising nonspecific therapy for refractory shock from cardiotoxic overdose and should be considered primarily in cases of refractory cardiogenic shock.

### Use of a porcine model to evaluate the risks and benefits of vasopressors in propranolol poisoning [^1154UrrR]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). Low credibility.

Vasopressors are a commonly used treatment in beta-blocker poisoning despite evidence they may be ineffective or harmful. The primary objective of the present study is to use previously collected data from two prior studies (high-dose insulin (HDI) versus vasopressin + epinephrine and a placebo-controlled HDI study) to compare survival between vasopressin + epinephrine and placebo. Secondary outcomes included a comparison with HDI as well as comparisons with hemodynamic parameters, including mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

- **Methods**: Cardiogenic shock was induced in healthy pigs with a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of intravenous propranolol followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/minute until the point of toxicity, defined as (0.75 × initial HR × initial MAP), at which point the infusion was reduced to 0.125 mg/kg/minute for 240 (vasopressin + epinephrine or HDI) or 360 minutes (placebo) or until death.

- **Results**: Survival was significantly lower in pigs receiving vasopressin + epinephrine (0%, 0/5) than in pigs receiving placebo (50%, 2/4) (p < 0.01). Survival was significantly higher with HDI compared with both groups (100%, 5/5) (p < 0.01). All vasopressin + epinephrine pigs died within 100 minutes after reaching toxicity. Over the course of the resuscitation, we observed a statistically significant steady decrease in CO and HR in the vasopressin + epinephrine group compared with placebo (p < 0.01). In contrast, we observed a statistically significant change in MAP and SVR that followed a parabolic arc.

### Dopamine hydrochloride [^117JrGym]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Manifestations of overdosage include excessive blood pressure elevation.

In the case of accidental overdosage, reduce the rate of dopamine HCl injection administration or temporarily discontinue the dopamine HCl until the adverse reactions related to overdosage resolve. Since dopamine's duration of action is quite short, no additional remedial measures are usually necessary. If these measures fail to resolve the adverse reactions related to overdosage, consider using an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent (e.g. phentolamine).

### High-dose glucagon has hemodynamic effects regardless of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade: A randomized clinical trial [^113KMaTJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Intravenous high-dose glucagon is a recommended antidote against beta-blocker poisonings, but its clinical effects are unclear. We therefore investigated the hemodynamic effects and safety of high-dose glucagon with and without concomitant beta-blockade.

- **Methods and Results**: In a randomized crossover study, 10 healthy men received combinations of esmolol (1.25 mg/kg bolus + 0.75 mg/kg/min infusion), glucagon (50 µg/kg), and identical volumes of saline placebo on 5 separate days in random order (saline + saline; esmolol + saline; esmolol + glucagon bolus; saline + glucagon infusion; saline + glucagon bolus). On individual days, esmolol/saline was infused from -15 to 30 minutes. Glucagon/saline was administered from 0 minutes as a 2-minute intravenous bolus or as a 30-minute infusion (same total glucagon dose). End points were hemodynamic and adverse effects of glucagon compared with saline. Compared with saline, glucagon bolus increased mean heart rate by 13.0 beats per minute (95% CI, 8.0–18.0; P < 0.001), systolic blood pressure by 15.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 8.0–23.2; P = 0.002), diastolic blood pressure by 9.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 6.3–12.6; P < 0.001), and cardiac output by 18.0% (95% CI, 9.7–26.9; P = 0.003) at the 5-minute time point on days without beta-blockade. Similar effects of glucagon bolus occurred on days with beta-blockade and between 15 and 30 minutes during infusion. Hemodynamic effects of glucagon thus reflected pharmacologic glucagon plasma concentrations. Glucagon-induced nausea occurred in 80% of participants despite ondansetron pretreatment.

- **Conclusions**: High-dose glucagon b

### Brevibloc [^116yJD7N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Overdoses of Brevibloc (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects, which may trigger severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications, such as severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma, and could be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity. Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma. Additionally, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur.

- **Treatment recommendations**: Due to its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in managing toxicity should be to discontinue the Brevibloc infusion. Based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures:

	- **Bradycardia**: Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug, or cardiac pacing.
	- **Cardiac failure**: For cardiac failure, consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In cases of shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider the intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been considered.

### Perioperative beta-blockers for major noncardiac surgery: Primum non nocere [^114K6akA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Recent studies have called into question the benefit of perioperative beta blockade, especially in patients at low to moderate risk of cardiac events. Once considered standard of care, the role of beta-blocker therapy now lies mired in conflicting data that are difficult to apply to the at-risk patient. We provide an overview of the evolution of perioperative beta blockade, beginning with the physiology of the adrenergic system, with emphasis on the biologic rationale for the perioperative implementation of beta-blockers.

Although initial studies were small in size and statistically limited, early data showed cardiac benefit with the use of perioperative beta-blockers. However, larger, more recent studies now suggest a lack of benefit and potential harm from this practice. This paradigm holds true especially in those at low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profiles. Potential explanations for these paradoxical results are discussed, stressing the key differences between earlier and more recent studies that may explain these divergent outcomes.

We conclude by commenting on performance measures as they relate to perioperative beta-blockers and make recommendations for the continued safe implementation of this practice.

### Beta blockers for peripheral arterial disease [^117PKDgD]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

To quantify the potential harm of beta blockers in patients with peripheral arterial disease, all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta blockers with placebo for the outcomes of claudication, maximal walking distance and time, calf blood flow, vascular resistance, and skin temperature were searched using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PubMed, and CINAHL. Trials comparing different types of beta blockers were excluded.

Six RCTs fulfilling the above criteria, with a total of 119 patients, were included. The beta blockers studied were atenolol, propranolol, pindolol, and metoprolol. None of the trials showed a statistically significant worsening effect of beta blockers on the outcomes measured. There were no reports of any adverse events with the beta blockers studied.

Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that beta blockers adversely affect walking distance in people with intermittent claudication. Beta blockers should be used with caution if clinically indicated, especially in patients with critical ischemia where acute lowering of blood pressure is contraindicated.

### Towards evidence based emergency medicine: Best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Glucagon for the treatment of symptomatic beta blocker overdose [^115ZcPRq]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether intravenous glucagon can support blood pressure in beta blocker overdose. A total of 51 papers were identified using the reported search, of which six presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date, and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. A clinical bottom line is stated.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^112TfYrS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

Propranolol should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. It is not indicated for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies.

- **Reduction of intraocular pressure**: Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade can cause a reduction of intraocular pressure. Patients should be informed that propranolol may interfere with glaucoma screening tests. Withdrawal may lead to a return of increased intraocular pressure.

- **Anaphylactic reactions**: Patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to various allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges while taking beta blockers, whether accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.

- **Clinical laboratory tests**: In patients with hypertension, the use of propranolol has been associated with elevated levels of serum potassium, serum transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase. In cases of severe heart failure, the use of propranolol has been linked to increases in blood urea nitrogen.

- **Drug interactions**: Caution should be exercised when propranolol is administered with drugs that affect the CYP2D6, 1A2, or 2C19 metabolic pathways. Coadministration of such drugs with propranolol may lead to clinically relevant drug interactions, altering its efficacy and/or toxicity (see Drug Interactions in Pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism).

- **Cardiovascular drugs**:
	- **Antiarrhythmics**: Propafenone has negative inotropic and beta-blocking properties that can be additive to those of propranolol. Quinidine increases the concentration of propranolol and produces greater effects.

### Impact of short-acting beta-blockers on the outcomes of patients with septic shock: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117MNG5B]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of short-acting beta-blocker therapy on outcomes in adult patients with septic shock.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and unpublished sources from inception to April 19, 2024.

- **Study selection**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated short-acting beta-blockers compared with usual care in patients with septic shock.

- **Data extraction**: We collected data regarding study and patient characteristics, beta-blocker administration, and clinical, hemodynamic, and biomarker outcomes.

- **Data synthesis**: Twelve RCTs proved eligible (n = 1170 patients). Short-acting beta-blockers may reduce 28-day mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.93; low certainty) and probably reduce new-onset tachyarrhythmias (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18–0.78; moderate certainty) but may increase the duration of vasopressors (mean difference [MD], 1.04 d; 95% CI, 0.37–1.72; low certainty). Furthermore, there is an uncertain effect as to whether short-acting beta-blockers impact 90-day mortality (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.73–1.31), ICU length of stay (MD, -0.75 d; 95% CI, -3.43 to 1.93 d), hospital length of stay (MD, 1.03 d; 95% CI, -1.92 to 3.98 d), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD, -0.10 d; 95% CI, -1.25 to 1.05 d) (all very low certainty), bradycardia episodes (RR, 3.14; 95% CI, 0.91–14.01), and hypotension episodes (RR, 4.74; 95% CI, 1.62–14.01) (all very low certainty).

- **Conclusions**: In patients with septic shock, short-acting beta-blockers may improve survival and reduce new-onset tachyarrhythmias. However, these findings were bass

### A regional quality improvement effort to increase beta blocker administration before vascular surgery [^1155DPrA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

To determine if a regional quality improvement effort can increase beta-blocker utilization prior to vascular surgery and decrease the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI), a study was conducted.

A quality improvement effort to increase perioperative beta blocker utilization was implemented in 2003 at centers participating in the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE). A 90% target was set, and feedback was provided at biannual meetings. Beta blocker utilization (less than one month preoperative versus chronic) and POMI rates were prospectively collected for patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (n = 926) and lower extremity bypass (LEB; n = 2,123) from 2003 through 2008. Predictors of POMI were determined using multivariate logistic regression. Rates of beta blocker administration and POMI were analyzed over time and across strata of patient risk, based on a multivariate model.

- **Results**: Perioperative beta blocker treatment increased from 68% of patients in the first 3 months of 2005 to 88% by the last 3 months of 2008 (P < .001). In 2003, 44% of patients not on chronic beta blockers were treated with preoperative beta blockers; by 2008, 78% of patients not on chronic beta blockers were started perioperatively on these medications (P < .001). Beta blocker utilization increased across all centers and surgeons participating during the study period and in patients of low, medium, and high cardiac risk. However, the rate of POMI did not change over time (5.2% in 2003, 5.5% in 2008; p = 0.876), although there was a trend towards a lower POMI rate.

### Toxin-induced cardiovascular failure [^114SsnCv]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Adverse cardiovascular events comprise a large portion of the morbidity and mortality in drug overdose emergencies. Emergency physicians treating poisoned patients often encounter adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial injury, hemodynamic compromise with shock, tachydysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Early signs of toxin-induced cardiovascular failure include bradycardia, tachycardia, and specific ECG findings.

Treatment of toxicologic tachycardia relies on rapid supportive care along with the proper use of benzodiazepines for sedation. Managing toxicologic bradycardia involves the use of isotonic fluids, atropine, calcium salts, and glucagon. High-dose insulin euglycemia should be used early in the course of suspected severe poisoning, and intravenous lipid emulsion should be given to patients who suffer cardiac arrest.

The following constitutes key background information on beta-blocker toxicity:

- **Definition**: Beta-blocker toxicity refers to an overdose or excessive exposure to β-blocker medications.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of β-blocker toxicity involves the excessive blockade of β-adrenergic receptors, leading to a decrease in heart rate (HR) and myocardial workload.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of β-blocker toxicity is estimated at 5.1% among hospitalized patients with acute poisoning.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with β-blocker toxicity often present with bradycardia, hypotension, and varying degrees of AV block. In severe cases, patients may experience life-threatening cardiogenic shock refractory to pharmacological interventions.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of β-blocker toxicity can range from mild to severe, depending on the amount of β-blocker ingested and the time elapsed before treatment.

### Characterization of pediatric beta-adrenergic antagonist ingestions reported to the National Poison Data System from 2000 to 2020 [^113xq2XY]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

When ingested by children, small quantities of beta-adrenergic antagonists (BAA) are described as dangerous and potentially lethal, commonly referred to as "one pill can kill". We characterize the demographics, clinical characteristics, and the rate of serious outcomes among pediatric patients with reported BAA ingestions.

- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective review of U.S. patients 10 years old who sustained cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting.

- **Conclusions**: Reported BAA ingestions in this multiyear national pediatric cohort caused infrequent toxicity, and no fatalities resulted from an unintentional ingestion. The frequency of bradycardia, hypotension, and hypoglycemia was noted.

### Cardiac arrest due to accidental overdose with norepinephrine dissolved in crystalloid [^117ATa9Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Vasoactive agents should be administered through a controlled, well-marked infusor pump, ideally via a central venous catheter if given over longer periods of time. During the transport of hemodynamically unstable patients with limited staffing and resources on site, a peripheral vasopressor infusion is sometimes resorted to as a temporary measure of optimizing hemodynamics. The most commonly used vasopressor in such circumstances is diluted epinephrine, where 1 mg of epinephrine (1:1000) is mixed into a given amount of crystalloid, producing a diluted solution that can be easily titrated. Other vasoactive substances can be constituted in a similar fashion or as push-dose vasopressors, but such use is highly controversial.

We report a case of accidental norepinephrine overdose after such practice, resulting in cardiac arrest. It illustrates the importance of careful use and labeling of vasoactive agents during the transport and handover of critically ill patients. Finally, it demonstrates the human factor issues associated with transfer from the pre-hospital to the in-hospital environment when such preparations are used.

### SPL drug information for epinephrine [^112mMXie]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of epinephrine IV (also known as Auvi-Q, EpiPen, Neffy):

- **Arrhythmias, myocardial infarction**: Use caution in patients with heart disease, including cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or hypertension, as well as in elderly patients and pregnant women.

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Use extreme caution in patients with coronary artery disease or hypertension.

- **Cerebrovascular accident**: Maintain a high level of suspicion to prevent overdosage or inadvertent IV injection of epinephrine, as this may cause cerebrovascular hemorrhage resulting from a sharp rise in blood pressure.

- **Exacerbation of Parkinson's disease**: Use caution in patients with Parkinson's disease.

- **Exacerbation of thyroid disease**: Use caution in patients with hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis.

- **Hyperglycemia**: Use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus.

- **Hypertensive crisis**: Use caution in patients with pheochromocytoma.

### Cardiovascular and adverse effects of glucagon for the management of suspected beta blocker toxicity: A case series [^1117oyi9]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Low credibility.

Although glucagon use in beta blocker toxicity has been recommended for many years, evidence for its safety and efficacy in humans is limited. This study aims to determine the magnitude of effect of glucagon on heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with suspected beta blocker toxicity and describe potential adverse effects of the medication.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective, multi-center case series of patients greater than 12 years of age who received glucagon for suspected beta blocker toxicity. The primary outcome was the mean difference in HR from immediately pre- to 20 minutes post-glucagon administration. Secondary outcomes included the median difference in SBP, and occurrence of nausea, vomiting, and hyperglycemia.

- **Results**: A total of 107 patients met inclusion criteria accounting for 144 glucagon orders. The mean difference in HR from pre- to post-glucagon administration was 4 bpm ± 10.6 (95% CI [2.25–5.76], p < 0.001). The median difference (IQR) in SBP was 4.5 (-6 to 16) mmHg (p = 0.004). Similar increases were observed when patients receiving concomitant vasopressors were excluded. A total of nine glucagon administrations (6.3%) were associated with nausea and 14 (9.7%) with vomiting; however, 52 doses (36.1%) were administered concomitantly with antiemetic medications. Fifteen administrations (10.4%) were associated with hyperglycemia.

- **Conclusion**: Glucagon administration was associated with a statistically significant increase in HR, but a small absolute difference of uncertain clinical significance.

### Kapspargo [^1111JJBC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pheochromocytoma**: If metoprolol succinate is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

- **Major surgery**: Avoid initiation of a high-dose regimen of extended-release metoprolol in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since such use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke, and death. Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

- **Hypoglycemia**: Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e. surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

- **Thyrotoxicosis**: Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade may precipitate a thyroid storm.

- **Peripheral vascular disease**: Beta-blockers can…

### Beta-blocker ingestion: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^111MveqP]. Clinical Toxicology (2005). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for beta-blocker toxicity, specifically in the context of admission to the emergency department, the AACT/AAPCC/ACMT 2005 guidelines recommend offering ambulance transportation for patients referred to emergency departments due to the potential for life-threatening complications of β-blocker overdose. Provide usual supportive care en route to the hospital, including IV fluids for hypotension.

### Vasopressor use, critical care management, and outcomes in dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker toxicity [^112kY4ZB]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). Low credibility.

Although dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP CCBs) are considered to have less direct myocardial toxicity than non-dihydropyridines, DHPs remain a common cause of morbidity and mortality. We sought to examine various indices of critical illness and describe the clinical course of a population of DHP CCB-poisoned patients with special attention to vasopressor dosing and ischemic complications.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective chart review of DHP CCB exposures admitted to a single center. The study site was a tertiary referral center with an in-house medical toxicology consultation/admitting service. Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 14 years and DHP ingestion noted on the departmental patient log. Patients were excluded if DHP exposure was not documented in the medical record. The study period ranged from July 1, 2010, through December 31, 2022. Data on clinical presentation, management, and outcomes were reported.

- **Results**: Sixty-eight cases of DHP exposure were analyzed; 87% were intentional ingestions. Amlodipine represented 88% of cases, and 85% included cases involved co-ingestions. Vasopressors were administered in 42 cases (62%), with a median of three agents (IQR 1–4). Norepinephrine was most common (N = 41; 98%), followed by epinephrine (N = 23; 55%); median maximal rates were 45.0 (IQR 13.5–70.0) and 25.0 (IQR 12.0–30.0) mcg/min, respectively. Fifteen percent (N = 10) received high dose insulin-euglycemic therapy (HIE); all had > 2 vasopressors administered before administration of HIE. Twelve (18%) patients had ischemic complications; five (7%) experienced ischem.

### Effect of chronic β-blockade on the utility of an epinephrine-containing test dose to detect intravascular injection in nonsedated patients [^115Q2dqL]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

A test dose containing epinephrine is routinely used during epidural blockade to detect accidental intravenous needle or catheter placement before the administration of local anesthetics to avert local anesthetic systemic toxicity. β-blocker therapy may interfere with the expected hemodynamic response from an intravascular injection. This study describes a cohort of 24 patients and their response to an epinephrine test dose, examining whether expected increased heart rates during test-dose administration are valid in this population.

- **Methods**: Twenty-four nonsedated, chronically β-blocked patients were enrolled in a prospective, order-randomized, crossover, double-blind study, with each individual receiving injections of both placebo and a 15-μg epinephrine test dose. After injection into a peripheral vein, blood pressure and pulse rate were observed for 5 minutes, followed by injection of the remaining solution (placebo or epinephrine), with hemodynamic parameters observed in the same manner.

- **Results**: Epinephrine raised the heart rate by 17.8 beats per minute (bpm) (95% confidence interval, 15.5–20.1) compared to placebo 2.0 bpm (95% CI, -0.3–4.3) with P < 0.001 in our chronically β-blocked population. It also increased the systolic blood pressure by 23 mm Hg (95% CI, 17.2–28.9) versus placebo 4.4 mm Hg (95% CI, -1.5–10.3) with P < 0.001. A threshold increase of 20 bpm yielded a sensitivity of 37.5% (95% CI, 18.8%-59.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 85.8%-100%). Revising the threshold to include a change of 10 bpm or an increase in systolic blood pressure of 15 mm Hg or greater yielded 100% specificity (95% CI, 85.8%-100%).

### SPL drug information for nadolol [^112hBSAh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of nadolol PO (also known as Corgard):

- **Exacerbation of angina**: Use caution in vasospastic angina, as β-blockers without alpha1-blocking activity can cause unopposed coronary vasoconstriction, worsening symptoms.

- **Exacerbation of bronchospasm**: Use extreme caution in patients with bronchospastic diseases, as nadolol may impair bronchodilation by blocking beta2 receptors; its use is generally discouraged.

- **Exacerbation of HF**: Use caution in patients with compensated HF. Monitor closely for signs of decompensation, and discontinue gradually if HF develops.

- **Exacerbation of muscle weakness, double vision**: Use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Exacerbation of psoriasis**: Use caution in patients with psoriasis.

- **Exacerbation of Raynaud's phenomenon, peripheral vascular disease**: Use caution in patients with peripheral circulatory disorders, including Raynaud's disease or syndrome and peripheral occlusive vascular disease.

- **Hypertension**: Use extreme caution in patients with untreated pheochromocytoma. Ensure adequate α-blockade is achieved before initiating nadolol to prevent a paradoxical increase in BP.

- **Major surgery**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as β-blockers should not be routinely withdrawn before major surgery, but their effect on adrenergic response may increase anesthesia and surgical risks.

- **Mask symptoms of hyperthyroidism**: Use caution in patients with hyperthyroidism. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of β-blocker therapy to prevent symptom exacerbation or the precipitation of a thyroid storm.

### Pindolol [^1162ywmY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Because beta-blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to reflex stimuli and may increase the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures, resulting in protracted hypotension or low cardiac output, it has generally been suggested that such therapy should be gradually withdrawn several days prior to surgery. Recognition of the increased sensitivity to catecholamines of patients recently withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy, however, has made this recommendation controversial. If possible, beta-blockers should be withdrawn well before surgery takes place. In the event of emergency surgery, the anesthesiologist should be informed that the patient is on beta-blocker therapy.

The effects of pindolol can be reversed by administration of beta-receptor agonists such as isoproterenol, dopamine, dobutamine, or norepinephrine. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported with beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents.

- **Diabetes and hypoglycemia**: Beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent the appearance of premonitory signs and symptoms (e.g. tachycardia and blood pressure changes) of acute hypoglycemia. This is especially important with labile diabetics. Beta-blockade also reduces the release of insulin in response to hyperglycemia; therefore, it may be necessary to adjust the dose of antidiabetic drugs.

- **Thyrotoxicosis**: Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g. tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockers.

### One size does not fit all: The role of vasodilating beta-blockers in controlling hypertension as a means of reducing cardiovascular and stroke risk [^116VCqbs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers have played a key role in the management of hypertension-related cardiovascular disease for decades and continue to be recommended as a mainstay of therapy in national guidelines statements. Recent data have shown less optimal reductions in total mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and CVD events with beta-blockers compared with renin-angiotensin system-blocking agents or calcium channel blockers. The beta-blocker class, however, spans a wide range of agents, and the growing concern about the risk-benefit profile of beta-blockers should not be generalized to later-generation vasodilating beta-blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol.

A growing database from hypertension studies confirms the clinical efficacy and safety of vasodilating beta-blockers, and outcome studies indicate that these agents can play an important role in global CVD reduction in patients with hypertensive or ischemic heart failure.

### Neffy [^117GnjR4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Overdosage of epinephrine has been reported to produce extremely elevated arterial pressure, which may result in cerebrovascular hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients. Overdosage may also lead to pulmonary edema due to peripheral vascular constriction combined with cardiac stimulation. Epinephrine overdosage can cause transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, which may be accompanied by fatal cardiac arrhythmias. These include premature ventricular contractions, multifocal ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, and occasionally atrioventricular block; symptoms may also include extreme pallor, coldness of the skin, metabolic acidosis, and kidney failure.

Epinephrine is rapidly inactivated in the body, and treatment following overdosage is primarily supportive. Treatment of epinephrine-associated pulmonary edema consists of a rapidly acting alpha-adrenergic blocking drug, such as phentolamine mesylate, along with respiratory support. For epinephrine-associated arrhythmias, a beta-adrenergic blocking drug, such as propranolol, may be administered. If necessary, pressor effects may be counteracted by rapidly acting vasodilators or α-adrenergic blocking drugs. If prolonged hypotension follows such measures, administration of another pressor drug may be required.

Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.

### The role of angiotensin II in poisoning-induced shock-a review [^112E7V7X]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Low credibility.

Shock in drug poisoning is a life-threatening condition, and management involves fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. Management is limited by the toxicity of high-dose vasopressors such as catecholamines. Clinical trials have shown the efficacy of angiotensin II as an adjunct vasopressor in septic shock. The aim of this review is to assess the use of angiotensin II in patients with shock secondary to drug overdose.

- **Methods**: Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1947), and PubMed (from 1946) databases were searched until July 2021 via OVID. Included studies were those with shock due to drug poisoning and that received angiotensin II as part of their treatment regimen. Of the 481 articles identified, 13 studies (case reports and scientific abstracts) were included in the final analysis with a total of 14 patients. Extracted data included demographics, overdose drug and dosage, angiotensin II dosage, time of angiotensin II administration, hemodynamic changes, length of hospital stay, mortality, complications, cardiac function, and other treatment agents used.

- **Results**: Thirteen studies were included, consisting of 6 case reports, 6 scientific abstracts, and 1 case series. Overdose drugs included antihypertensives (n = 8), psychotropics (n = 4), isopropanol (n = 1), and tamsulosin (n = 1). Out of a total of 14 patients, 3 patients died. Ten patients had their hemodynamic changes reported. In terms of MAP or SBP changes, three patients (30%) had an immediate response to angiotensin II, four patients (40%) had responses within 30 minutes, and one patient (10%) within two.

### The changing role of beta-blocker therapy in patients with cirrhosis [^115dVt8w]. Journal of Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is a leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. Beta-blockers have been established in numerous studies as part of the cornerstone of the medical management of cirrhosis, particularly in the primary and secondary prevention of variceal hemorrhage. However, new evidence has cautioned the use of beta-blockers in patients with end-stage cirrhosis and refractory ascites. In this article, we review the beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy, the potential harms of aggressive beta-blocker therapy, and provide suggestions regarding the appropriate use of this class of medications in patients with cirrhosis.

### Rapiblyk [^113p1ePS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Use in patients with pheochromocytoma**: If RAPIBLYK injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, administer RAPIBLYK in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers without opposing alpha blockade in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta receptor-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle.

- **Use in patients with peripheral circulatory disorders**: RAPIBLYK injection may exacerbate peripheral circulatory disorders, such as Raynaud's disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease.

- **Abrupt discontinuation of RAPIBLYK injection**: Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing RAPIBLYK injection.

- **Hyperkalemia**: Beta-blockers, including RAPIBLYK injection, can cause increases in serum potassium and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta-blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with RAPIBLYK injection.

- **Use in patients with metabolic acidosis**: Beta-blockers have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardi…

### Betaxolol [^11592nUm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

No specific information on emergency treatment of overdosage with betaxolol is available. The most common effects expected are bradycardia, congestive heart failure, hypotension, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia. In one case of acute overdosage, a 16-year-old female recovered fully after ingesting 460 mg.

Oral LD50 values are 350 to 400 mg of betaxolol per kg in mice and 860 to 980 mg per kg in rats. In the event of overdosage, treatment with betaxolol should be discontinued, and the patient should be carefully observed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis does not remove significant amounts of the drug. In addition to gastric lavage, the following therapeutic measures are suggested if warranted:

- **Hypotension**: Use sympathomimetic pressor drug therapy, such as dopamine, dobutamine, or norepinephrine. In refractory cases of overdosage of other beta-blockers, the use of glucagon hydrochloride has been reported to be useful.

- **Bradycardia**: Administer atropine. If there is no response to vagal blockade, cautiously administer isoproterenol (see Warnings: Major Surgery). In refractory cases, the use of a transvenous cardiac pacemaker may be considered.

- **Acute cardiac failure**: Conventional therapy, including digitalis, diuretics, and oxygen, should be instituted immediately.

- **Bronchospasm**: Use a β2-agonist. Additional therapy with aminophylline may be considered.

- **Heart block (2nd- or 3rd-degree)**: Use isoproterenol or a transvenous cardiac pacemaker.

### Practice patterns and outcomes associated with choice of initial vasopressor therapy for septic shock [^115kDfxk]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor of choice for septic shock, with dopamine suggested as an alternative in selected patients who have a low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative bradycardia. We sought to determine practice patterns and outcomes associated with vasopressor selection in a large, population-based cohort of patients with septic shock, allowing for the assessment of outcomes in clinically important subgroups.

We performed a retrospective cohort study to determine factors associated with the choice of dopamine as compared to norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor for patients with septic shock. Propensity score matching was used to compare the risk of hospital mortality based on the initial vasopressor. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed using alternative methods to address confounding and hospital-level clustering. We investigated the interaction between vasopressor selection and mortality in clinical subgroups based on arrhythmia and cardiovascular risk.

Enhanced administrative data was utilized from Premier, Charlotte, NC, covering 502 U.S. hospitals during the years 2010–2013. The subjects included 61,122 patients admitted with septic shock who received either dopamine or norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor during the first two days of hospitalization.

Norepinephrine (77.6%) was the most frequently used initial vasopressor during septic shock. Dopamine was preferentially selected by cardiologists in the Southern United States, at non-teaching hospitals, and for older patients.

### Dobutamine [^116VbEZQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Overdosage of dobutamine has been rarely reported. The following information serves as a guide if such an overdose is encountered.

- **Signs and symptoms**: Toxicity from dobutamine is usually due to excessive cardiac β-receptor stimulation. Since the duration of action of dobutamine is generally short (T1/2 = 2 minutes) due to rapid metabolism by catechol-O-methyltransferase, symptoms of toxicity may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, tremor, anxiety, palpitations, headache, shortness of breath, anginal pain, nonspecific chest pain, hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and ventricular fibrillation. Hypotension may result from vasodilation.

- **Treatment**: To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, your certified Regional Poison Control Center is a good resource. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers can be found in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). When managing an overdose, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in the patient. The initial actions in a dobutamine overdose include discontinuing administration, establishing an airway, and ensuring oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be promptly initiated. Severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias may be successfully treated with propranolol or lidocaine. Hypertension usually responds to a reduction in dose or discontinuation of therapy.

Protect the patient's airway and provide supportive care as necessary.

### Inderalla [^1176kpNu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Caution should be exercised when patients receiving a beta-blocker are administered a calcium-channel-blocking drug with negative inotropic and/or chronotropic effects. Both agents may depress myocardial contractility or atrioventricular conduction. There have been reports of significant bradycardia, heart failure, and cardiovascular collapse with the concurrent use of verapamil and beta-blockers. Co-administration of propranolol and diltiazem in patients with cardiac disease has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, high-degree heart block, and heart failure.

When combined with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors can cause hypotension, particularly in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. The antihypertensive effects of clonidine may be antagonized by beta-blockers. Inderal LA should be administered cautiously to patients withdrawing from clonidine.

- **Alpha blockers**: Prazosin has been associated with prolongation of first-dose hypotension in the presence of beta-blockers. Postural hypotension has been reported in patients taking both beta-blockers and terazosin or doxazosin.

- **Reserpine**: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine, should be closely observed for excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous activity, which may result in hypotension, marked bradycardia, vertigo, syncopal attacks, or orthostatic hypotension.

### Outcomes of unintentional beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker overdoses: A retrospective review of poison center data [^1115TJpd]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Outcomes following unintentional, supratherapeutic ingestions of a patient's own beta-blocker (BB) or calcium channel blocker (CCB) have not been well studied. A retrospective review of all poison control center (PCC) charts from January 2007 through December 2009 yielded 4,099 cases involving a BB or CCB. Of these, 436 (10.6%) met the inclusion criteria. Data abstracted included patient age/gender, medication(s) involved, dose(s), time interval between ingestions, symptoms, and outcomes. Exclusion criteria included intentional ingestions, ingesting someone else's medication, and ingestion intervals greater than 12 hours.

Outcomes were defined as the development of symptoms, management site, hospital admission, and death. The mean age was 65.1 years (range 2–91; SD 17.9), with 284 (65.1%) being women. Eighty-two (18.8%) cases resulted in ED evaluation; 44 (53.7%) of these were referred in by the PCC. Symptoms developed in 44 (10.1%) cases, and 32 (7.3%) were admitted due to the ingestion. Of those admitted, five (15.6%) received treatment (three received intravenous fluids, one glucagon, and one calcium). Of the 343 (78.7%) cases initially observed on site, three (0.9%) were later referred to an ED; none required treatment. There was one death under extenuating circumstances.

The validity of data abstraction was determined for six variables using 43 charts [0.97; 95% CI (0.91–0.99)]. Based on a retrospective analysis of PCC cases, home observation of asymptomatic patients following unintentional supratherapeutic ingestions of their own BB or CCB was safe in most cases. Further, prospective study is required to identify…

Verapamil or diltiazem overdose can cause severe morbidity and death, and there exist limited human data describing management and outcome of a large number of such patients. This article describes the management and outcome of patients with nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker overdose, with an emphasis on vasopressor dosing, at a single center.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective chart review of patients older than 14 years and admitted to the inpatient toxicology service of a single tertiary care medical center for treatment of verapamil or diltiazem overdose from 1987 through 2012, and who had the presence of either drug confirmed by urine drug screening. Patients were identified by a review of patient encounter logs. Data abstracted from medical records included demographics, laboratory results, drugs used to support blood pressure, complications, and outcomes. A second group included patients with a reported calcium channel blocker ingestion but for whom results of the urine drug testing were no longer available. In an effort to assess selection bias, this group was included to determine whether patients who were excluded from the primary group only because of unavailability of urine drug screen results had different outcomes.

- **Results**: During the study period, 48 patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 45 years, with a range of 15 to 76 years, and 52% were male patients. Verapamil accounted for 24 of 48 (50%) ingestions. Vasopressors were administered to 33 of 48 (69%) patients. Maximal vasopressor infusion doses were epinephrine.

### Dopamine versus norepinephrine in the treatment of septic shock: A meta-analysis [^112Gjt9Y]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

There has long been controversy about the possible superiority of norepinephrine compared to dopamine in the treatment of shock. The objective was to evaluate the effects of norepinephrine and dopamine on outcome and adverse events in patients with septic shock.

- **Data sources**: A systematic search of the MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases, and of Google Scholar, was conducted up to June 30, 2011.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: All studies providing information on the outcome of patients with septic shock treated with dopamine compared to norepinephrine were included. Observational and randomized trials were analyzed separately. Because the time of outcome assessment varied among trials, we evaluated 28-day mortality or closest estimate. Heterogeneity among trials was assessed using the Cochrane Q homogeneity test. A Forest plot was constructed, and the aggregate relative risk of death was computed. Potential publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots.

- **Methods and main results**: We retrieved five observational (1,360 patients) and six randomized (1,408 patients) trials, totaling 2,768 patients (1,474 who received norepinephrine and 1,294 who received dopamine). In observational studies, where there was significant heterogeneity (p < .001), no difference in mortality was found (relative risk, 1.09; confidence interval, 0.84–1.41; p = .72). A sensitivity analysis identified one trial as being responsible for the heterogeneity; after the exclusion of that trial, no heterogeneity was observed, and dopamine administration was associated with an increased risk.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^1155zZWy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

There have been reports of significant bradycardia, heart failure, and cardiovascular collapse with the concurrent use of verapamil and beta-blockers. Coadministration of propranolol and diltiazem in patients with cardiac disease has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, high-degree heart block, and heart failure.

- **Ace inhibitors**: When combined with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors can cause hypotension, particularly in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

The antihypertensive effects of clonidine may be antagonized by beta-blockers. Propranolol should be administered cautiously to patients withdrawing from clonidine.

- **Alpha blockers**: Prazosin has been associated with prolongation of first dose hypotension in the presence of beta-blockers. Postural hypotension has been reported in patients taking both beta-blockers and terazosin or doxazosin.

- **Reserpine**: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine, should be closely observed for excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous activity, which may result in hypotension, marked bradycardia, vertigo, syncopal attacks, or orthostatic hypotension.

- **Inotropic agents**: Patients on long-term therapy with propranolol may experience uncontrolled hypertension if administered epinephrine as a consequence of unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation. Epinephrine is therefore not indicated in the treatment of propranolol overdose (see OVERDOSAGE).

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^113H9m2z]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

This umbrella review across cardiovascular indications used meta-analytic data to clarify the evidence basis for beta-blockers in contemporary clinical practice. In patients with coronary disease, there is a trade-off between benefit and risk. Beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI) at the expense of higher rates of incident heart failure (HF), with no effect on mortality. In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in sinus rhythm, beta-blockers reduced morbidity and mortality. However, they had no effect in HFrEF with concomitant atrial fibrillation or those with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

In perioperative patients, beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI in those undergoing non-cardiac surgery, but this was at the expense of increased mortality and stroke. Beta-blockers had no effect on any of the outcomes assessed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In hypertension, beta-blockers had no significant effect compared to placebo or diuretics, and they were inferior to renin-angiotensin system (RAS) antagonists and calcium channel blockers (CCB). These findings highlight the importance of an individualized assessment of indication, comorbidity, and understanding of the goal of therapy before the routine commencement of beta-blockers.

- **Certainty of evidence**: Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE guidelines. See Supplemental Table 4 for full details. LVEF stands for left ventricular ejection fraction.

### Treatment of serious calcium channel blocker overdose with levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer [^114LUqSe]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blocker (CCB) overdose is often lethal. Conventional medical treatment includes intravenous calcium, high doses of catecholamines, insulin, and glucagon. A new inotropic drug, levosimendan, should be considered in severe CCB poisoning. Levosimendan's pharmacologic features differ from other inotropic drugs. It is a calcium sensitizer and improves contraction without increasing intracytosolic calcium concentration. We describe two patients with serious CCB overdose. Despite intensive medical and mechanical cardiovascular support, both patients remained in shock. Hemodynamics gradually improved after administration of levosimendan.

### Death temporally related to the use of a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist in cocaine associated myocardial infarction [^112dGA8F]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Although it is commonly stated that the use of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists is contraindicated in patients with cocaine toxicity, actual clinical evidence of harm is lacking. This case helps to highlight the risks of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists in patients with chest pain associated with cocaine use.

- **Case report**: A 54-year-old man was brought to the emergency department (ED) complaining of chest pain after using approximately 1 gram of intranasal cocaine. Aspirin and nitroglycerin spray relieved his pain. Although he remained pain-free, tachycardia persisted despite 15 mg of diazepam intravenously. Nearly two hours after presentation, a total of 5 mg of metoprolol was given for persistent tachycardia (115/minute) and an elevated troponin. Shortly thereafter, the patient complained of crushing substernal chest pain, developed pulseless electrical activity, and could not be resuscitated.

- **Discussion**: The administration of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbates cocaine-induced lethality in animals. In humans given smaller doses of cocaine, beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbate coronary vasoconstriction. Both effects are presumed to occur through unopposed alpha adrenergic receptor agonism. Despite these data, actual cases describing adverse effects in cocaine users given beta adrenergic receptor antagonists are uncommon. This case supports the potential lethality of a cocaine-beta adrenergic receptor antagonist interaction.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^111giqfP]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

- **Therapy for patients in refractory shock or periarrest**: For patients poisoned by calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and experiencing refractory shock or periarrest despite increasing doses of inotropes and vasopressors, the workgroup recommends the following rescue treatments:
	- Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy (up to 10 U/kg/hr) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present and if it has not been administered previously.
	- Lipid-emulsion therapy if it has not been administered previously.

	- **Additionally, the workgroup suggests the following rescue treatments**:
	- Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy (up to 10 U/kg/hr) even in the absence of myocardial dysfunction if not administered previously.
	- VA-ECMO in the presence of cardiogenic shock in centers where this treatment is available.
	- Pacemaker in cases of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block, without significant alteration in cardiac inotropy, if not tried previously.

- **Rationale**: Due to the high risk of mortality in patients with severe refractory shock or periarrest, the workgroup considered therapies with less supporting evidence and potentially greater risks. Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy are suggested even if myocardial dysfunction has not been documented, and the use of lipid-emulsion therapy is recommended in such situations. Given the mortality risk in severely poisoned patients and the potential survival benefit demonstrated in an observational study conducted in experienced centers, the workgroup members suggested venoarterial extracorp.

### Successful treatment of antihypertensive overdose using intravenous angiotensin II [^116bBdy8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Despite multiple treatment options, antihypertensive overdose remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Intravenous angiotensin II (AG II) is approved for use in vasodilatory shock, and in this study, we describe two cases of refractory shock from antihypertensive overdose that were successfully treated using AG II.

- **Case reports**: A 24-year-old female presented after an overdose of multiple antihypertensive medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). She developed hypotension that was refractory to norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 57 mm Hg nine hours after emergency department arrival. Fifteen minutes after starting AG II at 10 ng/kg/min, her heart rate and MAP rose by seven beats/min and 12 mm Hg, respectively. Her hemodynamic parameters continued to improve thereafter. She developed acute kidney injury, which resolved prior to discharge.

	- The second patient, a 65-year-old male, presented after an overdose of multiple antihypertensive medications, including an ACEI. Despite norepinephrine, epinephrine, and hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia therapy, he remained bradycardic and hypotensive, with a heart rate of 47 beats/min and a MAP of 59 mm Hg. Thirty minutes after starting AG II at 10 ng/kg/min, his heart rate was 61 beats/min and MAP was 66 mm Hg. He recovered without apparent sequelae.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this**: Antihypertensive overdose can lead to shock refractory to catecholamine and vasopressin therapy. Our experience suggests that AG II is efficacious in antihypertensive overdose.

### High-dose glucagon has hemodynamic effects regardless of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade: A randomized clinical trial [^112WWfxH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Glucagon has been used as an antidote for systemic beta‐blocker toxicity for nearly 50 years. It has rarely been the only therapy for beta‐blocker poisoning, with reports of no response to glucagon therapy also existing, and there is no evidence supporting that glucagon has beneficial effects on survival after beta‐blocker poisoning. However, several published papers describe favorable outcomes in beta‐blocker–poisoned patients after normalization of hemodynamics by glucagon injection[s]. The observed hemodynamic effects of glucagon, even when including the counteracting effects of a beta‐blocker, might therefore have clinical relevance.

Limitations to this study include that participants were healthy, young male volunteers who were administered intravenous beta‐blocker infusions. This limits translation of our results to incidents of life‐threatening overdoses. For technical reasons, we did not measure plasma epinephrine, which — compared with norepinephrine — is more associated with the response of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenocortical axis than of the sympathetic nervous system. The strengths of this study are the randomized, placebo‐controlled crossover design and the invasive hemodynamic data recording. To our knowledge, there are no previous controlled studies documenting the hemodynamic effects and safety of the glucagon dose recommended for beta‐blocker poisonings. Our study therefore provides novel information about the effects of high‐dose glucagon alone and with a simultaneous beta‐blocker infusion. To increase generalizability, esmolol was administered.

### Beta-blockers in noncardiac surgery: Did observational studies put us back on safe ground [^114GrXMb]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Based on landmark trials, international guidelines had for years promoted the use of beta-blockers in the setting of non-cardiac surgery. In 2011, concerns were raised regarding the integrity of some of the landmark trials, as the Dutch Erasmus Medical Center found some of them to be scientifically incorrect. Based on the remaining studies that were to be trusted, investigations showed that, in contrast to prior beliefs, the widespread use of perioperative beta-blockers might be harmful.

A call for further investigations into the matter ushered in several observational studies evaluating the safety of perioperative beta-blocker therapy in specific patient subgroups. Within this review, we discuss important aspects for making these decisions and compare the major observational studies and specific estimates of risk in subgroups of interest. We conclude that patients at high risk with heavy co-morbidities, such as heart failure, may benefit from beta-blocker therapy, whereas low-risk patients, such as those with uncomplicated hypertension, may be at increased risk with beta-blocker therapy.

We provide a critical review of perioperative guidelines in view of the new observational data, suggesting that the recommended schematics, such as the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for risk stratification of patients in this setting, may be suboptimal. Further, we provide discussions of other aspects, including the risk of sepsis, type of beta-blocker, and the potential of perioperative beta-blocker withdrawal, which may be important in guiding future studies.

### A review of emergency cardiopulmonary bypass for severe poisoning by cardiotoxic drugs [^114z1sEj]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular collapse remains a leading cause of death in severe acute drug intoxication. Commonly prescribed medications, such as antidysrhythmics, calcium channel antagonists, and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, can cause refractory cardiovascular collapse in massive overdoses. Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (ECPB), a modality originating in cardiac surgery, is a rescue technique successfully implemented in the treatment of refractory cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest unresponsive to traditional medical interventions. More recently, a growing number of animal studies, case reports, and case series have documented its use in refractory hemodynamic collapse in poisoned patients. This article reviews ECPB techniques and explores its growing role in treating severely hemodynamically compromised poisoned patients.

### Protamine sulfate [^114pJwT1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and pulmonary hypertension. Risk factors include high dose or overdose, rapid administration (see warnings and dosage and administration), repeated doses, previous administration of protamine, or previous use of protamine-containing drugs (such as NPH insulin, protamine zinc insulin, and certain beta-blockers). Allergy to fish, previous vasectomy, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and abnormal preoperative pulmonary hemodynamics may also be risk factors. In patients with any of these risk factors, the risk-to-benefit ratio of administering protamine sulfate should be carefully considered. Vasopressors and resuscitation equipment should be immediately available in case of a severe reaction to protamine. Protamine sulfate should not be given when bleeding occurs without prior heparin use.

### Inotropes and beta-blockers: Is there a need for new guidelines [^112gjPAe]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are the standard treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. When patients receiving beta-blockers decompensate, they often need treatment with a positive inotropic agent. The beta-agonist dobutamine may not produce much increase in cardiac output during full-dose beta-blocker treatment and may increase systemic vascular resistance via alpha-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) such as milrinone or enoximone retain full hemodynamic effects during complete beta-blockade because the site of action of PDEIs is beyond the beta-adrenergic receptor. Additionally, beta-blockade reverses some of the desensitization phenomena that account for the attenuation of PDEI response in heart failure related to upregulation in G(alphai). Inotrope-requiring subjects with decompensated heart failure who are undergoing long-term therapy with beta-blocking agents should be treated with a type III-specific PDEI, not a beta-agonist such as dobutamine.

### Is the intra-aortic balloon pump a method of brain protection during cardiogenic shock after drug intoxication [^114ZbW2D]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular medications are ubiquitous and frequently implicated in accidental or intentional overdose. It is common that the combined use of these drugs may lead to hypotension and even shock, followed by metabolic derangements. We report a case in which an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was used in the management of self-poisoning with verapamil, amlodipine, metoprolol, and ibuprofen. In presenting this case of combined massive drug ingestion, we outline early strategies in the Emergency Department and some alternative treatment options.

Beyond pharmacological and conservative procedures, we implemented an invasive approach that included temporary pacing, mechanical ventilation, and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP). Such intense treatment was necessary due to the critical state of the patient. In our opinion, the use of the IABP contributed to the final recovery of our adolescent patient. Combined mechanical and pharmacological treatment may protect from multi-organ insufficiency, including permanent central nervous system injury. It is hoped that reporting our experience will raise awareness of alternative treatment options for ingestions of cardiovascular medications.

### Cardiovascular challenges in toxicology [^1113J2Uz]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnoses and subsequent treatment of poisoned patients manifesting cardiovascular compromise challenge the most experienced emergency physician. Numerous drugs and chemicals cause cardiac and vascular disorders. Despite widely varying indications for therapeutic use, many agents share a common cardiovascular pharmacologic effect if taken in overdose. Standard advanced cardiac life support protocol care of these patients may not apply and may even result in harm if followed.

This discussion focuses on common cardiovascular toxins and groups them according to their mechanisms of toxicity. Multiple agents result in human cardiovascular toxicity, and the management of each should follow a rational approach. The first step in the care of all poisoned patients is good supportive care.

### The role of the new beta-blockers in treating cardiovascular disease [^114m7tzv]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). High credibility.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers play an important role in the management of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and chronic heart failure. However, concerns regarding safety and tolerability with currently available agents can limit their use.

Beta-blockers vary with regard to several pharmacologic properties, including beta1/beta2 selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and, with the newest beta-blockers, vasodilation. These pharmacologic differences may result in clinically important differences in tolerability and hemodynamic properties.

Nebivolol is a novel beta-blocker with both a greater degree of selectivity for beta1-adrenergic receptors than other agents in this class and an ability to stimulate endothelial nitric oxide production, leading to vasodilation and other potential clinical effects. Published randomized, controlled, multicenter studies with nebivolol have shown that once-daily treatment significantly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, compared with placebo, in a dose-dependent manner. It is well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.

When compared with other beta-blockers, as well as with other antihypertensive classes of agents in head-to-head trials, nebivolol demonstrated similar antihypertensive efficacy and a lower incidence of adverse events. Furthermore, nebivolol has also been shown to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in a large population of elderly patients with chronic heart failure, independent of left ventricular ejection fraction.

### High-dose insulin and intravenous lipid emulsion therapy for cardiogenic shock induced by intentional calcium-channel blocker and beta-blocker overdose: a case series [^111vrN1T]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Recently, high-dose insulin (HDI) and intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) have emerged as treatment options for severe toxicity from calcium-channel blockers (CCB) and beta-blockers (BB).

- **Objective**: Our aim was to describe the use and effectiveness of HDI and ILE for the treatment of CCB and BB overdose.

- **Case reports**: We describe two patients presenting to the emergency department after intentional ingestions of CCBs and BBs. A 35-year-old man presented in pulseless electrical activity after ingesting amlodipine, verapamil, and metoprolol. A 59-year-old man presented with cardiogenic shock (CS) after ingesting amlodipine, simvastatin, lisinopril, and metformin. Both patients were initially treated with glucagon, calcium, and vasopressors. Shortly after arrival, HDI (1 unit/kg × 1; 1 unit/kg/h infusion) and ILE 20% (1.5 mL/kg × 1; 0.25 mL/kg/min × 60 min) were initiated, leading to hemodynamic improvement and resolution of shock. At the time of hospital discharge, both patients had achieved full neurologic recovery.

- **Conclusions**: HDI effectively reverses CS induced by CCBs and BBs due to its inotropic effects, uptake of glucose into cardiac muscle, and peripheral vasodilatation. ILE is theorized to sequester agents dependent on lipid solubility from the plasma, preventing further toxicity. To our knowledge, these are the first two successful cases reported using the combination of HDI and ILE for reversing CS induced by intentional ingestions of CCBs and BBs.

### Methylene blue reverses recalcitrant shock in β-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose [^111Zdv39]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

β-blocker and calcium channel blocker toxicity generally present with bradycardia and hypotension. A 69-year-old woman presented following a suicide attempt involving a β-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose. Her blood pressure was 69/35 mm Hg, and her heart rate was in the 40s. Despite treatment with calcium chloride, glucagon, a dextrose-insulin infusion, and three vasopressors, she remained hypotensive. She suffered two cardiac arrests and required a transvenous pacemaker. When all interventions failed, she was started on a methylene blue infusion for refractory vasodilatory shock, resulting in a dramatic improvement in her blood pressure. The patient was successfully weaned off all vasopressors and from mechanical ventilation without any end-organ damage.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^113ZQapt]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for calcium channel blocker toxicity, especially with respect to vasopressors, the 2017 guidelines from AAPCC, ACMT, CAEP, CAPCC, CCCS, CPS, EAPCCT, ESEM, ESICM, and SCCM recommend considering the administration of vasopressin as a single vasoactive agent in patients with calcium channel blocker poisoning who have documented cardiogenic shock.

### Cardiac arrest due to accidental overdose with norepinephrine dissolved in crystalloid [^115cqCpC]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Drug labeling**: Drug labeling is a safety measure where non-compliance continues to be implicated in a myriad of cases of drug errors. It is especially important to have clear labels when a handover of work is expected, and adherence to good practice standards is the safest approach. Most international guidelines on product labeling state that bags should be labeled immediately once an injectable is added and should contain a clearly visible sticker with at the very least the substance name, quantity, dilution, date, and time.

	- A matter of some confusion in our case was the marking of 500 mL on the 1000 mL bag, with later clarification that the norepinephrine was added after the first 500 mL had been given. Ideally, a separate infusion from the resuscitation fluid should have been mixed.

	- Opinions on whether vasoactive substances should be given via a roller flow control clamp at all are divided at best. It can be justified in extreme emergency circumstances (e.g. pre-hospital environment where access to an infusor pump might be limited) only as a temporary measure before at least an elastomeric infusion pump, or ideally a syringe driver infusor, can be set up.

- **Human factors**: There was a clear failure of closed-loop communication in the above case. The pre-hospital diluted norepinephrine was stopped initially, until a team member who had not heard the handover data point regarding norepinephrine opened the roller clamp again. This occurred after the new syringe-driven norepinephrine was being administered, without informing the rest of the team.
