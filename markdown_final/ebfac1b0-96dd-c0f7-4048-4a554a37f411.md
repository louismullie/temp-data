## Question

Background: Aldosterone blockade reduces mortality and morbidity among patients with severe heart failure. Researchers conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group (14.4%) and 554 deaths in the placebo group (16.7%, p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoints, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).\nWhich of the following represents the number of patients needed to treat to save one life, based on the primary endpoint?
A. 1/(0.136–0.118)
B. 1/(0.300–0.267)
C. 1/(0.167–0.144)
D. 1/(0.267–0.300)

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option correctly calculates the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one death from any cause, based on the primary endpoint of the EPHESUS trial comparing eplerenone to placebo. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what NNT means and the formula to compute it. Then, I should verify the correct event rates in the eplerenone and placebo groups from the trial. Next, I will calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR). After that, I will invert the ARR to get the NNT. Finally, I will match the calculation to the provided options and double-check that I'm using the right endpoint and numbers before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition and formula. The number needed to treat is the inverse of the absolute risk reduction, so NNT = 1 / ARR, where ARR equals the event rate in the control group minus the event rate in the treatment group. This gives the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional event, in this case death from any cause, over the study's follow-up period.

> Wait, let me verify the correct event rates from the trial. The problem states there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group (3,319 patients) and 554 deaths in the placebo group (3,313 patients), which correspond to 14.4% and 16.7% mortality, respectively. I should confirm those percentages: 478/3319 ≈ 0.144 and 554/3313 ≈ 0.167, so the reported rates are accurate.

> I will now examine the absolute risk reduction. ARR is the difference between the placebo event rate and the eplerenone event rate, so ARR = 0.167 − 0.144 = 0.023, which is a 2.3% absolute reduction in all-cause mortality with eplerenone compared with placebo.

> Next, I should review the NNT calculation. NNT = 1 / ARR = 1 / 0.023 ≈ 43.5, which rounds to about 43 patients needed to treat to prevent one additional death over the mean follow-up of 16 months. This aligns with published summaries of the trial that report an NNT near 43 for mortality benefit.

> Hold on, I should verify which option matches this calculation. Option C is 1/(0.167 − 0.144), which is exactly 1 divided by the ARR of 0.023, yielding approximately 43. Options A and B use different denominators that do not correspond to the all-cause mortality ARR, and Option D reverses the subtraction, which would produce a negative denominator and is incorrect for NNT in this context.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if the question might be asking about cardiovascular death rather than all-cause death, but the wording explicitly says "save one life", which corresponds to all-cause mortality. The cardiovascular mortality relative risk was 0.83, but that is a relative measure and not the ARR needed for NNT, so I should stick with all-cause mortality for this calculation [^notfound].

> Final answer: C. 1/(0.167 − 0.144).

---

The correct answer is **C. 1/(0.167 − 0.144)**. The number needed to treat (NNT) is the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between the event rate in the placebo group (16.7%) and the eplerenone group (14.4%). Thus, ARR = 0.167 − 0.144 = 0.023, and NNT = 1/0.023 ≈ 43.5, meaning approximately 44 patients need to be treated with eplerenone for 16 months to prevent one additional death [^11691GJK].

## Calculation of the number needed to treat (NNT)

The NNT is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between the event rate in the control group and the event rate in the treatment group [^116WH8pC]. In this study, the primary endpoint is **death from any cause** [^11691GJK].

- **Event rate in the placebo group**: 16.7% (554 deaths out of 3,313 patients)
- **Event rate in the eplerenone group**: 14.4% (478 deaths out of 3,319 patients)
- **Absolute risk reduction (ARR)**: 0.167 − 0.144 = 0.023 (or 2.3%)
- **Number needed to treat (NNT)**: 1 / ARR = 1 / 0.023 ≈ 43.5

Therefore, approximately **44 patients** need to be treated with eplerenone for 16 months to prevent one additional death from any cause [^11691GJK].

---

## Clinical significance of the NNT

An NNT of approximately 44 is **clinically meaningful** in this population, as it indicates that treating 44 patients with eplerenone for 16 months prevents one additional death. This benefit must be balanced against potential harms, such as hyperkalemia, which occurred more frequently in the eplerenone group (5.5% vs 3.9% in the placebo group) [^11691GJK].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. 1/(0.167 − 0.144)**, which corresponds to an NNT of approximately 44 patients treated with eplerenone for 16 months to prevent one additional death from any cause [^11691GJK].

### Aldosterone antagonist therapy for adults with heart failure and preserved systolic function (TOPCAT) [^115qfGk6]. ClinicalTrials (2004). Low credibility.

However, there is now an emerging awareness that nearly half of the patients with heart failure have preserved systolic function and that the survival of these patients is adversely affected. This study is a randomized clinical trial of a novel therapeutic approach, specifically the use of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, in treating these patients. While this treatment has been shown to be useful in treating heart failure with reduced systolic function, it has not been studied in patients with preserved systolic function. Patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function have a poor prognosis. The annual mortality rate is intermediate between the prognosis for those without heart failure and for those with heart failure and reduced systolic function. For instance, Family Health Study participants with heart failure and preserved systolic function had a mortality rate of 9% compared to 3% for their age- and gender-matched controls.

The mortality rate was 19% in heart failure patients with reduced systolic function heart failure compared to 4% for their matched controls. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts on the distal tubule, inhibiting sodium and potassium ion exchange. There are several potential beneficial actions, including prevention of cardiac fibrosis. A recent trial evaluated spironolactone in patients with systolic dysfunction heart failure. Spironolactone treatment caused a 30% reduction in mortality compared to placebo. The improvement resulted from a reduction in all cause mortality. More recently, the Eplerenone Post-Myocardial Infarction study showed that this aldosterone antagonist significantly reduces mortality despite background treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blocker.

Advantages of using spironolactone in this study are that it is commercially available, inexpensive, and no longer under patent. Also, there is a clear physiologic rationale for its use, and the side effect profile is well understood. The study enrolled subjects who had preserved systolic function with heart failure and who met clearly defined eligibility criteria that were selected to make the results widely generalizable to clinical practice.

### Understanding the number needed to treat [^116WH8pC]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2024). Medium credibility.

The number needed to treat (NNT) is the inverse of the absolute risk difference, which is used as a secondary outcome to clinical trials as a measure relevant to a positive trial, supplementing statistical significance. The NNT requires dichotomous outcomes and is influenced by the baseline disease or symptom severity, the particular population, the type and intensity of the interventional, the duration of treatment, the time period to assessment of response, and the comparator response. Confidence intervals should always accompany NNT for the precision of its estimate. In this review, three meta-analyses are reviewed, which included the NNT in the analysis of response.

### Using the number needed to treat in clinical practice [^113ZsfNi]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

The number needed to treat (NNT) is gaining attention as a method of reporting the results of clinical trails with dichotomous outcome measures. The NNT is defined as the number of patients who would need to be treated, on average, with a specific intervention to prevent 1 additional bad outcome or to achieve 1 desirable outcome in a given time period. Because it reports outcomes in terms of patient numbers, it is extremely useful to clinicians for making decisions about the effort expended with a particular intervention to achieve a single positive outcome. This special communication describes the NNT statistic and its utility for choosing clinical interventions.

### Number needed to treat (NNT) in clinical literature: an appraisal [^113ed8SR]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The concept of "number needed to treat" (NNT) was introduced in the medical literature by Laupacis et al. in 1988. NNT is an absolute effect measure which is interpreted as the number of patients needed to be treated with one therapy versus another for one patient to encounter an additional outcome of interest within a defined period of time. The computation of NNT is founded on the cumulative incidence of the outcome per number of patients followed over a given period of time, being classically calculated by inverting absolute risk reduction (ARR) (also called risk difference [RD]) between two treatment options.

Some characteristics are inherently associated with the concept of NNT. The resulting value is specific to a single comparison between two treatment options within a single study, rather than an isolated absolute measure of clinical effect of a single intervention. Thus, NNT is specific to the results of a given comparison, not to a particular therapy. In addition, three other factors, beyond the efficacy or safety of the intervention and the comparator, influence NNT: baseline risk (i.e. control event rate [CER]), time frame, and outcomes.

The use of NNT has been valuable in daily clinical practice, namely at assisting physicians in selecting therapeutic interventions. Further, this metric has the potential for use as a supportive tool in benefit-risk assessments and in helping regulators make decisions on drug regulation.

The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement recommends the use of both relative and absolute measures of effect for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with binary and time-to-event outcomes. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) requires that, whenever possible, absolute rather than relative risks and NNTs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are to be reported in RCTs. Yet, few authors express their findings in terms of NNT or ARR. Relative effect measures, such as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), are more commonly seen in the scientific literature. Despite the unquestionable usefulness of relative effect measures, they do not reflect baseline risks, making it impracticable to discriminate large from small treatment effects, and leading sometimes to misleading conclusions.

### Evidence-based dermatology: number needed to treat and its relation to other risk measures [^1129UsSi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

When discussing treatment options with patients, clinicians often use terms such as "frequently" or "rarely" when referring to potential benefits or possible harms. Quantitative measurements of treatment benefits and harms derived from randomized clinical trials or meta-analysis such as odds ratios or risk reduction are more precise terms, yet physicians and their patients find them difficult to understand and they are not, therefore, commonly used in clinical practice. To overcome the lack of intuitiveness for traditional measures of risk estimates derived from clinical trials, the number needed to treat (NNT) has been widely recommended as a measure of effectiveness, and number needed to harm as a way of describing risk of possible adverse events. NNT is simply the number of patients who, on average, would need to be treated with a proposed intervention to demonstrate one additional gain over the standard comparator intervention. NNT is an absolute measure and it is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction. In this article we describe the usefulness and limits of the NNT with particular reference to dermatology, and compare NNT with other relative measures such as the relative risk and relative risk reduction.

### Number needed to treat and number needed to harm are not the best way to report and assess the results of randomised clinical trials [^117CAZ4M]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The inverse of the difference between rates, called the 'number needed to treat' (NNT), was suggested 20 years ago as a good way to present the results of comparisons of success or failure under different therapies. Such comparisons usually arise in randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis. This article reviews the claims made about this statistic, and the problems associated with it. Methods that have been proposed for confidence intervals are evaluated, and shown to be erroneous. We suggest that giving the baseline risk, and the difference in success or event rates, the 'absolute risk reduction', is preferable to the number needed to treat, for both theoretical and practical reasons.

### Number needed to treat (or harm) [^116LRjHP]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The effect of a treatment versus controls may be expressed in relative or absolute terms. For rational decision-making, absolute measures are more meaningful. The number needed to treat, the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction, is a powerful estimate of the effect of a treatment. It is particularly useful because it takes into account the underlying risk (what would happen without the intervention?). The number needed to treat tells us not only whether a treatment works but how well it works. Thus, it informs health care professionals about the effort needed to achieve a particular outcome. A number needed to treat should be accompanied by information about the experimental intervention, the control intervention against which the experimental intervention has been tested, the length of the observation period, the underlying risk of the study population, and an exact definition of the endpoint. A 95% confidence interval around the point estimate should be calculated. An isolated number needed to treat is rarely appropriate to summarize the usefulness of an intervention; multiple numbers needed to treat for benefit and harm are more helpful. Absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat should become standard summary estimates in randomized controlled trials.

### Anti-VEGF intervention in neovascular AMD: benefits and risks restated as natural frequencies [^116ujBqU]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Objective

Clear information is essential to properly determine preference in medical intervention. In neovascular age-related macular degeneration, patients need to understand the balance of risk and benefit of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment. This balance is altered by the number of injections administered.

Methods

Natural frequencies, displayed as pictographically as icon arrays, are used to show material outcomes from the MARINA and HARBOR (12months) trials. We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH).

Results

MARINA 24-month data show the absolute risk reduction is 37% and the NNT is 3; meaning for one patient to benefit three need to be treated.12 months' HARBOR data show that compared with as-needed treatment, scheduled monthly injection treatment increases the number of patients achieving a better visual outcome. The number of patients suffering harm is also increased by the additional injections.

Conclusion

Displaying MARINA and HARBOR trial data as natural frequencies, with numbers needed to treat and harm, communicates complimentary information on the positive and negative aspects of anti-VEGF treatment.

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^115JrD9Q]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Changing the primary outcome to something more information heavy

Statistically speaking, the best primary outcome to use is the one with the greatest information content; that is, the one which minimises the variance of the treatment effect relative to the magnitude of the treatment effect. In terms of information content, there is generally a hierarchy for outcome measures with continuous outcomes tending to hold most information, followed by, in order, time-to-event, ordinal and finally binary outcome measures. From a statistical perspective, it is, thus, sensible to use the most information-rich primary outcome available. It is always costly in terms of sample size to split continuous or ordered outcome data into two categories.

Clearly the primary outcome measure must be important from the perspective of both patients and treating clinicians: the practical convenience of needing fewer patients should not determine the choice of outcome unless candidate outcome measures are considered relevant for decision-making for all interested parties, including patients, clinicians, relevant health authorities and, potentially, regulators.

It is also important to consider any other studies in the field or closely related areas, so that common outcome measures might be measured in all studies to facilitate the synthesis of evidence.

### Challenges in applying the results of clinical trials to clinical practice [^112QkvDM]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

The relevance of clinical trial results to clinical practice hinges on 2 critical questions: Will the results be replicated in one's practice, and Are the results clinically important? The answers to the following 5 questions may help one determine how relevant a study result is to clinical practice. First, have steps been taken to minimize bias (eg, masking, randomization)? Second, is the result likely due to the treatment (vs confounding factors)? Third, is the result unlikely to be due to chance? Fourth, is the study population representative of your patients? Fifth, is the totality of the evidence consistent across studies? To determine if a study result is likely to be clinically important, consider a 3-step approach. In step 1, decide, a priori, what a clinically meaningful difference between 2 treatments would be to define regions of beneficial, harmful, and trivial outcomes. In step 2, determine whether the CIs around the average outcome include the range of beneficial outcomes and lie outside the range of harmful outcomes. In step 3, determine the proportion of patients achieving a clinically meaningful benefit. If the CIs mostly include the range of beneficial outcomes and lie outside the range of clinically harmful outcomes and if a substantial proportion of patients achieve a clinically meaningful benefit, then the intervention is probably clinically important. Application of clinical trial results to clinical practice requires critical analysis of the extant literature as well as good clinical judgment.

### Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111aBDwR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); a review of the evidence is required to determine whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with HFpEF.

Search Methods

We updated searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and one clinical trial register on 14 May 2020 to identify eligible studies, with no language or date restrictions. We checked references from trial reports and review articles for additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design, enrolling adults with HFpEF, defined by LVEF greater than 40%.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 41 randomised controlled trials (231 reports), totalling 23,492 participants across all comparisons. The risk of bias was frequently unclear and only five studies had a low risk of bias in all domains. Beta-blockers (BBs) We included 10 studies (3087 participants) investigating BBs. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 30 years to 81 years. A possible reduction in cardiovascular mortality was observed (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; three studies), however, the certainty of evidence was low. There may be little to no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00; 1105 participants; four studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, and quality of life remain uncertain. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) We included 13 studies (4459 participants) investigating MRA. Eight studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 54.5 to 80 years. Pooled analysis indicated that MRA treatment probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB = 41; 3714 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). However, MRA treatment probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; 4207 participants; five studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; 4070 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). MRA treatment may have little or no effect on quality of life measures (mean difference (MD) 0.84, 95% CI -2.30 to 3.98; 511 participants; three studies; low-certainty evidence). MRA treatment was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 11; 4291 participants; six studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) We included eight studies (2061 participants) investigating ACEIs. Three studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 70 to 82 years. Pooled analyses with moderate-certainty evidence suggest that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.42; 945 participants; two studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.45; 1187 participants; five studies) and heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; 1019 participants; three studies), and may result in little or no effect on the quality of life (MD -0.09, 95% CI -3.66 to 3.48; 154 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on hyperkalaemia remain uncertain. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating ARBs were included. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in three the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 61 to 75 years. Pooled analyses with high certainty of evidence suggest that ARB treatment has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% 0.90 to 1.14; 7254 participants; three studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; 7964 participants; four studies), heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02; 7254 participants; three studies), and quality of life (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.86 to 1.67; 3117 participants; three studies). ARB was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; two studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) Three studies (7702 participants) investigating ARNIs were included. Two studies used ARBs as the comparator and one used standardised medical therapy, based on participants' established treatments at enrolment. The mean age of participants ranged from 71 to 73 years. Results suggest that ARNIs may have little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 4796 participants; one study; moderate-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 7663 participants; three studies; high-certainty evidence), or quality of life (high-certainty evidence). However, ARNI treatment may result in a slight reduction in heart failure hospitalisation, compared to usual care (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7362 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence). ARNI treatment was associated with a reduced risk of hyperkalaemia compared with valsartan (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01; 5054 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA and ARNI treatment in HFpEF probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation but probably has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality and quality of life. BB treatment may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality, however, further trials are needed. The current evidence for BBs, ACEIs, and ARBs is limited and does not support their use in HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication. Although MRAs and ARNIs are probably effective at reducing the risk of heart failure hospitalisation, the treatment effect sizes are modest. There is a need for improved approaches to patient stratification to identify the subgroup of patients who are most likely to benefit from MRAs and ARNIs, as well as for an improved understanding of disease biology, and for new therapeutic approaches.

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^114xSudk]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Exploring less common approaches to reducing sample size

We now consider some less standard approaches to bringing the sample size requirements closer to the numbers it is feasible to recruit in a reasonable time frame.

Step 3: Relaxing α by a small amount, beyond traditional values

The much-criticised 5% significance level is used widely in much applied scientific research, but is an arbitrary figure. It is extremely rare for clinical trials to use any other level. It may be argued that this convention has been adopted as a compromise between erroneously concluding a new treatment is more efficacious and undertaking a trial of an achievable size and length. Settings where traditionally sized trials are not possible may be just the area where researchers start to break this convention, for good reason.

In considering the type I error, it is critical to consider the question: 'What are the consequences of erroneously deciding to use a new treatment routinely if it is truly not better?'

Taking the societal perspective as before, we might consider the probability of making a type I error, thus erroneously burdening patients with treatments that do not improve outcomes, or even worsen them, while potentially imposing unnecessary toxicity.

First, for conditions where there are only enough patients available to run one modestly sized randomised trial in a reasonable time frame, research progress will be relatively slow, and making a type I error may be less of a concern than a type II error. In contrast, making several type I errors in a common disease could lead in practice to patients taking several ineffective treatments; for a disease area where only one trial can run at any given time, the overall burden on patients is potentially taking one ineffective treatment that does not work.

Thus, if we take the societal perspective with the trials in Table 1 then, if each trial was analysed with α = 0.05 and we see (hypothetically) 40% positive results, then the expected number of false positive trials is given in the final column. We also assumed 10% and 70% positive results, with qualitatively similar conclusions.

### CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials [^116mq3Kv]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Explanation — Authors should describe each intervention thoroughly, including control interventions. The description should allow a clinician wanting to use the intervention to know exactly how to administer the intervention that was evaluated in the trial. For a drug intervention, information would include the drug name, dose, method of administration (such as oral, intravenous), timing and duration of administration, conditions under which interventions are withheld, and titration regimen if applicable. If the control group is to receive "usual care" it is important to describe thoroughly what that constitutes. If the control group or intervention group is to receive a combination of interventions the authors should provide a thorough description of each intervention, an explanation of the order in which the combination of interventions are introduced or withdrawn, and the triggers for their introduction if applicable.

Specific extensions of the CONSORT statement address the reporting of non-pharmacologic and herbal interventions and their particular reporting requirements (such as expertise, details of how the interventions were standardised). We recommend readers consult the statements for non-pharmacologic and herbal interventions as appropriate.

Item 6a. Completely defined pre-specified primary and secondary outcome measures, including how and when they were assessed

Example — "The primary endpoint with respect to efficacy in psoriasis was the proportion of patients achieving a 75% improvement in psoriasis activity from baseline to 12 weeks as measured by the PASI [psoriasis area and severity index] Additional analyses were done on the percentage change in PASI scores and improvement in target psoriasis lesions".

Explanation — All RCTs assess response variables, or outcomes (end points), for which the groups are compared. Most trials have several outcomes, some of which are of more interest than others. The primary outcome measure is the pre-specified outcome considered to be of greatest importance to relevant stakeholders (such a patients, policy makers, clinicians, funders) and is usually the one used in the sample size calculation (see item 7). Some trials may have more than one primary outcome. Having several primary outcomes, however, incurs the problems of interpretation associated with multiplicity of analyses (see items 18 and 20) and is not recommended. Primary outcomes should be explicitly indicated as such in the report of an RCT. Other outcomes of interest are secondary outcomes (additional outcomes). There may be several secondary outcomes, which often include unanticipated or unintended effects of the intervention (see item 19), although harms should always be viewed as important whether they are labelled primary or secondary.

### Associations between aldosterone antagonist therapy and risks of mortality and readmission among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction… [^115FZ6Ad]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context Aldosterone antagonist therapy for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction has been highly efficacious in randomized trials. However, questions remain regarding the effectiveness and safety of the therapy in clinical practice. Objective To examine the clinical effectiveness of newly initiated aldosterone antagonist therapy among older patients hospitalized with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. During the past 30 years, large randomized trials have established the efficacy of multiple therapies for reducing mortality among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. 1 Among the most efficacious therapies for heart failure are the aldosterone antagonists spironolactone and eplerenone. In 2 landmark trials, these agents reduced mortality by 24% to 30% and readmission for heart failure by nearly 40%. 2, 3 Despite these findings and subsequent class I guideline recommendations, the use of aldosterone antagonist therapy remains lower than expected. 1, 4, 5.

To address confounding by observed covariates, we used inverse probability of treatment weighting methods, a type of propensity score analysis. Table 2 and the Figure show the observed cumulative incidence of the study outcomes. Rates of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular readmission were similar between the treatment groups at 3 years. Ours is among the largest clinical effectiveness studies of aldosterone antagonist therapy in eligible older patients hospitalized with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Overall, we found no significant differences in mortality or cardiovascular readmission between treated and untreated patients after adjustment for propensity of use, risk factors, and use of other medications. However, we found a significantly lower risk for first readmission for heart failure among treated patients.

Treated patients had a higher risk of readmission with hyperkalemia, primarily in the first few weeks after discharge from the index hospitalization. Observational studies have produced mixed results regarding associations between aldosterone antagonist therapy and outcomes. An analysis of data from the Registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting found nonsignificant higher odds of mortality at 2 years with aldosterone antagonist therapy. A nested case-control analysis from the same registry found no difference in risk-adjusted mortality. 26, 27 In contrast, a study of 946 patients hospitalized in Japan with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction found a nearly 40% lower risk of mortality with aldosterone antagonist therapy. 28 A hospital-level analysis of Organized.

### Guidance for protocol content and reporting of factorial randomised trials: explanation and elaboration of the CONSORT 2010 and SPIRIT 2013 extensions [^1129StR3]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

The sample size calculation should be guided by the main trial objectives, and thus will differ depending on whether the aim is to evaluate multiple interventions in a single trial, or to detect an interaction.

Interactions affect the required sample size. A statement relating to the assumptions regarding the presence or absence of interaction in the calculation will assist readers in understanding how the calculation was performed, and whether it is appropriate for the trial objectives.

For 2-in-1 factorial trials, a sample size calculation is typically performed for each main comparison using the same approach as for a two-arm parallel group trial (ie, using the same desired level of power, significance level, etc); however, the required number of participants per group is then multiplied by the number of levels within the comparison to obtain the overall sample size, rather than by the number of treatment groups in the trial (eg, in a 2×2 trial, this number is multiplied by two levels, and not by four treatment groups).

Then, once the sample size has been calculated for each main comparison, the largest of these is chosen if they differ across comparisons. A difference might occur if different interventions are expected to produce different treatment effects, if different primary outcomes are used for each factor, or if the number of levels differs between factors.

Sample size calculations based on a binary primary outcome might require special consideration to account for the assumed effect of each other intervention on the event rate in the control arm. For example, in a 2×2 factorial design, assume that (1) the event rate in the double control group is 40%; and that (2) both treatments reduce the absolute event rate by 5 percentage points, or an equivalent relative reduction of 12.5%. For the comparison between all A and all not A, the assumed event rate in the all-not-A group is thus 37.5%, because half of these participants also receive treatment B. This difference from the event rate in the double control group might require a reduction or increase in sample size, depending on whether the same absolute or relative effect is to be detected.

### Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1156h8GZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. There is uncertainty whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and a comprehensive review of the evidence is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trial registries on 25 July 2017 to identify eligible studies. Reference lists from primary studies and review articles were checked for additional studies. There were no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design enrolling adult participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 40 percent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. The outcomes assessed included cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, all-cause mortality and quality of life. Risk ratios (RR) and, where possible, hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous data, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) were calculated. We contacted trialists where neccessary to obtain missing data.

Main Results

37 randomised controlled trials (207 reports) were included across all comparisons with a total of 18,311 participants. Ten studies (3087 participants) investigating beta-blockers (BB) were included. A pooled analysis indicated a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (15% of participants in the intervention arm versus 19% in the control arm; RR 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; 3 studies). However, the quality of evidence was low and no effect on cardiovascular mortality was observed when the analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29; 643 participants; 1 study). There was no effect on all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation or quality of life measures, however there is uncertainty about these effects given the limited evidence available.12 studies (4408 participants) investigating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were included with the quality of evidence assessed as moderate. MRA treatment reduced heart failure hospitalisation (11% of participants in the intervention arm versus 14% in the control arm; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB 41; 3714 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence) however, little or no effect on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and quality of life measures was observed. MRA treatment was associated with a greater risk of hyperkalaemia (16% of participants in the intervention group versus 8% in the control group; RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; 4291 participants; 6 studies; high-quality evidence). Eight studies (2061 participants) investigating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as moderate. The evidence suggested that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. Data for the effect of ACEI on hyperkalaemia were only available from one of the included studies. Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as high. The evidence suggested that treatment with ARB has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. ARB was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia (0.9% of participants in the intervention group versus 0.5% in the control group; RR 1.88; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence). We identified a single ongoing placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA treatment reduces heart failure hospitalisation in heart failure with preserverd ejection fraction, however the effects on mortality related outcomes and quality of life remain unclear. The available evidence for beta-blockers, ACEI, ARB and ARNI is limited and it remains uncertain whether these treatments have a role in the treatment of HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication for their use. This comprehensive review highlights a persistent gap in the evidence that is currently being addressed through several large ongoing clinical trials.

### CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials [^111wp94e]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Explanation — For scientific and ethical reasons, the sample size for a trial needs to be planned carefully, with a balance between medical and statistical considerations. Ideally, a study should be large enough to have a high probability (power) of detecting as statistically significant a clinically important difference of a given size if such a difference exists. The size of effect deemed important is inversely related to the sample size necessary to detect it; that is, large samples are necessary to detect small differences. Elements of the sample size calculation are (1) the estimated outcomes in each group (which implies the clinically important target difference between the intervention groups); (2) the α (type I) error level; (3) the statistical power (or the β (type II) error level); and (4), for continuous outcomes, the standard deviation of the measurements. The interplay of these elements and their reporting will differ for cluster trialsand non-inferiority and equivalence trials.

Authors should indicate how the sample size was determined. If a formal power calculation was used, the authors should identify the primary outcome on which the calculation was based (see item 6a), all the quantities used in the calculation, and the resulting target sample size per study group. It is preferable to quote the expected result in the control group and the difference between the groups one would not like to overlook. Alternatively, authors could present the percentage with the event or mean for each group used in their calculations. Details should be given of any allowance made for attrition or non-compliance during the study.

Some methodologists have written that so called underpowered trials may be acceptable because they could ultimately be combined in a systematic review and meta-analysis, and because some information is better than no information. Of note, important caveats apply — such as the trial should be unbiased, reported properly, and published irrespective of the results, thereby becoming available for meta-analysis. On the other hand, many medical researchers worry that underpowered trials with indeterminate results will remain unpublished and insist that all trials should individually have "sufficient power". This debate will continue, and members of the CONSORT Group have varying views. Critically however, the debate and those views are immaterial to reporting a trial. Whatever the power of a trial, authors need to properly report their intended size with all their methods and assumptions. That transparently reveals the power of the trial to readers and gives them a measure by which to assess whether the trial attained its planned size.

### Influence of trial sample size on treatment effect estimates: meta-epidemiological study [^112B6Sow]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data sources

This study combined data from two independent collections of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials assessing therapeutic interventions with binary outcomes. The first collection included 48 meta-analyses (421 trials) published in the 10 leading journals of each medical subject category of the Journal Citation Reports during two periods: between July 2008 and January 2009 and between January and June 2010 or in issue 4 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2008. Further details about the search strategy and selection of meta-analyses have been published. Reports of all component trials from included meta-analyses were obtained.

The second collection included 45 meta-analyses (314 trials) published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between January and July 2011. We included meta-analyses assessing a binary outcome for the primary or main outcome measure and involving four or more trials. If the meta-analysis reported combined results for more than one primary binary outcome, we selected the first reported outcome if it was described in enough trial reports. We excluded meta-analyses that overlapped with the first collection. Web appendix 1 includes details of the selection process for both collections.

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment

Using a standardised data extraction form, we extracted the following data for each randomised controlled trial: the date of publication, whether the trial was a single centre or multicentre trial (with at least two different centres), the number of patients with the outcome in each group, and the number of patients randomised in each group. Data for risk of bias were also collected by using the following domains of the risk of bias tool of the Cochrane Collaboration: methods for sequence generation and allocation concealment, blinding, and incomplete outcome data. Each domain was rated as having low, high, or unclear risk of bias, according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. For each trial, the overall risk of bias was classified as low (that is, low risk of bias for all domains), high (that is, high risk of bias for one or more domains), or unclear (that is, unclear risk of bias for one or more domains in the absence of high risk of bias). We extracted data from the original reports of trials for the first collection of meta-analyses (in duplicate for a third of the meta-analyses), and from the Cochrane reviews for the second collection.

### NCT00094302 | Aldosterone antagonist therapy for adults… [^112Znuk6]. ClinicalTrials (2004). Low credibility.

Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy for Adults With Heart Failure and Preserved Systolic Function ClinicalTrials. gov ID. However, there is now an emerging awareness that nearly half of the patients with heart failure have preserved systolic function and that the survival of these patients is adversely affected. This study is a randomized clinical trial of a novel therapeutic approach, specifically the use of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, in treating these patients. While this treatment has been shown to be useful in treating heart failure with reduced systolic function, it has not been studied in patients with preserved systolic function. Patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function have a poor prognosis. The annual mortality rate is intermediate between the prognosis for those without heart failure and for those with heart failure and reduced systolic function.

For instance, Family Health Study participants with heart failure and preserved systolic function had a mortality rate of 9% compared to 3% for their age- and gender-matched controls. The mortality rate was 19% in heart failure patients with reduced systolic function heart failure compared to 4% for their matched controls. The improvement resulted from a reduction in all cause mortality. More recently, the Eplerenone Post-Myocardial Infarction study showed that this aldosterone antagonist significantly reduces mortality despite background treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blocker. Advantages of using spironolactone in this study are that it is commercially available, inexpensive, and no longer under patent. Also, there is a clear physiologic rationale for its use, and the side effect profile is well understood.

The study enrolled subjects who had preserved systolic function with heart failure and who met clearly defined eligibility criteria that were selected to make the results widely generalizable to clinical practice. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of aldosterone antagonist therapy in 3, 445 adult patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function. Patients were recruited from August 2006 through January 2012, treated, and will be followed through June 2013.

### Assumptions of expected benefits in randomized phase III trials evaluating systemic treatments for cancer [^115DDaLV]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In designing phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the expected magnitude of the benefit of the experimental therapy (δ) determines the number of patients required and the number of person-years of follow-up. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate how reliably δ approximates the observed benefit (B) in RCTs that evaluated cancer treatment.

Methods

RCTs evaluating systemic therapy in adult cancer patients published in 10 journals from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, were identified. Data were extracted from each publication independently by two investigators. The related-samples Sign test was used to determine whether the median difference between δ and B was statistically significant in different study subsets and was two-sided.

Results

A total of 253 RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. Regardless of whether benefit was defined as proportional change (median difference between δ and B = -13.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -21.0% to -8.0%), absolute change (median difference between δ and B = -8.0%, 95% CI = -9.9% to -5.1%), or median increase in a time-to-event endpoint (median difference between δ and B = -1.4 months, 95% CI = -2.1 to -0.8 months), δ was consistently and statistically significantly larger than B (P < .001, for each, respectively). This relationship between δ and B was independent of year of publication, industry funding, management by cooperative trial groups, type of control arm, type of experimental arm, disease site, adjuvant treatment, or treatment for advanced disease, and likely contributed to the high proportion of negative RCTs (158 [62.5%] of 253 studies).

Conclusions

Investigators consistently make overly optimistic assumptions regarding treatment benefits when designing RCTs. Attempts to reduce the number of negative RCTs should focus on more realistic estimations of δ. Increased use of interim analyses, certain adaptive trial designs, and better biological characterization of patients are potential ways of mitigating this problem.

### Can placebo controls reduce the number of nonresponders in clinical trials? A power-analytic perspective [^114Vim82]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

There is ongoing debate regarding the ethics of placebo-controlled clinical trials when a moderately effective standard treatment exists. One aspect of the debate — the number of nonresponders — tends to be overlooked. A larger between-group effect size is expected in placebo-controlled trials than in trials with an active comparator. For that reason, substantially fewer subjects need to be enrolled in placebo-controlled trials; consequently, there tend to be far fewer nonresponders in placebo-controlled trials.

Objective

This analysis was undertaken to illustrate that the use of placebo as a control can reduce the number of subjects who are unnecessarily exposed to delayed treatment.

Methods

Statistical power analyses were used to estimate the sample size required to detect various population treatment differences and the resulting number of nonresponders for 2-tailed chi-square tests.

Results

Empiric evidence of the phenomenon is provided for a wide range of rates of response to placebo, investigational, and comparator treatments. For example, 24 subjects (ie, 12 per group) are needed to detect differences between placebo (10% response rate) and an investigational drug (70% response); 15 of these would not respond. In contrast, if the investigational drug (70% response) is initially compared with a standard therapy (60% response), 752 subjects would be required, 263 of whom would not respond.

Conclusions

This paper shows empirically that placebo controls can reduce the number of nonresponders in a randomized controlled trial. The number of subjects who are exposed to unproven, albeit promising, investigational drugs should be kept to a minimum until placebo-controlled trials support their use.

### Outcome – adaptive randomization: is it useful? [^113eMQQL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Outcome-adaptive randomization is one of the possible elements of an adaptive trial design in which the ratio of patients randomly assigned to the experimental treatment arm versus the control treatment arm changes from 1:1 over time to randomly assigning a higher proportion of patients to the arm that is doing better. Outcome-adaptive randomization has intuitive appeal in that, on average, a higher proportion of patients will be treated on the better treatment arm (if there is one). In both the randomized phase II and phase III settings with a short-term binary outcome, we compare outcome-adaptive randomization with designs that use 1:1 and 2:1 fixed-ratio randomizations (in the latter, twice as many patients are randomly assigned to the experimental treatment arm). The comparisons are done in terms of required sample sizes, the numbers and proportions of patients having an inferior outcome, and we restrict attention to the situation in which one treatment arm is a control treatment (rather than the less common situation of two experimental treatments without a control treatment). With no differential patient accrual rates because of the trial design, we find no benefits to outcome-adaptive randomization over 1:1 randomization, and we recommend the latter. If it is thought that the patient accrual rates will be substantially higher because of the possibility of a higher proportion of patients being randomly assigned to the experimental treatment (because the trial will be more attractive to patients and clinicians), we recommend using a fixed 2:1 randomization instead of an outcome-adaptive randomization.

### Heterogeneity in pragmatic randomised trials: sources and management [^117Y6vnb]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Trial planning: relax patient selection criteria

A pragmatic trial aims to recruit patients from an available population who are as similar as possible to the target population. This target population corresponds to the population that would receive the study intervention once it has been shown to be effective and scaled up in the usual healthcare setting. Eligibility criteria should not exclude patients who are less likely to respond to the treatment or those not likely to complete the follow-up. Success in representing the target population in the patients recruited for the trial contributes to the applicability of the trial's results to the target population. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are often more restrictive in trials of drug interventions than those assessing devices, surgery or other complex interventions; they are also more restrictive in industry-sponsored versus public agency-funded trials. As an example, the TiME trial had very few selection criteria for patients, thus promising very good applicability, besides the fact that it limited the risk of identification and recruitment bias (Table 5).

Table 5
TiME: increased haemodialysis duration session

Trial planning: account for pragmatic features in sample size calculation

Even though sample size formulae may be the same, the reasoning about sample size differs in pragmatic and explanatory trials. First, intervention effects are expected to be smaller in pragmatic than explanatory trials, in part because of the inclusion of patients with a wider range of characteristics, for example those with comorbidities, who are less adherent, and/or who have both less severe conditions, and thus benefit less, as well as those whose condition is more severe and possibly intractable. Other features that might promote homogeneity and thus apparently greater effect sizes in explanatory trials include selecting caregivers and centres based on volume and experience. Second, sample size parameters need to be carefully and realistically specified. A priori specifying a standard deviation that is lower than the post hoc estimate is a common problem and results in optimistic sample size estimates and risks of insufficient statistical power. Therefore, attention should be paid to whether standard deviation estimates are derived from previously conducted explanatory trials — and therefore likely to be too low — or from administrative routinely collected data, for instance, which should adequately capture real-world heterogeneity.

### Key design considerations for adaptive clinical trials: a primer for clinicians [^115zc6uV]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Statistical planning

Statistical planning is critical for any clinical trial design. For adaptive designs, the statistical analysis plan comprises the simulation, the interim analysis to inform potential adaptations, and the final analysis of the completed trial. Similar to conventional trial designs, a number of factors such as observed and expected effects, trial budget, and total maximum sample size need to be considered.

Adaptive trials need a so-called burn-in phase where a predetermined number of patients can be enrolled at a fixed allocation ratio (usually 1:1) to ensure that enough data are collected to allow for reasonable expected precision. Making adaptations too early can be problematic because small datasets are more prone to random error.

The general rule of thumb for response adaptive randomisation is to collect data on a minimum of 20–30 patients in each arm (the burn-in) before conducting the first interim analysis. Other adaptations, including sample size reassessments and study enrichments, typically need a longer burn-in period and larger sample size.

In multi-arm adaptive trials, allocation to the control group is commonly fixed (for example, at 20% of total patient allocation) and the allocation ratio between experimental treatments is adjusted. Collecting sufficient data from the control group helps to ensure adequate statistical power to make comparisons between treatments.

The final statistical analysis of an adaptive trial is usually quite similar to that of conventional trials. This may be because regulatory requirements commonly have heavy emphasis on conventional statistics (such as requiring P values less than 5%). But using more specific statistics when making the decision to adapt a trial during interim analyses may be the cause of misinterpretation if viewed through the lens of conventional statistics. For example, if an adaptive multi-arm trial allows early termination due to a predefined threshold for a (bayesian) probability of treatment superiority, a conventional statistical analysis of the final dataset may not meet regulatory success criteria. In particular, a two sided statistical test comparing the apparently superior treatment to the control could yield a P value larger than 5%, which is very different from estimating the bayesian probability of superiority among many treatments, especially when data are still relatively small during an interim analysis. Like any clinical trial stopped early, adaptive trials may also yield treatment effect estimates that are affected by random error. Planning which types of statistical inferences will be drawn in case of early termination is important. For example, a seamless adaptive trial may reliably inform which of many candidate treatments (or doses) tested in phase II should be continued into a phase III, but claims about the magnitude of treatment effects may not be warranted.

### CONSORT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for reporting randomised trials [^111X4gQJ]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Authors should report all major changes to the trial after it commenced indicating the reason for the changes and when the changes occurred. Such changes might affect the trial methods, such as the randomisation ratio, eligibility criteria, interventions, outcomes, method of analysis or duration of follow-up; or might affect the trial conduct, such as dropping a trial site with poor data quality.

Some trials are set up with a formal adaptive design, which allows pre-planned changes to an ongoing trial without compromising the validity of conclusions. It is therefore essential to distinguish pre-planned changes from unplanned changes that may also occur. Such adaptive trial design modifications are usually to the sample size and number of treatment groups, and can lead to decisions being made more quickly and with more efficient use of resources than would be possible with traditional, non-adaptive parallel group trials. Specific guidance has been developed for reporting trials with a formal adaptive design; authors could consult this for more detailed information.

Most trials record multiple outcomes, with the risk that results will be reported for only a selected subset. Prespecification and reporting of completely defined primary and secondary outcomes for both benefits and harms (item 14) should remove such a risk. In some trials, however, circumstances require a change in the way an outcome is assessed, the designation of outcomes as primary or secondary or even, as in the example above, a switch to a different outcome. For example, there may be external evidence from other trials or systematic reviews suggesting the time point for the primary outcome might not be appropriate; or recruitment or the overall event rate in the trial may be lower than expected. Changing an endpoint based on unblinded data are much more problematic, although may be specified in the context of an adaptive trial design.

Whether the modifications are explicitly part of the trial design or in response to changing circumstances, it is essential that they are fully reported and the reason for the change explained to help the reader interpret the results. Such information is not always reported. A comparison of protocols and publications of 102 randomised trials found that 62% of trial reports had at least one primary outcome that was changed, introduced, or omitted compared with the protocol. Primary outcomes also differed between protocols and publications for 40% of a cohort of 48 trials funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. None of these subsequent 150 trial reports mentioned, let alone explained, changes from the protocol. Similar results from other studies have been reported in a systematic review of empirical studies, comparing trial registers or protocols to published trial reports.

### Real-world analysis of acamprosate use in patients with cirrhosis and alcohol-associated hepatitis [^112XkDG7]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use is the leading cause of cirrhosis globally, and cases of alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD), including alcohol-associated hepatitis, continue to rise in most parts of the world. Abstinence from alcohol is the most important intervention for patients with advanced ArLD. Indeed, abstinence from alcohol improves clinical outcomes at all stages of liver disease. The impact of abstinence on mortality is particularly stark in cases of alcohol-associated hepatitis. Despite this, relapse rates and alcohol use among this population remain high. The evidence base for any intervention for alcohol use disorder (AUD) in patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis remains poor, and uptake of treatments is low. Hospital admission creates an enforced period of abstinence and should represent an opportunity for patients and healthcare professionals to work together to attempt to prevent future relapse to alcohol.

Acamprosate is a widely used treatment for AUD in patients without liver disease. It is recommended as a first-line measure to prevent relapse in patients who have achieved abstinence from alcohol and should be prescribed in conjunction with psychological interventions. The pharmacology of acamprosate is not completely understood but it is thought to act as a glutaminergic antagonist and a γ-aminobutyric acid agonist. It is suggested to reduce craving by reducing arousal, insomnia and anxiety.

In outpatient settings, the number needed to treat to prevent a return to drinking for acamprosate in one patient is 12. There have been no randomised studies of acamprosate in patients with cirrhosis or alcohol-associated hepatitis. Nevertheless acamprosate is broadly considered to be safe in this population since it is renally excreted and has no known hepatotoxicity. It is therefore an attractive candidate for use in patients with cirrhosis or alcohol-associated hepatitis for whom relapse prevention is critical.

In a recent retrospective analysis of patients with cirrhosis, acamprosate was not found to be associated with any significant adverse events and was associated with fewer hospital admissions than baclofen. However, other cohort studies have demonstrated that patients with AUD who had been treated with acamprosate were more likely to be diagnosed with ArLD and to develop hepatic decompensation. Moreover, even in patients without liver disease, acamprosate prescription has been associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation.

We wanted to determine the real-world impact of acamprosate prescription for patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcohol-associated hepatitis following a hospital admission. We were interested not only in the impact of acamprosate on relapse to alcohol, but also in any impact on clinical outcomes.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1146YTFy]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Description of levels of evidence — Evidence based on endpoints of well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provides consistent findings without important limitations. Evidence with limitations includes RCTs with limited numbers of patients, post hoc or subgroup analyses or meta-analyses, and also applies when few RCTs exist or important limitations are evident (e.g., methodological flaws, small numbers, short duration, populations differing from the target, or inconsistent results). Evidence from non-randomized designs derives from outcomes of uncontrolled or non-randomized trials or observational studies. When clinical literature is insufficient, guidance relies on panel consensus based on clinical experience or knowledge that does not meet the above stated criteria.

### When to keep it simple-adaptive designs are not always useful [^115azbyr]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Having delay does hurt the efficiency gain – whilst the required number of first-stage patients were reaching 24 weeks follow-up, second-stage patients were being recruited. We explored the effect of the length of the endpoint delay in simulations. We consider the endpoint delay varying from 1 to 48 weeks and simulated 10,000 trial replicates for each. This allowed us to explore the effect of delay on the statistical properties. We considered two scenarios, namely when all doses had the same effect as control (null scenario) and when two doses had no effect and one dose had a standardized effect of 0.545 (alternative scenario). Figure 3 shows the expected sample size of the trial under each scenario and the proportion of participants allocated to the effective treatment in the alternative scenario. Clearly, the delay had a substantial effect on the expected sample size and the advantages to patients. Nevertheless, with the actual 24-week delay observed in the trial, there was a substantial benefit from the adaptive approach, wherein the sample size needed (on average) was reduced and there was an increase in the proportion of patients allocated to the best treatment.

It should be noted that the time taken to perform the interim analysis (see later section on logistical complexity) was not included in the 24-week delay, and thus, in practice, the delay might have been longer. We consider in a later section logistical issues that may either prolong the interim analysis, require substantially more trial resources, or lower the quality of the information on the endpoint assessed at the interim. Any of these issues will reduce the benefits given by the adaptive design.

### Impact of a patient's baseline risk on the relative benefit and harm of a preventive treatment strategy: applying trial results in clinical decision making [^1125oJyK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Every patient is different, and every patient will react differently to medication. However, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) usually report results as a single relative effect size. In current clinical practice, this single relative treatment effect is then used and applied to diverse patient categories and a plethora of individual patients. Implicitly, the assumption is made that this single relative effect measure is true for all study participants, independent of an individual's characteristics.

The anticipated absolute treatment effect is then dependent on not only the relative treatment effect, but also on baseline risk: for example, a relative risk reduction of 20% for an intervention will result in a 5% absolute risk reduction for a patient with a 25% baseline 10‐year risk for the outcome, and a 2% absolute risk reduction for a patient with a 10% baseline 10‐year risk. However, for these absolute treatment effects to be true, the assumption of a single relative treatment effect independent of baseline risk and different clinical characteristics needs to hold. An individual patient in clinical practice is not the same as the average trial participant. The dilemma in clinical practice is whether a single overall relative treatment effect is also true for the patient a health care professional is seeing. The best treatment on average may not be the best treatment for a given patient. Moreover, a given patient may experience more important treatment harms than another patient.

Simple relative treatment effect modification is regularly assessed in trials using subgroup analyses, a one‐characteristic‐at‐a‐time approach. This article explains why such approaches to subgroup analyses could have limitations, and suggests an alternative method to evaluate relative treatment effect modification. In this article, we evaluate whether relative treatment effects of medication in 2 large contemporary trials are influenced by the baseline risk of an individual patient. This method can be used to assess treatment effect heterogeneity (ie, how the relative treatment effect varies across patients) in terms of both treatment benefit and treatment harm.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^112kaUQj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### New strategies for clinical trials in patients with sepsis and septic shock [^111jcezC]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The difficulty in identifying new treatment modalities that significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity rates associated with sepsis has highlighted the need to reevaluate the approach to clinical trial design. The United Kingdom Medical Research Council convened an International Working Party to address these issues.

Data Sources

The subject areas that were to be the focus of discussion were identified by the co-chairs, and group leaders were nominated. Preconference reading material was circulated to group members.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Small-group discussion fed into an iterative process of feedback from plenary sessions, followed by the formulation of recommendations. Finally, each working group prepared a summary of its recommendations and these are reported herein.

Data Synthesis

There were five key recommendations. First, investigators should no longer rely solely on the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine definitions of sepsis or sepsis syndrome as the basis of trial entry. Entry criteria should be based on three principles: a) All patients should have infection; b) there should be evidence of a pathologic process that represents a biologically plausible target for the proposed intervention, for example, an abnormal circulating level of a biological marker pertinent to the study drug; and c) patients should fall into an appropriate category of severity (usually severe sepsis). Second, investigators should use a scoring system for organ dysfunctions that has been validated and that can be incorporated into all sepsis studies; agreement on the use of a single system would simplify comparisons between studies. Third, the primary outcome measure generally should be mortality rates, but under appropriate circumstances major morbidities could be considered as primary end points. Regardless of choice of the duration to primary end point, patients should be followed for ≥ 90 days. Fourth, sample size needs to be based on a realistic assessment of achievable effect size based on knowledge of the at-risk population. Fifth, subgroups should be few in number and should be defined a priori on the basis of variables present before randomization.

Conclusions

Important changes in several aspects of trial design may improve the quality of clinical studies in sepsis and maximize the chance of identifying effective therapeutic agents.

### Novel clinical trial designs with dose optimization to improve long-term outcomes [^1158ywjK]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conventional designs for choosing a dose for a new therapy may select doses that are unsafe or ineffective and fail to optimize progression-free survival time, overall survival time, or response/remission duration. We explain and illustrate limitations of conventional dose-finding designs and make four recommendations to address these problems. When feasible, a dose-finding design should account for long-term outcomes, include screening rules that drop unsafe or ineffective doses, enroll an adequate sample size, and randomize patients among doses. As illustrations, we review three designs that include one or more of these features. The first illustration is a trial that randomized patients among two cell therapy doses and standard of care in a setting where it was assumed on biological grounds that dose toxicity and dose-response curves did not necessarily increase with cell dose. The second design generalizes phase I-II by first identifying a set of candidate doses, rather than one dose, randomizing additional patients among the candidates, and selecting an optimal dose to maximize progression-free survival over a longer follow-up period. The third design combines a phase I-II trial and a group sequential randomized phase III trial by using survival time data available after the first stage of phase III to reoptimize the dose selected in phase I-II. By incorporating one or more of the recommended features, these designs improve the likelihood that a selected dose or schedule will be optimal, and thus will benefit future patients and obtain regulatory approval.

### Use of aldosterone antagonists in heart failure… [^113NoTa6]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context Aldosterone antagonists are recommended for patients with moderate to severe heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Prior studies suggest underuse of aldosterone antagonists in eligible patients as well as overuse in settings in which therapy may be harmful. Objective To examine aldosterone antagonist prescription based on HF management guideline criteria, investigator-defined appropriateness criteria, and trends over time in patients hospitalized with heart failure. Results Among 12 565 patients eligible for aldosterone antagonist therapy, 4087 received an aldosterone antagonist at discharge, and treatment increased modestly from 28% to 34% over the study period. There was also wide variation in aldosterone antagonist use among hospitals.

Clinical trials have established the incremental benefits of aldosterone antagonist therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, 1–3 such that aldosterone antagonists were designated as class I, "useful and recommended, " within the American College of Cardiology/American Heart. We assessed evidence-based guideline prescription of an aldosterone antagonist at discharge in hospitals with at least 10 eligible patients as well as the relationship of aldosterone antagonist prescription and quality-of-care measures. To assess appropriateness of aldosterone antagonist use, we examined use based on each of the 3 components of the ACC/AHA guidelines; use in patients with LVEF of 35% or less who received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or β-blocker therapy; and use in patients with preserved LVEF and history of hypertension.

Based on the 3 individual component criteria of the ACC/AHA management guidelines, aldosterone antagonist use in patients by LVEF criteria was 29. 5%, by serum creatinine criteria was 32%, and by serum potassium criteria was
31. 1%. For each component, aldosterone antagonist prescription increased significantly over the six 6-month intervals. In our study, aldosterone antagonist–treated patients were younger than those not treated. When pre- and post–Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study study populations were compared, patient age was unchanged over time in one report4 and was higher in another. 5 There are possible implications of age on appropriateness of aldosterone antagonist use.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: translational research in rare respiratory diseases [^113xt76E]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2017). Medium credibility.

Translational research organization in RRDs — stakeholders, infrastructure, and trial design: The goal of translational research is to exploit knowledge gained from experimental or clinical models to develop new diagnostics or therapeutics for patients, and effective translational research on RRDs requires an integrated infrastructure that interfaces with critical stakeholders. Patient advisory groups and referral centers form a critical entry point and represent end users in the research pipeline, and the development of patient cohorts and recruitment into observational studies or clinical trials is facilitated by dedicated centers that participate in organized networks. Obstacles in RRD trial design include small sample sizes, chronicity, and limited effects over time, and emerging techniques include adaptive designs, N-of-1 and crossover trials, the incorporation of diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, and clinical surrogate markers.

### Defining the time-limited trial for patients with critical illness: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^114fByMq]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2024). High credibility.

Time-limited trial in critical care — essential elements include, with the patient and/or surrogate(s), to discuss the patient's goals and priorities, including what is an acceptable level of recovery after acute critical illness, and discuss estimates of the patient's prognosis, including level of uncertainty. Plan steps are to meet with the patient and/or surrogate(s) to discuss a time-limited trial and define trial guidelines: (1) Planned duration (2) Clinical criteria of improvement and/or deterioration; discuss which therapies are acceptable to the patient during the trial, discuss potential decisions to be made at the end of the trial, provide an opportunity for the patient and/or surrogate to agree or decline to participate in the trial, schedule a future meeting with the patient and/or surrogate(s) to discuss the patient's response to therapy, and document the meeting and plans in the health record. Support actions are to disseminate plans to entire interprofessional care team + whenever staffing rotation occurs, update patient and/or surrogate(s) about major changes in the patient's condition, and reconsider plans if necessary due to major changes in the patient's condition. Reassessment involves meeting with the patient and/or surrogate(s) and using clinical criteria to assess the patient's response to therapy, considering potential decisions — (1) Continue care focused on recovery (e.g., if the patient is improving), (2) Transition to care focused exclusively on comfort, (3) Extend the trial for a newly agreed-upon duration — and documenting assessment and next steps in the health record. Potentially beneficial steps to consider are to determine if additional interprofessional intensive care unit team members or other healthcare teams should be involved in the consider/plan phases, including longitudinal healthcare teams (e.g., primary care, oncology, surgery), specialty palliative care, and new consultant teams from current hospitalization, and during the plan phase, elicit preferences from the patient and/or surrogate about how they would like to communicate over the course of the trial.

### Key design considerations for adaptive clinical trials: a primer for clinicians [^115Nwwpg]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Decision rules

Decision rules are prespecified before starting the trial. The most common types are mathematical expressions for terminating treatment arms or the trial and modifications of the allocation ratio between treatments. Other decision rules include preset quantitative criteria for re-estimating the sample size or narrowing patient eligibility or picking new arms to best inform a dose-response model (box 2).

Investigators must also consider which outcomes will be evaluated for decision rules and what effect the choice of outcome has on the properties of the design; for example, risk of false positive "enrichment". To determine the adequacy of the outcomes used for the decision rules, the clinical relevance and time required to measure the outcome are essential. The outcome for the decision rule should be clinically important and sufficiently correlated with at least one of the trial's primary outcomes. If the outcome fails to meet these criteria, the clinical merit and statistical robustness of any trial adaptation is likely to be inadequate. The time required to observe the outcome, and therefore collect sufficient interim data, should be short enough that efficiency, ethical gains, or both can be achieved with adaptations before the trial is terminated. For example, if one year progression free survival is used to inform response adaptive randomisation in a trial that enrols patients over two years, the time required to collect, clean, and analyse enough information to support an interim trial adaptation is so substantial that only a small proportion (the last 25%) of enrolled patients may benefit from this adaptation and no real efficiency gains will be realised. By contrast, an outcome such as three month tumour response may facilitate the collection of sufficient data to inform early adaptations but may lack sufficient correlation with the primary outcome (such as full trial duration overall survival). Six month progression free survival may strike a more appropriate balance between time to collect and robustness.

Transparency is key to decision rules and adaptive trial designs. The outcome used as a decision rule to inform an adaptation should be clear, as should the justification for the outcome and the decision rules. Moreover, decision rules should be easy to implement and implement, to avoid practical adaptation that may impose bias. If the trial is planned for regulatory approval, further considerations should ensure that the decision rules are also non-binding. That is, whether a decision rule is enforced should not affect statistical properties such as type I error. Multiple sophisticated statistical and economic decision rules to accommodate optimal adaptations have been described in detail elsewhere.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^114j181a]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Consensus methodology — topic selection, development, outline formulation, and literature search — states that topics are chosen for clinical importance due to high incidence or prevalence, emergence of new or conflicting evidence, uncertainty in management, or significant variations in practice, and that Clinical Consensus topics have a narrow scope with one to two focused clinical questions or issues. The development process typically spans 12–18 months and is led by two committee member authors who draft the outline, synthesize evidence, develop recommendations, and author the manuscript, with scheduled conference calls with ACOG staff and frequent electronic communication, and committee review culminating in final approval. For outlines, a formal topic outline uses PICOTS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Time, and Setting), incorporates health equity using the PROGRESS Plus tool, and may consult clinical and methodologic experts and conduct a scoping search, with the Clinical Consensus Committee reviewing, revising as necessary, and providing final approval. Literature search procedures specify identifying literature in ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsychInfo, performed by ACOG staff medical librarians using reference manager software, with prior references reviewed when revising documents and exclusion of studies that do not meet the PICOTS criteria or are outside the scope.

### Randomized trials stopped early for benefit: a systematic review [^111u37od]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that stop earlier than planned because of apparent benefit often receive great attention and affect clinical practice. Their prevalence, the magnitude and plausibility of their treatment effects, and the extent to which they report information about how investigators decided to stop early are, however, unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the epidemiology and reporting quality of RCTs involving interventions stopped early for benefit.

Data Sources

Systematic review up to November 2004 of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and full-text journal content databases to identify RCTs stopped early for benefit.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of any intervention reported as having stopped early because of results favoring the intervention. There were no exclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Twelve reviewers working independently and in duplicate abstracted data on content area and type of intervention tested, reporting of funding, type of end point driving study termination, treatment effect, length of follow-up, estimated sample size and total sample studied, role of a data and safety monitoring board in stopping the study, number of interim analyses planned and conducted, and existence and type of monitoring methods, statistical boundaries, and adjustment procedures for interim analyses and early stopping.

Data Synthesis

Of 143 RCTs stopped early for benefit, the majority (92) were published in 5 high-impact medical journals. Typically, these were industry-funded drug trials in cardiology, cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS. The proportion of all RCTs published in high-impact journals that were stopped early for benefit increased from 0.5% in 1990–1994 to 1.2% in 2000–2004 (P < .001 for trend). On average, RCTs recruited 63% (SD, 25%) of the planned sample and stopped after a median of 13 (interquartile range [IQR], 3–25) months of follow-up, 1 interim analysis, and when a median of 66 (IQR, 23–195) patients had experienced the end point driving study termination (event). The median risk ratio among truncated RCTs was 0.53 (IQR, 0.28–0.66). One hundred thirty-five (94%) of the 143 RCTs did not report at least 1 of the following: the planned sample size (n = 28), the interim analysis after which the trial was stopped (n = 45), whether a stopping rule informed the decision (n = 48), or an adjusted analysis accounting for interim monitoring and truncation (n = 129). Trials with fewer events yielded greater treatment effects (odds ratio, 28; 95% confidence interval, 11–73).

Conclusions

RCTs stopped early for benefit are becoming more common, often fail to adequately report relevant information about the decision to stop early, and show implausibly large treatment effects, particularly when the number of events is small. These findings suggest clinicians should view the results of such trials with skepticism.

Time-limited trial in critical care — essential elements and phased process were derived through a Delphi process: investigators "identified 18 potential steps" and found first-round consensus that "11 of these were essential elements"; during the second round, they "identified seven additional essential elements". The committee then "combined 4 related items into two steps (to reach 16 essential elements)" and "organized steps into four phases of care: consider, plan, support, and reassess". Additional steps "may be helpful in some cases, but not necessary for all trials", and involvement of other disciplines is "highly dependent on a patient's specific situation and on the available hospital resources".

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^112J6Lfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guideline methodology — evidence selection prioritized acceptable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of effectiveness, with prophylaxis populations excluding those who had reported COVID-19 infection; if acceptable RCTs were found, no additional non-randomized or non-comparative single-arm evidence was sought, while single-arm data were included only when a historical control event rate could be estimated and conflicts were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Reviewers used a standardized form to extract data, calculating risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and for continuous outcomes calculated either mean and standard deviation or standard mean difference; where applicable, data were pooled using a random effects model, with a fixed effects model for two or fewer trials or pooling of rates, and results were presented in RevMan forest plots. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; within GRADE, certainty could be reduced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias, and could be strengthened by large or very large effects, a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding, with summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Outcomes used for decision-making may change as higher-quality direct evidence becomes available; for example, at the time of the first guideline clinical improvement outcomes such as need for mechanical ventilation were not reported, only radiographic findings.

### A key to T1D prevention: screening and monitoring relatives as part of clinical care [^112eK9B2]. Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2019 report of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrating that immune therapy can delay the onset of clinical type 1 diabetes (T1D) in antibody-positive relatives by a median of 2 years stands out as a landmark in the decades-long effort to prevent T1D. With this important step achieved, it is now time to consider what is needed to bring disease-modifying therapy for prevention or delay of T1D to clinical use from this point. Long considered a chicken and egg problem (why screen for T1D risk when we have no therapy, and how can we develop therapies without more screening), we now have the opportunity to break this impasse. The purpose of this article is to place this clinical trial result in context, highlighting key foundational studies leading to this accomplishment, addressing the current gaps, and suggesting that a key next step for prevention of T1D is to screen and monitor relatives for T1D risk in the context of clinical care.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^112rvLPb]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

KDIGO guideline — GRADE system for grading quality of evidence outlines a three-step approach: Step 1 assigns a starting grade by study design (Randomized trials = High; Observational study = Low; Any other evidence = Very Low). Step 2 reduces the grade for specified concerns: Study quality −1 level if serious limitations, −2 levels if very serious limitations; Consistency −1 level if important inconsistency; Directness −1 level if some uncertainty, −2 levels if major uncertainty; and Other −1 level if sparse or imprecise data and −1 level if high probability of reporting bias. Step 3 raises the grade when applicable: Strength of association +1 level if strong (no plausible confounders) or +2 levels if very strong (no major threats to validity), and Other +1 level if evidence of a dose–response gradient or if all residual plausible confounders would have reduced the observed effect. Definitions specify that strong evidence is a significant relative risk of > 2 (< 0.5) from consistent observational evidence with no plausible confounders; very strong evidence is a significant relative risk of > 5 (< 0.2) based on direct evidence with no major threats to validity; sparse evidence includes only one study or total N < 500; imprecision includes a low event rate (0 or 1 event) in either arm or a confidence interval spanning a range > 1. Final grades are defined as: High = further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of the effect; Moderate = further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate; Low = further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate; Very Low = any estimate of effect is very uncertain.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence quality assessment — Under GRADE, the quality of evidence is influenced by "study design, risk of bias, consistency, precision, directness, and publication bias", with randomized trials "presumed to be high in quality, unless compromised", and observational studies "considered to be low in quality by default but can be 'rated up' by demonstrating a large magnitude of effect, a dose–response, or results that would be even more compelling if plausible confounders are taken into account". Table factors for rating down include "Risk of bias", "Heterogeneity", "Imprecision", "Indirectness", and "Publication bias", and for rating up include "Magnitude of effect", "Dose–response", and "Plausible confounding effect", with example comments such as "Unclear allocation concealment, incomplete blinding, selective reporting of results, incomplete accounting of outcomes", "Inconsistent results across studies", "Confidence intervals range from substantial benefit to little or no benefit", and "Studies showing negative or conflicting results may exist but are missing from the literature".

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^116j6cv3]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Palliative care — time-limited trial (TLT) initiation and team roles are outlined as follows: To proceed with a TLT, initiate the following steps: Define and communicate the patient's clinical problems and prognoses; Clarify the patient's personal values, goals of care, and quality of life priorities; Identify realistic objective markers that constitute clinical improvement or deterioration; Suggest and agree upon a time frame for reassessment and reevaluation; and Define clear expectations and the plan of action at the end of the TLT. Ideally, one or two providers take ownership of the TLT process to ensure smooth communication and build trust with the family, and the palliative care team can be effective in facilitating the TLT discussion and providing additional expertise in communication skills and bereavement support for families and providers.

Statistical methods — outcomes

Item 20a: Statistical methods for analysing primary and secondary outcomes. Reference to where other details of the statistical analysis plan can be found, if not in the protocol

Explanation

The protocol should indicate explicitly each intended analysis comparing study groups. An unambiguous, complete, and transparent description of statistical methods facilitates execution, replication, critical appraisal, and the ability to track any changes from the original pre-specified methods.

Results for the primary outcome can be substantially affected by the choice of analysis methods. When investigators apply more than one analysis strategy for a specific primary outcome, there is potential for inappropriate selective reporting of the most interesting result. The protocol should prespecify the main ("primary") analysis of the primary outcome (Item 12), including the analysis methods to be used for statistical comparisons (Items 20a and 20b); precisely which trial participants will be included (Item 20c); and how missing data will be handled (Item 20c). Additionally, it is helpful to indicate the effect measure (eg, relative risk) and significance level that will be used, as well as the intended use of confidence intervals when presenting results.

The same considerations will often apply equally to prespecified secondary and exploratory outcomes. In some instances, descriptive approaches to evaluating rare outcomes such as adverse events — might be preferred over formal analysis given the lack of power. Adequately powered analyses may require preplanned meta-analyses with results from other studies.

Most trials are affected to some extent by multiplicity issues. When multiple statistical comparisons are performed (eg, multiple study groups, outcomes, interim analyses), the risk of false positive (type 1) error is inflated and there is increased potential for selective reporting of favourable comparisons in the final trial report. For trials with more than two study groups, it is important to specify in the protocol which comparisons (of two or more study groups) will be performed and, if relevant, which will be the main comparison of interest. The same principle of specifying the main comparison also applies when there is more than one outcome, including when the same variable is measured at several time points (Item 12). Any statistical approaches to account for multiple comparisons and time points should also be described.

Finally, different trial designs dictate the most appropriate analysis plan and any additional relevant information that should be included in the protocol. For example, cluster, factorial, crossover, and within-person randomised trials require specific statistical considerations, such as how clustering will be handled in a cluster randomised trial.

### Factors that impact on recruitment to randomised trials in health care: a qualitative evidence synthesis [^114Q5rH5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomised trials (also referred to as 'randomised controlled trials' or 'trials') are the optimal way to minimise bias in evaluating the effects of competing treatments, therapies and innovations in health care. It is important to achieve the required sample size for a trial, otherwise trialists may not be able to draw conclusive results leading to research waste and raising ethical questions about trial participation. The reasons why potential participants may accept or decline participation are multifaceted. Yet, the evidence of effectiveness of interventions to improve recruitment to trials is not substantial and fails to recognise these individual decision-making processes. It is important to synthesise the experiences and perceptions of those invited to participate in randomised trials to better inform recruitment strategies.

Objectives

To explore potential trial participants' views and experiences of the recruitment process for participation. The specific objectives are to describe potential participants' perceptions and experiences of accepting or declining to participate in trials, to explore barriers and facilitators to trial participation, and to explore to what extent barriers and facilitators identified are addressed by strategies to improve recruitment evaluated in previous reviews of the effects of interventions including a Cochrane Methodology Review.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos, LILACS, PsycINFO, ORRCA, and grey literature sources. We ran the most recent set of searches for which the results were incorporated into the review in July 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies (with an identifiable qualitative component) that explored potential trial participants' experiences and perceptions of being invited to participate in a trial. We excluded studies that focused only on recruiters' perspectives, and trials solely involving children under 18 years, or adults who were assessed as having impaired mental capacity.

Data Collection and Analysis

Five review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified by the search. We used the CART (completeness, accuracy, relevance, timeliness) criteria to exclude studies that had limited focus on the phenomenon of interest. We used QSR NVivo to extract and manage the data. We assessed methodological limitations using the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We used thematic synthesis to analyse and synthesise the evidence. This provided analytical themes and a conceptual model. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. Our findings were integrated with two previous intervention effectiveness reviews by juxtaposing the quantitative and qualitative findings in a matrix.

Main Results

We included 29 studies (published in 30 papers) in our synthesis. Twenty-two key findings were produced under three broad themes (with six subthemes) to capture the experience of being invited to participate in a trial and making the decision whether to participate. Most of these findings had moderate to high confidence. We identified factors from the trial itself that influenced participation. These included how trial information was communicated, and elements of the trial such as the time commitment that might be considered burdensome. The second theme related to personal factors such as how other people can influence the individual's decision; and how a personal understanding of potential harms and benefits could impact on the decision. Finally, the potential benefits of participation were found to be key to the decision to participate, namely personal benefits such as access to new treatments, but also the chance to make a difference and help others. The conceptual model we developed presents the decision-making process as a gauge and the factors that influence whether the person will, or will not, take part.

Authors' Conclusions

This qualitative evidence synthesis has provided comprehensive insight into the complexity of factors that influence a person's decision whether to participate in a trial. We developed key questions that trialists can ask when developing their recruitment strategy. In addition, our conceptual model emphasises the need for participant-centred approaches to recruitment. We demonstrated moderate to high level confidence in our findings, which in some way can be attributed to the large volume of highly relevant studies in this field. We recommend that these insights be used to direct or influence or underpin future recruitment strategies that are developed in a participant-driven way that ultimately improves trial conduct and reduces research waste.

### Time to treatment benefit for adult patients with Fabry disease receiving agalsidase β: data from the Fabry registry [^117EK9UT]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Serum-mediated inhibition of ERTs is emerging as an important issue particularly in male patients with classic Fabry disease. No systematic evaluation of this issue was available for inclusion in the manuscript. Incompleteness of the data set for the temporary dose reduction period precluded a meaningful analysis of clinical events occurring after dose reductions. The focus of the current analyses was: (A) first severe clinical event in order to understand primary prevention associated with agalsidase β treatment; (B) a time frame of up to 5 years on agalsidase β, as the number of patients treated for longer than 5 years was very low; and (C) patients treated with the approved dose and formulation of agalsidase β. Further research is needed to understand outcomes for longer periods of time or other doses/formulations of ERT. A major strength of this analysis is that it represents the largest longitudinal follow-up data set and evaluation of time-to-event analysis for severe clinical events in adult patients with Fabry disease treated with agalsidase β.

In conclusion, the occurrence of severe clinical events in patients with Fabry disease decreases after the first 6 months of initiation of treatment with agalsidase β. This is in contrast to the expected increase in events due to ageing. Interestingly, the decrease in the incidence of severe clinical events with time on agalsidase β was most conspicuous for those populations at greater risk of events because of older age or male gender. These observations are also consistent with a delayed benefit after initiation of agalsidase β in patients with Fabry disease, which is similar to the time needed to clear vascular endothelial cells of GL-3 deposits with ERT. Although the small number of events precluded further subgroup analysis, older age (≥ 40 years) at initiation of treatment was associated with more advanced disease. The apparent clinical benefit of ERT for serious clinical events was observed even in patients with more advanced disease, supporting prior clinical trial resultsand providing an alternative perspective to recent recommendations for withholding ERT in patients with more advanced disease. Time-to-event analysis will be important in future studies that compare different doses or preparations of ERT, or other modalities for treating Fabry disease.

### Evidence-based medicine for every day, everyone, and every therapeutic study [^116sEpzy]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

The rapid growth in published medical literature makes it difficult for clinicians to keep up with advances in their fields. This may result in a cursory scan of the abstract and conclusion of a study without critically evaluating study quality. The application of evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the process of converting the abstract task of reading the literature into a practical method of using the literature to inform care in a specific clinical context while simultaneously expanding one's knowledge. EBM involves 4 steps: (1) stating the clinical problem in a defined question; (2) searching the literature for the evidence; (3) critically appraising the evidence for its validity; and (4) applying the evidence in the context of the patient's situation, preferences, and values. In this review, we use the recently published trial of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis as an example and systematically go through the steps of assessing internal validity, precision, and external validity. Muscle Nerve 58: 486–496, 2018.

### Bayesian strategy selection identifies optimal solutions to complex problems using an example from GP prescribing [^116MojRA]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Another aspect to be mindful of is that Thompson sampling trades between the type-1 error rate and statistical power, implying that to achieve a greater statistical power (relative to a same sample-size equal allocation trial), it is likely to inflate the type-1 error rate. By not trying the null strategy sufficiently, the type-1 error rate may exceed the acceptable threshold. Thus it is judicious to monitor the type-1 error rate and if it exceeds the significance level, adjustments may be required in the allocation algorithm. Recent workis starting to explore adaptive sampling approaches that can control the type-1 error rate, and further work is required to develop such techniques for a Thompson sampling setting.

We did not assess intervention fidelity, that is, whether the intervention was delivered as conceived and in accordance with the materials and instructions provided to participants. Given that the aims were to measure the effectiveness of the strategies in supporting GP-patient interactions where physical activity was discussed, failure to implement the strategies in consultations was ultimately what was tested, in essence assessing the utility of each strategy.

This case study has demonstrated an efficient process providing clear results in a short period of time. Further work should develop methods to understand interactions and sequencing of various and multiple combinations of interventions. Subsequent lines of investigation should also begin to consider the question of fidelity. Given this study demonstrates a process for supporting conversations about PA between GPs and patients, an important next step is to examine the quality and content of those conversations and their impact on measured patient PA.

While the reasons for low incidence of GP patient interaction about PA are complex, these interactions occur in a relatively stable setting with a clear, well-defined outcomes. Further work on other complex problems in similarly well-defined domains, or further investigations of the GP-patient relationship in expanded settings (i.e. with greater numbers of prioritised actions, or broader participant groups) represent exciting directions for future work.

The new frontier of public health is not what behaviours need to change, but rather how to change them. This study shows how new methods can be used to test and optimise implementation of intervention in multiple settings by engaging key actors in a system and moving quickly to the best set of interventions. For PA specifically, data suggested more than 80% of adults visit their GP at least once per year. Rapid identification of appropriate strategies that increase the discussion of PA between GPs and their patients provides new potential avenues for the improvement of public health.

### Approaches to phase 1 clinical trial design focused on safety, efficiency, and selected patient populations: a report from the clinical trial design task force of the national cancer institute investigational drug steering committee [^1166b4u2]. Clinical Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

The goals and objectives of phase 1 clinical trials are changing to include further evaluation of endpoints such as molecular targeted effects, in addition to dose-toxicity profile of the investigational agent. Because of these changes in focus, the National Cancer Institute and Investigational Drug Steering Committee's Task Force on Clinical Trial Design met to evaluate the most efficient ways to design and implement early clinical trials with novel therapeutics. Clinical approaches discussed included the conventional 3 + 3 cohort expansion phase 1 design, multi-institutional phase 1 studies, accelerated titration designs, continual reassessment methods, the study of specific target patient populations, and phase 0 studies. Each of these approaches uniquely contributes to some aspect of the phase 1 study, with all focused on dose and schedule determination, patient safety, and limited patient exposure to ineffective doses of investigational agent. The benefit of labor-intensive generation of preliminary biomarker evidence of target inhibition, as well as the value of molecular profiling of the study population, is considered. New drug development is expensive and the failure rate remains high. By identifying patient populations expected to respond to the study agent and tailoring the treatment with a novel drug, investigators will be one step closer to personalizing cancer treatment. The "fail early and fast" approach is acceptable if the appropriate patient population is evaluated in the phase 1 trial. The approaches outlined in this overview address the merits, advantages, disadvantages, and obstacles encountered during first in human studies.

### SPIRIT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for protocols of randomised trials [^1122zJuG]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Box 5
Need for a separate document to describe restricted randomisation

If some type of restricted randomisation approach is to be used, in particular blocked randomisation or minimisation, then knowledge of the specific details could lead to bias. For example, if the trial protocol for a two arm, parallel group trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio states that blocked randomisation will be used and the block size will be six, then trial implementers know that the intervention assignments will balance every six participants. Thus, if intervention assignments become known after assignment, knowing the block size will allow trial implementers to anticipate when equality of the sample sizes will arise. A sequence can be discerned from the pattern of past assignments, and then some future assignments could be accurately predicted. For example, if part of a sequence contained two As and three Bs, trial implementers would know that the last assignment in the sequence would be an A. If the first three assignments in a sequence contained three As, trial implementers would know that the last three assignments in that sequence would be three Bs. Selection bias could result, regardless of the effectiveness of allocation concealment (item 22).

Selection bias is mainly a problem in open label trials where everyone becomes aware of the intervention after assignment. It can also be a problem in trials where everyone is supposedly blinded (masked), but the blinding is ineffective, or the harms from the intervention provide clues such that treatments can be guessed.

We recommend that trial investigators do not provide full details of a restricted randomisation scheme (including minimisation) in the trial protocol. Knowledge of these details might undermine randomisation by facilitating deciphering of the allocation sequence. Instead, this specific information should be provided in a separate document with restricted access. However, simple randomisation procedures could be reported in detail in the protocol because simple randomisation is perfectly unpredictable.

Simple randomisation (unrestricted randomisation) can be specified in the main body of the protocol because it is perfectly unpredictable. Its use does not require a separate document.

Summary of key elements to address

Type of randomisation: simple versus restricted (eg, blocked), fixed versus adaptive (eg, minimisation), and, when relevant, the reasons for such choices
If applicable, factors (eg, recruitment site, sex, disease stage) to be used for stratification, including categories and relevant cut-off boundaries
For restricted randomisation, aside from the above: all other details on restriction (including minimisation) should be provided in a separate document to reduce predictability of the random sequence.

### Improving the reporting of clinical trials of infertility treatments (IMPRINT): modifying the CONSORT statement [^115rMaHA]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Medium credibility.

IMPRINT modifications to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) for infertility trials specify to "Characterize how infertility factors in male and female participants were evaluated, describe the definitions used, any preconception screening, and from which participants informed consents were obtained", to "State the duration of the intervention noting when the treatment started and concluded" and "State the temporal relation of the intervention to randomization and pregnancy", and to "Clearly define the primary outcome", with "Reporting live birth (defined as a delivery at ≥ 20 weeks' gestation) is preferred (including gestational age, birthweight, and sex of infant)" and, "When more than one cycle occurs or frozen embryos are transferred, the preferred outcome is cumulative live birth per woman"; "Secondary pregnancy outcomes that merit reporting are serum pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy (≥ 12 weeks), multiple pregnancy, and an accounting of all pregnancy losses", while "Both male and female outcomes, other than live birth, could be the primary outcome and should be justified" and "When live birth is not the primary end point and infertility treatment is given (for example, embryos are transferred), live birth should still be reported". Results reporting should "Report the numbers of couples who were screened and eligible", baseline data should "State the duration of infertility (including whether it is primary or secondary), relevant obstetrical history, and cause of infertility in women and men", and analysis should follow "The preferred unit of analysis is per randomized individual/couple (not cycles or oocytes/embryos) for a specified period of time (preferably displayed with life table analysis). If per-cycle analysis is used, it should be justified and must account for individuals receiving multiple cycles". Multiple pregnancy reporting should "Clearly describe what happens to all multiple pregnancies, including fetal reduction and vanishing gestations. Report multiple pregnancy outcome both per woman and per pregnancy. Separate out twin/triplets/quads/etc". Harms reporting should "Report all important harms or unintended effects in each group (men, women, infants) during treatment (including both male and female partners), during pregnancy, and around birth, and in infants after birth", and "Reportable harms include ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, infection, bleeding, multiple pregnancy (see also item 16) and maternal pregnancy complications, and harms or unintended effects on the fetus/newborn, including congenital abnormalities, and major neonatal complications as well as infant developmental delays or medical problems". Interpretation should "Balance outcomes and any competing interests of female and male participants and infant".

### Defining the time-limited trial for patients with critical illness: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^117JMNAL]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2024). High credibility.

Table 4: Prioritized future questions for time-limited trials in critical care outlines key unanswered questions by stakeholder. For patients, surrogates, and families, questions address perspectives on the concept, best communication wording, benefits and harms, ensuring a collaborative process centered on the patient's perspective, participation factors, and effects on trust in clinicians and health systems. For interprofessional clinicians who care for critically ill patients, questions are grouped by "Consider phase", "Plan phase", "Support phase", and "Reassess phase", and address identifying appropriate patients, uncertainty, determining and tailoring duration, clinical criteria of improvement and/or deterioration, documentation, dissemination across large teams and staffing rotations, defining major changes warranting reconsideration, and addressing unanticipated changes or rotational revisits to plans. For health systems, questions focus on supporting optimal implementation, impacts on health systems, and ensuring systemic biases do not propagate inequities.

### Defining the time-limited trial for patients with critical illness: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^112cr3ak]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2024). High credibility.

Section 3: Collaborative planning and clear communication during a time-limited trial describes a Delphi process defining roles for three elements of a time-limited trial (the clinical criteria of improvement and deterioration, the duration, and the acceptable degree of recovery or the clinical outcome at the end of the trial). Participants rated each element on a scale of 1 through 9, with 1 representing an element that should be exclusively determined by clinicians and 9 representing an element that should be exclusively determined by the patient and/or surrogate(s). Category labels shown are "Clinicians should primarily determine", "Patient/surrogate and clinicians should collaboratively determine", and "Patient/surrogate should primarily determine". The figure labels mean ratings and variability as "Mean rating 2.9 (SD 1.9)", "Mean rating 3.8 (SD 1.6)", and "Mean rating 6.3 (SD 2.0)".

### Assessing treatment efficacy in the subset of responders in a randomized clinical trial [^112E12ED]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Durability of response is a clinically relevant dimension of the treatment effect in randomized clinical trials; it is often measured by comparing among the responders the duration of response between the treatment arms. However, since the comparison groups are defined by response (a post-randomization event), it is subject to analysis-by-responder bias, especially if the proportion of responders differs between the arms.

Methods

Two simple methods are developed that use tumor shrinkage measurements in order to lessen analysis-by-responder bias by generating more comparable patient subsets in the control and experimental arms of the trial. These subsets are then used to estimate between-arm differences in response duration. In the subtraction method, responding patients with the least tumor shrinkage in the treatment arm with more responders are removed from the patient subset for that arm. In the addition method, non-responding patients with the most tumor shrinkage in the treatment arm with fewer responders are added to the patient subset for that arm. In both methods, the numbers of patients subtracted or added are such that the proportion of patients in the modified patient subset is the same as the proportion of responders in the other treatment arm.

Results

The methods are demonstrated on a hypothetical dataset where they are shown to eliminate analysis-by-responder bias, and on two published analyses of randomized trials that compared the duration of response between the treatment arms.

Conclusions

The proposed methods can lessen the analysis-by-responder bias. These methods to compare duration of response between treatment arms may provide a useful exploratory analysis to measure treatment efficacy among responders.

### Potential impact on estimated treatment effects of information lost to follow-up in randomised controlled trials (LOST-IT): systematic review [^1146nwKV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the reporting, extent, and handling of loss to follow-up and its potential impact on the estimates of the effect of treatment in randomised controlled trials.

Design

Systematic review. We calculated the percentage of trials for which the relative risk would no longer be significant under a number of assumptions about the outcomes of participants lost to follow-up.

Data Sources

Medline search of five top general medical journals, 2005–07.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that reported a significant binary primary patient important outcome.

Results

Of the 235 eligible reports identified, 31 (13%) did not report whether or not loss to follow-up occurred. In reports that did give the relevant information, the median percentage of participants lost to follow-up was 6% (interquartile range 2–14%). The method by which loss to follow-up was handled was unclear in 37 studies (19%); the most commonly used method was survival analysis (66, 35%). When we varied assumptions about loss to follow-up, results of 19% of trials were no longer significant if we assumed no participants lost to follow-up had the event of interest, 17% if we assumed that all participants lost to follow-up had the event, and 58% if we assumed a worst case scenario (all participants lost to follow-up in the treatment group and none of those in the control group had the event). Under more plausible assumptions, in which the incidence of events in those lost to follow-up relative to those followed-up is higher in the intervention than control group, results of 0% to 33% trials were no longer significant.

Conclusion

Plausible assumptions regarding outcomes of patients lost to follow-up could change the interpretation of results of randomised controlled trials published in top medical journals.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^114Q4RMC]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis guideline — introduction describes that osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 302 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of disability among older adults, with the knees, hips, and hands the most commonly affected appendicular joints. OA is characterized by whole-joint pathology including cartilage degradation, bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, and synovial inflammation, leading to pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of normal joint function. Patients with OA are likely to be treated with a number of different pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions, often in combination, and while some principles apply to all patients, some recommendations are specific to particular joints such as the hip, knee, patellofemoral joint, and first carpometacarpal joint (CMC), or to particular patient populations such as those with erosive OA.

### Iterative quality improvement can occur faster than one element at a time [^111sZFZi]. The American Psychologist (2013). Low credibility.

Responds to the comments by S. Hamby and J. Grych (see record 2013-31242-011) on the current authors' original article, "Disruptive innovations for designing and diffusing evidence-based interventions" (see record 2012-10813-001). Hamby and Grych implied that the careful and systematic testing of one element at a time is a prerequisite to its application in service contexts. This is certainly one valid approach to generating such evidence and follows the dominant paradigm of current scientific norms. In fact, it would partially contribute to a more molecular and theory-based understanding of intervention efficacy than we currently have; however, we believe that the choice to apply elements of an intervention or to study them first is a false dichotomy given the real-world complexities of behavioral interventions, ongoing need for interventions to impact families currently in need, and funding environments.

### Estimation of study time reduction using surrogate end points rather than overall survival in oncology clinical trials [^116Luoeu]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Surrogate end points in oncology trade the advantage of reducing the time needed to conduct clinical trials for the disadvantage of greater uncertainty regarding the treatment effect on patient-centered end points, such as overall survival (OS) and quality of life.

Objective

To quantify the amount of time saved through the acceptance of surrogate end points, including response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective study of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oncology approvals and their drug registration trials based on actual publication analyzed the original and updated clinical trials data that led to FDA-approved drug indications in oncology from 2006 to 2017 by using existing publications, conference abstracts, and package inserts from the FDA. Data related to cancer type, line of therapy (first-line, second-line, and third- or later-line treatment of advanced or metastatic disease), FDA approval type, end point basis for approval (RR, PFS, or OS/quality of life), sample size, accrual rate, and drug RR were extracted by March 23, 2018. All data were analyzed by July 13, 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was the study duration needed to complete the primary end point analysis used for each drug indication approval. This was estimated from reported enrollment dates, analysis cutoff dates, time to response, median duration of response, median PFS, and median OS.

Results

In total, 188 distinct indications among 107 cancer drugs were identified. The RR was more often used for FDA approval in subsequent lines of therapy (17 of 71 drug indications [24%] in first-line therapy vs 34 of 77 drug indications [44%] in second-line therapy vs 19 of 24 drug indications [79%] in third- or later-line therapy, P < .001). Study duration for PFS (median, 31 [range, 10–104] months) was similar to that for OS (median, 33 [range, 12–117] months; P = 0.31), whereas study duration for RR (median, 25 [range, 11–54] months) was shorter than that for OS (P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, compared with using OS, use of PFS as the end point was associated with study durations that were shorter by a mean of 11 months (95% CI, 5–17 months), and the use of RR as the end point was associated with study durations that were shorter by a mean of 19 months (95% CI, 13–25 months).

Conclusions and Relevance

From the findings of this study, an estimated 11 months appeared to be needed (ie, approximately 12% longer in the drug development cycle) to assess the OS benefit of a cancer drug. This study's findings suggest that this must be weighed against the downside of increased uncertainty of clinical benefit arising from using surrogate end points.

### SPIRIT 2013 explanation and elaboration: guidance for protocols of clinical trials [^117D4YLW]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Statistical methods — additional analyses

Item 20b: Methods for any additional analyses (eg, subgroup and adjusted analyses)

Explanation

Subgroup analysis

Subgroup analyses explore whether estimated treatment effects vary significantly between subcategories of trial participants. As these data can help tailor healthcare decisions to individual patients, a modest number of prespecified subgroup analyses can be sensible.

However, subgroup analyses are problematic if they are inappropriately conducted or selectively reported. Subgroup analyses described in protocols or grant applications do not match those reported in subsequent publications for more than two thirds of randomised trials, suggesting that subgroup analyses are often selectively reported or not prespecified. Post hoc (data driven) analyses have a high risk of spurious findings and are discouraged. Conducting a large number of subgroup comparisons leads to issues of multiplicity, even when all of the comparisons have been pre-specified. Furthermore, when subgroups are based on variables measured after randomisation, the analyses are particularly susceptible to bias.

Preplanned subgroup analyses should be clearly specified in the protocol with respect to the precise baseline variables to be examined, the definition of the subgroup categories (including cut-off boundaries for continuous or ordinal variables), the statistical method to be used, and the hypothesised direction of the subgroup effect based on plausibility.

Adjusted analysis

Some trials prespecify adjusted analyses to account for imbalances between study groups (eg, chance imbalance across study groups in small trials), improve power, or account for a known prognostic variable. Adjustment is often recommended for any variables used in the allocation process (eg, in stratified randomisation), on the principle that the analysis strategy should match the design. Most trial protocols and publications do not adequately address issues of adjustment, particularly the description of variables.

It is important that trial investigators indicate in the protocol if there is an intention to perform or consider adjusted analyses, explicitly specifying any variables for adjustment and how continuous variables will be handled. When both unadjusted and adjusted analyses are intended, the main analysis should be identified (Item 20a). It may not always be clear, in advance, which variables will be important for adjustment. In such situations, the objective criteria to be used to select variables should be prespecified. As with subgroup analyses, adjustment variables based on post-randomisation data rather than baseline data can introduce bias.

Statistical methods — analysis population and missing data

### Defining the time-limited trial for patients with critical illness: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^111vzyGY]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2024). High credibility.

Section 4: Potential challenges for time-limited trials in critical illness emphasizes that despite suggested benefits (alignment with patients' goals, improved therapeutic alliance, reduced decisional conflict), there is "a small evidence base for efficacy". The report notes the approach "has been tested in only one pre-post study of a quality improvement program focused on implementation", in which surrogates "experienced earlier and more frequent family meetings", but there was "no change in their satisfaction with medical care or amount of decision making conflict".

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111boYi6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Initial antiretroviral (ARV) treatment regimens — evidence sources and classification are outlined, emphasizing that information from randomized prospective clinical trials with adequate sample size that demonstrate that an ARV regimen produces high rates of viral suppression, increases CD4 count, and has a favorable safety profile to be the strongest evidence on which to base recommendations, and that comparative clinical trials of initial treatments generally are not designed to show significant differences in HIV-related clinical endpoints or survival, so assessment is primarily based on surrogate marker endpoints and the incidence and severity of adverse events. In some instances, the Panel recommends regimens that include ARV drugs approved by the FDA based on bioequivalence or relative bioavailability studies, and the Panel may also consider data from randomized switch studies; however, switch trials do not evaluate the ability of a drug or regimen to induce viral suppression; they only examine the drug or regimen's ability to maintain suppression, therefore results from switch trials may not be directly applicable to the selection of an initial regimen and should be considered in conjunction with other data, and in this section of the guidelines, the definition of an evidence rating of II is expanded to include supporting data from bioavailability/bioequivalence studies or randomized switch studies. When developing recommendations, the Panel also considers tolerability and toxicity profiles, pill burden and dosing frequency, drug interaction potential, cost and access, postmarketing safety data, observational cohort data published in peer-reviewed publications, the experience of clinicians who are actively engaged in patient care, and the views of community members. The Panel reviewed the available data to arrive at two classifications for initial ARV treatment regimens: Recommended Initial Regimens for Most People With HIV and Other Initial Antiretroviral Regimens for Certain Clinical Scenarios; Recommended Initial Regimens for Most People With HIV are those regimens with demonstrated durable virologic efficacy, favorable tolerability and toxicity profiles, and ease of use, while in certain clinical situations, other regimens may be preferred and examples are provided in Table 7. Many other ARV regimens are effective for initial therapy but have disadvantages compared with the regimens listed in Tables 6a and 6b and are no longer included; for people with HIV who have a suppressed viral load and are not experiencing any adverse effects while on a regimen that is not listed, changing to a regimen listed in Table 6a or 6b is not necessary, and clinicians should refer to Optimizing Antiretroviral Therapy in the Setting of Viral Suppression for further guidance if switching to a new regimen is desired. Several tables in these guidelines provide clinicians with guidance on selecting and prescribing an optimal regimen, including Table 7 on considerations based on specific clinical scenarios and ARV drug characteristics and Table 9 on the potential advantages and disadvantages of the different ARV drug components.

### Impact of missed treatment opportunities on outcomes in hospitalised patients with heart failure [^116xW9md]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Using data from the NHFA and evidence on the cost-effectiveness of relevant treatments, we have quantified the costs, in terms of forgone health, of the failure of the NHS to adhere to guidelines to prescribe ACEi and BBs following hospitalisation for HF from 2010 to 2013. In 2010, there were 4019 patients not receiving optimal therapy in England and Wales (both ACEi and BBs if not contraindicated), rising to 4886 patients in 2013. If all these patients had been treated optimally, the NHS would have gained 1569 QALYs in 2010 or 1698 QALYs in 2013. These represent real losses in population health. The study also considered the cost-effectiveness of potential implementation strategies if they had been used in 2013. If a study could have achieved an increase in utilisation of 5% over 1 year it would have been worth spending up to £6.73 million on it, increasing to £31.44 million if the increase could have been sustained over 5 years.

The study has a number of strengths. First, it shows the value of clinical audits in understanding historical failure in following recommended clinical practice. Second, it shows how this evidence can be combined with external evidence on the cost-effectiveness of recommended practice to estimate the health losses of this failure. By quantifying these benefits it is possible to demonstrate how much the NHS has lost and also how much it could afford to invest to rectify poor adherence while still representing a cost-effective use of NHS resources. Third, the study has appropriately taken into account that some patients are contraindicated to particular treatments, and that a failure to receive these interventions does not mean patients are receiving suboptimal therapy. Failure to account for contraindications would have resulted in an underestimate of adherence to guidelines and, therefore, an overestimate of the potential benefits of improved utilisation. Finally, the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the treatments is taken from an economic model that has synthesised evidence from a number of different sources and made a number of assumptions. These are reported in detail elsewhere. This is the best evidence available on the costs and health outcomes associated with the use of these treatments in the NHS; but, as with all evidence, this is still subject to uncertainty.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline FOR the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C in chronic kidney disease [^114fZN62]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

KDIGO IgA vasculitis nephritis (IgAVN) — general management includes the following: Control blood pressure with a target of ≤ 120/70 mm Hg using a RASi as the first-choice drug intervention; measures to reduce glomerular hyperfiltration and the impact of proteinuria on the tubulointerstitium, using RASi and SGLT2i, singly or in combination; a thorough cardiovascular risk assessment and commencement of appropriate interventions, as necessary; and Offer participation in a clinical trial if one is available. The guideline notes there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the Oxford Classification MEST-C score to determine which drug should be commenced in patients with IgAVN, insufficient evidence to base treatment decisions on the presence and number of crescents in the kidney biopsy, and that the International IgAN Prediction Tools cannot be used to determine the likely impact of any particular treatment regimen. Dynamic assessment of patient risk over time should be performed, as decisions regarding immunosuppression may change.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Titration

The objective of dose titration is to identify an effective and tolerable maintenance dose for ongoing management of breakthrough cancer pain episodes. The effective and tolerable dose of LAZANDA will be determined by dose titration in individual patients.

Titration steps: If adequate analgesia is not achieved with the first 100 mcg dose, dose escalate in a step-wise manner over consecutive episodes of breakthrough pain until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved.

Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.

The titration steps should be:

Patients should confirm the dose of LAZANDA that works for them with a second episode of breakthrough pain and review their experience with their physicians to determine if that dose is appropriate, or whether a further adjustment is warranted.

The safety and efficacy of doses higher than 800 mcg have not been evaluated in clinical studies. Avoid the use of a combination of dose strengths to treat an episode as this may cause confusion and dosing errors.

In order to minimize the risk of LAZANDA-related adverse reactions and to identify the appropriate dose, it is imperative that patients be supervised closely by health professionals during the titration process.

Maintenance Therapy

Once an appropriate dose has been established, instruct patients to use that dose for each subsequent breakthrough cancer pain episode. Limit LAZANDA use to four or fewer doses per day.

Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.

During any episode of breakthrough cancer pain, if there is inadequate pain relief after 30 minutes following LAZANDA dosing or if a separate episode of breakthrough cancer pain occurs before the next dose of LAZANDA is permitted (i.e., within 2 hours), the patients may use a rescue medication as directed by their healthcare provider.

2.5 Dose Re-Adjustment

If the response (analgesia or adverse reactions) to the titrated LAZANDA dose markedly changes, an adjustment of dose may be necessary to ensure that an appropriate dose is maintained.

If more than four episodes of breakthrough pain are experienced per day, re-evaluate the dose of the long-acting opioid used for persistent underlying cancer pain. If the long-acting opioid or dose of long-acting opioid is changed, re-evaluate and re-titrate the LAZANDA dose as necessary to ensure the patient is on an appropriate dose.

Limit the use of LAZANDA to treat four or fewer episodes of breakthrough pain per day.

It is imperative that any dose re-titration is monitored carefully by a healthcare professional.

### Improving treatment of people with gastro-esophageal reflux disease refractory to proton pump inhibitors [^112ARiCu]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Call to action

Overall, the choice of whether or not to undergo surgery and the type of surgery that could offer the most benefit to an individual patient should be decided between the surgeon and the patient, taking into account not only the surgeon's experience but also the likelihood of side effects. We should avoid a blanket approach and seek to determine exactly what abnormalities are present and then consider carefully the treatments that specifically address the underlying abnormalities. Patient preferences and response to prior therapies should also be taken into accountbut we must be cautious that they are not misused as a barrier to surgical treatment.

We urge those responsible for the continuing care of these patients, such as primary care physicians and gastroenterologists, to remain aware that these surgical options exist and are constantly evolving, and to consider surgical referral in patients who have persistent symptoms caused by GERD despite correct prescribing of and adherence to PPI therapy. This patient group is not appropriately treated by long-term PPI medication, but they will only be identified if they are regularly and actively reviewed. Scientific societies also have a role to play in including newer surgical alternatives in their evidence guidelines, particularly as evidence continues to grow in terms of follow-up and larger patient groups.

In our view, patients with PPI-refractory reflux symptoms should be managed by interdisciplinary reflux teams that provide general and nutritional advice, specialized workup with the expertise of technicians and gastroenterologists, and input from upper gastrointestinal surgeons with sufficient experience in anti-reflux surgery. It has been shown that the number of anti-reflux procedures per year is crucial with respect to the overall safety profile of fundoplication. We strongly advocate the new endoscopic and surgical interventions to be introduced first in experienced centers. We firmly believe that a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and the identification of reason(s) for PPI failure will allow a tailored interventional therapy with a high rate of success and low risk for the patients.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^115ZQ7QM]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Classes of evidence — grading and adjudication for this policy are defined as follows: Two methodologists independently graded and assigned a preliminary Class of Evidence, with an article with design 1 representing the strongest study design and design 2 and design 3 representing respectively weaker designs; articles were graded on methodological features including randomization, blinding, allocation concealment, data collection, outcome assessment, biases, sample size, generalizability, data management, analyses, congruence of results and conclusions, and conflicts of interest. An adjudication process with the original methodologist graders and at least one additional methodologist addressed discordance and yielded a final Class of Evidence assignment of Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X; articles with fatal flaws or not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade X and were not used in formulating recommendations, although such content may inform background and expert consensus. Grading was question specific, so a single article could receive a different Class of Evidence rating for different critical questions, with question-specific grading located in the Evidentiary Table.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association class of recommendation and level of evidence — strength categories and phrasing are defined as follows: Class 1 (Strong) indicates Benefit > > > Risk with suggested phrases for writing recommendations that include "Is recommended", "Is indicated/useful/effective/beneficial", and "Should be performed/administered/other". Class 2a (Moderate) indicates Benefit > > Risk with suggested phrases that include "Is reasonable" and "Can be useful/effective/beneficial", with comparative-effectiveness phrasing such as "Treatment/strategy A is probably recommended/indicated in preference to treatment B" and "It is reasonable to choose treatment A over treatment B". Class 2b (Weak) indicates Benefit ≥ Risk with suggested phrases that include "May/might be reasonable", "May/might be considered", and "Usefulness/effectiveness is unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established". Class 3: No Benefit (Moderate) (Generally, LOE A or B use only) indicates Benefit = Risk with suggested phrases that include "Is not recommended", "Is not indicated/useful/effective/beneficial", and "Should not be performed/administered/other". Class 3: Harm (Strong) indicates Risk > Benefit with suggested phrases that include "Potentially harmful", "Causes harm", "Associated with excess morbidity/mortality", and "Should not be performed/administered/other". Levels of evidence are defined as Level A with "High-quality evidence from more than 1 RCT", "Meta-analyses of high-quality RCTs", and "One or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality registry studies"; Level B-R (Randomized) with "Moderate-quality evidence from 1 or more RCTs" and "Meta-analyses of moderate-quality RCTs"; Level B-NR (Nonrandomized) with "Moderate-quality evidence from 1 or more well-designed, well-executed nonrandomized studies, observational studies, or registry studies" and "Meta-analyses of such studies"; Level C-LD (Limited Data) with "Randomized or nonrandomized observational or registry studies with limitations of design or execution", "Meta-analyses of such studies", and "Physiological or mechanistic studies in human subjects"; and Level C-EO (Expert Opinion) with "Consensus of expert opinion based on clinical experience". The table further clarifies that "COR and LOE are determined independently (any COR may be paired with any LOE)" and that "A recommendation with LOE C does not imply that the recommendation is weak".

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^116QTzV7]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Medication selection and clinical considerations in osteoarthritis — for some patients with more limited disease in whom medication is required, topical NSAIDs represent an appropriate first choice, whereas for others, particularly with hip OA or polyarticular involvement, oral NSAIDs are more appropriate. The appropriate use of other oral agents, particularly acetaminophen and opioids, will continue to evolve. Despite the many options available, some patients may continue to experience inadequate symptom control, and clinicians treating patients in these circumstances should choose interventions with a low risk of harm; there are controversies in interpretation of the evidence, particularly with regard to the use of glucosamine and chondroitin, acupuncture, and intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older — evidence review scope and methods: Adults aged 60 years or older with a diagnosis of hypertension were studied. The interventions evaluated included treatment to higher (< 150 mm Hg) versus lower (≤ 140 mm Hg) SBP targets, with the comparator being less intensive BP treatment. Evaluated outcomes included all-cause mortality; cardiac events (myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death); morbidity and mortality related to stroke; and harms such as falls, fractures, syncope, functional status, hypotension, acute kidney injury (defined as the doubling of serum creatinine or need for renal replacement therapy), medication burden, and withdrawal due to adverse events. Outcomes were assessed in the long-term (> 6 months) for KQs 1, 2, and 3 and any time frame for KQs 4 and 5. Controlled study designs (randomized, controlled trials and nonrandomized, controlled trials) and cohort studies were included, whereas case reports; case series; randomized, controlled trials with less than 6-month follow-up; and controlled before-after studies were excluded. The reviewers conducted a meta-analysis on study-level data using the random-effects model and also conducted individual-patient data meta-analysis; study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and evidence graded using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality system. Searches covered EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from database inception through January 2015, MEDLINE through September 2016, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify studies that were in progress or unpublished.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112iyv6Z]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Track 1 (preferred) Step 3 for adults and adolescents: low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) — For adults and adolescents, the preferred Step 3 option is low-dose ICS-formoterol as both maintenance and reliever treatment (MART), with either budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol used for daily maintenance and as an anti-inflammatory reliever; low-dose ICS-formoterol can also be used before exercise and before expected allergen exposure. Before considering a step up, check for common problems such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and environmental exposures, and confirm that the symptoms are due to asthma. Double-blind studies included adult and adolescent patients with ≥ 1 exacerbation in the previous year despite maintenance low-dose ICS or ICS-LABA treatment, and open-label studies included patients taking at least low-dose ICS or ICS-LABA without requiring a history of exacerbations. Low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy reduced severe exacerbations and provided similar asthma control at relatively low ICS doses compared with a fixed dose of ICS-LABA maintenance or a higher dose of ICS, both with as-needed SABA (Evidence A), and in a meta-analysis switching from Step 3 treatment plus SABA reliever to MART was associated with a 29% reduced risk of severe exacerbation versus stepping up to Step 4 ICS-LABA maintenance plus SABA reliever and a 30% reduced risk versus staying on the same treatment with SABA reliever.

### Patient likelihood to repeat surgery after highly "Successful" hand procedures [^116cqdBL]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

It is not in the best interest of either the patient or the surgeon to undergo a surgery that will ultimately result in patient dissatisfaction. Future studies will be necessary to further ascertain the reasons for patient dissatisfaction, including analysis of ongoing symptoms, complications, and unmet expectations. Comparing patients treated nonoperatively and operatively may also yield further insights. This knowledge could provide insight into improving preoperative counseling, selecting better candidates for surgery, as well as finding ways to identify dissatisfied patients early in the postoperative course and potential offer an early intervention.

This study represents an important first step toward this goal by providing data which can be shared with patients during preoperative conversations. It is clear, however, that we still do not understand dissatisfied patients well enough. There is ample opportunity for qualitative research efforts to better determine what is driving this group of patients and why they are dissatisfied. Being able to accurately quantify patient satisfaction within a given setting is the important first step toward recognizing deficiencies and areas for improvement, understanding how to improve satisfaction, and ultimately increasing the value provided to patients through hand surgery.

### Eplerenone for hypertension [^116c6gYm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eplerenone is an aldosterone receptor blocker that is chemically derived from spironolactone. In Canada, it is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality for heart failure patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II systolic chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is also used as adjunctive therapy for patients with heart failure following myocardial infarction. Additionally, it is indicated for the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension for patients who cannot be treated adequately with other agents. It is important to determine the clinical impact of all antihypertensive medications, including aldosterone antagonists, to support their continued use in essential hypertension. No previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of eplerenone on cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and magnitude of blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of eplerenone monotherapy versus placebo for primary hypertension in adults. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular events (fatal or non fatal strokes), adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 3 March 2016. We handsearched references from retrieved studies to identify any studies missed in the initial search. We also searched for unpublished data by contacting the corresponding authors of the included studies and pharmaceutical companies involved in conducting studies on eplerenone monotherapy in primary hypertension. The search had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomized placebo-controlled trials studying adult patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies in people with secondary or gestational hypertension and studies where participants were receiving multiple antihypertensives.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. A fourth independent review author resolved discrepancies or disagreements. We performed data extraction and synthesis using a standardized format on Covidence. We conducted data analysis using Review Manager 5.

Main Results

A total of 1437 adult patients participated in the five randomized parallel group studies, with treatment durations ranging from 8 to 16 weeks. The daily doses of eplerenone ranged from 25 mg to 400 mg daily. Meta-analysis of these studies showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 9.21 mmHg (95% CI -11.08 to -7.34; I² = 58%) and a reduction of diastolic pressure of 4.18 mmHg (95% CI -5.03 to -3.33; I² = 0%) (moderate quality evidence). There may be a dose response effect for eplerenone in the reduction in systolic blood pressure at doses of 400 mg/day. However, this finding is uncertain, as it is based on a single included study with low quality evidence. Overall there does not appear to be a clinically important dose response in lowering systolic or diastolic blood pressure at eplerenone doses of 50 mg to 400 mg daily. There did not appear to be any differences in the number of patients who withdrew due to adverse events or the number of patients with at least one adverse event in the eplerenone group compared to placebo. However, only three of the five included studies reported adverse events. Most of the included studies were of moderate quality, as we judged multiple domains as being at unclear risk in the 'Risk of bias' assessment.

Authors' Conclusions

Eplerenone 50 to 200 mg/day lowers blood pressure in people with primary hypertension by 9.21 mmHg systolic and 4.18 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo, with no difference of effect between doses of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. A dose of 25 mg/day did not produce a statistically significant reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure and there is insufficient evidence for doses above 200 mg/day. There is currently no available evidence to determine the effect of eplerenone on clinically meaningful outcomes such as mortality or morbidity in hypertensive patients. The evidence available on side effects is insufficient and of low quality, which makes it impossible to draw conclusions about potential harm associated with eplerenone treatment in hypertensive patients.

### Optimizing practice through research: a new perspective to solve an old problem [^11454mg2]. Annals of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Policy makers, researchers, clinicians, and the public are frustrated that research in the health sciences has not resulted in a greater improvement in patient outcomes. Our experience as clinicians and researchers suggests that this frustration could be reduced if health sciences research were directed by 5 broad principles: (1) the needs of patients and populations determine the research agenda; (2) the research agenda addresses contextual and implementation issues, including the development of delivery and accountability systems; (3) the research agenda determines the research methods rather than methods determines the research agenda; (4) researchers and clinicians collaborate to define the research agenda, allocate resources, and implement findings; and (5) the level of funding for implementation research is commensurate with and proportional to the magnitude of the task. To keep the research agenda focused on the task of improving health and to acknowledge that the effort must be seen as more comprehensive than translating or transferring research into practice (TRIP), we suggest that the task be reframed, using the term optimizing practice through research.

Prospective cohort studies or RCTs are needed to evaluate whether changes in CKD-MBD risk marker patterns over time associate with changes in risk, and to examine whether biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD must be weighed differently when induced by pharmacotherapy compared with baseline values. Investigations to understand the usefulness of FGF23 as a complementary marker for treatment indications and as a direct treatment target should be undertaken.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE METHODOLOGY: methodology [^1116RNRN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) clinical practice guideline methodology — risk of bias assessment, evidence mapping, and recommendation development specifies tools and criteria across study designs and guidelines. Internal validity is evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 tool for systematic reviews, the Cochrane Collaboration tool for RCTs, the ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies of interventions, and the AGREE II tool for guidelines; systematic reviews are assessed across critical domains including protocol registration, adequacy of the literature search, justification for excluding individual studies, risk of bias from included studies, appropriateness of meta-analytic methods, consideration of risk of bias when interpreting results, and presence and likely effect of publication bias. RCTs are evaluated by the following six domains with a low, high, or unclear risk of bias rating per domain: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting; trial protocol, registration, and retention rates are examined when making judgments on reporting biases. Observational studies undergo investigation of the following seven domains with ROBINS-I ratings of low risk, moderate risk, serious risk, and critical risk: bias due to confounding; selection of participants; classification of interventions; departures from intended interventions; missing data; measurement of outcomes; and selection of the reported result. Guidelines are reviewed using criteria including scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. ACOG research staff develop summary evidence tables and evidence maps that include study setting, design, population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, sample size, results, and risk of bias, and the evidence maps display the hierarchy of evidence (systematic reviews, RCTs, observational studies, case studies, and narrative reviews). Writing group members review the evidence tables and propose key recommendations in GRADE format with summaries of the strength of the recommendation and the quality of evidence identified.

### Considerations in the rational design and conduct of phase I / II pediatric clinical trials: avoiding the problems and pitfalls [^116gx8WE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, there has been a heightened awareness of the need to include children in the drug development process. With this awareness has come an expansion of the infrastructure for conducting studies in children and an increase in the sponsorship of pediatric clinical trials. However, the growth in pediatric research has, in many cases, not been accompanied by an increase in the involvement of trained pediatric investigators when it comes to trial design and/or interpretation. Pediatric phase I/II protocols continue to span a spectrum from those that are carefully constructed to those that are poorly designed. This paper highlights the basic elements of phase I/II protocols that merit unique consideration when the clinical trial involves children. Illustrations are provided from our experience, which highlight problems that may arise when trials are not designed with the pediatric patient in mind.

### Comparison of time-to-first event and recurrent-event methods in randomized clinical trials [^112eAtFS]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Most phase-3 trials feature time-to-first event end points for their primary and secondary analyses. In chronic diseases, where a clinical event can occur > 1 time, recurrent-event methods have been proposed to more fully capture disease burden and have been assumed to improve statistical precision and power compared with conventional time-to-first methods.

Methods

To better characterize factors that influence statistical properties of recurrent-event and time-to-first methods in the evaluation of randomized therapy, we repeatedly simulated trials with 1:1 randomization of 4000 patients to active versus control therapy, with true patient-level risk reduction of 20% (ie, relative risk = 0.80). For patients who discontinued active therapy after a first event, we assumed their risk reverted subsequently to their original placebo-level risk. Through simulation, we varied the degree of between-patient heterogeneity of risk and the extent of treatment discontinuation. Findings were compared with those from actual randomized clinical trials.

Results

As the degree of between-patient heterogeneity of risk increased, both time-to-first and recurrent-event methods lost statistical power to detect a true risk reduction and confidence intervals widened. The recurrent-event analyses continued to estimate the true relative risk (0.80) as heterogeneity increased, whereas the Cox model produced attenuated estimates. The power of recurrent-event methods declined as the rate of study drug discontinuation postevent increased. Recurrent-event methods provided greater power than time-to-first methods in scenarios where drug discontinuation was ≤ 30% after a first event, lesser power with drug discontinuation rates of ≥ 60%, and comparable power otherwise. We confirmed in several actual trials of chronic heart failure that treatment effect estimates were attenuated when estimated via the Cox model and that increased statistical power from recurrent-event methods was most pronounced in trials with lower treatment discontinuation rates.

Conclusions

We find that the statistical power of both recurrent-events and time-to-first methods are reduced by increasing heterogeneity of patient risk, a parameter not included in conventional power and sample size formulas. Data from real clinical trials are consistent with simulation studies, confirming that the greatest statistical gains from use of recurrent-events methods occur in the presence of high patient heterogeneity and low rates of study drug discontinuation.

### Efficacy of eplerenone for treatment of heart failure… [^11691GJK]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to treat patients with heart failure is standard practice. The addition of spironolactone for aldosterone blockade in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors has been shown to provide further benefits in risk reduction of death and rates of hospitalization. Pitt and other investigators from the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of eplerenone in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.

This international trial enrolled 6, 642 patients three to 14 days after acute myocardial infarction if they had the following: left ventricular dysfunction and ejection fraction of 40 percent or lower on echocardiography, radionuclide angiography, or angiography of the left ventricle; and clinical evidence of heart failure, such as pulmonary rales, chest radiograph exhibiting pulmonary venous congestion, or presence of a third heart sound. The primary outcome for the study was death from all causes, which occurred in 478 patients receiving eplerenone and 554 patients receiving placebo; this was a statistically significant reduction. Other outcome measures also showed small benefits associated with the use of eplerenone, including death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization rates, and sudden death.

The authors conclude that adding the aldosterone blocker eplerenone to the standard treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure improves their survival and hospitalization rates. editor's note: The statistically significant, but clinically modest, reduction in overall mortality seen with the use of eplerenone translates to a "number of patients needed to treat" of 43. Treating 43 patients with heart failure for a year and a half with an inexpensive aldosterone blocker, such as spironolactone, to prevent one death would seem reasonable to many, although the list of "musthave" medications for patients with heart failure is getting quite long. Whether one can make a similar case for an expensive alternative aldosterone blocker with a less well-known safety profile, such as eplerenone, is more difficult to discern. — b. z.

### Treatment failure and hospital readmissions in severe COPD exacerbations treated with azithromycin versus placebo-a post-hoc analysis of the BACE randomized controlled trial [^113y1yWN]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the field of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute exacerbations (AECOPD) are considered the most important determinants of a patient's health status. They are characterized by an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that necessitate additional therapy, based on which they are classified as mild (treated with short-acting bronchodilators only), moderate (requiring systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics) or severe (requiring hospitalization). Hospital readmissions after an initial hospitalization for an exacerbation ('index event') are associated with significant morbidity, mortality and high resource utilization, especially within the first 3 months after hospital discharge.

We recently reported the results of the Belgian trial with Azithromycin for acute COPD Exacerbations requiring hospitalization (BACE, NCT02135354). The BACE trial was an investigator-initiated randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) comparing azithromycin (500 mg once a day for 3 days and subsequently administered for 3 months at 250 mg every 2 days) with placebo on a novel composite primary endpoint, treatment failure (TF). Though formally negative on the primary endpoint (p = 0.0526), the applied time-to-first event analyses of its 3 subcomponents revealed that the reduction in TF rate within 3 months of hospital admission was mainly driven by a significant decrease of treatment intensification with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (TI), as well as step-up in hospital care (SH) for respiratory reasons, while no difference was observed for all-cause mortality. The main analyses, however, limit our understanding to 'whether' and 'when' a first TF, or one of its subcomponents, occurred.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the intervention's effect on recurrent events, with a particular focus on hospital readmissions. Based on a number of pre-specified baseline patient characteristics, we additionally aimed to identify clinical subgroups most likely to benefit, determined from the incidence rate of TF and hospital readmissions.
