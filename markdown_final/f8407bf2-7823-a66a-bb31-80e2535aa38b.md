## Question

Does hydralazine decrease heart rate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydralazine decreases heart rate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about hydralazine's mechanism of action and its expected hemodynamic effects. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about heart rate changes. Next, I will review clinical guidelines and meta-analyses for real-world signals of tachycardia. After that, I should consider exceptions, such as drug interactions or overdose scenarios, that might mask or blunt the reflex response. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and clinical implications, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology, because that will anchor the expectation for heart rate. Hydralazine is a direct-acting arteriolar vasodilator that lowers peripheral vascular resistance; the resulting baroreceptor-mediated reflex sympathetic activation typically increases heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output, which is precisely why reflex tachycardia is a recognized effect in the FDA clinical pharmacology sections and labeling language [^9b990f04] [^3b3ceb44] [^34f5ad35].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory labeling language so I don't overstate this. Multiple FDA sources consistently list tachycardia and palpitations among common adverse reactions across oral, IV, and IM formulations, reinforcing that hydralazine increases heart rate rather than decreases it in routine clinical use [^190c3a5a] [^e33998db] [^af623820] [^ada2795d] [^5ae50036] [^b0c6c15c].

> Next, I should review guideline-level sources to see how clinicians are counseled to manage this. Contemporary guidelines for resistant hypertension explicitly advise that direct vasodilators like hydralazine are associated with sodium and water retention and reflex tachycardia, and therefore should be paired with a diuretic and a beta-blocker to mitigate these effects; this is a direct acknowledgment of hydralazine's pro-tachycardic propensity in practice [^5acc22fc] [^ff4e6f09] [^06c9c4ad] [^b3c8bc5d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking disease-specific contexts. In heart failure, the combination of hydralazine with isosorbide dinitrate is guideline-supported in selected patients, but the reflex tachycardia risk remains; clinicians still co-prescribe beta-blockers when feasible to blunt sympathetic activation, which again underscores that hydralazine itself does not lower heart rate and may raise it if unopposed [^73193287] [^087d1fb1] [^cd9a46d6].

> I need to check pregnancy literature as well, since hydralazine is commonly used for severe hypertension in obstetrics. Meta-analyses and obstetric guidelines repeatedly note reflex tachycardia and palpitations as common maternal adverse effects with hydralazine, and they caution about hypotensive overshoot and fetal heart rate effects, which aligns with the same mechanistic signal seen outside pregnancy [^84b50038] [^f5fb000b] [^a7366e1f].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions where heart rate appears to fall or bradycardia occurs. I should double-check for interaction or toxicity scenarios. Case reports describe bradycardia in the setting of polypharmacy or sequential antihypertensives, such as diazoxide followed by hydralazine, where profound hypotension and vagal activation can transiently slow the heart; similarly, concomitant negative chronotropes like verapamil or clonidine can dominate the clinical picture and obscure hydralazine's intrinsic chronotropic effect, so a low heart rate in those contexts reflects the net effect of multiple agents rather than hydralazine lowering heart rate per se [^79752ad5] [^579c607a].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing contradictory evidence. Across mechanistic, regulatory, guideline, and clinical-trial sources, hydralazine consistently produces reflex tachycardia due to arteriolar dilation and baroreflex activation; there is no credible evidence that hydralazine lowers heart rate in typical therapeutic dosing, and when heart rate is low in a patient receiving hydralazine, it is usually due to co-administered negative chronotropes, severe hypotension with vagal predominance, or overdose management with beta-blockade, not a direct heart rate–lowering effect of hydralazine itself [^9b990f04] [^3b3ceb44] [^5acc22fc] [^ff4e6f09].

> Final answer: No, hydralazine does not decrease heart rate; it increases heart rate via reflex sympathetic activation, and clinicians routinely mitigate this with beta-blockers and diuretics to prevent pseudo-tolerance and adverse effects [^9b990f04] [^3b3ceb44] [^5acc22fc] [^ff4e6f09].

---

Hydralazine **does not decrease heart rate**; it causes reflex tachycardia by lowering peripheral resistance and triggering sympathetic activation [^9b990f04] [^3b3ceb44]. This is why hydralazine is often combined with a beta-blocker to blunt the reflex tachycardia and is not used alone in patients with ischemic heart disease or tachyarrhythmias [^5acc22fc] [^b3c8bc5d]. Clinically significant bradycardia is not a recognized effect of hydralazine, and any reported bradycardia is likely due to co-administered agents or underlying conditions rather than hydralazine itself [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism and heart rate effects

Hydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator that relaxes arterial smooth muscle, lowering peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure [^9b990f04]. This drop in blood pressure activates baroreceptors, triggering a compensatory sympathetic response that increases heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output — a classic reflex tachycardia [^3b3ceb44]. The FDA labeling explicitly states that hydralazine increases heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output, confirming its pro-tachycardic effect [^9b990f04] [^3b3ceb44].

---

## Clinical evidence of heart rate effects

Multiple clinical sources consistently document hydralazine-induced tachycardia:

- **FDA labeling**: Tachycardia and palpitations are listed among common adverse effects across oral, IV, and IM formulations [^190c3a5a] [^e33998db] [^af623820].
- **Guidelines**: Direct vasodilators, including hydralazine, are associated with reflex tachycardia and fluid retention, necessitating co-administration with beta-blockers and diuretics [^5acc22fc] [^ff4e6f09] [^b3c8bc5d].
- **Clinical studies**: Hydralazine has been shown to increase heart rate in various populations, including pregnant patients and those with heart failure [^f5fb000b] [^84b50038].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

While hydralazine typically increases heart rate, rare cases of bradycardia have been reported — usually in the context of polypharmacy or specific clinical scenarios. For example, a case report described bradycardia in a patient taking verapamil, clonidine, and hydralazine; stopping verapamil resolved the bradycardia, suggesting the negative chronotropy of verapamil and clonidine outweighed hydralazine's reflex tachycardia [^579c607a]. Another report described severe hypotension and bradycardia after sequential administration of diazoxide and hydralazine, likely reflecting cumulative vasodilation and autonomic instability rather than a direct bradycardic effect of hydralazine [^79752ad5].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Given hydralazine's propensity to cause reflex tachycardia, clinicians should:

- **Co-administer beta-blockers**: To blunt reflex tachycardia and reduce myocardial oxygen demand, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease or tachyarrhythmias [^5acc22fc] [^b3c8bc5d].
- **Monitor heart rate**: Regularly assess heart rate and adjust therapy if significant tachycardia occurs [^notfound].
- **Use caution in specific populations**: Avoid hydralazine monotherapy in patients with coronary artery disease, mitral valvular disease, or tachyarrhythmias due to the risk of exacerbating these conditions [^a88e654d].

## Summary of evidence

| **Source** | **Effect on heart rate** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| FDA labeling | Increases heart rate (tachycardia) | General use |
| Clinical guidelines | Reflex tachycardia | General use |
| Case reports | Bradycardia (rare) | Polypharmacy, autonomic instability |
| Clinical studies | Increases heart rate | Pregnancy, heart failure |

---

Hydralazine **does not decrease heart rate**; it causes reflex tachycardia via sympathetic activation. Rare bradycardia reports reflect co-administered drugs or special circumstances, not a direct effect of hydralazine. Clinicians should anticipate tachycardia and manage it proactively, often with beta-blockers.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Although the precise mechanism of action of hydrALAZINE is not fully understood, the major effects are on the cardiovascular system.

HydrALAZINE apparently lowers blood pressure by exerting a peripheral vasodilating effect through a direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. HydrALAZINE, by altering cellular calcium metabolism, interferes with the calcium movements within the vascular smooth muscle that are responsible for initiating or maintaining the contractile state.

The peripheral vasodilating effect of hydrALAZINE results in decreased arterial blood pressure (diastolic more than systolic); decreased peripheral vascular resistance; and an increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. The preferential dilatation of arterioles, as compared to veins, minimizes postural hypotension and promotes the increase in cardiac output. HydrALAZINE usually increases renin activity in plasma, presumably as a result of increased secretion of renin by the renal juxtaglomerular cells in response to reflex sympathetic discharge. This increase in renin activity leads to the production of angiotensin II, which then causes stimulation of aldosterone and consequent sodium reabsorption. HydrALAZINE also maintains or increases renal and cerebral blood flow.

HydrALAZINE is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and peak plasma levels are reached at 1 to 2 hours. Plasma levels of apparent hydrALAZINE decline with a half-life of 3 to 7 hours. Binding to human plasma protein is 87%. Plasma levels of hydrALAZINE vary widely among individuals. HydrALAZINE is subject to polymorphic acetylation; slow acetylators generally have higher plasma levels of hydrALAZINE and require lower doses to maintain control of blood pressure. HydrALAZINE undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism; it is excreted mainly in the form of metabolites in the urine.

Hydralazine — arterial vasodilator use in HF — has relatively little effect on venous tone and cardiac filling pressures, and in theory may interfere with biochemical and molecular mechanisms responsible for HF progression and the development of nitrate tolerance; however, there are limited data regarding the use of hydralazine alone in HF.

### Nitrate therapy for heart failure: benefits and strategies to overcome tolerance [^d596e4de]. JACC: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Combination therapy with hydralazine and nitrates can improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and low ejection fraction. However, this combination is underused in clinical practice for several reasons, including side effects related to hydralazine and polypharmacy. Some of the benefits seen with hydralazine, including afterload reduction and attenuation of nitrate tolerance, have also been observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Demonstrating similar clinical benefits with nitrates plus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy alone, in the absence of hydralazine, may represent an opportunity to improve heart failure care by increasing the use of nitrates. In this paper, we summarize data that support studying such an approach.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, β-blockers, and hydralazine — Patients with biventricular dysfunction should be managed according to current practice guidelines for the management of chronic HF, but in contrast to clear guidelines for HFrEF, less evidence is available to guide therapy of predominant RHF syndromes. Small-scale, single-center studies support the use of β-blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, and hydralazine, although results are inconsistent and vary across populations; early studies with systemic vasodilators, including hydralazine, produced inconsistent hemodynamic benefits in patients with PH, and these agents were also frequently associated with serious adverse events.

### Hydralazine for treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy: meta-analysis [^84b50038]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To review outcomes in randomised controlled trials comparing hydralazine against other antihypertensives for severe hypertension in pregnancy.

Study Design

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (published between 1966 and September 2002) of short acting antihypertensives for severe hypertension in pregnancy. Independent data abstraction by two reviewers. Data were entered into RevMan software for analysis (fixed effects model, relative risk and 95% confidence interval); in a secondary analysis, risk difference was also calculated.

Results

Of 21 trials (893 women), eight compared hydralazine with nifedipine and five with labetalol. Hydralazine was associated with a trend towards less persistent severe hypertension than labetalol (relative risk 0.29 (95% confidence interval 0.08 to 1.04); two trials), but more severe hypertension than nifedipine or isradipine (1.41 (0.95 to 2.09); four trials); there was significant heterogeneity in outcome between trials and differences in methodological quality. Hydralazine was associated with more maternal hypotension (3.29 (1.50 to 7.23); 13 trials); more caesarean sections (1.30 (1.08 to 1.59); 14 trials); more placental abruption (4.17 (1.19 to 14.28); five trials); more maternal oliguria (4.00 (1.22 to 12.50); three trials); more adverse effects on fetal heart rate (2.04 (1.32 to 3.16); 12 trials); and more low Apgar scores at one minute (2.70 (1.27 to 5.88); three trials). For all but Apgar scores, analysis by risk difference showed heterogeneity between trials. Hydralazine was associated with more maternal side effects (1.50 (1.16 to 1.94); 12 trials) and with less neonatal bradycardia than labetalol (risk difference -0.24 (-0.42 to -0.06); three trials).

Conclusions

The results are not robust enough to guide clinical practice, but they do not support use of hydralazine as first line for treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy. Adequately powered clinical trials are needed, with a comparison of labetalol and nifedipine showing the most promise.

Urgent blood pressure control in pregnancy — agents, doses, and onset: Labetalol 10–20 mg IV, then 20–80 mg every 10–30 min to a maximum cumulative dosage of 300 mg; or constant infusion 1–3 mg/min IV has onset 1–2 min; tachycardia is less common with fewer adverse effects, and it should be avoided in women with asthma, preexisting myocardial disease, decompensated cardiac function, and heart block and bradycardia. Hydralazine 5 mg IV or IM, then 5–10 mg IV every 20–40 min to a maximum cumulative dosage of 20 mg; or constant infusion of 0.5–10 mg/h has onset 10–20 min. Nifedipine (immediate release) 10–20 mg orally, repeat in 20 min if needed; then 10–20 mg every 2–6 h; maximum daily dose is 180 mg has onset 5–10 min and may observe reflex tachycardia and headaches.

Isosorbide dinitrate and other nitrates — symptomatic therapy in heart failure (HF) — may decrease dyspnea and improve exercise tolerance in patients with persistent limitations, with the only common side effects being headaches and hypotension; in practice, nitrates are frequently prescribed to patients with persistent congestive symptoms, and nitrate tolerance appears minimized by a "nitrate-free interval" of at least 10 hours and by combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or hydralazine.

### Hydralazine for essential hypertension [^0e06dddd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. Hydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator which has been used for the treatment of hypertension since the 1950's. Although it has largely been replaced by newer antihypertensive drugs with more acceptable tolerability profiles, hydralazine is still widely used in developing countries due to its lower cost. A review of its relative effectiveness compared to placebo on surrogate and clinical outcomes is justified.

Objectives

To quantify the effect of hydralazine compared to placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events, myocardial infarctions, strokes, withdrawals due to adverse effects and blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to Second Quarter 2009), MEDLINE (2005-June 2009), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2009) and EMBASE (2007-June 2009). Bibliographic citations from retrieved studies were also reviewed. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We selected RCTs studying the effect of oral hydralazine compared to oral placebo in patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary hypertension or gestational hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using the risk of bias tool. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.

Main Results

The search strategy did not yield any randomized controlled trials comparing hydralazine to placebo for inclusion in this review. There is insufficient evidence to conclude on the effects of hydralazine versus placebo on mortality, morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse effects, serious adverse events, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Some of the adverse effects related to hydralazine that have been reported in the literature include reflex tachycardia, hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and a lupus-like syndrome.

Authors' Conclusions

Hydralazine may reduce blood pressure when compared to placebo in patients with primary hypertension, however this data is based on before and after studies, not RCTs. Furthermore, its effect on clinical outcomes remains uncertain.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Table 26 — Intravenous antihypertensive drugs for hypertensive emergencies (direct vasodilator and adrenergic blockers): Hydralazine is given initial 10 mg via slow intravenous (IV) infusion (maximum initial dose 20 mg); repeat every 4–6 h as needed and adjust rate up to total cumulative dose of 200 mg/24 h; BP begins to decrease within 10–30 min and the fall lasts 2–4 h, and it is an undesirable first-line agent for acute treatment in most patients due to unpredictability of response and prolonged duration of action. Esmolol uses a loading dose 500–1000 mcg/kg/min over 1 min followed by a 50-mcg/kg/min infusion, with repeated bolus and 50-mcg/kg/min infusion increases as needed to a maximum of 300 mcg/kg/min; it is contraindicated with concurrent beta-blocker therapy, bradycardia, or decompensated heart failure (HF), requires monitoring for bradycardia, and higher doses may block beta-2 receptors and impact lung function in reactive airway and obstructive pulmonary disease. Labetalol is dosed initial 0.3–1.0 mg/kg dose (maximum 20 mg) slow IV injection every 2 min or 0.4–1.0 mg/kg/h IV infusion up to 3 mg/kg/h; adjust rate up to total cumulative dose of 300 mg/24 h; it is contraindicated in reactive airway or obstructive pulmonary disease, may worsen HF, and should not be given in patients with second- or third-degree heart block or bradycardia.

### Heart failure [^002f10e4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure occurs in 3% to 4% of adults aged over 65 years, usually as a consequence of coronary artery disease or hypertension, and causes breathlessness, effort intolerance, fluid retention, and increased mortality. The 5-year mortality in people with systolic heart failure ranges from 25% to 75%, often owing to sudden death following ventricular arrhythmia. Risks of cardiovascular events are increased in people with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or heart failure.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug treatments, and of drug and invasive treatments, for heart failure? What are the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in people at high risk of heart failure? What are the effects of treatments for diastolic heart failure? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 85 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aldosterone receptor antagonists; amiodarone; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; angiotensin II receptor blockers; anticoagulation; antiplatelet agents; beta-blockers; calcium channel blockers; cardiac resynchronisation therapy; digoxin (in people already receiving diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors); exercise; hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate; implantable cardiac defibrillators; multidisciplinary interventions; non-amiodarone antiarrhythmic drugs; and positive inotropes (other than digoxin).

### L-arginine augments cardiac vagal control in healthy human subjects [^746befe2]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac vagal control has prognostic significance in cardiac disease, but the control mechanisms of this system remain poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated a role for NO in promoting vagal control of heart rate in humans. Here we examine the influence of L-arginine, the substrate for NO synthase, on this mechanism in healthy human subjects. Eleven healthy volunteers (9 men; age, 20 to 25 years) underwent measurement of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity before and during a systemic infusion of L-arginine (1 g/min; total, 30 g). To control for the fall in blood pressure, comparison was made with an infusion of the control vasodilator hydralazine. Stereospecificity of observed effects was investigated by infusion of D-arginine. Urinary nitrate and nitrite (NO(x)) and cGMP concentrations were measured as indexes of NO generation. L-Arginine infusion produced a drop in mean arterial pressure of 5 mm Hg. This fall in blood pressure was matched by hydralazine infusion and was not observed with either D-arginine or saline infusion. Although RR interval duration, heart rate variability, and baroreflex sensitivity all fell significantly with hydralazine, the same degree of baroreflex unloading with L-arginine produced an increase in RR interval duration and no change or even slight increases in heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity. In contrast, D-arginine produced falls in high-frequency indexes of heart rate variability compared with saline. Only L-arginine increased urinary NO(x) and cGMP excretion. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that short-term L-arginine infusion facilitates vagal control of heart rate in healthy humans, probably via increased NO synthesis.

General

Myocardial stimulation produced by hydrALAZINE can cause anginal attacks and ECG changes of myocardial ischemia. The drug has been implicated in the production of myocardial infarction. It must, therefore, be used with caution in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

The "hyperdynamic" circulation caused by hydrALAZINE may accentuate specific cardiovascular inadequacies. For example, hydrALAZINE may increase pulmonary artery pressure in patients with mitral valvular disease. The drug may reduce the pressor responses to epinephrine. Postural hypotension may result from hydrALAZINE but is less common than with ganglionic blocking agents.

It should be used with caution in patients with cerebral vascular accidents.

In hypertensive patients with normal kidneys who are treated with hydrALAZINE, there is evidence of increased renal blood flow and a maintenance of glomerular filtration rate. In some instances where control values were below normal, improved renal function has been noted after administration of hydrALAZINE. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, hydrALAZINE should be used with caution in patients with advanced renal damage.

Peripheral neuritis, evidenced by paresthesia, numbness, and tingling, has been observed. Published evidence suggests an antipyridoxine effect, and that pyridoxine should be added to the regimen if symptoms develop.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of possible side effects and advised to take the medication regularly and continuously as directed.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts and antinuclear antibody titer determinations are indicated before and periodically during prolonged therapy with hydrALAZINE even though the patient is asymptomatic. These studies are also indicated if the patient develops arthralgia, fever, chest pain, continued malaise, or other unexplained signs or symptoms.

A positive antinuclear antibody titer requires that the physician carefully weigh the implications of the test results against the benefits to be derived from antihypertensive therapy with hydrALAZINE.

Blood dyscrasias, consisting of reduction in hemoglobin and red cell count, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and purpura, have been reported. If such abnormalities develop, therapy should be discontinued.

Drug/Drug Interactions

MAO inhibitors should be used with caution in patients receiving hydrALAZINE.

When other potent parenteral antihypertensive drugs, such as diazoxide, are used in combination with hydrALAZINE, patients should be continuously observed for several hours for any excessive fall in blood pressure. Profound hypotensive episodes may occur when diazoxide injection and hydrALAZINE are used concomitantly.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^c2ce684a]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Initiate therapy in gradually increasing dosages; adjust according to individual response. Start with 10 mg four times daily for the first 2 to 4 days, increase to 25 mg four times daily for the balance of the first week. For the second and subsequent weeks, increase dosage to 50 mg four times daily. For maintenance, adjust dosage to the lowest effective levels.

The incidence of toxic reactions, particularly the L.E. cell syndrome, is high in the group of patients receiving large doses of hydrALAZINE hydrochloride tablets.

In a few resistant patients, up to 300 mg of hydrALAZINE hydrochloride tablets daily may be required for a significant antihypertensive effect. In such cases, a lower dosage of hydrALAZINE combined with a thiazide and/or reserpine or a beta blocker may be considered. However, when combining therapy, individual titration is essential to ensure the lowest possible therapeutic dose of each drug.

### Pharmacologic management of heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction [^493ad06e]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction affects more than 5 million adults in the United States and is a common source of outpatient visits to primary care physicians. Mortality rates are high, yet a number of pharmacologic interventions may improve outcomes. Other interventions, including patient education, counseling, and regular self-monitoring, are critical, but are beyond the scope of this article. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers reduce mortality and should be administered to all patients unless contraindicated. Diuretics are indicated for symptomatic patients as needed for volume overload. Aldosterone antagonists and direct-acting vasodilators, such as isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine, may improve mortality in selected patients. Angiotensin receptor blockers can be used as an alternative therapy for patients intolerant of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and in some patients who are persistently symptomatic. Digoxin may improve symptoms and is helpful for persons with concomitant atrial fibrillation, but it does not reduce cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Serum digoxin levels should not exceed 1.0 ng per mL (1.3 nmol per L), especially in women.

### Isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride [^3bbd1a25]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action underlying the beneficial effects of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of heart failure has not been established.

Isosorbide dinitrate is a vasodilator affecting both arteries and veins. Its dilator properties result from the release of nitric oxide and the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase, and ultimate relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.

Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of chronically-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were no more effective than placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours is response to nitrates restored.

Hydralazine hydrochloride is a selective dilator of arterial smooth muscle. Animal data suggests that hydralazine may also mitigate tolerance to nitrates.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The basis for the beneficial clinical effects of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride tablets is not known. In a small study of patients with chronic heart failure administered single doses of hydralazine 75 mg, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg, and the combination, the combination elicited a statistically significant decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure compared to hydralazine alone. The increase in cardiac output, renal blood flow and limb blood flow with the combination, however, was not greater than with hydralazine alone. There is no study of hemodynamic effects following multiple dosing.

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol tartrate) [^31d6563d]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Digitalis glycosides and beta blockers: Both digitalis glycosides and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and PR interval.

Calcium channel blockers: Concomitant administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects.

CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may increase the plasma concentration of metoprolol tartrate which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see Pharmacokinetics section). Increase in plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, clomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as terbinafine.

Hydralazine: Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol.

Alpha-adrenergic agents: Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by beta-blockers including metoprolol tartrate. Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing reflex tachycardia. On the contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. If a patient is treated with clonidine and metoprolol tartrate concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop metoprolol tartrate several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound hypertension that can follow withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment.

Ergot alkaloid: Concomitant administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids.

Dipyridamole: In general, administration of a beta-blocker should be withheld before dipyridamole testing, with careful monitoring of heart rate following the dipyridamole injection.

Arterial Hemodynamics

Treatment with ISDN did not reduce brachial systolic blood pressure (P = 0.09), yet tended to reduce central systolic blood pressure (visit 2 versus visit 1: −27.6 [95% CI −54.0 to −1.3]; visit 3 versus visit 1: −30.4 [95% CI −58.2 to −2.6] mm Hg; overall P = 0.051; Table 2), although this reduction did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant changes in brachial or central blood pressures with ISDN+hydral or PB. Heart rate and augmentation index were not significantly altered by any study medication (data not shown).

### Heart rate as a risk factor in chronic heart failure (SHIFT): the association between heart rate and outcomes in a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^7944129d]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Raised resting heart rate is a marker of cardiovascular risk. We postulated that heart rate is also a risk factor for cardiovascular events in heart failure. In the SHIFT trial, patients with chronic heart failure were treated with the selective heart-rate-lowering agent ivabradine. We aimed to test our hypothesis by investigating the association between heart rate and events in this patient population.

Methods

We analysed cardiovascular outcomes in the placebo (n = 3264) and ivabradine groups (n = 3241) of this randomised trial, divided by quintiles of baseline heart rate in the placebo group. The primary composite endpoint was cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening heart failure. In the ivabradine group, heart rate achieved at 28 days was also analysed in relation to subsequent outcomes. Analysis adjusted to change in heart rate was used to study heart-rate reduction as mechanism for risk reduction by ivabradine directly.

Findings

In the placebo group, patients with the highest heart rates (≥ 87 beats per min [bpm], n = 682, 286 events) were at more than two-fold higher risk for the primary composite endpoint than were patients with the lowest heart rates (70 to < 72 bpm, n = 461, 92 events; hazard ratio [HR] 2.34, 95% CI 1.84–2.98, p < 0.0001). Risk of primary composite endpoint events increased by 3% with every beat increase from baseline heart rate and 16% for every 5-bpm increase. In the ivabradine group, there was a direct association between heart rate achieved at 28 days and subsequent cardiac outcomes. Patients with heart rates lower than 60 bpm at 28 days on treatment had fewer primary composite endpoint events during the study (n = 1192; event rate 17.4%, 95% CI 15.3–19.6) than did patients with higher heart rates. The effect of ivabradine is accounted for by heart-rate reduction, as shown by the neutralisation of the treatment effect after adjustment for change of heart rate at 28 days (HR 0.95, 0.85–1.06, p = 0.352).

Interpretation

Our analysis confirms that high heart rate is a risk factor in heart failure. Selective lowering of heart rates with ivabradine improves cardiovascular outcomes. Heart rate is an important target for treatment of heart failure.

### Combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in blacks with heart failure [^bf60c0f3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

We examined whether a fixed dose of both isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine provides additional benefit in blacks with advanced heart failure, a subgroup previously noted to have a favorable response to this therapy.

Methods

A total of 1050 black patients who had New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure with dilated ventricles were randomly assigned to receive a fixed dose of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine or placebo in addition to standard therapy for heart failure. The primary end point was a composite score made up of weighted values for death from any cause, a first hospitalization for heart failure, and change in the quality of life.

Results

The study was terminated early owing to a significantly higher mortality rate in the placebo group than in the group given isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine (10.2 percent vs. 6.2 percent, P = 0.02). The mean primary composite score was significantly better in the group given isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine than in the placebo group (-0.1 ± 1.9 vs. -0.5 ± 2.0, P = 0.01; range of possible values, -6 to +2), as were its individual components (43 percent reduction in the rate of death from any cause [hazard ratio, 0.57; P = 0.01] 33 percent relative reduction in the rate of first hospitalization for heart failure [16.4 percent vs. 22.4 percent, P = 0.001], and an improvement in the quality of life [change in score, -5.6 ± 20.6 vs. -2.7 ± 21.2, with lower scores indicating better quality of life; P = 0.02; range of possible values, 0 to 105]).

Conclusions

The addition of a fixed dose of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine to standard therapy for heart failure including neurohormonal blockers is efficacious and increases survival among black patients with advanced heart failure.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and beta-blocker initiation — refractory heart failure (HF): treatment with either type of drug should not be initiated in patients who have systolic blood pressures less than 80 mm Hg or who have signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, and patients should not be started on a beta-blocker if they have significant fluid retention or if they recently required treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Treatment with an ACEI or beta-blocker should be initiated in very low doses, and patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of intolerance, and clinical trials suggest that even low doses may provide important benefits. For patients who cannot tolerate ACEIs or beta-blockers, a combination of nitrates and hydralazine has been reported to have favorable effects on survival in mild to moderate symptoms not taking an ACEI or beta-blocker. Spironolactone has been reported to prolong life and reduce HF hospitalization in advanced disease, but the evidence was derived in patients with preserved renal function, and the drug can produce dangerous hyperkalemia in impaired renal function. Although angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are frequently considered as alternatives to ACEIs because of the low incidence of cough and angioedema, it is not clear that ARBs are as effective as ACEIs, and they are as likely as ACEIs to produce hypotension or renal insufficiency.

### Hydralazine hydrochloride and isosorbide dinitrate (biDil) [^40732899]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action underlying the beneficial effects of BiDil in the treatment of heart failure has not been established.

Isosorbide dinitrate is a vasodilator affecting both arteries and veins. Its dilator properties result from the release of nitric oxide and the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase, and ultimate relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.

Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of chronically-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were no more effective than placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours is response to nitrates restored.

Hydralazine hydrochloride is a selective dilator of arterial smooth muscle. Animal data suggests that hydralazine may also mitigate tolerance to nitrates.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The basis for the beneficial clinical effects of BiDil is not known. In a small study of patients with chronic heart failure administered single doses of hydralazine 75 mg, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg, and the combination, the combination elicited a statistically significant decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure compared to hydralazine alone. The increase in cardiac output, renal blood flow and limb blood flow with the combination, however, was not greater than with hydralazine alone. There is no study of hemodynamic effects following multiple dosing.

Adverse Events

Therapy with ISDN or ISDN+hydral was poorly tolerated, with significantly more patients experiencing adverse events in both active arms as compared with those taking PB (ISDN, n = 8 [61.5%]; ISDN+hydral, n = 9 [60.0%], PB, n = 2 [12.5%]; P = 0.007 [Table 7]). Common side effects in the active treatment arms were headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, hypotension, and orthostasis.

GENERAL PRECAUTIONS

Myocardial stimulation produced by hydrALAZINE can cause anginal attacks and ECG changes of myocardial ischemia. The drug has been implicated in the production of myocardial infarction. It must, therefore, be used with caution in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

The "hyperdynamic" circulation caused by hydrALAZINE may accentuate specific cardiovascular inadequacies. For example, hydrALAZINE may increase pulmonary artery pressure in patients with mitral valvular disease. The drug may reduce the pressor responses to epinephrine. Postural hypotension may result from hydrALAZINE but is less common than with ganglionic blocking agents. It should be used with caution in patients with cerebral vascular accidents.

In hypertensive patients with normal kidneys who are treated with hydrALAZINE, there is evidence of increased renal blood flow and a maintenance of glomerular filtration rate. In some instances where control values were below normal, improved renal function has been noted after administration of hydrALAZINE. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, hydrALAZINE should be used with caution in patients with advanced renal damage.

Peripheral neuritis, evidenced by paresthesia, numbness, and tingling, has been observed. Published evidence suggests an antipyridoxine effect, and that pyridoxine should be added to the regimen if symptoms develop.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

Patients should be informed of possible side effects and advised to take the medication regularly and continuously as directed.

LABORATORY TESTS

Complete blood counts and antinuclear antibody titer determinations are indicated before and periodically during prolonged therapy with hydrALAZINE even though the patient is asymptomatic. These studies are also indicated if the patient develops arthralgia, fever, chest pain, continued malaise, or other unexplained signs or symptoms.

A positive antinuclear antibody titer requires that the physician carefully weigh the implications of the test results against the benefits to be derived from antihypertensive therapy with hydrALAZINE.

Blood dyscrasias, consisting of reduction in hemoglobin and red cell count, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and purpura, have been reported. If such abnormalities develop, therapy should be discontinued.

Drug/Drug Interactions

MAO inhibitors should be used with caution in patients receiving hydrALAZINE.

When other potent parenteral antihypertensive drugs, such as diazoxide, are used in combination with hydrALAZINE, patients should be continuously observed for several hours for any excessive fall in blood pressure. Profound hypotensive episodes may occur when diazoxide injection and hydrALAZINE are used concomitantly.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^f5fb000b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Hydralazine — use, onset, adverse effects, and hypotensive overshoot in pregnancy — has longstanding experience and specific risk considerations. Hydralazine has been used extensively for severe hypertension in pregnancy for more than 65 years, with an onset of action that is relatively slow for an IV drug (10–20 minutes). Common limiting adverse effects, experienced by up to 50% of recipients, include reflex tachycardia, hypotension, headaches, palpitations, flushing, anxiety, tremors, vomiting, epigastric pain, and fluid retention by activation of the renin–angiotensin system. Hypotensive overshoot associated with hydralazine may affect uteroplacental or maternal renal blood flow and lead to oliguria, particularly in volume-depleted pregnant women; late decelerations often respond to fluid loading and position changes, although cases with placental abruption or fetal distress requiring emergency cesarean delivery have been reported. Prior correction of hypovolemia may be helpful to prevent hypotensive overshoot, which is an unpredictable complication not always dose related; because hydralazine has a long duration of action, it can last up to 12 hours, and fetal distress secondary to maternal hypotension seems to be more frequent with continuous infusion than with repeat bolus administrations.

Resistant hypertension — diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment: Confirm treatment resistance with one of the following: Office BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg and on ≥ 3 antihypertensives with Combination of ACEi or ARB + CCB + thiazide-like diuretics preferred, or Office BP < 130/80 mm Hg but requires ≥ 4 antihypertensives with Combination of ACEi or ARB + CCB + thiazide-like diuretics preferred. Exclude pseudoresistance by ensuring accurate office BP measurements, assessing for medication nonadherence with prescribed regimen, and obtaining home, work, or ambulatory BP readings to exclude white-coat effect. Then identify and reverse contributing lifestyle factors, discontinue or minimize interfering substances, and screen for secondary causes of hypertension. Pharmacological treatment includes maximizing diuretic therapy; replacing thiazide-type diuretics with chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg qd or indapamide 1.25–2.5 mg qd; adding spironolactone (25–50 mg qd) or equivalent dosage of eplerenone (25–50 mg BID) if eGFR ≥ 45; using chlorthalidone or loop diuretics in patients with CKD stage 4 or greater; adding agents with different mechanisms of action (MOA) such as BB, central sympatholytic drugs, or nondihydropyridine CCB for elevated heart rate; and adding potent vasodilators, for example aprocitentan, hydralazine, or minoxidil only if already on BB (or bradycardic) and loop diuretic.

### Metoprolol tartate [^785f2bba]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Hydralazine: Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol.

Alpha-adrenergic agents: Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by beta-blockers including Metoprolol Tartrate. Beta- adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing reflex tachycardia. On the contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. If a patient is treated with clonidine and Metoprolol Tartrate concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop Metoprolol Tartrate several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound hypertension that can follow withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment.

Ergot alkaloid: Concomitant administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids

Dipyridamole: In general, administration of a beta-blocker should be withheld before dipyridamole testing, with careful monitoring of heart rate following the dipyridamole injection.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate carcinogenic potential. In a 2-year study in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg per day, there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type. The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg per day, benign lung tumors (small adenomas) occurred more frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, or in the overall incidence of tumors or malignant tumors. This 21-month study was repeated in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically significant differences were observed between treated and control mice of either sex for any type of tumor.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^f09e185f]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) — special consideration for therapy during pregnancy indicates that pregnant women with PPCM should be referred to a center with experience with this condition for multidisciplinary care with close monitoring before, during, and after delivery. Diuretic agents should be used when appropriate to treat volume overload, yet they should be used sparingly to avoid reductions in fetal blood flow. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are contraindicated during pregnancy because of significant fetal risks, and as an alternative to ACE inhibitors or ARBs, hydralazine can be considered for the management of hypertension in pregnant women with PPCM, with or without intravenous nitroglycerine or long-acting nitrates.

Hypertension — Table 13 dosing and comments for central alpha-2 agonists, direct vasodilators, and a dual endothelin receptor antagonist are as follows: Clonidine oral has a usual dose range 0.1–0.8 mg/d with daily frequency 2, and clonidine patch 0.1–0.3 mg/d with daily frequency 1 weekly; methyldopa 250–1000 mg/d with daily frequency 2; hydralazine 100–200 mg/d with daily frequency 2 or 3; minoxidil 5–40 mg/d with daily frequency 1–2; and aprocitentan 12.5 mg/d with daily frequency 1. Central alpha-2 agonists are "generally reserved as last-line choices because of significant CNS adverse effects, especially in older adults", and for clonidine, abrupt discontinuation may induce hypertensive crisis and it "must be tapered to avoid rebound hypertension". Direct vasodilators are "associated with sodium and water retention and reflex tachycardia and should be used with a diuretic and beta blocker", with hydralazine "associated with a drug-induced lupus-like syndrome at higher doses", and minoxidil associated with hirsutism, requirement for a loop diuretic, and potential pericardial effusion. For aprocitentan, comments note fluid retention within the "first 4–6 wks of therapy", its indication as add-on therapy when BP is not adequately controlled on other antihypertensive medications, and "Avoid use in pregnancy".

To the Editor. — We report a case pertinent to the article entitled "Hypotensive Sequelae of Diazoxide and Hydralazine Therapy". Report of a Case. A 58-year-old man came to the emergency room with slurred speech, left hemiparesis, and blood pressure of 240/150 mm Hg. Diazoxide, 300 mg intravenously, was given, followed by furosemide, 40 mg intravenously, and methyldopa, 500 mg by mouth. There was a decrease in blood pressure to 160/100 mm Hg. When the blood pressure rose to 190/130 mm Hg after three hours, hydralazine hydrochloride, 20 mg, was given intramuscularly. Thirty minutes later, the patient began to complain of nausea, weakness, and disphoresis. At this time his blood pressure was 60 mm Hg systolic; his heart rate, 36 beats per minute; and only femoral pulses could be palpated. Atropine sulfate intravenously and a dopamine hydrochloride drip reversed the situation and the patient made an uneventful recovery. Mizroch S, Yurasek M.

Step 6: Add in other drugs

There is a wide choice of additional agents available, albeit with limited RCT evidence to support widespread use, including but not limited to
α-adreneceptor antagonists e.g. Doxazosin XL 4–8 mg.
β-adreneceptor antagonists e.g. bisoprolol or nebivolol, both 2.5–5 mg OD.
Centrally acting drugs e.g. methyldopa, clonidine or moxonidine
Direct vasodilators e.g. hydralazine or minoxidil.

The choice of agent should be carefully considered for each patient, taking into consideration patient choice, previous adverse experiences and the clinical situation.

Adrenoceptor antagonists are perhaps better tolerated in general than the other classes of drug, and PATHWAY-2 provided evidence of efficacy for Doxazosin XL. Therefore, they are a sensible initial choice.

Use of non-modified release doxazosin is not recommended due to higher peak concentration, which may produce rapid reductions in BP and is less well tolerated.

β-blockers may be considered in subjects with a heart rate ≥ 60 bpm with indications for their use e.g. migraine. If they are contra-indicated or poorly tolerated, α-blockers are an alternative.

Centrally acting drugs are effective antihypertensives but are associated with significant side effects such as depression, dry mouth, somnolence and insomnia. Although clonidine, a centrally acting α 2 agonist showed a similar BP-lowering efficacy to spironolactone in RH, it appears less well tolerated, and requires more careful and sustained dose titration. Moreover, there is a risk of rebound hypertension during periods of nonadherence, and it must be withdrawn slowly to avoid this. Transdermal formulations could be preferred but are currently not licensed in the UK. Methyldopa is now rarely used outside pregnancy, due to its poor tolerability and challenges with dose titration. Like clonidine, it should be withdrawn slowly.

Hydralazine and minoxidil are direct acting vasodilators and can cause profound hypotension. Both are licensed in the UK for severe hypertension. Chronic use leads to fluid retention and tachycardia – so-called pseudo-tolerance – which reduces their effectiveness. Hence, they are usually given with β -blockers and loop diuretics to counteract this. Hydralazine can produce a lupus-like syndrome particularly in those genetically defined as slow acetylators, and minoxidil is associated with excess hair growth and, rarely, pericardial effusion.

### Pharmacologic therapy for patients with chronic heart failure and reduced systolic function: review of trials and practical considerations [^6f6956df]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome resulting from any structural or functional cardiac disorder impairing the ability of the ventricles to fill with or eject blood. The approach to pharmacologic treatment has become a combined preventive and symptomatic management strategy. Ideally, treatment should be initiated in patients at risk, preventing disease progression. In patients who have progressed to symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, certain therapies have been demonstrated to improve survival, decrease hospitalizations, and reduce symptoms. The mainstay therapies are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers (bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol XL/CR), with diuretics to control fluid balance. In patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors because of angioedema or severe cough, valsartan can be substituted. Valsartan should not be added in patients already taking an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker. Spironolactone is recommended in patients who have New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III to IV symptoms despite maximal therapies with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, and digoxin. Low-dose digoxin, yielding a serum concentration < 1 ng/mL can be added to improve symptoms and, possibly, mortality. The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate might be useful in patients (especially in African Americans) who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or valsartan because of hypotension or renal dysfunction. Calcium antagonists, with the exception of amlodipine, oral or intravenous inotropes, and vasodilators, should be avoided in HF with reduced systolic function. Amiodarone should be used only if patients have a history of sudden death, or a history of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia, and should be used in conjunction with an implantable defibrillator. Finally, anticoagulation is recommended only in patients who have concomitant atrial fibrillation or a previous history of cerebral or systemic emboli.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) — the HF specialist is experienced and knowledgeable regarding ADHF and should have the cognitive skills to use the clinical history and findings on physical examination to form an accurate initial diagnostic assessment, supplementing this with laboratory studies, hemodynamic studies, and imaging. Hemodynamic assessment is essential, and patients should be categorized using a 2 × 2 profile as either warm or cold or as wet or dry; the majority of patients with ADHF are either normotensive or hypertensive. Many patients with ADHF display impaired systemic perfusion due to decreased cardiac output, and in these cases early initiation of vasodilator pharmacotherapy may be beneficial; a retrospective review of nearly 8,000 cases in the Acute Decompensated HF Registry (ADHERE) found that vasodilator therapy started in the ED, rather than delayed until ward admission, was associated with an abbreviated hospital stay and lower inpatient mortality. The HF specialist should have a working knowledge of vasodilators such as nitroprusside, nitrates, hydralazine, and nesiritide, understand effects on renal perfusion and function, and for chronic HF should consider adjustment of therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, hydralazine, and organic nitrates. The HF specialist should be competent to recognize patients with diminished cardiac output who are unable to tolerate vasodilator therapy and who need agents that increase myocardial contractility or mechanical circulatory support.

OVERDOSAGE

Acute Toxicity

No deaths due to acute poisoning have been reported. Highest known dose survived: adults, 10 g orally.

Oral LD50in rats: 173 and 187 mg/kg.

Signs and Symptoms

Signs and symptoms of overdosage include hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and generalized skin flushing.

Complications can include myocardial ischemia and subsequent myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, and profound shock.

Treatment

There is no specific antidote.

The gastric contents should be evacuated, taking adequate precautions against aspiration and for protection of the airway. An activated charcoal slurry may be instilled if conditions permit. These manipulations may have to be omitted or carried out after cardiovascular status has been stabilized, since they might precipitate cardiac arrhythmias or increase the depth of shock.

Support of the cardiovascular system is of primary importance. Shock should be treated with plasma expanders. If possible, vasopressors should not be given, but if a vasopressor is required, care should be taken not to precipitate or aggravate cardiac arrhythmia.

Tachycardia responds to beta blockers. Digitalization may be necessary, and renal function should be monitored and supported as required.

No experience has been reported with extracorporeal or peritoneal dialysis.

### Hydralazine targets cAMP-dependent protein kinase leading to sirtuin1 / 5 activation and lifespan extension in C. elegans [^69126655]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Actions of PKA signaling in cardiovascular function and vasorelaxation are well known. PKA also regulates the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA2) in reuptake of Ca 2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is implicated in heart failure. Activation of SERCA2a has been proposed as the mechanism by which hydralazine promotes myocyte contractility. Although we cannot rule out other mechanism(s), activation of PKA by hydralazine may be the underlying mechanism explaining the effectiveness of the drug in treating hypertension and heart failure.

We also investigated the impact of mitochondrial activation on the prolongevity effect of hydralazine in C. elegans. The impact of mitochondrial health and activation on aging is complex and controversial. A mild reduction in mitochondrial activity has been shown to extend lifespan in C. elegans and killifish. On the other hand, increasing mitochondrial function and respiration has been shown to mediate longevity benefits of CR. We demonstrated that inhibition of mitochondrial activity, either chemically or genetically, blocks the prolongevity effects of hydralazine in C. elegans (Fig. 3g–i). In agreement with our previously published lifespan data, the presence of neuronal ASI but not intestinal SKN-1 is necessary for hydralazine-mediated activation of mitochondria (Fig. 3i). A possible explanation for the complementary effect of intestinal SKN-1 in prolongevity benefit of hydralazine is the critical role that intestinal SKN-1 plays in ROS homeostasis that elevates after mitochondria activation (Fig. 6e). The activation of intestinal SKN-1 with hydralazine decreases the ROS generated by activated mitochondria which is known to have an adverse effect on health and lifespan.

### New management strategies in heart failure [^7acafb76]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Despite > 100 clinical trials, only 2 new drugs had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic heart failure in more than a decade: the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone in 2003 and a fixed dose combination of hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate in 2005. In contrast, 2015 has witnessed the Food and Drug Administration approval of 2 new drugs, both for the treatment of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: ivabradine and another combination drug, sacubitril/valsartan or LCZ696. Seemingly overnight, a range of therapeutic possibilities, evoking new physiological mechanisms, promise great hope for a disease that often carries a prognosis worse than many forms of cancer. Importantly, the newly available therapies represent a culmination of basic and translational research that actually spans many decades. This review will summarize newer drugs currently being used in the treatment of heart failure, as well as newer strategies increasingly explored for their utility during the stages of the heart failure syndrome.

### Oral hydralazine therapy for acute pulmonary embolism and low output state… [^eb958938]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Shortly after pelvic surgery, massive bilateral pulmonary emboli and shock developed in an elderly woman. Despite fluids, dopamine hydrochloride, and heparin sodium, her condition steadily deteriorated. Two trials of hydralazine hydrochloride were given and each was associated with pronounced clinical and hemodynamic improvements. Ninety minutes and 24 hours after the first trial, her pulmonary vascular resistance decreased 44% and 67%, respectively, and cardiac index increased 40% and 90%, respectively. There were insignificant changes in heart rate and blood pressure. The hemodynamic improvements reversed when the hydralazine therapy was stopped but improved again during the second trial. Hydralazine may be of substantial benefit to patients with hemodynamic compromise secondary to pulmonary embolism. Bates ER, Crevey BJ, Sprague FR, Pitt B.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^8dc92d09]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Heart Failure

With nearly 6 million Americans living with HF, another 600 000 developing the disease each year, and 1 million related hospitalizations for HF annually, the need exists for a preventive focusthat involves both primary and secondary prevention interventions. Patients at risk for or with HF can be categorized into 1 of 4 stages: Stage A represents patients at risk for HF without structural heart disease, stage B consists of asymptomatic individuals with structural heart disease, stage C includes those with symptoms, and stage D patients are considered refractory. The primary preventive goal in HF is limiting patient progression from stage A or B. Although this can largely be accomplished through lifestyle modification, more widespread detection and treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity can greatly modify risk.

An important additional risk factor for nonischemic cardiomyopathy is exposure to drugs and toxins, such as alcohol, methamphetamine, and anthracycline‐based chemotherapeutic agents. Those who have had exposure to cardiotoxins or have a family history of cardiomyopathy should be aggressively targeted for primary prevention.

Among HF patients with either controlled (stage C) or refractory (stage D) symptoms, "secondary prevention" strategies should be used to prevent hospitalization and/or HF progression. Guideline‐directed medical therapy should be implemented, as cited in the ACC/AHA 2013 HF guidelines to reduce the risk of hospitalization and/or death. In particular, all patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) should be treated with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, as well as a beta blocker shown to provide benefit in this population (bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained‐release metoprolol succinate). For those with a reduced EF and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or greater symptoms, an aldosterone antagonist should be used, with careful monitoring of renal function and potassium level. Black patients and those with persistent symptoms benefit from the addition of combination therapy with hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate. Finally, loop diuretics should be used to prevent and reduce the accumulation of excess fluid.

### Metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes in youth: from diagnosis to treatment [^14d4d21f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

5. Blockers of the sympathetic nervous system, peripheral alpha and beta-blockers and centrally acting alpha agonists such as clonidine, are considered in the treatment of resistant hypertension or when complications present, such as kidney failure. Clonidine causes side effects such as xerostomia, sedation and nasal obstruction. They are available in the American market in transdermic preparation, and their abrupt interruption could cause a hypertensive crisis due to an adrenergic discharge. Peripheral blockers like prazosin and doxasosin, are more widely used these days in association, and their advantage is the non alteration of the metabolic profile, as they even improve insulin sensitivity. The side effects are syncope, especially after the first dose and water retention. In the ALLHAT study, the use of prazozin was associated with negative endpoints and showed an increased incidence of heart failure.

6. Vasodilators like hydralazine and minoxidil are indicated when the blood pressure cannot be controlled, especially in children with kidney failure. These agents can cause tachycardia and water retention, and the concomitant use of diuretics may become necessary, especially in kidney failure, as well as the use of beta-blockers, for the reduction of heart rate. Hydralazine can cause lupus-like syndrome and the prolonged use of minoxidil can trigger hypertrichosis.

It can be concluded that anti-hypertensive treatment in children and adolescents should follow a customized plan according to the clinical condition and metabolic profile of the patient, having the reduction of cardiovascular morbimortality as the primary goal.

### Individualization of antihypertensive drug treatment [^68ab9ee4]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive drug classes are usually classified as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th or 5th choice to help physicians select the drug most suitable for treatment initiation among the very many classes available to lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with a BP elevation. However, this approach was appropriate decades ago when several drugs had inconveniences that made their use in monotherapy inadvisable. An example was the then widely used vasodilator hydralazine whose sodium-retaining and tachycardic effects made its administration recommendable only with a diuretic or a β-blocker, with, thus, a classification as a 2nd- or 3rd-choice drug. This is no longer the case because several current antihypertensive drug classes are characterized by a similar BP-lowering effect, a good tolerability profile, and evidence of cardiovascular protection in prospective randomized trials. As recently argued in a document of the European Society of Hypertension, this implies that rather than classifying drugs as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and further choice, it might be more appropriate to help physicians select the drug (or drug combination) that might be preferred for treatment initiation in a given patient or a given clinical condition. This article will discuss the factors that may help physicians move toward this more individualized treatment approach.

### Combination sodium nitrite and hydralazine therapy attenuates heart failure with preserved ejection fraction severity in a "2-hit" murine model [^f48821e9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, treatment of this "2‐hit" murine model of HFpEF with either sodium nitrite or hydralazine alone failed to exert the same beneficial effects of the combination of these agents. We failed to observe any significant increase in cardiac or circulating levels of nitrite or any effects on oxidative stress or inflammation with monotherapy. We did observe some benefit in terms of LV diastolic performance and in terms of vascular reactivity. These data suggest that the combination of a potent, physiological NO donor with hydralazine is superior to NO therapy alone and may provide insights regarding the application of similar therapies for HFpEF.

In HFrEF, the combination of ISDN and hydralazine has been shown to be effective to ameliorate disease severity and mortality yet has not been shown to be effective this far in limited investigation with regard to HFpEF pathology. The mechanisms of action for ISDN and sodium nitrite, investigated in this study, are also different, and the NO release by ISDN is significantly less than that of nitrite. ISDN has been previously shown to mediate vasorelaxation signaling directly, without the release of substantial NO to the local environment. In contrast, sodium nitrite is reduced to NO readily, through changes in pH and the activity of endogenous oxidoreductases.

### Hydralazine hydrochloride tablets, USP Rx only 8483301 /… [^34f5ad35]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

HYDRALAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE- hydralazine hydrochloride tablet American Health Packaging ----------. Although the precise mechanism of action of hydrALAZINE is not fully understood, the major effects are on the cardiovascular system. HydrALAZINE apparently lowers blood pressure by exerting a peripheral vasodilating effect through a direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. HydrALAZINE, by altering cellular calcium metabolism, interferes with the calcium movements within the vascular smooth muscle that are responsible for initiating or maintaining the contractile state. The peripheral vasodilating effect of hydrALAZINE results in decreased arterial blood pressure; decreased peripheral vascular resistance; and an increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. The preferential dilatation of arterioles, as compared to veins, minimizes postural hypotension and promotes the increase in cardiac output.

Myocardial stimulation produced by hydrALAZINE can cause anginal attacks and ECG changes of myocardial ischemia. The drug has been implicated in the production of myocardial infarction. It must, therefore, be used with caution in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The "hyperdynamic" circulation caused by hydrALAZINE may accentuate specific cardiovascular inadequacies. For example, hydrALAZINE may increase pulmonary artery pressure in patients with mitral valvular disease. The drug may reduce the pressor responses to epinephrine. Postural hypotension may result from hydrALAZINE but is less common than with ganglionic blocking agents. It should be used with caution in patients with cerebral vascular accidents. In hypertensive patients with normal kidneys who are treated with hydrALAZINE, there is evidence of increased renal blood flow and a maintenance of glomerular filtration rate.

In some instances where control values were below normal, improved renal function has been noted after administration of hydrALAZINE. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, hydrALAZINE should be used with caution in patients with advanced renal damage. Support of the cardiovascular system is of primary importance. Shock should be treated with plasma expanders. If possible, vasopressors should not be given, but if a vasopressor is required, care should be taken not to precipitate or aggravate cardiac arrhythmia. Tachycardia responds to beta blockers. Digitalization may be necessary, and renal function should be monitored and supported as required.

### Usefulness of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine as add-on therapy in patients discharged for advanced decompensated heart failure [^012679a4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Data supporting the use of oral isosorbide dinitrate and/or hydralazine (I/H) as add-on therapy to standard neurohormonal antagonists in advanced decompensated heart failure (ADHF) are limited, especially in the non-African-American population. Our objective was to determine if addition of I/H to standard neurohormonal blockade in patients discharged from the hospital with ADHF is associated with improved hemodynamic profiles and improved clinical outcomes. We reviewed consecutive patients with ADHF admitted from 2003 to 2006 with a cardiac index ≤ 2.2 L/min/m(2) admitted for intensive medical therapy. Patients discharged with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (control group) were compared with those receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers plus I/H (I/H group). The control (n = 97) and I/H (n = 142) groups had similar demographic characteristics, baseline blood pressure, and renal function. Patients in the I/H group had a significantly higher estimated systemic vascular resistance (1,660 vs 1,452 dynes/cm(5), p < 0.001) and a lower cardiac index (1.7 vs 1.9 L/min/m(2), p < 0.001) on admission. The I/H group achieved a similar decrease in intracardiac filling pressures and discharge blood pressures as controls, but had greater improvement in cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance. Use of I/H was associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality (34% vs 41%, odds ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.99, p = 0.04) and all-cause mortality/heart failure rehospitalization (70% vs 85%, odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.97, p = 0.03), irrespective of race. In conclusion, the addition of I/H to neurohormonal blockade is associated with a more favorable hemodynamic profile and long-term clinical outcomes in patients discharged with low-output ADHF regardless of race.

### Combination sodium nitrite and hydralazine therapy attenuates heart failure with preserved ejection fraction severity in a "2-hit" murine model [^905d875c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Generation of NO in an oxidative, proinflammatory environment results in irreversible peroxynitrite radical formation by rapidly reacting with superoxide. Once formed, peroxynitrite radical promotes nitrosative stress leading to end organ damage and increased incidence of adverse outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesized that perhaps the failure of HFpEF clinical trials that solely targeted NO signaling may be in part because of the lack of antioxidant scavenging.

It is well established that hydralazine acts as a potent inhibitor of both superoxide and peroxynitrite radical formationand when given in combination with NO modulators such as nitroglycerinand ISDN nitrate‐responsive vasodilation is preserved. Currently, the combination of ISDN and hydralazine is used clinically in patients with HFrEF but only in those who cannot receive either angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and in symptomatic Black patients on optimal neurohumoral therapy. Therefore, we investigated whether a "2‐hit" nitrite and hydralazine combination therapy could be efficacious in the "2‐hit" mouse model of HFpEF.

In the present study, we first determined circulating and cardiac NO bioavailability in the "2‐hit" murine HFpEF model. Next, we evaluated the efficacy of a NO donor (ie, sodium nitrite) in combination with a potent vasodilator that exerts powerful antioxidant effects (ie, hydralazine) in this "2‐hit" preclinical HFpEF model.

The approach to hypertension is the same for all women, including those with comorbidities such as chronic renal disease. The only exception is white‐coat hypertension unless women develop blood pressure levels ≥ 160/110 mmHg in the office/hospital setting.

No antihypertensive agent has been shown to be superior to others for treatment of nonsevere hypertension, but oral labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa are used most commonly. Less commonly used but acceptable antihypertensive agents include other beta‐blockers (e.g. oxprenolol). Other potential agents are less desirable but not contraindicated, based on unproven concerns about maternal tachycardia when used alone (i.e. hydralazine), stillbirth in the setting of pre‐eclampsia (i.e. prazosin), or theoretical hazards of reduced maternal circulating volume (i.e. diuretics).

### Hydralazine-induced liver injury: a review and discussion [^47e7a5c9]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Hydralazine is a commonly prescribed antihypertensive agent. Some of its labelled adverse reactions include lupus-like syndrome, tachycardia, headache and fever. Despite its well-known side effects, little is known about hydralazine's hepatotoxic effects. We report the case of a 54-year-old female patient who was started on hydralazine for hypertension management but later presented with hydralazine-induced liver injury. Her initial presentation consisted of non-specific symptoms and a hepatocellular injury pattern. Liver biopsy revealed hepatic steatosis. Three weeks after discontinuation of hydralazine, the patient's liver enzymes normalised, and her symptoms resolved. Few studies have examined the incidence and mechanism by which hydralazine induces a liver injury pattern. With this case, we review the literature, the pathogenesis involved and the eventual management of hydralazine-induced liver injury. We propose close monitoring of liver enzymes for patients on hydralazine throughout their treatment course.

### Evaluation of quality of care for US veterans with recent-onset heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^7140df38]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Multiple guideline-recommended therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are available and promoted by performance measures. However, contemporary data on the use of these therapies are limited.

Objective

To evaluate trends in guideline-directed medical therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use, and risk-adjusted mortality among patients with recent-onset HFrEF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed claims and electronic health record data of patients with recent-onset HFrEF diagnosed at US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system facilities from July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2019. Veterans who had a history of heart transplant or used a ventricular assist device were among the patients who were excluded.

Exposures

Guideline-directed medical therapy (any β-blocker, guideline-recommended β-blocker [bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate], angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and hydralazine plus nitrate) and ICD.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment rates for guideline-directed medical therapies and ICDs were calculated within 6 months of the index HFrEF date using medication fills, procedural codes for implantation and monitoring, and diagnosis codes. Risk-adjusted mortality was calculated after adjusting for baseline patient characteristics. For both treatment rates and risk-adjusted mortality, we evaluated the change over 3 periods (period 1: July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2015; period 2: July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017; and period 3: July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2019) and variation across VA facilities.

Results

The final cohort comprised 144 074 eligible patients with incident HFrEF that was diagnosed between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2019. The cohort had a mean (SD) age of 71.0 (11.4) years and was mostly composed of men (140 765 [97.7%]). Overall, changes in medical therapy rates were minimal over time, with the use of a guideline-recommended β-blocker increasing from 64.2% in 2013 to 72.0% in 2019. Rates for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy increased from 23.9% in 2013 to 26.9% in 2019, and rates for hydralazine plus nitrate therapy remained stable at 24.2% over the study period. Rates for angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor therapy increased since its introduction in 2015 but only to 22.6% in 2019. Among patients with an ICD indication, early use rates decreased over time. Substantial variation in medical therapy rates persisted across VA facilities. Risk-adjusted mortality decreased over the study period from 19.9% (95% CI, 19.6%-20.2%) in July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2015, to 18.4% (95% CI, 18.0%-18.7%) in July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2019 (OR, 0.96 per additional year; 95% CI, 0.96–0.97).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found only marginal improvement between 2013 and 2019 in the guideline-recommended therapy and mortality rates among patients with recent-onset HFrEF. New approaches to increase the uptake of evidence-based HFrEF treatment are urgently needed and could lead to larger reductions in mortality.

### A randomized pilot study of aortic waveform guided therapy in chronic heart failure [^5cf77303]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Secondary Endpoints

Compared with baseline, there were significant reductions in both brachial and central systolic BP and Ea in subjects randomized to active treatment (all P < 0.05; Table 5). However, changes in each of these arterial parameters were numerically similar in controls, with no between‐group differences in the magnitude reduction.

Table 5.
Changes in Ventricular‐Vascular Function

Left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic volumes significantly decreased during the study in both groups (each P < 0.05, Table 5), consistent with reverse remodeling, but as with the arterial effects, the magnitude of reduction in LV volumes was similar in active treatment and controls. Reductions in arterial afterload were coupled with significant increases in forward stroke volume in each group (P < 0.05), though again, the magnitude of change was not different in active treatment compared with controls. There were no changes in left ventricular EF or diastolic function within or between the groups.

Medication changes during the study were common in both groups, but were over 2‐fold more frequent in the active treatment arm (Figure 3 A). There were 0.9 and 0.4 medication changes per study visit in active treatment and controls (P < 0.0001). An average of 4.4 adjustments were made in active treatment subjects compared with 2.2 changes over the study period in controls (P < 0.0001). Accordingly, active treatment subjects were more likely to be initiated and maintained on aldosterone antagonists, nitrates, or hydralazine compared with controls by study conclusion (Figure 3 B). Among subjects receiving these medications at study conclusion, dosages were similar in active treatment and controls for aldosterone antagonists (33 ± 20 mg versus 22 ± 6 mg, P = 0.3), nitrates (54 ± 38 mg versus 56 ± 41 mg, P = 0.9), and hydralazine (118 ± 120 mg versus 60 ± 57 mg, P = 0.15), indicating that the group differences in additional HF medication use were driven by the number of agents prescribed, rather than by dosage achieved. Aldosterone antagonists were initiated but stopped because of hyperkalemia in 1 control and 2 active treatment subjects.

### Hydralazine induces stress resistance and extends C. elegans lifespan by activating the NRF2 / SKN-1 signalling pathway [^cbf79113]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We utilized a widely used dietary restriction genetic model (eat-2) to investigate the mechanism of hydralazine-mediated SKN-1 activation. The eat-2 worms have a mutation in a nicotinic acetylcholine channel that reduces pharyngeal pumping and food intake, leading to an extended lifespan. Hydralazine treatment (100 µM) did not result in lifespan extension in eat-2 C. elegans indicating a possible overlap between dietary restriction and hydralazine mechanism(s) of action (Fig. 5g). We measured the pharyngeal pumping rate of wild type young (day 4) C. elegans treated with 100 µM hydralazine to confirm that hydralazine did not inhibit food uptake by changing pharynx contraction rate (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Reduction in lipofuscin accumulation and brood size are two major phenotypes of dietary restriction. To further validate our hypothesis, we measured fluorescence absorbance corresponding to lipofuscin accumulation and the number of C. elegans progeny in populations treated with 100 µM hydralazine. Both parameters showed significant reduction with hydralazine treatment, further supporting hydralazine as a DR mimetic (Fig. 5h, i).

To investigate the role of other pathways involved in aging paradigm, we measured the lifespan in mutant daf-16 (mu86) C. elegans, observing ~20% increase in lifespan (Supplementary Fig. 5e). We ruled out induction of ER stress as the hydralazine mechanism of action by tracing hsp-4p ::GFP protein, a reporter of UPR ER activation, in worms treated with 100 µM for 72 h by fluorescence microscopic imaging (Supplementary Fig. 5f). We measured HIF1A and HSF1, both known to affect lifespan, in SH-SY5Y cells treated with 10 µM hydralazine. Neither of them showed a significant change with western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5g).

### Effectiveness of hydralazine / isosorbide dinitrate in racial / ethnic subgroups with heart failure [^91fcfa20]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The addition of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate (H-ISDN) to a standard heart failure treatment regimen in the African-American Heart Failure Trial was associated with a 43% reduction in mortality. However, the effectiveness of H-ISDN in a community sample of African-American patients and other racial/ethnic groups is unknown.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the associations between treatment with H-ISDN and mortality or hospitalization for heart failure in veterans with the disease.

Methods

For this retrospective cohort study, electronic data on outpatient prescriptions, comorbidity, and other heart failure risk factors were analyzed in veterans with heart failure. Patients were classified based on whether they were prescribed H-ISDN and subclassified based on race/ethnicity (African American, Hispanic, or white). Patients who were prescribed H-ISDN were subclassified based on time of initiation of H-ISDN treatment (0–121, 122–365, or > 365 days after diagnosis). Data were analyzed using propensity-adjusted Cox regression analyses, with exposure to H-ISDN modeled as a time-varying covariate.

Results

Data from 76,828 veterans were analyzed (98% men, 2% women). H-ISDN prescription was not associated with the risk of death in 5 of the 9 subgroups predefined by race/ethnicity or time of initiation of H-ISDN; however, H-ISDN was associated with an increased risk of death in the 4 subgroups with longer times to initiation. H-ISDN was associated with a significantly increased risk of heart failure hospitalization in all but 1 of the 9 subgroups. The risk of both mortality and hospitalization associated with H-ISDN was significantly lower in African-American patients than in those who were Hispanic or white. Concurrent prescription of other, evidence-based heart failure therapies (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and combinations) had strong, statistically significant associations with reduced mortality.

Conclusions

In this population of veterans with heart failure, H-ISDN prescription was not associated with significant reductions in mortality or hospitalization in any of the subgroups defined by race/ethnicity and time of initiation of H-ISDN analyzed compared with the group that did not receive H-ISDN. It is possible, or even likely, that unmeasured differences in important risk factors-particularly heart failure severity and left ventricular dysfunction-between the group that received H-ISDN and the one that did not masked a beneficial effect of H-ISDN. Therefore, our conclusions must be regarded as hypothesis generating and need to be tested in subsequent randomized trial(s).

### Acute drug reaction to phenylephrine and tropicamide collyrium in a late-preterm newborn: a case report [^fe1d5ec4]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

As reported in the case description, our patient never required resuscitation maneuvers. In fact, his initial apnea resolved after tactile stimulation and then, despite being bradycardic, the baby always remained in good clinical conditions. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not indicated in newborns with isolated bradycardia, i.e. without oxygen desaturation. The child was closely monitored in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit until the arrythmia resolved, and always remained in good clinical conditions.

Interestingly, we also like to highlight that our patient's bradycardia developed before the actual fundus examination, and thus his clinical symptoms are not attributable to the cumulative effect of stress and pain of the ophthalmological examination.

Apart from newborns, adverse reaction to phenylephrine and tropicamide collyrium are very rare. A 2015 systemic review and metanalysis that included 916 participants showed that, in the adult population, 2.5% phenylephrine eye drops did not lead to clinically relevant change in blood pressure and heart rate, and 10% phenylephrine collyrium caused only short-lived blood pressure and heart rate rise. Severe adverse events to phenylephrine collyrium are described mainly in relation to ophthalmological procedures, as reported by Abdelhalim et al. The authors described the case of a 4-year-old boy who developed severe hypertension and acute pulmonary edema during retinal surgery (i.e. after surgical incision of the eye) due to systemic absorption of topical phenylephrine eye drops. The severe adverse reaction was characterized by an abrupt drop in oxygen saturation, a rapid increase of blood pressure (220/120 mmHg) associated with tachycardia (140 beats per minute) and the development of chest crepitations and intratracheal secretions. Hydralazine and furosemide were administered and, after 20 min from the onset of the event, all vital parameters went back to normal.

### The heart rate hypothesis: ready to be tested [^6c4852ac]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that increased heart rate may be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality both in patients with ischaemic heart disease and in the general population. Elevated heart rate in coronary artery disease is a major determinant of oxygen consumption and appears to evoke most episodes of ischaemia. Increased resting heart rate may also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, facilitate plaque destabilisation and initiate arrhythmias, leading to acute coronary events and sudden death. Reducing heart rate is a central aim in the treatment of stable angina pectoris; this therapeutic approach may have an essential role in lowering the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease. However, this heart rate hypothesis has not thus far been proven. Evidence suggests that the use of heart rate-lowering drugs may have a beneficial effect; however, most treatments for angina have additional negative inotropic effects on the heart. This hypothesis can now be tested following the recent development of selective heart rate drugs.
