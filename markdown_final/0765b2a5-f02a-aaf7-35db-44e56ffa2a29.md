## Question

Treatment for PVCs and bradycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for PVCs and bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical scenario and whether the bradycardia is true physiologic bradycardia or pseudo-bradycardia from frequent PVCs. Then, I should verify the initial workup and risk stratification, including ECG, echocardiography, and ambulatory monitoring. Next, I will consider management of PVCs by burden and ventricular function, followed by management of true bradycardia per guideline-directed pacing indications. After that, I need to address special populations and reconcile conflicting guidance on antiarrhythmic drug choices. Finally, I will outline follow-up, monitoring, and a practical decision algorithm, making sure I double-check thresholds and evidence strength at each step.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario, because I need to ensure we are not conflating pseudo-bradycardia from frequent PVCs with true sinus-node or conduction-system bradycardia. Frequent PVCs can create an underestimation of the effective cardiac output and even a low pulse rate on automated devices, yet the intrinsic sinus mechanism may be normal, so I should verify with a 12-lead ECG and careful pulse assessment before labeling this as bradycardia requiring pacing [^e17fcb1f].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation and risk stratification. I need to check for structural heart disease with echocardiography, quantify PVC burden with ambulatory monitoring, and assess for ischemia or infiltrative disease when indicated. Very frequent PVCs, generally more than 15% of beats, are associated with PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy, and a burden above about 10% has been linked to LV dysfunction in observational cohorts, so I should confirm the burden and morphology before deciding on therapy [^750fd305] [^0d955e96] [^75bb6b2d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment until I classify PVC management by burden and ventricular function. For low-burden PVCs with preserved LVEF and minimal symptoms, reassurance and observation are appropriate. For symptomatic patients with normal LVEF, beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are first-line to reduce symptoms and PVC frequency. For high-burden PVCs, typically more than 15% of beats, especially with LV dysfunction or suspected PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy, catheter ablation is preferred when feasible, with antiarrhythmic drugs as an alternative when ablation is not desired or not possible [^750fd305] [^702a0eda] [^308bbbe4] [^7ac4521d].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence for ablation versus drugs. Contemporary systematic reviews suggest ablation achieves greater PVC suppression and lower recurrence than antiarrhythmic drugs, with acute success around 80–90% in experienced centers, though success varies by PVC origin and procedure factors. Importantly, successful PVC suppression often leads to normalization of LV function in PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy, which strengthens the case for definitive therapy when the burden is high and the ventricle is impaired [^f062ce42] [^6559cb15] [^0d955e96].

> Wait, let me verify the role of antiarrhythmic drugs when ablation is deferred or unavailable. Class IC agents like flecainide can be highly effective for suppressing PVCs, but I must avoid them in patients with structural heart disease or coronary artery disease due to proarrhythmic risk. In carefully selected patients with idiopathic PVCs and normal ventricular function, flecainide or propafenone can be considered, whereas in those with LV dysfunction, amiodarone is reasonable though limited by long-term toxicity. Sotalol is an option but should be used cautiously in markedly reduced EF due to torsades risk and negative inotropy [^33887ea6] [^c746dd52] [^42397721].

> I will now examine true bradycardia management, because if the patient has genuine sinus-node dysfunction or conduction disease, pacing indications are separate from PVC therapy. I need to ensure I apply ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guidelines: permanent pacing is indicated for symptomatic bradycardia, high-grade AV block, or certain conduction abnormalities, and I should first correct reversible causes such as drugs, ischemia, or electrolytes before committing to pacing. In patients who also have frequent PVCs, device-based PVC quantification can underestimate burden, so I should not rely on CIED PVC counts to exclude clinically significant ectopy [^3b6dc559] [^a365ba0c] [^b988e6c0].

> But wait, what if the bradycardia is actually PVC-mediated concealed mechanical bradycardia with cardiomyopathy. In that scenario, the correct treatment is to suppress the PVCs rather than pace for bradycardia, because eliminating the ectopy restores effective cardiac output and can reverse LV dysfunction. I should confirm the diagnosis with a therapeutic trial of PVC suppression or ablation and document LV recovery to validate the causal relationship [^e17fcb1f] [^02792729].

> Let me consider special populations and reconcile guidance. In athletes with frequent PVCs, I should confirm absence of structural disease and consider conservative management with periodic reassessment, reserving ablation for symptoms or LV dysfunction. In older adults, age alone should not preclude ablation, and outcomes appear comparable to younger patients. In patients with CRT, frequent PVCs can impair biventricular pacing, so suppressing PVCs or considering ablation can improve CRT delivery and LV function [^c5a86f05] [^75689ca3] [^319b9757].

> Hold on, I should verify conflicting recommendations about amiodarone. The ESC advises against amiodarone as first-line for idiopathic PVCs without structural disease, whereas AHA/ACC/HRS guidance supports amiodarone as a reasonable option when PVCs contribute to cardiomyopathy or when other therapies fail. I need to align the choice with the presence of structural heart disease, LV function, symptom burden, and patient preferences, and I should monitor closely for pulmonary, hepatic, thyroid, and ocular toxicity if amiodarone is used [^02cd1973] [^8004bbe2] [^c746dd52].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring. I need to ensure periodic echocardiography to detect evolving LV dysfunction, repeat ambulatory monitoring to quantify PVC burden given substantial day-to-day variability, and tailor therapy accordingly. If I initially choose medical therapy, I should reassess efficacy and tolerability within about 3 months and pivot to ablation if suppression is inadequate or adverse effects emerge [^666fe65e] [^e79abb4b].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway, and I will double-check thresholds as I go. If the ECG shows frequent PVCs with slow apparent heart rate, I first confirm true versus pseudo-bradycardia and assess symptoms, PVC burden, and LV function. If LVEF is preserved and symptoms are mild, I start with a beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and reassess. If LVEF is reduced or PVC burden exceeds about 15%, I favor catheter ablation when feasible, with amiodarone as an alternative when ablation is not preferred or not possible. If there is true sinus-node dysfunction or AV block causing symptomatic bradycardia, I proceed with guideline-directed pacing independent of PVC therapy, while continuing to manage the PVCs as indicated by burden and ventricular function [^750fd305] [^308bbbe4] [^3b6dc559].

> Finally, I should confirm key safety pearls. Class IC drugs are contraindicated in structural heart disease or prior MI due to increased mortality, so I must screen carefully. Sotalol requires inpatient initiation with QT monitoring in many patients, especially with reduced EF. And although ablation is generally safe and effective, rare complications like tamponade or vascular injury can occur, so shared decision-making and operator experience matter [^15ce5bb3] [^c746dd52] [^6559cb15].

For PVCs with bradycardia, **treat only if symptomatic or if there is LV dysfunction** [^750fd305]. Use **beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** for symptomatic PVCs in patients with normal LV function [^702a0eda]; consider catheter ablation if PVC burden is high (> 15%) [^308bbbe4] or if medical therapy fails [^7ac4521d]. For true bradycardia, **pace if symptomatic or if there is high-grade AV block** [^3b6dc559]; avoid antiarrhythmics that worsen bradycardia (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) [^c746dd52] unless pacing is in place. Monitor for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy [^e17fcb1f] and reassess LV function after treatment.

---

## Clinical evaluation and risk stratification

- **ECG**: Identify PVC morphology, burden, and concomitant conduction disease [^750fd305].
- **Echocardiography**: Assess LV function and structural heart disease [^750fd305].
- **Ambulatory monitoring**: Quantify PVC burden and correlate with symptoms [^750fd305].
- **Exercise testing**: Evaluate for ischemia or catecholamine-sensitive PVCs [^notfound].

## Management of PVCs in the setting of bradycardia

### General principles

Avoid **overtreatment** — treat only if symptomatic or if there is LV dysfunction [^750fd305]. Balance therapies that suppress PVCs against those that may worsen bradycardia [^b6b861df]. Reassess LV function after treatment [^e17fcb1f].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

| **Medication class** | **Indications** | **Considerations in bradycardia** |
|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | Symptomatic PVCs with normal LV function | May worsen bradycardia; use cautiously [^b6b861df] |
| Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) | Symptomatic PVCs with normal LV function | May worsen bradycardia; use cautiously [^notfound] |
| Class IC antiarrhythmics (flecainide, propafenone) | High PVC burden (> 15%) with normal LV function | Contraindicated in structural heart disease; monitor for proarrhythmia [^33887ea6] |
| Amiodarone | Structural heart disease or LV dysfunction | Bradycardia risk; monitor closely [^c746dd52] |

---

### Interventional therapy

Catheter ablation is indicated for **high PVC burden (> 15%)** [^308bbbe4], symptomatic PVCs refractory to medical therapy, or PVC-induced cardiomyopathy [^7ac4521d]. Success rates are 70–90% depending on PVC origin [^f31792f9], with low complication rates [^6559cb15].

---

## Management of bradycardia in the setting of PVCs

### Indications for pacing

- **Symptomatic bradycardia**: Syncope, presyncope, fatigue, or dyspnea attributable to bradycardia [^notfound].
- **High-grade AV block**: Second-degree Mobitz II or third-degree AV block [^notfound].
- **Persistent bradycardia**: Despite correction of reversible causes [^a365ba0c].

---

### Pacing strategies

DDD pacing is preferred to preserve AV synchrony [^notfound]. Consider **CRT** if there is LV dysfunction and wide QRS [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **PVC-induced cardiomyopathy**: Treat PVCs aggressively; LV function often normalizes with suppression [^e17fcb1f].
- **Athletes**: Conservative management unless symptomatic or LV dysfunction develops [^c5a86f05].
- **Elderly**: Tailor therapy to comorbidities and frailty [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regularly reassess symptoms, **PVC burden**, and **LV function** [^750fd305]. Adjust therapy based on response and tolerance [^750fd305].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Symptomatic PVCs with normal LV function**: Beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [^702a0eda].
- **High PVC burden (> 15%) or LV dysfunction**: Catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone) [^308bbbe4] [^e71598b4].
- **Symptomatic bradycardia or high-grade AV block**: Permanent pacing [^notfound].
- **Avoid**: Antiarrhythmics that worsen bradycardia unless pacing is in place [^notfound].

---

Management of PVCs with bradycardia requires a **balanced approach** [^750fd305] that treats symptomatic PVCs or LV dysfunction while avoiding therapies that worsen bradycardia. Catheter ablation is effective for high PVC burden or refractory cases, and pacing is indicated for symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disease [^308bbbe4] [^3b6dc559].

Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy

Premature ventricular contractions are the most frequent ventricular arrhythmia and commonly associated with HF, ventricular arrhythmias, and SCD. Frequent PVCs are recognized as a reversible cause of LV systolic dysfunction referred to as 'PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy' (PVC-CM), where PVC suppression will improve and even normalize LV function. The prevalence of PVC-CM is estimated between 10 and 29% in patients with frequent PVCs (> 5–10%). While PVC burden is the most consistent predictor of PVC-M, various factors, including genetics, comorbidities, cardiac phenotype, or PVC features and length of exposure, play a role in the susceptibility or resilience to develop PVC-CM. In addition, PVCs with a longer QRS duration and epicardial location are more frequently associated with PVC-CM, supporting the role of LV dyssynchrony in PVC-CM (Table 2 and Figure 1).

Table 2
Clinical and premature ventricular contraction features to identify premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy

Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy can present with or without fatigue, HF symptoms, syncope, and SCD. Frequently, patients are referred for bradycardia due to bigeminy where heart rate is underestimated (i.e. pseudo-bradycardia) due to the lack of pulse pressure generated by PVC. The time to develop PVC-CM is unknown, but probably months or years of exposure to frequent PVCs are needed.

Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy diagnosis should be suspected if PVC burden is > 5–10% and other causes of HF are excluded, and confirmed only if PVC suppression improves and even normalizes LV function. A major diagnosis challenge is when PVCs cannot be successfully eliminated. A frequent dilemma is to determine whether the PVCs are a bystander or the cause of CM. Some PVCs and clinical features (e.g. absence of scar) can assist to differentiate these two scenarios (Table 2).

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are common findings in asymptomatic participants during ECG recordings. While most PVCs are treated conservatively, some patients may develop adverse cardiac events needing further investigations and definitive ablation by radiofrequency. Spectral strain ultrasonography has demonstrated ventricular dysfunction as a sequel to high burden PVCs, but the exact underlying pathophysiology is still uncertain. Cohort studies have associated PVCs with increased risks for overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and yet consensus is still lacking for threshold in treating PVCs. Our case is that of a 54-year-old woman with an unusual bradycardiac presentation of PVCs and an ECG that changed rapidly within minutes.

### Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: what's new? [^ba188274]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias can present as asymptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), symptomatic presentation of the former arrhythmias, or sustained VT with minimal symptoms to full hemodynamic collapse. The most important and feared consequence of VT is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Independent of SCD risk, frequent ventricular arrhythmias can cause substantial symptoms. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the foundation of managing patients at high risk for SCD due to their ability to automatically identify and defibrillate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Unfortunately, defibrillation is associated with significant physical and emotional adverse effects. Other treatment options include antiarrhythmic drugs, which have substantial toxicities and limited efficacy, and catheter ablation. The techniques and strategies for VT ablation have advanced considerably in recent years leading to a rapid expansion of indications and use. In this review, we discuss current state of the art therapies for ventricular arrhythmias and highlight some of the most promising areas of ongoing development.

There is a growing body of literature focusing on the morphology, management, and outcomes of PVCs in athletes. This review summarizes this literature and establishes recommendations on management, treatment, and indications for specialist referral in this patient population. The sports medicine physician's responses and recommendation should be made in conjunction with the athletes wishes. Medications or ablations are not always necessary in all athletes if they are followed with regular evaluations.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes — evaluation considerations: Because some studies have shown an association of PVCs with adverse outcomes, the detection of PVCs, particularly if multifocal and frequent, is generally considered a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and such patients are generally evaluated to ensure they do not have underlying conditions (eg, ischemic heart disease, left ventricular [LV] dysfunction) that warrant further treatment to reduce risk.

### Idiopathic malignant premature ventricular contractions [^f79b18a1]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in patients with structurally normal hearts was once considered a benign phenomenon. However, in susceptible patients, these "benign" or idiopathic PVCs may develop malignant potential and trigger ventricular fibrillation and result in sudden cardiac death. Alternatively, idiopathic PVCs can also induce cardiomyopathy. Clinical recognition of these entities can lead to effective targeted therapy. In the first instance, treatment consists of ablating the PVC source and implanting a defibrillator, whereas in the second scenario, ablating the PVC origin can normalize left ventricular function.

### Performance of cardiac implantable electronic devices in detecting premature ventricular contraction burden [^b988e6c0]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) can cause or exacerbate cardiomyopathy. At-risk patients often have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) for treating bradycardia or ventricular arrhythmias. Many modern CIEDs also collect objective data about arrhythmias, including PVCs. However, the performance of CIEDs for quantifying PVC burden remains unclear.

Objective

This study aimed to determine the performance of CIEDs for quantifying PVC burden compared with ambulatory cardiac monitoring, which is the standard of care.

Methods

We identified adult patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center with CIEDs who underwent concurrent ambulatory cardiac monitoring with Holter or mobile cardiac telemetry. Patients who received PVC ablations or antiarrhythmic medication changes during the CIED interrogation period of interest were excluded. The study population included a total of 439 patients and 571 instances of concurrent device monitoring. We then developed ordinal regression models to investigate the differences in detected PVC burdens between the 2 device groups.

Results

The median PVC burden detected by ambulatory monitoring and CIED was 1.90% (Q1-Q3, 0.10%-9.65%) and 0.61% (Q1-Q3, 0.02%-4.36%), respectively. In general, PVC burden detected by CIED underestimated that detected by ambulatory monitoring. Furthermore, when the PVC burden detected by the ambulatory monitor is ≥ 15%, the probability of a CIED also detecting a burden of ≥ 15% is approximately 11%.

Conclusion

CIEDs underestimate PVC burden compared with ambulatory cardiac monitoring. Clinicians should not solely rely on PVC data from CIEDs to rule out a clinically relevant PVC burden.

PVC-induced cardiomyopathy — recommendations: For patients who require arrhythmia suppression for symptoms or declining ventricular function suspected to be due to frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (generally > 15% of beats and predominately of 1 morphology) and for whom antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference, catheter ablation is useful (COR I, LOE B-NR). In patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, pharmacological treatment (eg, beta blocker, amiodarone) is reasonable to reduce recurrent arrhythmias and improve symptoms and left ventricular (LV) function (COR IIa, LOE B-NR).

### Evaluation and management of premature ventricular complexes [^750fd305]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are extremely common, found in the majority of individuals undergoing long-term ambulatory monitoring. Increasing age, a taller height, a higher blood pressure, a history of heart disease, performance of less physical activity, and smoking each predict a greater PVC frequency. Although the fundamental causes of PVCs remain largely unknown, potential mechanisms for any given PVC include triggered activity, automaticity, and reentry. PVCs are commonly asymptomatic but can also result in palpitations, dyspnea, presyncope, and fatigue. The history, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG are each critical to the diagnosis and evaluation of a PVC. An echocardiogram is indicated in the presence of symptoms or particularly frequent PVCs, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is helpful when the evaluation suggests the presence of associated structural heart disease. Ambulatory monitoring is required to assess PVC frequency. The prognosis of those with PVCs is variable, with ongoing uncertainty regarding the most informative predictors of adverse outcomes. An increased PVC frequency may be a risk factor for heart failure and death, and the resolution of systolic dysfunction after successful catheter ablation of PVCs demonstrates that a causal relationship can be present. Patients with no or mild symptoms, a low PVC burden, and normal ventricular function may be best served with simple reassurance. Either medical treatment or catheter ablation are considered first-line therapies in most patients with PVCs associated with symptoms or a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and patient preference plays a role in determining which to try first. If medical treatment is selected, either β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are reasonable drugs in patients with normal ventricular systolic function. Other antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered if those initial drugs fail and ablation has been declined, has been unsuccessful, or has been deemed inappropriate. Catheter ablation is the most efficacious approach to eradicate PVCs but may confer increased upfront risks. Original research remains necessary to identify individuals at risk for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and to identify preventative and therapeutic approaches targeting the root causes of PVCs to maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk.

### Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs): a narrative review [^b0bd0e1c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes/contractions (PVCs) are relatively common, occurring in 3%-20% of the general population, and are often found during work-up of palpitations or incidentally on routine electrocardiographic testing. They are usually considered benign but can be a sign of underlying cardiac disease and cause significantly impairing symptoms. While often thought of as a problem for the cardiologist, it is not uncommon for PVCs to be identified initially in a primary care or inpatient general medicine setting. This paper will review etiologies, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of PVCs for the internist.

### Catheter ablation vs antiarrhythmic drug therapy for treatment of premature ventricular complexes: a systematic review [^f062ce42]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

There is variability in treatment modalities for premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), including use of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy or catheter ablation (CA). This study reviewed evidence comparing CA vs AADs for the treatment of PVCs. A systematic review was performed from the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases, as well as the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, U.S. National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials database, and the European Union Clinical Trials Register. Five studies (1 randomized controlled trial) enrolling 1,113 patients (57.9% female) were analyzed. Four of five studies recruited mainly patients with outflow tract PVCs. There was significant heterogeneity in AAD choice. Electroanatomic mapping was used in 3 of 5 studies. No studies documented intracardiac echocardiography or contact force-sensing catheter use. Acute procedural endpoints varied (2 of 5 targeted elimination of all PVCs). All studies had significant potential for bias. CA seemed superior to AADs for PVC recurrence, frequency, and burden. One study reported long-term symptoms (CA superior). Quality of life or cost-effectiveness was not reported. Complication and adverse event rates were 0% to 5.6% for CA and 9.5% to 21% for AADs. Future randomized controlled trials will assess CA vs AADs for patients with PVCs without structural heart disease (ECTOPIA [Elimination of Ventricular Premature Beats with Catheter Ablation versus Optimal Antiarrhythmic Drug Treatment]), with impaired LVEF (PAPS [Prospective Assessment of Premature Ventricular Contractions Suppression in Cardiomyopathy] Pilot), and with structural heart disease (CAT-PVC [Catheter Ablation Versus Amiodarone for Therapy of Premature Ventricular Contractions in Patients With Structural Heart Disease]). In conclusion, CA seems to reduce recurrence, burden, and frequency of PVCs compared with AADs. There is a lack of data on patient- and health care-specific outcomes such as symptoms, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Several upcoming trials will offer important insights for management of PVCs.

### Predictors and possible mechanisms of premature ventricular contraction induced cardiomyopathy [^db04d034]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are encountered frequently in clinical practice. While PVCs may have various causes, a small number of individuals with PVCs develop cardiomyopathy in the absence of other potential etiologies. When correctly identified, patients with PVC-incuded cardiomyopathy can have dramatic improvement of their cardiomyopathy with treatment of their PVCs. In this focused review, we discuss potential predictors of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, including PVC frequency, PVC characteristics, and modifiable patient risk factors. We also review some proposed mechanisms of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and conclude with future directions for research and clinical practice.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to management of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing catheter ablation in patients requiring arrhythmia suppression for symptoms or declining ventricular function suspected to be due to frequent premature ventricular complexes (generally > 15% of beats and predominately of 1 morphology) and if antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference.

### Evaluation and treatment of premature ventricular contractions in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^e37f33e9]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are often observed in patients presenting with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). PVCs may in some patients be considered to be the cause of heart failure, while in others it may be the consequence of heart failure. PVCs are important prognostic markers in HFrEF. The uncertainty whether PVCs are the cause or effect in HFrEF impacts clinical decision making. In this review, we discuss the complexity of the cause-effect relationship between PVCs and HFrEF. We demonstrate a workflow with the use of a trial period of amiodarone that may discover whether the reduced LVEF is reversible, the symptoms are due to PVCs and whether biventricular pacing can be increased by the reduction of PVCs. The use of non-invasive and invasive (high-density) mapping techniques may help to improve accuracy and efficacy in the treatment of PVC, which will be demonstrated. With these results in mind, we conclude this review highlighting the future directions for PVC research and treatment.

### Pacemaker therapy for prevention of syncope in patients with recurrent severe vasovagal syncope… [^3fef70a6]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

for the DDD group. The relative risk reduction in time to syncope with DDD pacing was 30%. Lead dislodgement or repositioning occurred in 7 patients. One patient had vein thrombosis, another had pericardial tamponade. pacemaker therapy should not be recommended as first-line therapy for patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope, also known as neurally mediated syncope, is a common problem for which no highly effective pharmacological treatments are available. Because vasovagal syncope episodes are often associated with bradycardia. the patient had received a pacemaker. It is possible that the reported benefit of pacemaker therapy was due in part to a psychological or emotional effect related to receiving a device by means of an invasive procedure. To exclude this possibility and to provide a stronger level of evidence that prevention of bradycardia by means of pacemaker therapy reduces the risk of recurrent.

In the first randomized trial, the Vasovagal Pacemaker Study, 1 patients were randomized to receive or not receive a pacemaker. This pilot trial of pacing was terminated early when a large treatment effect in favor of pacing was observed after enrollment of just 54 patients. Subsequently, 2 other randomized trials of pacing for vasovagal. in the nonpaced group. Whereas in the VPS I study almost 80% of nonpaced patients had syncope by 6 months, in this study only 41% of ODO patients had syncope by 6 months. The 6-month rates of syncope in the patients receiving pacing therapy in the 2 studies were more similar; 20% in VPS I and 31% in the present. is plausible but not proven. The rationale for the use of a pacemaker in vasovagal syncope is that bradycardia often occurs at the time of syncope. Prevention of bradycardia is the main physiological mechanism by which a pacemaker can prevent attacks of syncope. However, patients with vasovagal syncope often experience reductions.

Premature ventricular contractions — consensus statements specify that asymptomatic patients with frequent PVCs (> 500 per 24 h) should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation to rule out any underlying structural, ischaemic, or electrical heart disease; very frequent PVCs (burden > 20%) are a marker of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and may justify intensified follow-up; PVCs should be treated in patients with suspected PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy; and treatment of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic PVCs should focus on the underlying heart disease in order to improve prognosis.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) triggered by premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) — mechanisms, ablation approach, and cautions. Idiopathic VF may be initiated by PVCs that arise from the outflow tracts or the His-Purkinje system within either the right ventricle or left ventricle, and the PVCs usually have a consistent QRS morphology and a short coupling interval and can be targeted for ablation to control the arrhythmia. To maximize the probability of successful ablation, the procedure is best performed during periods of frequent PVCs, and when the PVCs can be identified, ablation is highly successful, but late recurrences are observed in approximately 10% of patients such that implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is prudent even if ablation is acutely successful. The risks of catheter ablation include bleeding at the site of arterial or venous access and a small risk of pericardial tamponade, and therapy with quinidine acutely and chronically can suppress recurrent VF episodes in some patients.

### Premature ventricular contraction-induced concealed mechanical bradycardia and dilated cardiomyopathy [^02792729]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2005). Low credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to frequent isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) has been rarely reported. LV dysfunction and concealed mechanical bradycardia resolved in a patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy after the focal source of PVCs in the LV was eliminated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The patient remained free from PVCs and maintained normal LV function over 36-month follow-up. In a subset of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with frequent isolated PVCs, RFA of the arrhythmic focus restores normal LV function that can be long lasting.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) — exercise, athlete context, and high-burden effects are outlined as follows: PVCs that occur during an exercise test are associated with a higher risk of death, and in 1 study, PVCs that occur during recovery are a stronger predictor of death than PVCs occurring only during exercise. In trained athletes with palpitations, PVCs are common and there does not appear to be increased risk of death at least in those without other cardiovascular abnormalities, and an electrophysiological study may be needed to assess patients' arrhythmogenic risk. Very frequent PVCs, > 1000 to 20000 a day, can be associated with depressed LV function that is reversible with control of the PVCs (PVC-induced cardiomyopathy). Very rarely, idiopathic PVCs from the outflow tract may trigger malignant VA in patients without structural heart disease.

### Mapping and ablation of premature ventricular complexes: state of the art [^973bf0e6]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are common arrhythmias in clinical practice. Although benign and asymptomatic in most cases, PVCs may result in disabling symptoms, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or PVC-induced ventricular fibrillation. Catheter ablation has emerged as a first-line therapy in such cases, with high rates of efficacy and low risk of complications. Significant progress in mapping and ablation technology has been made in the past 2 decades, along with the development of a growing body of knowledge and accumulated experience regarding PVC sites of origin, anatomical relationships, electrocardiographic characterization, and mapping/ablation strategies. This paper provides an overview of the main indications for catheter ablation of PVCs, electrocardiographic features, PVC mapping techniques, and contemporary ablation approaches. The authors also review the most common sites of PVC origin and the main considerations and challenges with ablation in each location.

The medical community's understanding of the consequences of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and PVC-induced cardiomyopathy has been derived mostly from observational and large population-based studies. Due to the difficulty of predicting the development of PVC-cardiomyopathy, the acute and chronic cardiac effects of PVCs and the mechanism of PVC-cardiomyopathy have been derived from pre-clinical studies with large animal models. Recently, these studies have described myocardial substrates that could potentially increase morbidity and mortality in patients with frequent PVCs and PVC-cardiomyopathy. In this paper, we provide an up-to-date comprehensive review of these pre-clinical and clinical studies.

PVC-induced cardiomyopathy — For patients who require arrhythmia suppression for symptoms or declining left ventricular (LV) function suspected to be due to frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (generally > 15% of beats and predominantly of 1 morphology) and for whom antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference, catheter ablation is useful. In patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, pharmacological treatment (eg, beta blocker, amiodarone) is reasonable to reduce recurrent arrhythmias and improve symptoms and LV function. Frequent PVCs (usually > 15% of the total number of beats) may produce a reversible form of LV dysfunction, and LV dysfunction has been associated with greater PVC burden (> 10% and usually > 20%), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), a retrograde P-wave after the PVCs, and interpolated PVCs. In a prospective study of catheter ablation for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, ablation was completely successful in 80% of patients, and LV function normalized within 6 months in 82% of the 22 patients who had depressed ventricular function at baseline. In a double-blind parallel study of 30 patients with or without ischemic heart disease with > 30 PVCs per hour, proarrhythmic effects were present in 1 patient on sotalol; there was no significant difference in suppression of PVCs (sotalol 65%, propranolol 44%), with reduction in ventricular couplets being 39% for sotalol and 49% for propranolol, and there was a significant increase in QTc in patients on sotalol.

1 INTRODUCTION

Catheter ablation has become one of the main treatment strategies in patients with symptomatic palpitations caused by premature ventricular contractions (PVC), when pharmacological treatment is insufficient in suppression of PVC burden or not desired. Furthermore, it has been shown to restore left ventricular function in patients with PVC induced cardiomyopathy, as well as decrease the burden of PVC induced episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF). This has led to a class I recommendation in recent guidelines, when PVCs are considered to be idiopathic or LV dysfunction is present and class IIa in nonidiopathic PVCs.

The success rate of ablation of PVC is considered to range from 84% to 92%, while maintain a low intraprocedural complication rate ranging from 2.5% to 5%. However, acute success rates differ dependent on the localization of the PVC ranging from approximately 90% in patients with outflow tract PVCs to 70% in patients with an epicardial exit. But despite these promising acute procedural outcomes, long‐term reduction of PVC burden after catheter ablation can be improved in conjunction with additional antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Nonetheless, acute procedural success remains the most valuable predictor for long‐term success.

Usually, the setup for ablation of PVC includes an atrial catheter which is placed in the coronary sinus (CS), a right ventricular catheter (RVA), a catheter which is placed alongside the bundle of His and a separate ablation catheter. However, successful ablation side of PVC mainly depends on prematurity of the PVC on the uni‐ and bipolar recording of the ablation catheter, as well as morphological aspects based on pace mapping.

It seems reasonable to reduce the amount of diagnostical catheters to only an ablation catheter, when the symptoms of a patient can be clearly related to PVC. We therefore hypothesize, that the utilization of a single catheter approach for ablation of PVC may reduce vascular complications, procedure, and fluoroscopy times, while maintaining the same acute success rate.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) triggered by premature ventricular contractions — ablation outcomes and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) considerations: During a median postprocedural follow-up of 63 months, 7 (18%) of 38 patients undergoing catheter ablation of idiopathic VF induced by short coupled PVCs experienced VF recurrence at a median follow-up of 4 months, and five of these 7 patients underwent repeat ablation without VF recurrence. Although catheter ablation is very effective in idiopathic VF, the recurrence risk remains substantial after an apparently successful procedure and the patient should be protected with an ICD; when PVCs can be identified, ablation is highly successful, but late recurrences are observed in approximately 10% of patients such that implantation of an ICD is prudent even if ablation is acutely successful. The subcutaneous ICD may not be a good therapy for these patients due to the higher risk of T-wave oversensing seen in this population; therapy with quinidine acutely and chronically can suppress recurrent VF episodes in some patients.

5 CONCLUSION

A direct relationship between palpitations and PVCs could be established only in a minority of patients with frequent PVCs. Therefore, when making treatment decisions, it's important to carefully investigate the correlation between symptoms and arrhythmias. PVCs with a relatively short PVC CI and a long post‐PVC CI were more likely to cause palpitations, whereas palpitations lasting only a few seconds were more likely to be directly relevant to PVCs.

### Are antiarrhythmic agents indicated in premature ventricular complex-induced cardiomyopathy and when? [^33887ea6]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are the most common ventricular arrhythmia that are encountered in the clinical practice. Recent data suggests that high PVC burden may lead to the development of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM) even in patients without structural heart disease. Treatment for effective suppression of PVCs, can reverse PVC-CM. Both antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) and catheter ablation (CA) are recognized treatment modalities for any cardiac arrhythmias. However, with increasing preference of CA, the role of AADs needs further defining regarding their efficacy, safety, indications and patient selection to treat PVC-CM.

Methods

To ascertain the role of AADs to treat PVC-CM; whether they are indicated to treat PVC-CM, and if so, when, we interrogated PubMed and other search engines for English language publications with key words premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), cardiomyopathy, anti-arrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation, and pharmacological agents. All publications were carefully reviewed and scrutinized by the authors for their inclusion in the review paper. For illustration of cases, ethical standard was observed as per the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, and the patient was treated as per the prevailing standard of care. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for conducting the ablation procedure.

Results

Our literature search specifically the pharmacological treatment of PVC-CM with AADs revealed significant paradigm shift in treatment approach for PVCs and PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. No major large, randomized control trials of AADs versus CA for PVC-CM were found. We found that beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are particularly effective in the treatment of PVCs originating from right ventricular outflow tract. For Class Ic AADs - flecainide and propafenone, small clinical studies showed Class Ic AADs to be effective in PVC suppression, but their usage was not recommended in patients with significant coronary artery disease. Mexiletine was found to have modest effect on PVC suppression. Studies showed sotalol to significantly reduce PVCs frequency in patients receiving both low and high doses. Studies also showed amiodarone to have higher successful PVC suppression, but not recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with idiopathic PVCs in the absence of symptoms and left ventricular dysfunction. For dronedarone, no major clinical data were available.

Conclusions

Based on the available data in the literature, we conclude that AADs play important role in the treatment of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. However, appropriate patient selection criteria are vitally important, and in general terms AADs are indicated or polymorphic PVCs, epicardial PVCs; and when CA procedure is contraindicated, or not feasible or failed.

4 DISCUSSION

This study was designed to determine whether the use of a single catheter approach would have an effect on procedural outcomes, success rates, and complications rates in the treatment of PVCs. According to our study, in patients with symptomatic PVC, limiting the number of diagnostic catheters to only one ablation catheter resulted in significant reductions in the total procedure time, fluoroscopy time, and dose area product as well, while maintaining comparable success rates and complications when compared with conventional catheter setups for electrophysiological studies. Differences in "partial success" rates between single catheter and conventional methods may stem from procedural nuances, not method superiority. The subjectivity of "partial success" criteria, considering PVC characteristics, requires cautious interpretation. Both methods, however, showed comparable success rates in eliminating all PVCs, highlighting the need for careful consideration of procedural complexities and patient‐specific factors.

No differences were observed regarding procedure‐associated complications in both groups. Efforts to minimize vascular complications in both groups included strict adherence to established protocols, meticulous catheter placement, and routine ultrasound‐guided vascular access. Pericardial effusion instances were primarily associated with ablation procedures or complex septal punctures rather than the presence of additional catheters. Notably, there was no observed damage to the cardiac conduction system in either group.

Palpitations, or worsening left ventricular function in patients with heart failure symptoms, may not necessarily require additional electrophysiological testing, when the symptoms are attributed to a substantial burden of PVCs on continuous rhythm monitoring. To localize these PVCs, a variety of algorithms are available, including the identification of potential epicardial exit points and catheter ablation sites. The ideal ablation site for PVCs is characterized by a similar 12‐lead‐ECG morphology when applying pace mapping, as well as a sufficient duration of local activation on the ablation catheter before the onset of surface QRS of at least 25 milliseconds in conjunction with a QS configuration on a unipolar recording of the distal ablation catheter electrode. Using only one catheter, the latter can be used to perform both mapping and ablation without the need for additional diagnostic catheters.

### Premature ventricular contraction diurnal profiles predict distinct clinical characteristics and β-blocker responses [^79a4915c]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) can lead to symptoms, such as cardiomyopathy and increased mortality. Beta-blockers are recommended as first-line therapy to reduce PVC burden; however, the response is unpredictable. The objective of this study is to determine whether PVC diurnal-variability patterns are associated with different clinical profiles and predict drug response.

Methods

Consecutive patients with frequent PVCs (burden ≥ 1%), referred for Holter monitoring between 2014 and 2016, were included. Follow-up Holters, when available, were assessed after beta-blocker initiation to assess response (≥ 50% reduction). Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of relationship between hourly PVC count and mean HR during each of the 24 Holter hours: (1) fast-HR-dependent-PVC (F-HR-PVC) for positive correlation (Pearson, P < 0.05), (2) slow-HR-dependent-PVC (S-HR-PVC) for a negative, and (3) independent-HR-PVC (I-HR-PVC) when no correlation was found.

Results

Of the 416 patients included, 50.2% had F-HR-PVC, 35.6% I-HR-PVC, and 14.2% S-HR-PVC with distinct clinical profiles. Beta-blocker therapy was successful in 34.0% patients overall: patients with F-HR-PVC had a decrease in PVC burden (18.8 ± 10.4% to 9.3 ± 6.6%, P < 0.0001; 62% success), I-HR-PVC had no change (18.4 ± 17.9% to 20.6 ± 17.9%, P = 0.175; 0% success), whereas S-HR-PVC had an increase in burden (14.6 ± 15.3% to 20.8 ± 13.8%, P = 0.016; 0% success). The correlation coefficient was the only predictor of beta-blocker success (AUC = 0.84, sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 67.7%; r ≥ 0.4).

Conclusions

A simple analysis of Holter PVC diurnal variability may provide incremental value to guide clinical PVC management. Only patients displaying a F-HR-PVC profile benefited from beta-blockers. An alternative strategy should be considered for others, as beta-blockers may have no effect or can even be harmful.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — trial evidence for symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 52 patients with symptomatic VA and a mean PVC count of 21407 ± 1740 beats per 24 hours, atenolol significantly decreased symptom frequency (P = 0.03) and PVC count (P = 0.001), whereas placebo had no effect on PVC count (P = 0.78) or average heart rate (P = 0.44). In an RCT of 233 patients with ≥ 30 PVCs per hour, d-sotalol was shown to reduce frequent PVCs, but only racemic dl-sotalol is presently available. In a prospective randomized comparison of antiarrhythmic medications versus catheter ablation, therapy with metoprolol or propafenone was shown to have modest efficacy when used to suppress right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) PVCs although with a far higher rate of recurrence than catheter ablation, and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers reduce arrhythmias.

### Premature ventricular contractions and atrial fibrillation: the Reunion of distant relatives? [^a83249a2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Perhaps more technical and hypothetical follow‐up questions to the study by Lee et al are regarding specific PVC characteristics. Previous research has focused on PVC characteristics to help us differentiate high‐risk features that pose a more malignant risk for cardiomyopathy including origin (epicardial), QRS width, and coupling interval. Is there an association between a PVC anatomical location and new‐onset AF? Did participants with new AF and moderate to high burden of PVCs have monomorphic, or polymorphic PVCs? May there be a similar relationship with AF incidence? Although PVC anatomical location can be a point of debate among electrophysiologists, establishing a relationship between the risk of AF and PVC anatomical location would further risk stratify patients and may support screening decisions.

The authors looked at a cohort in the highest PVC burden group (defined as > 10 000 a day) that received successful catheter ablation, compared them with the index study cohort with the highest PVC burden, and found a trend in lower development of AF (not statistically significant). This raises the following important key question: Could PVCs be a modifiable risk factor for AF? The authors speculate that PVC ablation may be a possible adjuvant strategy for AF ablation, which could eliminate all potential AF triggers. Without a doubt, this statement begs further data and analysis. Yet, it may influence our use of continuous monitoring post AF ablation to screen for PVCs and may represent one missing piece of the AF ablation recurrence puzzle.

Antiarrhythmic medication use for suppression of ventricular arrhythmias — comparative data and cautions: The most common antiarrhythmic medications used for suppression of VA include amiodarone and sotalol, while mexiletine, quinidine, and ranolazine are occasionally used. Amiodarone appears to be more effective than sotalol and has a low rate of ventricular proarrhythmia, but has an increased risk of medication-related adverse effects that lead to its discontinuation in many patients within 18 to 24 months from initiation of therapy. Data supporting effectiveness of sotalol for suppression of VA are conflicting, but given its more favorable adverse effect profile than amiodarone, it may be a better first-line antiarrhythmic medication in appropriate patients; however, sotalol is generally avoided in patients with a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 20% due to its negative inotropic effects and the risk of torsades de pointes. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 674 patients with heart failure (HF) and ≥ 10 premature ventricular complexes per hour (PVCs/h) and an LVEF ≤ 40% randomly assigned to receive amiodarone (336 patients) or placebo (338 patients), there was no significant difference in overall mortality or sudden cardiac death (SCD) between the 2 arms.

### Effectiveness of medical therapy for treatment of idiopathic frequent premature ventricular complexes [^cb356ac9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The relative effectiveness of medical therapy compared with a conservative approach of monitoring in patients with idiopathic frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is uncertain. We evaluated the effectiveness of medical versus conservative therapy for frequent PVCs.

Methods

Patients with frequent PVCs (≥ 5%) were prospectively enrolled in this cohort study between 2016 and 2020. In patients with normal cardiac function and no structural heart disease, those receiving medical therapy were compared with controls without therapy. Patients were followed longitudinally for change in PVC burden and with serial echocardiography.

Results

Overall, 120 patients met inclusion criteria (mean: 56.5 ± 14.6 years, 54.2% female) with 53 on beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers (BBs/CCBs), 27 on Class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), and 40 patients treated conservatively. Median initial PVC burden ranged from 15.5% to 20.6%. The median relative reduction of PVCs was 32.7%, 30.5%, and 81.3%, in the conservative therapy, BBs/CCBs, and AADs cohorts, respectively. AADs had greater PVC reduction compared with BBs/CCBs (p = 0.017) and conservative therapy (p = 0.045). PVC reduction to < 1% was comparable across groups at 35.0%, 17.0%, 33.3%, respectively. Four patients (4/120, 3.3%) developed left ventricular dysfunction. Rates of adverse drug reactions and medication discontinuation were similar between groups, with no serious adverse events noted.

Conclusion

In patients with idiopathic frequent PVCs, BB, and CCB have limited effectiveness in PVC reduction. Class I and III AADs have superior effectiveness for medical therapy in symptomatic patients, but only achieved complete PVC resolution suppression in one-third of patients.

### Single catheter approach for treatment of premature ventricular contractions [^426cd8e6]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This investigation had several limitations: (1) this was a retrospective, monocentric analysis and not prospectively randomized or multicentric. (2) The propensity matched analysis was performed with a 1:1 ratio — a higher ratio, for example, 1:2 would be more appropriate for this kind of analysis, but was limited by the number of matched baseline characteristics, mainly PVC origin. (3) Despite recognizing the correlation between acute and long‐term success, the absence of data on recurrence rates, PVC burden postablation, symptom alleviation, and medication needs was notable due to follow‐ups conducted in an ambulatory, out‐of‐hospital setting. We acknowledge these limitations and suggests a need for enhanced follow‐up measures, proposing a direct, truly randomized trial with continuous rhythm for more conclusive insights into the single catheter approach's efficacy and sustainability.

In conclusion, in a comparison of a conventional catheter setup, compared with a limitation to solely an ablation catheter, which is used for diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers, for the interventional treatment of PVC, we found that a single catheter approach is associated with a reduction of procedure‐ and fluoroscopy time, as well as a lesser radiation exposure surrogated by dose area product, while maintaining equivalent acute success and complication rates.

### Distal-to-proximal delay for ablation of premature ventricular contractions [^ff3e4deb]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ablation of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) has emerged as a safe and effective treatment in patients experiencing a high PVCs burden. Mapping of PVCs origin may sometimes be challenging. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of a new electrophysiological criterion, the distal-to-proximal (DP) delay, at localizing the optimal site for ablation of ventricular ectopic foci.

Methods and Results

Consecutive patients with ablation attempts of symptomatic PVCs were included. Prematurity and DP delay-that is, the time duration between the onset of ablation catheter distal bipolar electrogram and the onset of proximal bipolar electrogram-were measured at successful and unsuccessful ablation sites by three blinded experienced electrophysiologists. Mean DP delay at effective ablation sites (N = 30) was significantly higher than at ineffective sites (N = 55) (23 ± 9 vs 11 ± 8milliseconds; P < 0.0001). DP delay had good-to-excellent interrater reliability. A DP delay greater than or equal to 15milliseconds had the highest accuracy at predicting a successful ablation site (sensitivity 0.97, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.87; P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

DP delay is an additional, simple, and effective electrophysiological parameter to accurately localize PVCs foci.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence for symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of 52 patients with symptomatic VA and a mean PVC count of 21407 ± 1740 beats per 24 hours, atenolol significantly decreased symptom frequency (P = 0.03) and PVC count (P = 0.001), whereas placebo had no effect on PVC count (P = 0.78) or average heart rate (P = 0.44). A prospective randomized comparison of antiarrhythmic medications versus catheter ablation, metoprolol or propafenone had modest efficacy to suppress RVOT VA although with a far higher rate of recurrence than catheter ablation. In an RCT of 233 patients with ≥ 30 PVCs per hour, d-sotalol was shown to reduce frequent PVCs, but only racemic d-l sotalol is presently available. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers reduce arrhythmias.

### Prevalence of frequent premature ventricular contractions and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients receiving holter monitoring [^9b2358b3]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

A high burden of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) may be associated with the development of cardiomyopathy (CM) and heart failure, referred to as PVC‐induced cardiomyopathy (PVC‐CM). However, the presence of PVCs in an abnormal heart can represent a mere consequence of the underlying (unrelated) CM ("bystander PVCs"), or as mentioned, it may represent the main etiology of the newly diagnosed CM (i.e. PVC‐CM), or a secondary mechanism that worsens the original ventricular dysfunction ("superimposed PVC‐CM"). Although several studies have tried to elucidate some of its pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors, this clinical entity still faces several unmet clinical needs. Currently, a PVC burden (percentage of PVCs) greater than 15% is considered a strong predictor for the development of PVC‐CM. However, there is no clear consensus of the PVC burden required to produce invariably "deleterious effects" to the heart. Undoubtedly, this distinction has treatment implications. Furthermore, it is unclear what the prevalence of frequent PVCs (> 5% burden), high PVC burden (> 10%) and PVC‐CM is in the general population. The first step would be to estimate the prevalence of frequent PVCs with and without LV systolic dysfunction in a cohort of patients undergoing ambulatory Holter monitors. The purpose of this study was to understand the prevalence of LV systolic dysfunction and frequent PVCs and describe their demographic profiles in consecutive patients receiving ambulatory ECG monitors.

### Single catheter approach for treatment of premature ventricular contractions [^901d90e0]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Catheter ablation has become one of the main treatment strategies in patients with premature ventricular complexes (PVC). The successful mapping and ablation can be performed with an ablation catheter without additional diagnostic catheters.

Hypothesis

We hypothesize that using a single catheter for PVC ablation may decrease complications, procedure time, and fluoroscopy exposure while maintaining comparable success rates.

Methods

Sixty-nine consecutive patients with PVC were treated with a single catheter approach compared to a historical cohort, in which a conventional setup was used. Propensity score matching was conducted with a 1:1 ratio. Outcome parameters included acute procedural success with elimination of all premature ventricular contractions after catheter ablation, procedural data as well as complication rates.

Results

Patients treated with a single catheter approach had shorter total procedure (60minutes [IQR: 47,5–69,0minutes] vs. 90minutes [IQR 60-120minutes]; p = 0.001) and fluoroscopy times (218seconds [IQR: 110,5-446seconds] vs. 310seconds [IQR 190-640seconds]; p = 0.012), which consecutively leads to a reduction of radiation exposure signified by a lower dose area product (155cGycm² [IQR 74.4–334.5cGycm²] vs. 368.4cGycm² [IQR: 126–905.4cGycm²]; p value 0.009). Acute procedural success rates were comparable in both groups (54 [84.3%] in the single catheter approach group and 58 [90.6%] in the conventional group; p: 0.287).

Conclusion

A single catheter approach for the treatment of PVC is associated with a reduction of procedure- and fluoroscopy time, as well as a lesser radiation exposure, while maintaining equivalent acute success and complication rates compared with a conventionally used catheter setup.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias therapy and outcomes — antiarrhythmic suppression of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) after myocardial infarction has not improved survival and can increase mortality. In CAST, treatment of patients with post-myocardial infarction (MI) who took antiarrhythmic medications (eg, flecainide, encainide, moricizine) increased the risk of death despite suppression of VA. Treatment of PVCs with antiarrhythmic medications has not been shown to reduce mortality, and in the post-MI population, treatment with class I sodium channel–blocking medications (eg, quinidine, flecainide) increases the risk of death. Likewise, in patients with a reduced LVEF class I, sodium channel–blocking medications and d-sotalol increase the risk of death. Symptomatically, beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and some antiarrhythmic medications may relieve palpitations.

### Impact of age on catheter ablation of premature ventricular contractions [^75689ca3]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Catheter ablation (CA) of frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC) is increasingly performed in older patients as the population ages. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of age on procedural characteristics, safety and efficacy on PVC ablations.

Methods

Consecutive patients with symptomatic PVCs undergoing CA between 2015 and 2020 were evaluated. Acute ablation success was defined as the elimination of PVCs at the end of the procedure. Sustained success was defined as an elimination of symptoms, and ≥ 80% reduction of PVC burden determined by Holter-electrocardiogram during long-term follow. Patients were sub-grouped based on age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 years).

Results

A total of 114 patients were enrolled (median age 64 years, 71% males) and followed up for a median duration of 228 days. Baseline and procedural data were similar in both age groups. A left-sided origin of PVCs was more frequently observed in the elderly patient group compared to younger patients (83% vs. 67%; p = .04). The median procedure time was significantly shorter in elderly patients (160 vs. 193min; p = .02). The rates of both acute (86% vs. 92%; p = .32) and sustained success (70% vs. 71%; p = .90) were similar between groups. Complications rates (3.7%) did not differ between the two groups.

Conclusion

In a large series of patients with a variety of underlying arrhythmia substrates, similar rates of acute procedural success, complications, and ventricular arrhythmia-free-survival were observed after CA of PVCs. Older age alone should not be a reason to withhold CA of PVCs.

Secondary diseases caused by VA include PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, which can present with typical symptoms of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (EF). If PVCs are asymptomatic, the diagnosis is commonly made by a routine physical exam and is confirmed by a 12-lead ECG.

Underlying pathologies resulting in VA are numerous and include ischemia; cardiomyopathy; genetic diseases (eg, inherited arrhythmia syndromes); hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM); ARVC; CHD; infiltrative, inflammatory, or infectious diseases; and correctible causes, such as electrolyte abnormalities or medication adverse effects. If VAs themselves are asymptomatic, the presenting symptoms will mostly depend on the underlying pathology and might include chest pain, heart failure, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac death. A careful history and physical exam with a review of the family history, ECG, imaging, and laboratory data will direct diagnosis and specific treatment (eg, immunosuppression in cardiac sarcoidosis). If inherited arrhythmia syndromes are suspected (eg, long QT syndrome), genetic testing should be considered.

ICD therapy including shocks is an increasingly common presentation of VAs in patients with CIEDs, and appropriate ICD therapy occurs in the first year in.50% of patients with secondary and approximately 5% of patients with primary prevention ICDs.

Combined presentations of those scenarios are common, such as worsening heart failure status with increased arrhythmias burden or acute MI presenting with sudden cardiac death as a manifestation of the VAs.

Given that presenting symptoms of VA vary widely, careful documentation and correlation of the specific arrhythmia (ECG, telemetry, Holter or event monitor, electrograms) with the presenting symptoms is important to guide further workup and therapy. Symptoms commonly attributed to VA (eg, palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, syncope) are nonspecific and can either be due to other arrhythmias (eg, supraventricular tachycardia [SVT] or bradycardia), other cardiac diseases, noncardiac conditions, anxiety, or have no clear identifiable cause.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) — arrhythmic phenotype and monitoring: Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) is an important predictor of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), sudden cardiac death (SCD), or appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks, and in primary-prevention ICD recipients appropriate shocks are reported in 24% to 48% of patients. Sustained VT in ARVC is monomorphic in 55% to 90% of episodes based on device or electrophysiological studies, and antitachycardia pacing algorithms are used to terminate VT. Frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), > 760 to 1000 per 24 hours during ambulatory monitoring, correlate with arrhythmic risk, and the presence of nonsustained VT (NSVT) or sustained VT is an important predictor of adverse cardiac events. Observational registry data report that atenolol or amiodarone were associated with less clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias, while sotalol had no effect or increased arrhythmia. Ambulatory monitoring to assess ventricular arrhythmia burden and adequacy of beta-blocker therapy is usually used.

Figure 5
Premature ventricular complex (PVC) burden threshold likely to identify cases most likely to ablation to improve left ventricular function. A 13% baseline PVC burden had 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity to predict an absolute increase ≥ 5% in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) after sustained successful ablation (SSA). From Penela et al.

The question of whether to ablate asymptomatic monomorphic PVCs when the burden is high should be discussed carefully with the patient as PVC ablation particularly in the right ventricular outflow tract does carry a small but important risk of tamponade (< 1%) and even death. Since PVC ablation restores normal LV function in the structurally normal heart, a pragmatic approach in these cases is simply to monitor the patient for signs of LV impairment and only consider ablation should this be the case. This is because isolated PVCs have an excellent prognosis in the normal hearts with preserved function anyway, so there is no reason to intervene unless significant dysfunction develops. Recently, Bhushan and Asirvatham have proposed criteria regarding PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. They suggest that otherwise young healthy individuals, without abnormal cardiovascular substrate having over 20 000 PVCs per day, no more than two PVC morphologies, PVCs originating from outflow tracts or from the fascicles and with preserved myocardial wall thickness are the best candidates for presumption of a PVC-induced cardiomyopathy diagnosis. The most prominent predictor of cardiomyopathy in patients with frequent PVCs appears to be the daily burden of PVCs. Ventricular function can improve if the PVC burden is reduced to < 5000/day. This is an important target when elimination of all PVCs may not be possible, especially in the context of multifocal PVCs; overall, the efficacy of ablation is 70%–90%.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) — risk stratification and arrhythmia features note that supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias are induced by exercise when heart rate reaches 120 to 130 beats per minute, progressing from premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sometimes sustained VT; a beat-to-beat alternating QRS axis that rotates by 180° defines typical bidirectional VT, and irregular polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) can occur. Patients with an episode of VF are considered at higher risk and are usually implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) along with beta-blocker therapy, and recurrence of sustained VT or hemodynamically non tolerated VT while on beta blockers is a marker of higher risk for which an ICD is often recommended. Electrophysiology (EP) testing is not useful for management and risk stratification because CPVT patients are usually not inducible. Beta blockers prevent recurrences of syncope in the majority of patients, but if syncope occurs while taking a beta blocker, ICD implantation is recommended, and ICD therapy requires careful programming to prevent needless therapy for nonsustained episodes.

### Idiopathic premature ventricular complexes treatment: comparison of flecainide, propafenone, and sotalol [^38130989]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this retrospective study from a tertiary university center, we report on the efficacy and safety of three antiarrhythmic drugs used for treatment of idiopathic PVCs. We summarize that (1) all three analyzed drugs (flecainide, propafenone, and sotalol) are generally safe, (2) have modest effectiveness, and (3) we conclude that the flecainide has the highest rate of complete/near complete reduction of PVCs, being significantly more effective compared to propafenone or sotalol.

Our work brings the most recent evidence on the current management of frequent idiopathic PVCs in routine practice. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study directly comparing the effectiveness of three specific and most often prescribed AADs in the treatment of idiopathic PVCs. Moreover, different definitions of drug efficacy have been used, as the primary outcome of efficacy was more than 99% of PVC burden reduction in the analyzed population.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias epidemiology — premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) show age-related prevalence and adverse associations. In a healthy military population, PVCs were found in 0.6% of those aged ≤ 22 years and 2.7% of those > 50 years on 12-lead ECGs, and longer term monitoring shows PVCs in about 50% of all people with or without heart disease. PVCs on 2 minutes of monitoring in the ARIC cohort were associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease events and mortality. In the general population, frequent PVCs are defined as at least 1 PVC on a 12-lead ECG or > 30 PVCs per hour and are associated with increased cardiovascular risk and increased mortality. In a Taiwan cohort without sustained VT or structural heart disease who had 24-hour Holter monitoring, multifocal PVCs were associated with increased risk of death and nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes, and NSVT in the same population was independently associated with increased risk of death and other cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke; ARIC also showed an association of PVCs with increased risk of stroke. Because of these associations, detection of PVCs, particularly if multifocal and frequent, is generally considered a risk factor, and such patients are generally evaluated for underlying conditions that could warrant further treatment to reduce risk.

### Idiopathic premature ventricular complexes treatment: comparison of flecainide, propafenone, and sotalol [^0c000c6c]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4.1 Further development and outlook

Despite the tremendous development of cardiology, many aspects of PVCs diagnosis and management are still unknown. The CA presents a rather invasive treatment option, that may lead to a resolution of PVCs but also to certain adverse events, which can be potentially severe. Moreover, in case of an unsuccessful CA, the only remaining therapy is pharmacological control of the arrhythmia.

The existing evidence on the PVC management in case the CA is not possible, or the patient is unresponsive to the first line drug treatment (BB or CCBs) is still sparse. The use of flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone can be considered, but the consensus on the best initial choice does not exist. The data on efficacy and safety of certain antiarrhythmic drug classes showed controversial results, missing to identify the best initial agent within the classes. With our work, we bring the proof of flecainide superiority when compared to propafenone or sotalol, accepting our main limitations — the single center and retrospective nature of the study. Moreover, our work brings new data pool of high methodological quality for possible future systematizations of evidence, as for example systematic reviews and meta‐analyses.

Further research should focus rather on the comparison of specific agents within the antiarrhythmic drug classes, including the intergroup comparisons. Future prospective studies with bigger samples are warranted. Until these data are available, our study showed moderate efficacy and acceptable safety of flecainide in the treatment of PVCs.

### Premature ventricular contractions and atrial fibrillation: the Reunion of distant relatives? [^1048ffb5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the authors should be commended for their work, there are some important limitations and with most studies showing intriguing results, some important hypothesis‐generating questions.

The authors chose to define their PVC burden as low PVC burden as < 1000/d and moderate‐to‐high PVC burden as > 1000/d. Quantification of PVCs was evaluated with 24‐hour Holter 3‐channel ECG monitoring, and the indications for monitoring were report of palpitations, a clinical diagnosis of any arrhythmia, or transient loss of consciousness. First, previous literature has shown notable daily variation in PVC burden and demonstrated that up to 6 days of continuous monitoring is more accurate than the traditional 24‐hour Holter monitor. Additionally, continuous monitoring allows clinicians to establish the percentage of PVCs over the total sinus beats during a given timeline. Second, by dichotomizing the PVC groups, the authors categorize the moderate and high group as > 1000, which correlates with ≥ 1% burden. In fact, the overall mean burden was 4.6% (highest seen was 11.2%) in the moderate/high burden group and almost zero PVCs in the low burden group with a range of 1 to 30 PVCs seen and a mean burden of 0.01%. This would suggest that the low group was an "extremely low‐almost zero" PVCs group and the moderate to high group was a more "intermediate" group as most "high" PVCs are usually defined > 15 000 to 20 000 in the literature. This level of PVC burden would be much lower than the perceived risk of developing cardiomyopathy (24+%) and most falling in the < 10% burden, which rarely leads to cardiomyopathy. This would suggest that the number of PVCs needed to increase the risk of AF is a more intermediate range and needs to be prospectively validated in a new cohort. Correspondingly, alternative explanations need to be entertained regarding the potential mechanisms by which PVCs increase the risk of AF. As described in previous literature, one would not expect many patients with this PVC burden range to develop a cardiomyopathy. Additionally, more research into the pro‐arrhythmogenic retrograde activation of the atria, a phenomenon rarely discussed in electrophysiology articles, as well as confounding genetic influences leading to increased risk in both arrhythmias, is needed to better understand the mechanism between PVCs and AF.

### Fluctuations in premature ventricular contraction burden can affect medical assessment and management [^666fe65e]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) can cause disabling symptoms and decrease left ventricular ejection fraction. PVC burden, typically quantified by a 24-hour monitor, is one of the factors that determines the clinical management of PVCs.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of variability in 24-hour PVC burden during 14-day ambulatory cardiac monitoring in patients with significant PVC burden.

Methods

All patients referred for PVC evaluation received a 14-day ambulatory cardiac monitor. Parameters of interest included mean 14-day PVC burden, minimum and maximum 24-hour PVC burden, and absolute change in 24-hour PVC burden (maximum minus minimum). We included only patients with a mean 14-day PVC burden of more than 5%.

Results

Fifty-nine patients were included in the study. The median of mean 14-day PVC burden, maximum 24-hour PVC burden, and minimum 24-hour PVC burden were 9.0% (IQR 6.4%-17.9%), 16.2% (IQR 11.7%-26.2%), and 4.5% (IQR 2.6%-11.2%) respectively (P < .001). The median of the absolute 24-hour PVC burden change was 9.9% (IQR 5.4%-14.5%). There was a 2.45-fold (IQR 1.68- to 5.55-fold) median difference between maximum 24-hour PVC burden and minimum 24-hour burden in the same patient. When categorized by low (< 10%), intermediate (10%-20%), and high (> 20%) 24-hour PVC burden, 72.9% patients fell into at least 2 categories depending on the 24-hour period considered.

Conclusion

There is a significant variation in 24-hour PVC burden when measured over a 14-day period in patients with of PVC burden of more than 5%. This variation might impact critical clinical decisions in a significant proportion of such patients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia suppression — antiarrhythmic medications and comparative evidence: The most common antiarrhythmic medications used for suppression of VA include amiodarone and sotalol, while mexiletine, quinidine, and ranolazine are occasionally used. Amiodarone appears to be more effective than sotalol and has a low rate of ventricular proarrhythmia, but has an increased risk of medication-related adverse effects that lead to its discontinuation in many patients within 18 to 24 months from initiation of therapy. Data supporting effectiveness of sotalol for suppression of VA are conflicting, but given its more favorable adverse effect profile than amiodarone, it may be a better first-line antiarrhythmic medication in appropriate patients; however, sotalol is generally avoided in patients with a severely reduced LVEF < 20% due to its negative inotropic effects and the risk of torsades de pointes. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 674 patients with HF and ≥ 10 PVCs/h and an LVEF ≤ 40% randomly assigned to receive amiodarone (336 patients) or placebo (338 patients), there was no significant difference in overall mortality or sudden cardiac death (SCD) between the 2 arms.

Catheter ablation general considerations — Catheter ablation is an important treatment option for patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VA) when antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not desired by the patient. Monomorphic VA usually have an origin or substrate that can be targeted, ablation is an option for selected patients with polymorphic VT/VF only if an initiating premature ventricular contraction (PVC) focus or substrate can be identified, and most VA originate close to the subendocardium and are approached through transvenous (right ventricle) or transaortic/transseptal (left ventricle) catheterization, with some diseases giving rise to subepicardial VA approachable by epicardial mapping and ablation and pericardial access usually achieved by a percutaneous subxiphoid puncture. The procedure usually involves attempts to induce VT by programmed electrical stimulation to confirm the diagnosis and guide ablation, and problems limiting success include inability to induce an arrhythmia for mapping or an arrhythmia origin in an inaccessible myocardial location.

Papillary muscle ventricular arrhythmias (VA), including premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) — phenotype, outcomes, and recommendation: The papillary muscles of the left ventricle (LV) or right ventricle (RV) can be the site of origin of VA in the presence or absence of structural heart disease, and idiopathic papillary muscle VA are most commonly PVCs and NSVT, are usually exercise-related, and may be induced by intravenous epinephrine or isoproterenol. In 1 study, successful ablation was achieved in all 8 patients with a reduction in PVC burden from 17 ± 20% to 0.6 ± 0.8%, and in the LV the site of origin may be either the posteromedial or the anterolateral papillary muscles. Multiple VA QRS morphologies were observed in 47% of patients, ablation on both sides of the papillary muscle is required in some patients, acute ablation success is high, and recurrences are more frequent than for idiopathic outflow tract VA. Serious complications, including valve injury, appear to be infrequent, and risks include bleeding related to arterial and venous access and a low risk of pericardial tamponade. For symptomatic papillary muscle VA when antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference, catheter ablation is useful (I, B-NR).

Ventricular arrhythmia catheter ablation — this clinical document is intended to supplement, not replace, the 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death and the 2015 ESC Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death. The scope of the current document relates to ablation therapy for ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), from premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) to monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and triggers of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Where possible, the recommendations are evidence based and intended to set reasonable standards that can be applicable worldwide while recognizing different resources, technological availability, disease prevalence, and health care delivery logistics, and parts of this document, particularly Section 9, present a practical guide on how to accomplish the procedures described while recognizing that some procedures are better performed, and some disease states better managed, in settings in which there is specific expertise; due to its narrower scope, the consensus statement delves into greater detail with regard to indications and technical aspects of VA ablation than the above-mentioned guidelines.

### Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs for suspected premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy [^0c92b325]. Heart Rhythm (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs (IC-AADs) can effectively suppress premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). However, IC-AADs increase mortality in patients with PVCs and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Whether IC-AADs can be safely used to treat premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM) remains to be established.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of IC-AADs in patients suspected of having PVC-CM.

Methods

The electronic medical records at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were screened to identify all patients suspected of having PVC-CM treated with flecainide or propafenone. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and imaging studies were reviewed.

Results

Twenty patients suspected of having PVC-CM were treated with IC-AADs. Patients had undergone an average of 1.3 ± 0.2 previous unsuccessful ablations. Six had an implantable or wearable defibrillator. With IC-AAD treatment, mean PVC burden decreased from 36.2% ± 3.5% to 10.0% ± 2.4% (P < .001). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased from 37.4% ± 2.0% to 49.0% ± 1.9% (P < .001). Seven patients with myocardial delayed enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (all < 5% of the total myocardium) experienced similar improvement in LVEF (from 36.8% ± 4.3% before IC-AAD to 51.7% ± 3.7% afterward; P < .01). Over an average 3.8 ± 0.9 treatment-years, no sustained ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac deaths occurred.

Conclusion

In patients suspected of having PVC-CM, IC-AADs effectively suppressed PVCs, leading to LVEF recovery in the majority. No adverse events occurred in this small cohort.

Premature ventricular contractions — morphology/location triggers for further work-up and malignant patterns: The demonstration of PVCs of differing morphologies from the right ventricle in patients with normal left ventricular function should prompt investigations to rule out arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with right ventricular dominance or sarcoidosis, and multifocal PVCs of left ventricular origin should trigger investigations for non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Short-coupled PVCs lying on the T wave may indicate polymorphic VT/VF in settings such as ischaemia, electrolyte abnormalities, underlying long QT syndrome, or early repolarization syndrome; when present, this malignant electrical presentation mandates aggressive treatment, possibly ablation, and in some an implantable defibrillator may be indicated.

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^15ce5bb3]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In post-myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic PVCs and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, flecainide therapy was found to be associated with a 5.1% rate of death and non-fatal cardiac arrest, compared with a 2.3% rate in a matched placebo group. (See WARNINGS .)

Adverse effects reported for flecainide, described in detail in the WARNINGS section, were new or worsened arrhythmias which occurred in 1% of 108 patients with PSVT and in 7% of 117 patients with PAF; and new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias which occurred in 7% of 1330 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained VT. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained VT, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. 198 patients with sustained VT experienced a 13% incidence of new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In some patients, flecainide treatment has been associated with episodes of unresuscitatable VT or ventricular fibrillation (cardiac arrest). (See WARNINGS .) New or worsened CHF occurred in 6.3% of 1046 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained VT. Of 297 patients with sustained VT, 9.1% experienced new or worsened CHF. New or worsened CHF was reported in 0.4% of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. There have also been instances of second- (0.5%) or third-degree (0.4%) AV block. Patients have developed sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest, about 1.2% altogether (see WARNINGS). The frequency of most of these serious adverse events probably increases with higher trough plasma levels, especially when these trough levels exceed 1 mcg/mL.

Premature ventricular contractions are of common occurrence in routine clinical practice. Though generally perceived as of benign consequence in healthy people in the absence of heart disease, their presence can be a harbinger of fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmia in individuals with structural heart disease. With some of the latest insights into the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, especially with the advent of catheter ablation, there has been renewed interest in premature ventricular contractions, not only as a predictor of arrhythmia, but also for their potential etiological association with cardiomyopathy.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) — arrhythmic risk markers and medical therapy signals: Frequent PVCs > 760 to 1000 per 24 hours during ambulatory rhythm monitoring correlate with arrhythmic risk, and the presence of NSVT or sustained VT is an important predictor of adverse cardiac events. The increased arrhythmia risk conferred by intense exercise is consistent with beta-adrenergic modulation of disease expression. An observational registry reported that treatment with atenolol or amiodarone was associated with less clinically relevant VA, while sotalol was associated with no effect or increased arrhythmia, and ambulatory monitoring to assess VA burden and adequacy of beta-blocker therapy is usually used.

PVC-induced cardiomyopathy — supportive text and thresholds: Frequent PVCs (usually > 15% of the total number of beats) may produce a reversible form of LV dysfunction, and LV dysfunction has been associated with greater PVC burden (> 10% and usually > 20%), NSVT, a retrograde P wave after the PVCs, and interpolated PVCs. In a prospective study of catheter ablation for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, ablation was completely successful in 80% of patients, and LV function normalized within 6 months in 82% of the 22 patients who had depressed ventricular dysfunction at baseline. In a double-blind parallel study of 30 patients with or without ischemic heart disease with > 30 PVCs per hour comparing sotalol to propranolol, proarrhythmic effects were present in 1 patient on sotalol; there was no significant difference in suppression of PVCs (sotalol 65%, propranolol 44%), with reduction in ventricular couplets being 96% for sotalol and 49% for propranolol, and there was a significant increase in QTc in patients on sotalol.

6.6 Therapy: when and how to treat idiopathic PVCs

In the majority of cases, idiopathic PVCs are a benign clinical condition with a good prognosis and a specific treatment is usually unnecessary. The 2014 EHRA/HRS/APHRS Expert Consensus on VAs suggests, as first step, reassurance about the benign nature of this arrhythmia allaying patients' anxiety. 38 In case of highly symptomatic patients, significant PVCs burden (with or without symptoms) or suspicion of PVC‐induced cardiomyopathy, a therapeutic intervention is recommended. AADs are commonly used as a first‐line option even though no large‐scale randomized trials on AAD therapy for idiopathic PVCs have been performed. 39 Usually beta‐blockers or non‐dihydropyridine calcium antagonists are considered as first‐line therapy but their efficacy is quite limited, being similar to placebo, and the occurrence of side effects are not infrequent, thus reducing patient's compliance. While Class I AADs are highly effective to suppress PVCs and improve symptoms, the risk‐benefit ratio has not yet been carefully evaluated in patients without underlying cardiomyopathy. Multiple studies indicate high efficacy of CA with PVC elimination in 74%‐100% of patients associated with low complication rate (about 1%). The only prospective randomized study comparing CA and AADs confirmed the superiority of the ablative approach in preventing arrhythmia recurrences, at least in patients with PVCs originating from RVOT. 39 Indeed, CA success is strongly related to the PVCs site of origin with RVOT‐PVCs being the most easily approachable. Idiopathic PVC origins different from RVOT, such as LVOT, aortic cusp or epicardial origins or multiple morphologies, have been demonstrated to be associated with a lower success rate and with a trend toward the highest complication rate. 40 The recent 2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS Expert Consensus on CA of VAs, recommends CA of idiopathic PVCs in patients with symptomatic PVCs originating from RVOT as first line therapeutic approach in preference to AAD therapy. 41 In patients with symptomatic PVCs originating from other sites than RVOT (including LVOT, epicardial OT or LV summit) or in those presenting with polymorphic PVCs, CA can be considered only after failed/not tolerated medical therapy or when patients refuse taking drugs. 41

Premature ventricular contractions — PVC burden, cardiomyopathy risk, and monitoring: There is no absolute threshold of the number of PVCs that can be used as a cut-off for underlying disease and hence should trigger further investigations, and even in the absence of demonstrable underlying disease, a moderate to high burden of PVCs are a marker for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, indicating that continued follow-up may be warranted. It is well recognized that not all patients with frequent PVCs will develop LV dysfunction, but the PVC burden is one of the strongest predictors for the development of a PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, and factors associated with this include longer PVC QRS duration, epicardial PVCs, retrograde atrial activation of PVCs, and interpolation of PVCs. Across ablation-focused studies, the prevalence of LV dysfunction ranged from 7% to 52%, asymptomatic patients with frequent PVCs were underrepresented, PVC-induced cardiomyopathy has been reported with a PVC burden < 10%, mild impairment has been observed with a PVC burden > 8%, and longer monitoring can double the identification of patients with a PVC burden of > 10%.

### Multicenter outcomes for catheter Ablation of idiopathic premature Ventricular complexes [^6559cb15]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study reports multicenter outcomes and complications for catheter ablation of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and investigates predictors of procedural success, as well as development of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy.

Background

Catheter ablation of frequent idiopathic PVCs is used to eliminate symptoms and treat PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. Large-scale multicenter outcomes and complication rates have not been reported.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 1,185 patients (55% female; mean age 52 ± 15 years; mean ejection fraction 55 ± 10%; mean PVC burden 20 ± 13%) who underwent catheter ablation for idiopathic PVCs at 8 centers between 2004 and 2013. The following factors were evaluated: patient demographics, procedural characteristics, complication rates, and clinical outcomes.

Results

Acute procedural success was achieved in 84% of patients. In centers at which patients were followed up routinely with post-ablation Holter monitoring, continued success at clinical follow-up without use of antiarrhythmic drugs was 71%. Including the use of antiarrhythmic medications, the success rate at a mean of 1.9 years of follow-up was 85%. In a multivariate analysis, the significant predictors of acute success were PVC location and number of distinct PVC configurations (p < 0.03). The only significant predictor of continued success at clinical follow-up was a right ventricular outflow tract PVC location (p < 0.01). In 245 patients (21%) with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, the mean ejection fraction improved from 38% to 50% (p < 0.01) after ablation. Independent predictors for development of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy were male gender, PVC burden, lack of symptoms, and epicardial PVC origin (p < 0.05). The overall complication rate was 5.2% (2.4% major complications and 2.8% minor complications), and complications were most commonly related to vascular access (2.8%). There was no procedure-related mortality.

Conclusions

Catheter ablation of frequent PVCs is a low-risk and often effective treatment strategy to eliminate PVCs and associated symptoms. In patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiac function is frequently restored after successful ablation.

2.2 Prior antiarrhythmic drug therapy

Fifty patients (62%) had failed other antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) previously. Amiodarone had been administered without and with concomitant mexiletine in 36 (72%) and 15 patients (30%), respectively. Sotalol had previously been administered in 23 (46%) patients and with mexiletine in 5 patients (10%). Twelve patients (24%) had been treated with both amiodarone and sotalol.

Among the 36 patients with prior amiodarone therapy, amiodarone was discontinued due to limited efficacy in 3 patients (8%) and adverse events in 28 patients (78%), including pulmonary toxicity (11), thyroid toxicity (7), liver toxicity (6), ocular effects (1), photosensitivity (1), persistent gastrointestinal upset (1), and tremor (1). Among the 23 patients with prior sotalol therapy, sotalol was discontinued due to limited efficacy in 14 patients (61%), excessive QT prolongation in 3 patients (13%), and adverse events in 9 patients (26%), including fatigue (5), bradycardia (1), worsening heart failure (2), and others (3).

In 31 patients who did not receive an AAD previously, dofetilide was selected on the basis of young age (7), associated comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with reduced diffusion capacity (7), after failed VA ablation (n = 7), provider preference (7), and patient preference after shared decision making (2), and as a bridge to transplant in a patient with LVAD (1).

2.3 Prior catheter ablation of VAs

Catheter ablation for VAs was previously performed in 33 patients (41%). Among the 29 patients who underwent ablation at the University of Michigan, targeted VAs were PVCs in 20 (69%), VTs in 7 (24%), and both VAs in 2 (7%) patients. Prior ablation was ineffective due to intramural VAs (10), infrequent PVCs at procedure (4), parahisian VAs (2), epicardial VAs (1), papillary muscle VAs (1), pleimorphic PVCs (1), proximity to the left main coronary artery (1), and aborted procedure due to pericardial tamponade (1).

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) — natural history and risk of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure (HF) are described from cohort data: In a largely asymptomatic cohort with normal baseline LV function, 239 patients with PVC burden > 1% were followed for a mean of 5.6 years, with burden strata > 20%, 5–20%, and 1–5%; 13 patients (5%) developed LV dysfunction defined by a ≥ 6% fall in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and those with high burden > 20% were more likely to develop LV dysfunction. In elderly patients from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a PVC burden in the upper quartile (roughly equivalent to > 1000 PVC/24 h) was associated with a threefold increase in incident HF and a population attributable risk of 8.1%. The risk of PVC‑induced cardiomyopathy rises with increasing PVC burden, subtle LV dysfunction can occur at burdens as low as 8%, and in referral cohorts the predictive PVC burden to cause PVC‑induced cardiomyopathy is > 10%, usually > 16%.
