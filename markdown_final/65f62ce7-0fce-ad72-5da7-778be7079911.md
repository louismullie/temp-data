## Question

One thousand unit cubes are fastened together to form a large cube with edge length 10 units; this is painted and then separated into the original cubes. The number of these unit cubes which have at least one face painted is
 (A) 600 (B) 520 (C) 488 (D) 480 (E) 400

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many unit cubes have at least one painted face after a 10×10×10 cube is painted and then disassembled. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of unit cubes. Then, I should verify how to count the cubes with no painted faces. Next, I will subtract to get the number with at least one painted face. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and match the result to the options provided.

> Let me first confirm the total number of unit cubes. A 10×10×10 cube contains 10³ = 1000 unit cubes, which matches the problem statement, so that baseline is correct.

> Now, I need to identify which unit cubes remain unpainted. The unpainted cubes are those completely internal, not touching any outer face. If I remove a 1-unit layer from each side, the internal unpainted cube has dimensions 8×8×8, so the number of unpainted cubes is 8³ = 512.

> Wait, let me verify the subtraction before concluding. The number of cubes with at least one painted face equals the total minus the unpainted cubes: 1000 − 512 = 488.

> I should confirm the answer against the choices. 488 corresponds to option C, so the correct choice is C.

---

The number of unit cubes with at least one painted face is **488**. This is found by subtracting the number of unpainted cubes (the inner 8×8×8 cube) from the total: 10³ − 8³ = 1000 − 512 = 488.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Total number of unit cubes

The large cube has an edge length of 10 units, so the total number of unit cubes is:

10 × 10 × 10 = 1000

---

### Number of unpainted cubes

Unpainted cubes are those not on the surface. Removing a 1-unit layer from each side leaves an inner cube of 8×8×8 units, so the number of unpainted cubes is:

8 × 8 × 8 = 512

---

### Number of painted cubes

The number of cubes with at least one painted face is the total minus the unpainted cubes:

1000 − 512 = 488

---

## Final answer

The number of unit cubes with at least one painted face is **488**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Results

Characterization of the unit cell

We construct a unit cell by extruding the edges of a cube in the direction normal to each face (Fig. 2a). This results in a 3D structure with 24 faces connected by 36 edges of length L. If, as in the simplified model of rigid origami, we assume that the faces are rigid and the structure can only fold along the edges, such a unit has three degrees of freedom identified by the angles γ 1, γ 2 and γ 3 (Fig. 2a). Changing these three angles deforms the internal cube into a rhombohedron (a 3D geometry formed from six rhombi) and, more importantly, reconfigures the unit cell into many specific shapes. To describe them, we introduce the vectors p 1, p 2 and p 3, which span the internal rhombohedron (Fig. 2a)

where δ = [cos(γ 1)−cos(γ 2) cos(γ 3)]/sin(γ 3). It is important to note that, because of contact occurring between faces, not all combinations of γ 1, γ 2 and γ 3 are possible. All possible combinations of the three angles can be found by requiring the third component of p 3 to be real valued,

We first rewrite equation (4) as

and then solve it for γ 3 to obtain

where we have used 0 ≤ γ 1, γ 2, γ 3 ≤ π. Note that equation (6) defines a regular tetrahedron with vertices located at (γ 1, γ 2, γ 3) = (0, 0, 0), (π, π, 0), (π, 0, π) and (0, π, π) (Fig. 2b). Therefore, only the combinations of angles contained within this domain are attainable.

Using DNA as programmable, sequence-specific 'glues', shape-controlled hydrogel units are self-assembled into prescribed structures. Here we report that aggregates are produced using hydrogel cubes with edge lengths ranging from 30 μm to 1 mm, demonstrating assembly across scales. In a simple one-pot agitation reaction, 25 dimers are constructed in parallel from 50 distinct hydrogel cube species, demonstrating highly multiplexed assembly. Using hydrogel cuboids displaying face-specific DNA glues, diverse structures are achieved in aqueous and in interfacial agitation systems. These include dimers, extended chains and open network structures in an aqueous system, and dimers, chains of fixed length, T-junctions and square shapes in the interfacial system, demonstrating the versatility of the assembly system.

Quantitative indicators

Regarding 3D tomographic imaging of colloidal assemblies of Au NPs within a polymeric shell, surface area, volume, and regularity index serve as vital metrics for characterizing assembly structures. By analyzing the polyhedron formed by the assembled Au NPs inside the polymeric shell, these metrics are calculated.

The surface area measures the combined area of the polyhedron's faces, providing insight into the extent of surface interactions between NPs and the polymeric shell, which can influence the stability of the colloidal assembly. To calculate surface area, the areas of all the polyhedron's faces are summed up:where A i is the area of the i th face of the polyhedron.

The volume quantifies the space enclosed by the polyhedron formed by the Au NPs. This metric offers information about the density and packing of the NPs within the polymeric shell, which can affect the assembly's mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. We calculate the volume (V) by dividing the polyhedron into smaller parts, such as tetrahedrons or cubes, and summing their volumes:where V i is the volume of the i th tetrahedron or cube.

The regularity index measures the polyhedron's regularity. This metric provides information about the degree of order and symmetry in the assembly, which can influence the physical and chemical properties of the colloidal assembly. We calculate the regularity index (R) by comparing the polyhedron to a regular polyhedron with the same number of faces and vertices and measuring the deviation from the regular shape in terms of the angles and lengths of the edges and faces:where θ i and θ r are the angles of the i th and regular faces of the polyhedron, l i and l r are the lengths of the i th and regular edges of the polyhedron, d i is the distance of the i th vertex from the center of the polyhedron, and n is the number of faces of the polyhedron. For reference, the ideal or 'regular' polyhedron considered has identical face and vertex counts as the Au NP-formed polyhedron. The closer the value of R is to zero, the more regular or symmetric the polyhedron. A lower regularity index indicates a structure closely resembling an ideal polyhedron, suggesting high order and symmetry. Conversely, a higher regularity index points to irregularity.

### Automated design of scaffold-free DNA wireframe nanostructures [^4e0b456b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

3D wireframes

Also 3D wireframe structures based on meshes with polygonal faces can be created following the same principles. We explored the versatility of our approach by designing and assembling two classes of 3D constructs: wireframes based on spherical meshes (Fig. 3) and on non-spherical meshes (Fig. 4). By a spherical mesh we mean a surface mesh that is topologically equivalent to a sphere, i.e. can be continuously deformed into one. Non-spherical surface meshes on the other hand have one or more topological handles, or 3D holes.

Similarly as for the 2D designs with triangular faces, we subdivided the polygonal faces of 3D meshes into multiple triangles in order to rigidify the overall constructs. (In the mathematical sense, it is actually known that a convex polyhedral wireframe is structurally rigid if and only if its model mesh is fully triangulated.) Unlike the 2D structures, which had a uniform edge length, in the 3D constructs the edge lengths vary according to the geometric requirements. The constructs were scaled to make the shortest edges at least 21 bp long to improve binding stability. The maximum vertex degree (number of junction arms) was set to be eight and the sharpest acute angles were set to be 30 degrees.

### Unifying the design space and optimizing linear and nonlinear Truss metamaterials by generative modeling [^d51b9d37]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Results

Creating the design space

We begin by introducing our definition of the design space of truss lattices. From a practical standpoint, we focus our attention on lattices based on the periodic tessellation of a cubic representative volume element (RVE). Inspired by the cube decomposition approach, we partition the RVE into eight equal cubes, the octants, as shown in Fig. 1 a. By assuming symmetries across the three mutually orthogonal symmetry planes, it is sufficient to define the truss only within a single octant, which simplifies the complex optimization problem while ensuring great flexibility and periodic tilability. Following the graph representation of molecules, truss-like structures can be described by a set of nodes connected by solid beams, which form the nodes and edges of the graph, respectively. To create a sufficiently large design space of truss structures, we define a total of 27 possible node placements within the octant (Fig. 1 a): 8 vertex nodes { v 0, v 1, v 2, v 3, v 4, v 5, v 6, v 7 }, 12 edge nodes { e 0, e 1, e 2, e 3, e 4, e 5, e 6, e 7, e 8, e 9, e 10, e 11 }, 6 face nodes { f 0, f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, f 5 }, and a single body node { t 0 } within the volume. While the body node is free to move in 3D, edge and face nodes are restricted to be displaced only along the edge and within the face, respectively, and vertex nodes are fixed, as illustrated in Fig. 1 a. We define the offsets of nodes (as in ref.) in the natural coordinate system, representing their relative positions with respect to the fixed vertex nodes to ensure connectivity on the outer boundaries. The complete set of node features x contains the offset of each node in its movable direction(s).

### Ultrafast 3D nanofabrication via digital holography [^f569ddb0]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Notably, although two methods in Fig. 3a (S2 and S1), i.e. DOE-based multi-focus systemand projection-based TPL, show superior throughputs, our system still has clear advantages in resolution, energy efficiency, and fabricating complex and low volume-filling ratio structures. For example, due to its fixed scanning points, the DOE-based system can only achieve the promised rate when printing periodic patterns; and the projection-based TPL method has to compromise its fabrication rate when printing grayscale structures. In contrast, our method can achieve precise grayscale control (accuracy > 99%, Supplementary Fig. 13) via the single-pulse exposure process as the amplitude, phase and position of each laser focus is encoded in the design holograms. Further optimization of the hologram can realize advanced functions, including intensity error compensation and multi-focus beam shaping (Supplementary Fig. 14). Regarding energy efficiency, owing to the ultrahigh peak power of the laser amplifier, our system requires much lower average power (20 − 400 mW for 100 − 2000 foci) then the aforementioned two systems: The DOE-based systemrequires an operating power of ~4 W, and the projection-based TPLrequires ~1.5 W to achieve the best fabrication rate. Overall, our method has achieved the best resolution, energy efficiency, and flexibility among all high-throughput TPL methods.

Fabrication and characterization of large-scale metastructures

High-throughput fabrication of functional metastructures consisting of hundreds to thousands of units with sub-micrometer scale features has been one of the greatest challenges in nanotechnology. Due to the limited fabrication efficiency, previous studies typically fabricate such structures with only hundreds of meta-units, or with size-scale gaps of several orders of magnitude, which prevent them from showing the predicted bulk properties. To address this issue, we fabricated a 1.08 × 1.08 × 1 mm³ metastructure that contains 6.82 × 10⁵ units of octahedral trusses(Truss 1, Fig. 3b and d) using 100 foci. Each meta-unit has a side length of 7.9 μm, and a linewidth of 700 nm. As shown in Fig. 3c, the cube can be compressed for ~30%, and fully recovered after the load is removed.

### Hierarchical self-assembly of DNA into symmetric supramolecular polyhedra [^f10dd599]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

DNA is renowned for its double helix structure and the base pairing that enables the recognition and highly selective binding of complementary DNA strands. These features, and the ability to create DNA strands with any desired sequence of bases, have led to the use of DNA rationally to design various nanostructures and even execute molecular computations. Of the wide range of self-assembled DNA nanostructures reported, most are one- or two-dimensional. Examples of three-dimensional DNA structures include cubes, truncated octahedra, octohedra and tetrahedra, which are all comprised of many different DNA strands with unique sequences. When aiming for large structures, the need to synthesize large numbers (hundreds) of unique DNA strands poses a challenging design problem. Here, we demonstrate a simple solution to this problem: the design of basic DNA building units in such a way that many copies of identical units assemble into larger three-dimensional structures. We test this hierarchical self-assembly concept with DNA molecules that form three-point-star motifs, or tiles. By controlling the flexibility and concentration of the tiles, the one-pot assembly yields tetrahedra, dodecahedra or buckyballs that are tens of nanometres in size and comprised of four, twenty or sixty individual tiles, respectively. We expect that our assembly strategy can be adapted to allow the fabrication of a range of relatively complex three-dimensional structures.

### Visualizing nexus of porous architecture and reactive transport in heterogeneous catalysis by deep learning computer vision and transfer learning [^a382aba1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Input data for Generator 2

To simplify the setup, we focused on cube-shaped porous architecture with unidirectional flow perpendicular to its surfaces. The six faces of the cube were defined as upstream, top, bottom, two sides, and downstream based on the flow direction. This setup resulted in six possible fluid directions: x+ (direction 1), x− (direction 3), y+ (direction 2), y− (direction 4), z+ (direction 5), and z− (direction 6) (Fig. 1a, b). This represented a fundamental unit of the reactive transport process in heterogeneous catalysis, mineral dissolution, and environmental transport.

Input data for Generator 2 included Damköhler number (Da), Péclet number (Pe) and structure slices. To simplify the setup, we focused on cube-shaped porous architectures with unidirectional flow perpendicular to the surface. The cube porous structures were generated by two-phase QSGS method, in which there were three major input parameters, i.e. porosity ε, core distribution probability c d, and growth probability in 26 directions g i (i = 1, 2, …, 26). The c d was used to control the averaged pore size, and the g i was used to control the anisotropy of the pore shape. Supplementary Fig. 13 and Table 1 showed the 26 growth directions of the pores. Supplementary Fig. 14 provided an example of the generated porous architecture model, where the pores (white phase) were stochastically distributed within the continuous solid phase (black phase). Structural anisotropy was obtained by changing g i in 26 directions (Fig. 1a, b), which corresponded to the vectors from the cube center to each edge midpoint, vertex, and face center. The directions 1, 2, and 5 represented x, y, and z direction in coordinate system, respectively. Notably, the characteristic lengths of these porous media ranged from 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻³, serving as a limitation on the available image information.

### Rigidly flat-foldable class of lockable origami-inspired metamaterials with topological stiff States [^5d435cc3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To understand the relation between the total number of post-bifurcation modes and the sides of the unit chain primitive N, Fig. 2e plots the total number of lockable modes c L and flat-foldable modes c F versus N. The best curve fits are included to provide phenomenological closed-form relations that characterize folding paths and differentiate lockable modes from flat-foldable modes as a function of N for a generic. The results show that the number of regular modes grows exponentially, hence providing a rich platform to program lockable paths (Supplementary Table 1).

Symmetry and topology

From a single multilayered unit chain, we now turn to its periodic and multilayered tessellation forming a material system. Multilayered unit chains are connected to follow a tessellation pattern (Supplementary Discussion "Tessellations") that replicates a crystallographic arrangement of atoms. Figure 3 shows the top view of representative patterns for N = 4, 6, 8, and 10. While several others exist, here we focus on tessellations with the most compact pattern. The goal is to show that upon folding along a given path our material systems undergo switches in symmetry and apparent topology, both hallmarks of in situ programmability.

Topology and symmetry changes upon folding.

Group points using Schoenflies notation are shown for all modes. C n refers to an n -fold rotation axis, C nh refers to C n with the addition of a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and C s denotes a group with only a mirror plane (C 1 h). Edge and face connectivity are only shown for lockable modes. Z e is the number of edges that meet at a point (joint). Z f represents the number of faces that meet at an edge. The values of Z e and Z f for each configuration are shown after a vertical line separating them from their Schoenflies notation; parentheses are used whenever more than one connectivity value exists. For each configuration, multiple values of Z e and Z f may exist for a given joint and edge within the lattice. In these cases, all the values are reported in parentheses.

### Individual differences among deep neural network models [^04d90fa0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

RSA builds upon the concept of representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which store all pairwise distances between the stimulus-driven pattern activations in response to a large set of input stimuli (Figs. 1a and 10a). Here we use 1000 test stimuli, 100 from each of the 10 CIFAR-10 categories, such that the resulting RDMs have a size of 1000 × 1000 (Figs. 1b and 10b). The RDMs are symmetric around the diagonal and therefore contain 499,500 unique distance estimates. In the current set of experiments, pairwise distances (using correlation-, cosine-, and (unit length pattern-based) Euclidean distance) are measured in the activation space of individual layers, where each unit corresponds to its own input dimension. The resulting matrix thereby characterizes the representational space spanned by the network units, as it depicts the geometric relations of all different input stimuli with respect to each other. This focus on relative distances renders RSA largely invariant to rotations of the input space (including random shuffling of input dimensions, but see Supplementary Fig. 6). It is therefore well suited for comparisons across deep neural network instances.

Because RDMs are distance matrices, they can be used as a basis for multidimensional scaling (MDS) to project the high-dimensional network activation patterns into 2D. While not a lossless operation, as high-dimensional distances can usually not be perfectly reproduced in 2D, MDS does nevertheless enable us to gain first insights into the internal organization by visualizing how network layers cluster the 1000 test images from the 10 different categories.

In addition to enabling 2D visualizations of network-internal representations (i.e. the organization of test images in high-dimensional layer activation space, Fig. 2), RDMs themselves can be used as observations (each RDM is a point in the high-dimensional space of all possible RDMs) and thereby form the basis for computing "second-level" distance matrices (Fig. 10a). The resulting distance matrices can be used to compare representations across multiple network layers and network instances (rather than test images as in first-level RDMs). Here, we compute a second-level distance matrix based on the RDMs for all network layers and instances. Again, we use MDS to visualize the data points in 2D (Fig. 3).

### Non-line-of-sight snapshots and background mapping with an active corner camera [^d8856234]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Data acquisition

For our demonstrations, we set up a hidden room 2.2 m wide, 2.2 m deep and 3 m high, as shown in Fig. 4 A. Assuming the coordinate system origin is at the bottom of the occluding edge, the left wall is at x = − 1.20 m, the right wall is at x = 1 m, the back wall is at y = 2.2 m, and the ceiling is at z = 3 m. The walls are made of white foam board and the ceiling is black cloth. The SPAD array is positioned on the side of the wall, looking down at the occluding edge origin, allowing half of the array to be occluded. The laser is positioned so that it shines close to the origin. To reject the strong ballistic contribution (first bounce) of light reflected from the origin, we punched a hole in the occluding wall and shined the laser through the hole. The true location of the laser spot on the floor is slightly off the origin, by 6 cm to the right side. The latter was found by cross-checking and minimizing the number of ballistic photons measured by the SPAD array. More recent SPAD arrays incorporate a fast hard gate to rapidly enable and disable the detector with few hundreds picoseconds width, which can be tuned to censor the ballistic photons.

Two test scenarios were analyzed. For the first, we used two rectangular white foam board facets of size 20 × 110 cm as our moving objects. For the second, we used four different targets: a white foam board facet (of size 20 × 110 cm), a gray foam board facet (white foam board painted with a gray diffuse spray paint), a fabric mannequin of size 30 × 80 cm, and a stair-like facet of size 75 × 75 cm. These objects were used to test our method on targets of different shape, height and albedo. All tests were conducted with the objects facing the occluding edge. Before moving objects enter the hidden room, a 30 s acquisition was collected to form an estimate of b, the response of the stationary scene. Then, new measurement frames were collected with moving objects fixed at discrete points along their trajectories during 0.4 s. In Supplementary Note 4, we demonstrate that these measurements can be acquired over a much shorter period of time with little effect on the reconstruction quality.

### Exploring multistability in prismatic metamaterials through local actuation [^f6ab03b1]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

While stretching is permitted in both simulations and experiments, our simulations shows convergence problems when higher stretches occur. For example, when the flat face becomes concave, the normal of the initially rectangular face becomes ill-defined. This could occur when the maximum strain of an edges of the faces become larger than 0.17. Nevertheless, we found this constraint too tight as it was prohibiting large deformations on the structure and the search for stable states. Therefore, we loosen this constraint in our simulations to a maximum strain of edges according towhereandare the deformed and original length of an edge or diagonal, respectively. For all simulations, this value did not produce ill-defined normals. The gradient for this constraint is given by the normalized Jacobian of Eq. (10), and equalsforand.

To create metamaterials represented by infinite large tessellations of the prismatic structures, we apply periodic boundary conditions along the lattice vectorsfor. Depending on the number of lattice vectors, they can span the material in one, two or three dimensions. For the undeformed structure, two vertices are periodically located whenwhereandare the initial positions of the vertices, andrepresents the possible linear combination of the lattice vectors for tiling the unit cell in space. Then, periodic boundary conditions can be applied to these periodically located vertex pairs according toin whichrepresents the deformation of the lattice vector.

Third, to compare the results between prismatic structures based on different polyhedra, we normalize the elastic energy. The elastic energy of any structure is given by Eq. (1). Note that the constraints Eq. (18) and Eq. (19) limit the deformation of the hinge anglesand the edge length, and therefore we can define a total maximum energy when all the angles and edge lengths are at their maximum, respectivelyand. The maximum hinge energy is then equal to

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^4f0fb965]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To conclude, we have shown that the flat faces of the cubic NPs induce orientational order in self-assembled SPs. This might lead to novel crystal structures by inducing directed attachment between neighboring particles and can potentially be used to tune the near-field coupling inside self-assembled superstructures. In addition, we demonstrated by experiments and computer simulations that the SA of cubes in a spherical confinement displays a structural transition from defected SC clusters to clusters with icosahedral symmetry upon changing the NP shape from sharper cubes to more rounded cubes. Quantitative EM tomography on the SPs was essential to determine not only the structure of the SPs on the single NP level, but also to analyze the orientational correlations of the rounded cubes and to compare these with computer simulations. There are two organizing principles that we expect to hold more generally for hard convex-shaped particles. The first principle is that flat faces tend to align particles, both with respect to each other as well as with other flat surfaces. This alignment is strong as it limits 2 out of the 3 rotational degrees of freedom and has an important role at high volume fractions. The second principle is that sharp corners have an important role in keeping neighboring particles at a distance, and even a small amount of rounding of these corners can drastically change the phase behavior. Furthermore, in confinement there is a competition between the bulk and the surface-induced structures, both orientationally as well as positionally. Due to this competition equilibrium defects emerge that can have a complex topology whose details will depend on the symmetries of the equilibrium crystal structure and the free-energy cost of the different defect types. Therefore, we expect that our findings on sharp cubic and rounded cubic NPs to not only be of interest to the SA of micron-sized cubic-shaped particles, but also to lead to new opportunities for a broad range of other shaped crystalline faceted NPs. As such, manipulating particle shape to control local orientational order would help one to construct complex hierarchical structures with strong couplings, thus enabling additional control over the collective properties of such new materials.

### Fast-moving features in the debris disk around AU microscopii [^4c28da45]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

In the 1980s, excess infrared emission was discovered around main-sequence stars; subsequent direct-imaging observations revealed orbiting disks of cold dust to be the source. These 'debris disks' were thought to be by-products of planet formation because they often exhibited morphological and brightness asymmetries that may result from gravitational perturbation by planets. This was proved to be true for the β Pictoris system, in which the known planet generates an observable warp in the disk. The nearby, young, unusually active late-type star AU Microscopii hosts a well-studied edge-on debris disk; earlier observations in the visible and near-infrared found asymmetric localized structures in the form of intensity variations along the midplane of the disk beyond a distance of 20 astronomical units. Here we report high-contrast imaging that reveals a series of five large-scale features in the southeast side of the disk, at projected separations of 10–60 astronomical units, persisting over intervals of 1–4 years. All these features appear to move away from the star at projected speeds of 4–10 kilometres per second, suggesting highly eccentric or unbound trajectories if they are associated with physical entities. The origin, localization, morphology and rapid evolution of these features are difficult to reconcile with current theories.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^64d981fe]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) inside drying emulsion droplets provides a general strategy for hierarchical structuring of matter at different length scales. The local orientation of neighboring crystalline NPs can be crucial to optimize for instance the optical and electronic properties of the self-assembled superstructures. By integrating experiments and computer simulations, we demonstrate that the orientational correlations of cubic NPs inside drying emulsion droplets are significantly determined by their flat faces. We analyze the rich interplay of positional and orientational order as the particle shape changes from a sharp cube to a rounded cube. Sharp cubes strongly align to form simple-cubic superstructures whereas rounded cubes assemble into icosahedral clusters with additionally strong local orientational correlations. This demonstrates that the interplay between packing, confinement and shape can be utilized to develop new materials with novel properties.

### Condensates formed by prion-like low-complexity domains have small-world network structures and interfaces defined by expanded conformations [^b33295d1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Graph theoretical analyses

In Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 9, 10, 13, we report on the small-world network structure formed by condensates. For this, we analyze the undirected, unweighted graphs formed by each condensate over the equilibrated portion of the trajectory. For each snapshot, we associate the condensate with the largest connected number of chains. Two chains are considered connected if at least one pair of stickers between them are adjacent, defined by being withinlattice units on the cubic lattice. We also calculate the betweenness centrality of each chain as defined in Eq. (2). For each condensate, we calculate the average path length and the average clustering coefficient to verify the small-world characteristics of the graph. The empirical average path length, representing the average number of steps along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of nodes (v i, v j), is calculated according to:

Here, n is the number of nodes. We compare this value to the average path length assuming Erdős-Rényi statistics, which we calculate asfor each condensate, whereis the average degree. Finite-size effects were not accounted for because. We calculate the global clustering coefficient following the work of Watts and Strogatzby averaging over the local clustering coefficients for all nodes. For an undirected graph, the local clustering coefficient is given by:

This calculation applies to nodes v j and v k that are in the neighborhood of node n i, with e jk edges, in the set E of edges. The Erdős-Rényi value is calculated for each snapshot as.

### Seeing around corners with edge-resolved transient imaging [^1207e4b9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is a rapidly growing field seeking to form images of objects outside the field of view, with potential applications in autonomous navigation, reconnaissance, and even medical imaging. The critical challenge of NLOS imaging is that diffuse reflections scatter light in all directions, resulting in weak signals and a loss of directional information. To address this problem, we propose a method for seeing around corners that derives angular resolution from vertical edges and longitudinal resolution from the temporal response to a pulsed light source. We introduce an acquisition strategy, scene response model, and reconstruction algorithm that enable the formation of 2.5-dimensional representations-a plan view plus heights-and a 180° field of view for large-scale scenes. Our experiments demonstrate accurate reconstructions of hidden rooms up to 3 meters in each dimension despite a small scan aperture (1.5-centimeter radius) and only 45 measurement locations.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^608a67d1]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

SA of sharp cubes in spherical confinement

We first focus on our two experimental data sets of sharp nanocubes (α ≈ 0.7; Fig. 2) and rounded nanocubes (α ≈ 0.3; Fig. 3) and compare them with computer simulations, later we will discuss the whole range of α values available in our computer simulations (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods Section 3). To investigate the self-assembled superstructure of sharp Fe 3 O 4 nanocubes in drying emulsion droplets, we show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo-high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-HAADF-STEM) images of self-assembled SPs containing sharp Fe 3 O 4 nanocubes (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Methods Section 2.4). At the outside of the SP, the nanocubes are all aligned with their flat faces (i.e. {100} facets) towards the confining interface. In the inner core, the nanocubes form a simple-cubic (SC) lattice very similar to the bulk crystal of perfect cubes. To identify the physical mechanism that drives the assembly, we performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of hard cubes with a range of α values in spherical confinement, and slowly shrunk the confining sphere, thereby mimicking the evaporation process (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods Section 3). For α > 0.5, the cubes on the outside align with the interface, and form a distorted square lattice (Figs. 2c and 4a–e). For α > 0.75, the cubes in the core form a (twisted) SC lattice which connects smoothly to the outer layer at the six {100} facets (Figs. 2d and 4a–c). At the points where the eight {111} facets of the central cubic lattice meet the surface aligned layers defects are formed. Further investigation of our simulation results reveal that eight topological defects with winding number of π/2 are located at these points, which is in perfect agreement with our experimental findings (Fig. 2e, f). Li et al.have studied the 2D assembly of squares on a spherical surface. The defect positions observed by them differ from the positions we observe for sharp cubes. For sharp cubic particles, we observe 8 defects in a cubic arrangement (positioned at the vertices of a cube) while Li et al. observe defects in an square antiprism arrangement (positioned at the vertices of a square antiprism or a twisted cube). In 2D SA on a curved surface, the position of the defects is solely determined by the interactions between the defects through this 2D layer. As shown by Li et al. in this case, the repulsion between the defects will cause the defects to position themselves as far away from each other as possible and to form a square antiprism arrangement. In our case, the defects do not only interact through the surface but also through the particles layers below the surface layers which includes the cubic lattice in the bulk of the SP. It is this interaction with this cubic lattice that favors the positioning of the topological defects near the vertices of this cubic lattice and causes the cubic arrangement of defects. This is strengthened by the fact that we always observe the surface defects near the corners of the central cubic lattice. Furthermore this cubic arrangement of the defects transitions to a square antiprism arrangement of defects when the SP looses its SC core when the cubes become more rounded. The fact that we see a SC core in our experiments with α = 0.7 while we only observe this in simulations for α > 0.75 indicates that there are small differences between the simulations and the experiments, most likely resulting from the polydispersity of the nanocubes and/or possibly a local difference in the ligand density, e.g. on the corners of the nanocubes (Supplementary Methods Section 2.3). Our simulations demonstrate that a (twisted) SC core and curved shells arise spontaneously for hard sharp cubes in spherical confinement, and reveal striking agreement with the experimental observations.

### A short primer on lung stereology [^4b57380b]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Your small pilot study serves another purpose: It can be used to determine your sampling and analysis design for your definite study. This includes e.g. the number of individuals per group, the number of tissue blocks per lung, the number of sections per tissue block, the number of fields of view per section at a given magnification, and the stereological test system (see Step 6 below).

In case the total alveolar surface area of the lung is of interest in your study, how can you measure this? Obviously not directly. Neither can you roll out the inner surface of a lung on a lab bench and use a ruler nor can you trace the alveolar surface in microscopic sections for that purpose. Structural measurements in microscopy are a challenge for two reasons (and forgetting about these challenges leads to common mistakes, see Table 1):
There is a reduction in size. The thin microscopic sections you investigate constitute only a fraction, actually an infinitesimal sample, of the whole lung. However, you want to know the total alveolar surface area of that lung. So you have to measure surface density (the ratio of surface per unit volume) in these sampled sections first and then multiply this surface density by the reference space (total volume of lung parenchyma) to calculate total alveolar surface area in the lung (only then the units make sense — check yourself). Therefore, think of the total volume of the (fixed) lung (see Step 3 below) as the starting point for taking your samples (see Step 4 below) as well as the end point for reporting your data (see Step 6 below). So, measurements on microscopic sections are not the end point, because they are ratios, not totals. These ratios are subject to the " reference trap " where a change in the ratio can be due to a change in the numerator (alveolar surface area) or the denominator (parenchymal volume) or both, thus leading to ambiguity in interpretation. Don't fall into this "reference trap" by reporting ratios. Instead, measure the reference space and compute total values (see Steps 3 and 6 below).
There is a reduction in dimension. The microscopic sections you investigate are thin slices. Although the structures you are interested in are three-dimensional (3D) entities, their representation in sections is two-dimensional (2D). Something that looks small in your section, e.g. an alveolar profile, might be much bigger but is cut at the periphery. A line in your section could represent a tubular as well as a plate-like structure. Depending on the section plane, a tubular structure could also appear as a point in your section created by a transect. The alveolar surface you are interested in (2D) will appear as a thin boundary line (1D) towards the alveolar lumen. In short, we lose one dimension due to the sectioning process, and therefore we lose important qualitative and quantitative information. In analogy to the "reference trap", this has been termed the "dimension trap". The appearance of 3D structures in nearly 2D microscopic sections does not represent the full reality. Don't fall into this "dimension trap" by using particle profile counts in sections to obtain particle number in 3D space. Instead, use the disector (see Step 5 below).

Fig. 1
3D/3D systems formed from [B 7 H 7] 2−.

Computed NICS (in ppm) at the center of the five-membered ring of each cluster are enclosed. Boron atoms in orange and H atoms in white.

These examples are at present imaginary, but are there any synthesized examples that demonstrate the fusion of 3D geometries? The answer is yes. In 2007, Bernhardt, Willner, and coworkers reported the elegant synthesis of [B 21 H 18] − from closo -[B 10 H 10] 2− to fac -[B 20 H 18] 2− to closo -[B 21 H 18] −, that they named a face-fused diicosahedral borate ion. Earlier, in 1963, two separate groups, those of Lipscomb and Muetterties –, both using B 10 H 14 as starting reagent but with distinct synthetic strategies succeeded in synthesizing, isolating, and characterizing B 20 H 16. Its structure, known by single-crystal determination, is consequence of the B 10 H 14 boat shape by facing two B 10 H 14 decks one rotated 90° so as to occupy the minimum volume. Do they share an edge or face? Of the two examples, the closo -[B 21 H 18] − shares one face, three boron atoms producing a global [(BH) 9 B 3 (BH) 9] −, and the B 20 H 16 can be interpreted as two [B 8 H 8] units joined by a B 4 diamond butterfly entity, producing a global [(BH) 8 B 4 (BH) 8]. Fig. 2 encloses the geometries of these fused compounds and their parent units. In addition, we have also proven the aromaticity, and thus its possible synthetic viability, of [B 17 H 14] −, which would be the result of the fusion of two archetypical species [B 10 H 10] 2−. It should be noted that the fusion of two [B 10 H 10] 2− building blocks involves connecting the two apical boron atoms, which are characterized by maintaining their exocluster B–H bonds. This link is also seen later with Sn. And with the aim of completeness, two other boron clusters but based on carboranes, i.e. CB 20 H 18 and [C 2 B 19 H 18] +, have been also analyzed. These are the fusion products of their also aromatic fusing components, [CB 11 H 12] − and C 2 B 10 H 12, respectively (Fig. 3), and were previously proposed by Jemmis et al. who analyzed their isomerization energies and aromaticity. Here, we have focused only on the isomers in which the C atoms are located on the sharing triangular face derived from either [CB 11 H 12] − or C 2 B 10 H 12. We recently reported that the negative NICS values in [B 12 H 12] 2− and C 2 B 10 H 12 are the result of intense diatropic ring currents inside the cage.

### Seeing around corners with edge-resolved transient imaging [^f1bfc526]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The ability to see around corners would be profoundly useful in numerous fields, from helping see past partial blockages in medical settings to enabling surveillance while remaining undetected. Among the applications of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging with the most potential is autonomous navigation, which could leverage existing sensing hardware to gather information about hidden pedestrians, vehicles, or other potential obstacles and plan safer trajectories through intersections or into occluded spaces. Practical implementation of anticipatory imaging would require fast acquisition and reconstruction of a large-scale scene with a wide field of view (FOV) in order to detect the most significant obstacles with enough time to react safely. Unfortunately, despite the advances in NLOS imaging over the past decade, current approaches are limited by their long acquisition times, limited FOV, and small scale. In this article, we present a framework for NLOS imaging that scales up the reconstruction volume and FOV from a small number of measurements, presenting a path toward more practical techniques.

The key challenge of NLOS imaging is that optical reflections from diffuse surfaces scatter light in all directions, destroying directional information and diminishing the intensity as the inverse-square of the distance. Diffuse reflections are less problematic for line-of-sight (LOS) imaging (e.g. conventional photography or lidar) because the directionality of light can be preserved through focused illumination or detection, and the radial falloff is often only a problem at large stand-off distances. The difficulty of NLOS imaging arises because of the cascaded diffuse reflections, when light must first reflect off a relay surface before reaching an observer.

Significant strides have been made to counter this challenge over the decade since the conceptualization of imaging beyond the line of sight. The first experimental demonstration of 3D NLOS imaging used active optical illumination, scanning a pulsed laser over a set of points on a relay wall and performing time-resolved sensing to collect light from the same wall. Informative light incurs at least three diffuse reflections in such a scheme: from a visible relay surface to the hidden scene, off the scene, and back from the relay to the detector, so high-resolution transient information is critical to constrain the reconstruction of possible light directions to a more feasible inverse problem. The majority of subsequent work in 3D NLOS imaging followed this basic approach, with some variation in detection configurations and experimental hardware –.

### Shape-dependent ordering of gold nanocrystals into large-scale superlattices [^e12f17e2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of individual building blocks into highly ordered structures, analogous to spontaneous growth of crystals from atoms, is a promising approach to realize the collective properties of nanocrystals. Yet the ability to reliably produce macroscopic assemblies is unavailable and key factors determining assembly quality/yield are not understood. Here we report the formation of highly ordered superlattice films, with single crystalline domains of up to half a millimetre in two dimensions and thickness of up to several microns from nanocrystals with tens of nanometres in diameter. Combining experimental and computational results for gold nanocrystals in the shapes of spheres, cubes, octahedra and rhombic dodecahedra, we investigate the entire self-assembly process from disordered suspensions to large-scale ordered superlattices induced by nanocrystal sedimentation and eventual solvent evaporation. Our findings reveal that the ultimate coherence length of superlattices strongly depends on nanocrystal shape. Factors inhibiting the formation of high-quality large-scale superlattices are explored in detail.

SPECT camera uniformity testing — intrinsic and extrinsic methods — states that uniformity testing is performed to verify that the camera's sensitivity response is uniform across the detector's face, and may be performed intrinsically by using a point source or extrinsically using a sheet source, usually of Cobalt-57. For intrinsic testing, a radioactive point source is positioned at a distance at least five times the crystal's UFOV from the center of the detector, and the test is usually performed immediately following verification of the energy calibration of the detector. The point source should be a small volume (approximately 0.5 mL) with activity yielding a measured count rate between 10 and 20 kilo counts per second (kcps) (7 to 11 megabecquerel [MBq]); for large rectangular cameras where the point is 7 to 8 feet [2 to 2.5 meters] away, 20 to 25 MBq may yield a similar count rate. For some older systems, a lead ring should be used to shield the outermost tubes from the radiation to prevent edge packing.

### C. elegans collectively forms dynamical networks [^667a69c6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Since the particle's speed is 1 and the radius of the interaction range is 1, the parameters corresponding to the experiments are the estimates from single-worm tracking normalized by half the body length and the average time during movement over half the body length. Half the body length is chosen because the worms are shortened due to the undulation of their bodies during crawling. When the average (ω 0 = 0.0035) and standard deviation (σ ω = 0.35) of the rotation rate and the rotational correlation time (τ = 10) corresponding to the aforementioned estimated values are used, a dynamical network is successfully formed, as shown in Fig. 4a and Supplementary Movie 10.

### 3D-structured supports create complete data sets for electron crystallography [^88ce339c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Many objects have a specific orientation when they lie on a flat surface. A flat box falls on one of its largest faces, and needles do not stand on their tip. Many imaging and diffraction techniques require three-dimensional access to a sample to provide accurate information about its structure. Preferred orientation of the sample often hinders complete three-dimensional access –. Methods based on electron radiation are particularly affected, because the electron beam cannot penetrate the sample support, which is generally much thicker than the sample and which can shade the sample from the electron beam. Several methods address this problem: in two-dimensional electron crystallography and electron tomography, the missing data are partially recovered by extrapolation of the phase and the amplitude. Three-dimensional crystals can be shaped by ion beam milling to force a different orientation, or they are embedded in a resin, which changes their orientation. Incomplete electron diffraction data can also be complemented with X-ray powder diffraction data. In cases of high symmetry space groups, complete data can be collected from a single crystal. However, ~60% of all published crystal structures, both macromolecular and organic compounds, have a low-symmetry space group. Every method that produces crystals in different orientations makes it possible to combine data from several crystals to reach complete data. Furthermore, when these orientations are random, averaging leads to improved data quality. Crystallography is particularly well suited for the combination of different data sets, because determination of the sample orientation is an essential part of data analysis. The correct combination of crystallographic data, called data merging, is well developed. Many materials are transparent to X-rays, and diffraction data can be collected from a crystal in any orientation. In electron diffraction, the situation is very different. The strong interaction of electrons with matter, which enables the study of micrometre- and nanometre-sized crystals –, prevents electrons from penetrating the sample supports. As sample supports have a flat surface, any crystal with a flat shape and a low symmetry space group will result in incomplete data, even when data from many crystals are merged –. A conventional sample support, used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM), is a thin, flat carbon film transparent for electrons. It is stabilised by a copper or gilded metal grid, which is opaque for electrons. This creates a dead zone with no data, known as the missing wedge problem. The systematic lack of diffraction data leads to a distortion of the electrostatic potential map. This map is the basis of the structural model, and thus the missing wedge considerably reduces the reliability of the atom coordinates and of the atomic displacement parameters. Hence, although sometimes structural information from a single crystal may be desired, it is generally more important to reach full data completeness at the expense of merging data from several crystals. An example where data completeness is crucial is the crystallographic study of aluminium substitution in the zeolite ZSM-5. Zeolites are microporous aluminosilicate minerals. The framework structure of ZSM-5 is well known and not the focus of crystallographic studies. Substitution of Al³⁺ for Si⁴⁺ in the siliceous framework generates a charge imbalance, which must be compensated by introducing non-framework species, such as protons and redox-active cations, giving zeolites their catalytic activity. The location and precise speciation of such species requires high-quality data.

### Fast three-dimensional k-space trajectory design using missile guidance ideas [^f698be88]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Three-dimensional (3D) k-space trajectories are needed to acquire volumetric images in MRI. While scan time is determined by the trajectory efficiency, image quality and distortions depend on the shape of the trajectories. There are several 3D trajectory strategies for sampling the k-space using rectilinear or curve schemes. Since there is no evidence about their optimality in terms of image quality and acquisition time, a new design method based on missile guidance ideas is explored. Since air-to-air missile guidance shares similar goals and constraints with the problem of k-space trajectory design, a control approach for missiles is used to design a 3D trajectory. The k-space is divided into small cubes, and each one is treated as a target to be sampled. The main goal is to cover the entire space as quickly and efficiently as possible, with good performance under different conditions. This novel design method is compared to other trajectories using simulated and real data. As an example, a trajectory that requires 0.11 times the number of shots needed by the cylindrical 3DFT acquisition was designed. This trajectory requires more shots (1.66 times) than the stack of spirals, but behaves better under nonideal conditions, such as off-resonance and motion.

### Symmetry collapse due to the presence of multiple local aromaticity in Ge [^de97f069]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The bowl-shaped Ge 6 fragment (Fig. 1b) is reminiscent of similar organic molecules corannulene (C 20 H 10)or sumanene (C 21 H 12), a fullerene fragment, with a curved molecular surface. In contrast, the bowl depth of the Ge 6 fragment is 0.93 Å, which is close to corannulene (~0.88 Å). As shown in Fig. 1c, the central triangle (dotted lines) in the Ge 6 fragment has elongated Ge-Ge distances of av. 2.813 Å like in [Au 3 Ge 45] 9−, which is remarkably longer than other Ge-Ge bonds with an average length of 2.487 Å. Furthermore, the Ge 6 bowl combines with a neighboring Ge 3 face from unit-4 by three Ge-Ge bonds (2.471–2.495 Å) to form an interesting nine-atom cage (Fig. 1d) in which two staggered Ge 3 faces lead to three almost identical edge-sharing pentagons. In unit-1, the Ge-Ge distances (2.5304(16)-2.6739(16) Å) are in the expected rangeand lengths of the prisms (Ge1–Ge7, 2–8, 3–9: 2.8084(16)–2.8744(16) Å) are elongated compared with those (2.71–2.73 Å) in bare D 3h -[Ge 9] 2– cluster. Additionally, the extended bottom face of the central Ge 6 fragment coordinates to the triangle face of unit-1 through three exo Ge-Ge bonds (av. 2.581 Å) forming a distorted triangular prism (Fig. 1e). In contrast to D 3h -unit-1, unit-4 exhibits a largely distorted C 4v -structure with a broader range of Ge-Ge contacts (2.4960(14)-2.8598(15) Å).

### Colloidal fibers and rings by cooperative assembly [^c18585fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Molecular dynamics

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to simulate the self-assembly behavior of the DNA-coated Janus particles. The MD method implemented in the HOOMD-blue simulation package, is available as open source, which can be downloaded at. HOOMD-blue runs both on central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) and is optimized for parallel computing with multiple CPUs and GPUs using MPI domain decomposition. Most simulations of the present work were run on Intel Xeon E5–2680v3 CPUs and NVIDIA Tesla K20X GPUs.

A minimal model is developed to simulate a large number of Janus particles in reasonable timescale. The Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potentialis applied on whole sphere to create a rigid core, and the Morse pair potentialis applied on the patch region to reproduce the self-complementary DNA hybridization (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Note that, we used the Morse pair potential in this study because it is convenient to control the range of attraction, not physical reason. The depletion effect caused by surfactants is modeled in implicit way by applying the Lennard-Jones (LJ) pair potentialon the Janus particles.

The MD simulations were performed with N = 1000 particles for most self-assembly systems, which is large enough size to form multiple superstructures which are usually composed of dozens of particles, but small enough to form those structures in a reasonable timescale. Typically, 48 GPU hours are taken for 10⁸ MD timesteps (dt = 0.005) with Brownian dynamics for each state point. We used periodic boundary conditions in two dimensions and one non-periodic boundary for creating a bottom where particles sediment and assemble. Gravitational force (F G) is applied toward the bottom, which is converted from the experimental gravitational height (0.3 µm)of the present work (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Packing density is kept constant as 0.1 for all system, which is approximately calculated by, where N and v 0 are the number of particles and volume of a particle, respectively. The volume of the assembly space (V assemble) is calculated by multiplying an assembled height and two other simulation box lengths, whereis the unit length of simulation and the diameter of a Janus particle.

### A short primer on lung stereology [^07fa6729]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Step 4: Sampling

Tightly interrelated with the measurement of the reference space and processing of lung tissue is the sampling of tissue blocks for microscopy. Actually, stereology is all about rigorous unbiased (and thus, truely representative equal opportunity) sampling. A bad sample will inevitably result in bad data and thus bad science. In general, sampling must be randomized for location, i.e. each part of the lung has the same chance for being selected for analysis. For anisotropic structures with a preferential orientation in space (e.g. major conducting airways), some parameters (e.g. surface area and length) also require randomization for spatial orientation.

Various stereological sampling designs have been developed. The basic principle for randomization of location is systematic uniform random sampling (SURS). The first sample is chosen randomly but determines the position of all other samples which are selected by a predefined constant sampling interval (Fig. 3). Depending on the target compartment you are interested in, you may have to follow this SURS principle along a cascade of microscopic magnifications (e.g. distinguishing parenchyma vs. non-parenchyma at a low light microscopic magnification, but distinguishing alveolar septum, alveolar airspace and alveolar duct airspace within parenchyma at a higher light microscopic magnification). This principle, where the phase of interest at a lower magnification becomes the reference phase at a higher magnification, has been termed cascade sampling (Fig. 1). Along this cascade, you must not break the SURS chain at any point. Also keep in mind that the microscopic resolution influences the data. This is of particular relevance for alveolar surface area estimation where the well-known "coast of Britain effect" leads to higher values with higher resolution because finer irregularities become visible. Selective targeting of subcompartments within the lung, which can either be defined by anatomy (e.g. individual lung lobes) or by pathology (e.g. lesioned regions), is addressed by stratified sampling where those subcompartments are sampled seperately. The basic concept of fractionator sampling is to keep track of the sampling fraction throughout the cascade of sampling stages (e.g. slices, slabs, blocks, sections, fields of view). Fractionator sampling can easily be combined with SURS (Fig. 3). Its great advantage is that particle number can be estimated without bias independent of tissue deformation by multiplying the total counts at the final sampling step by the inverse of the sampling fraction along all sampling stages.

### Fast topographic optical imaging using encoded search focal scan [^595ce3bd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A central quest in optics is to rapidly extract quantitative information from a sample. Existing topographical imaging tools allow non-contact and three-dimensional measurements at the micro and nanoscales and are essential in applications including precision engineering and optical quality control. However, these techniques involve acquiring a focal stack of images, a time-consuming process that prevents measurement of moving samples. Here, we propose a method for increasing the speed of topographic imaging by orders of magnitude. Our approach involves collecting a reduced set of images, each integrated during the full focal scan, whilst the illumination is synchronously modulated during exposure. By properly designing the modulation sequence for each image, unambiguous reconstruction of the object height map is achieved using far fewer images than conventional methods. We describe the theoretical foundations of our technique, characterise its performance, and demonstrate sub-micrometric topographic imaging over 100µm range of static and dynamic systems at rates as high as 67 topographies per second, limited by the camera frame rate. The high speed of the technique and its ease of implementation could enable a paradigm shift in optical metrology, allowing the real-time characterisation of large or rapidly moving samples.

### Printing soft matter in three dimensions [^1c5605f7]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Light- and ink-based three-dimensional (3D) printing methods allow the rapid design and fabrication of materials without the need for expensive tooling, dies or lithographic masks. They have led to an era of manufacturing in which computers can control the fabrication of soft matter that has tunable mechanical, electrical and other functional properties. The expanding range of printable materials, coupled with the ability to programmably control their composition and architecture across various length scales, is driving innovation in myriad applications. This is illustrated by examples of biologically inspired composites, shape-morphing systems, soft sensors and robotics that only additive manufacturing can produce.

### Ultracompact 3D microfluidics for time-resolved structural biology [^cd089f9c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We reduced nozzle print time 350-fold to under one minute through a combination of different approaches (Fig. 2). First, we determined that prints with voxel spacings of up to 6.5 μm (Z) and 1.5 μm (X, Y), corresponding to 1.1 × 10 6 voxels per block and a 50-fold print time reduction, are sufficiently sturdy for microfluidic operations. Second, we replaced solid volumes in the design with scaffolds bounded by 20-μm-thick shells. All surface-exposed features were formed by the shells and the scaffolds provided structural integrity. Unexposed resin trapped in the shell and scaffold was cured after development through wide area UV lamp illumination. Third, we thoroughly reduced overall nozzle size to less than three print blocks (Fig. 2b), including fluid port connectors for interfacing with glass capillaries (Supplementary Fig. 1). Finally, to ensure optimal jetting performance, we combine the fast print settings for the nozzle body with the smooth surface print setting for the nozzle tip, including all orifices into a single job, printing in less than a minute (Fig. 2b, Design 1, Supplementary Movie 1). Taken together, this approach offers an efficient avenue for high-volume low-cost production of single nozzles and nozzle arrays, but also larger devices spanning several millimeters and larger.

### Metasurface-driven full-space structured light for three-dimensional imaging [^9f4be633]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Structured light (SL)-based depth-sensing technology illuminates the objects with an array of dots, and backscattered light is monitored to extract three-dimensional information. Conventionally, diffractive optical elements have been used to form laser dot array, however, the field-of-view (FOV) and diffraction efficiency are limited due to their micron-scale pixel size. Here, we propose a metasurface-enhanced SL-based depth-sensing platform that scatters high-density ~10K dot array over the 180° FOV by manipulating light at subwavelength-scale. As a proof-of-concept, we place face masks one on the beam axis and the other 50° apart from axis within distance of 1m and estimate the depth information using a stereo matching algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate the replication of the metasurface using the nanoparticle-embedded-resin (nano-PER) imprinting method which enables high-throughput manufacturing of the metasurfaces on any arbitrary substrates. Such a full-space diffractive metasurface may afford ultra-compact depth perception platform for face recognition and automotive robot vision applications.

### Large-scale modular and uniformly thick origami-inspired adaptable and load-carrying structures [^fc8b15d1]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Figure 5D shows that the local modularity allows for rapid repair of MUTOIS systems. We had experimentally tested the MUTOIS bridge shown in Fig. 5D to failure and obtained its ultimate strength (will be discussed later). After the experiment, one triangular truss panel in the bridge was damaged. This damaged panel can be directly replaced, or remaining panels can be reused to build a different MUTOIS system. This rapid repair is possible because all triangles have the same size and geometry. When fabricated with symmetric connection holes, the triangular panels are not subject to handedness issues and can be installed in any matching orientation (see laser cutter CAD file in Supplementary Data 1). In this work, we replace the damaged truss panel and use the undamaged truss panels to build a MUTOIS column as demonstrated in Supplementary Movie 4. We show that the rebuilt MUTOIS column can maintain its foldability because the folding pattern is preserved when reusing the same triangles. Moreover, this column maintains the load-carrying capability as will be shown later.

In addition, the MUTOIS has global modularity with rectangular geometric features. This allows us to connect multiple MUTOIS units to form different structural systems through a mix-and-match assembly process. Figure 5E and Supplementary Movie 1 highlight the superior adaptability of MUTOIS, where we can combine two units to build a 4-m-long bridge, a tall column, or three bus stops with different configurations. In this demonstration, we first use the compactly packaged MUTOIS sections to build the bus stop A, which takes about 40 minutes. We then reconfigure the bus stop into a 4-m-long bridge after another 45 minutes of assembly time. The 4-m-long bridge can support the weight of five persons with little deformation, highlighting its large load-carrying capability. This structure can also be used as a tall column. Next, we reconfigure the bridge to bus stops configurations B and C, which takes less than 30 min. From the bus stop configurations, reconfiguring back to the packaged state takes about 15 minutes.

3.4 Refinement of the surface mesh reduces the number of missed voxels

To test whether projecting fMRI data onto typical cortical surface meshes can result in lost fMRI voxels and thus missing data, and how this loss depends on both voxel grid and mesh vertex spacing, we counted the number of unique voxels projected onto the surface for various surface mesh resolutions. (Here, voxel index values, which are integers, were projected to the surface, and thus nearest‐neighbor interpolation was used to preserve their integer values.) The number of the lost voxels was then quantified by counting the number of unique values on the surface mesh.

As depicted in the schematic in Figure 4a, the mesh refinement scheme used here adds new vertices to the triangle edge mid‐points, and as the number and density of the vertices increases more unique voxels are retained during surface projection. This schematic also shows how refining the surface mesh can not only help reduce the number of missing voxels, but can also help minimize small‐scale spatial distortions or displacements that are incurred when projecting voxel values to vertices that are spatially distant from the corresponding voxel centroid. If the distance between neighboring voxels is smaller than the distance between neighboring vertex, there will be a chance that some voxels will be missed and not projected onto any vertex. As expected, Figure 4b shows, for an example subject, how the number of unique voxels projected onto the surface increases with increasing density of vertices as the mesh is iteratively refined from one to three steps. This evaluation was performed on the gray/white matter boundary surface generated by FreeSurfer from standard 1‐mm anatomical data, whose cross‐section with the image slice is represented by the black contour, because this cortical surface is more commonly used to preserve spatial specificity in BOLD fMRI studies. In order to visualize the unique voxels projected onto the surface, here we visualized the voxel index projected onto the surface as a mask in volume space. As can be seen in the zoomed‐in view, progressively more unique voxels near the gray/white matter boundary surface are retained (i.e. fewer voxels are lost) as the surface mesh is refined. Figure 4c shows quantitatively the number of unique voxels captured during surface projection with increasingly refined surface meshes, and demonstrates an increase in unique voxel count with increasing vertex resolution that is in line with what can be seen qualitatively in Figure 4b. Perhaps surprisingly, the number of unique voxels only reaches a plateau after three iterations of refinement for this example 1‐mm resolution volumetric fMRI data, suggesting that further steps of refinement may be necessary for even higher resolution fMRI data.

### Barrier membranes used for ridge augmentation: is there an optimal pore size? [^54408630]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify the optimal pore size of barrier membranes for successful alveolar ridge reconstruction procedures, to determine if cortical perforations have any effect on bone regeneration, and to reiterate that bone graft containment is an important parameter for successful regeneration.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study performed on hound dogs. Corticocancellous tibial bone grafting was performed to the lateral border of the mandible and protected with barrier membranes (meshes). The experiment analyzed three different pore sized meshes, compared with controls without the mesh. Two meshes (macroporous and microporous) were made of titanium, and one was a resorbable mesh. Meshes were preformed into the shape of a cube with one face open. Each side of the cube measured approximately 10 mm. Cubes were open-faced on one side, to facilitate packing of the graft material. The dogs received bilateral ramus grafts. Cortical perforations were created on the left ramus of all the dogs and compared with the right side, which did not have perforations. The dogs were randomly divided into 3 groups and sacrificed at intervals of 1, 2, and 4 months. Before sacrifice, all dogs received 2 doses of tetracycline as a marker for new bone formation. Histomorphometry was performed by using Bioquant image-analysis software. Areas of new bone and soft tissue were measured. The rate of mineral apposition was also calculated. All values obtained via histomorphometry were statistically analyzed with a t test.

Results

Thirty-one experimental sites were evaluated. The amount of new bone growth into the macroporous mesh was significantly higher than in the other groups. The mean area of new bone formation in large and small meshes was 66.26 ± 13.78 mm² and 52.82 ± 24.75 mm², respectively. In the resorbable mesh group, the mean area of new bone formed was 46.76 ± 21.22 mm². The amount of new bone formed in the control group was 29.80 ± 9.35 mm². There was no significant difference in amount of bone formation between left and right sides (P = 0.3172). Resorbable meshes had significant soft tissue ingrowth (23.47 mm²) compared with macroporous mesh (16.96 mm²) and microporous mesh (22.29 mm²). Controls had the least amount of soft tissue ingrowth (9.41 mm²). Mineral apposition rate was found to be higher in the resorbable group (2.41 microm/day), and the rate was lowest (1.09 microm/day) in the large pore mesh group.

Conclusion

Macroporous membranes facilitated greater bone regeneration compared with microporous and resorbable membranes. Macroporous mesh also prevented significant soft tissue ingrowth compared with other meshes. Containment of a bone graft is the most critical parameter in successful bone regeneration. Cortical perforations did not have any effect on the quantity of regenerated bone. Further research should be directed toward identifying a critical pore size and manufacturing a reliable mesh that would prevent excessive soft tissue ingrowth in ridge augmentation procedures.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Single-shot compressed ultrafast photography at one hundred billion frames per second [^19689d8b]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

The capture of transient scenes at high imaging speed has been long sought by photographers, with early examples being the well known recording in 1878 of a horse in motion and the 1887 photograph of a supersonic bullet. However, not until the late twentieth century were breakthroughs achieved in demonstrating ultrahigh-speed imaging (more than 10⁵ frames per second). In particular, the introduction of electronic imaging sensors based on the charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology revolutionized high-speed photography, enabling acquisition rates of up to 10⁷ frames per second. Despite these sensors' widespread impact, further increasing frame rates using CCD or CMOS technology is fundamentally limited by their on-chip storage and electronic readout speed. Here we demonstrate a two-dimensional dynamic imaging technique, compressed ultrafast photography (CUP), which can capture non-repetitive time-evolving events at up to 10¹¹ frames per second. Compared with existing ultrafast imaging techniques, CUP has the prominent advantage of measuring an x-y-t (x, y, spatial coordinates; t, time) scene with a single camera snapshot, thereby allowing observation of transient events with temporal resolution as tens of picoseconds. Furthermore, akin to traditional photography, CUP is receive-only, and so does not need the specialized active illumination required by other single-shot ultrafast imagers. As a result, CUP can image a variety of luminescent — such as fluorescent or bioluminescent — objects. Using CUP, we visualize four fundamental physical phenomena with single laser shots only: laser pulse reflection and refraction, photon racing in two media, and faster-than-light propagation of non-information (that is, motion that appears faster than the speed of light but cannot convey information). Given CUP's capability, we expect it to find widespread applications in both fundamental and applied sciences, including biomedical research.
