## Question

Can pseudoaneurysms be managed conservatively without surgical intervention?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pseudoaneurysms can be managed conservatively without surgical intervention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core rupture risk that distinguishes pseudoaneurysms from true aneurysms. Then, I should verify how location, size, etiology, and patient factors modify risk and thus the threshold for intervention. Next, I will examine the evidence for nonoperative strategies, including observation, compression, and thrombin injection, and I should confirm where these are appropriate. After that, I need to review guideline positions across vascular beds. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and state when conservative management is reasonable versus when it is unsafe, making sure I anchor this to high-quality sources and key series.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental risk profile. Pseudoaneurysms lack a full arterial wall and are contained only by adventitia and organized thrombus, so they carry a substantially higher rupture risk than true aneurysms; visceral pseudoaneurysms frequently present ruptured and have markedly higher rupture rates at presentation compared with true aneurysms, which is why most guidelines favor intervention unless there are compelling reasons otherwise [^89562f0f] [^86880b0e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify how location changes management. For femoral artery pseudoaneurysms after catheterization, ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is first-line and achieves high success with low morbidity, and many small femoral pseudoaneurysms can be observed with serial ultrasound because a meaningful fraction thrombose spontaneously, especially when antithrombotic therapy is minimized or held, though dual antiplatelet therapy increases failure of observation and warrants closer surveillance or earlier intervention [^368a86b3] [^3e078570] [^fef68b6b].

> I need to check visceral artery guidance next. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends treating essentially all visceral pseudoaneurysms when the patient is an acceptable risk because rupture can be catastrophic and size is an unreliable predictor of risk; this applies to splenic, hepatic, celiac, and mesenteric arteries, where endovascular exclusion is generally preferred when feasible, reserving open surgery for anatomy not amenable to endovascular therapy or for failed endovascular treatment [^86880b0e] [^5443c592] [^1bb46a21] [^5c8da2fa].

> Wait, let me verify the renal artery stance. Renal pseudoaneurysms are typically managed with selective embolization given their propensity to rupture; while rare spontaneous resolution is reported, observation alone is not recommended as a routine strategy because of the high hemorrhagic risk, and endovascular therapy remains the mainstay when feasible [^f30c9438].

> I will now examine aortic pseudoaneurysms. For blunt traumatic aortic pseudoaneurysms, nonoperative management can be considered in carefully selected, high-risk patients with limited circumferential involvement and stable imaging, but failure of nonoperative care does occur and mandates close surveillance; similarly, post–Type A dissection repair pseudoaneurysms may be observed in asymptomatic patients with dedicated aortic follow-up, acknowledging that a minority will eventually require repair [^d8803920] [^3d76bc2e] [^2ca0d7a6].

> Let me consider cardiac pseudoaneurysms. Left ventricular pseudoaneurysms after myocardial infarction or surgery are classically managed surgically due to high rupture risk, but case-based evidence shows that very small, narrow-necked, stable pseudoaneurysms in high surgical risk patients may be managed conservatively with close imaging follow-up; this remains exception rather than rule and requires multidisciplinary judgment [^395ef0e7] [^6e0b2f5b].

> Next, I should review pediatric and neurovascular contexts. In children with blunt splenic or hepatic trauma, small pseudoaneurysms may thrombose spontaneously, but higher-grade injuries carry meaningful rupture risk and some centers advocate routine screening before discharge; for extracranial carotid or vertebral dissecting pseudoaneurysms, medical therapy alone is safe in many patients, with intervention reserved for enlargement, symptoms, or high-risk features, and age ≤ 50 years and diameter ≤ 6 mm predict higher likelihood of resolution with medical management [^0e31063a] [^af8c839e] [^71a31d6c].

> But wait, what if the pseudoaneurysm is infected or mycotic. I should double-check that point. Infected pseudoaneurysms, including mycotic and tuberculous lesions, generally require source control and definitive repair because of the high risk of rupture and treatment failure with antibiotics alone; staged endovascular bridging followed by surgical reconstruction is a reasonable strategy in selected cases [^06c41e7f] [^cfb03bb6].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. Conservative management may be reasonable when the following align: small size, stable or decreasing on serial imaging, low-risk location such as femoral or select extracranial carotid segments, no active bleeding or symptoms, no infection, and low likelihood of spontaneous rupture based on morphology and patient factors; conversely, intervention is indicated for visceral pseudoaneurysms, infected pseudoaneurysms, large or expanding lesions, symptomatic presentations, high-risk locations like aortic root or left ventricle, or when antithrombotic therapy impedes spontaneous thrombosis, with endovascular therapy preferred when anatomy allows and surgery reserved for failure or unsuitable anatomy [^86880b0e] [^368a86b3] [^af8c839e] [^3d76bc2e].

> In conclusion, yes, pseudoaneurysms can sometimes be managed conservatively, but I need to ensure I emphasize that this is the exception and is highly context dependent. Most visceral pseudoaneurysms warrant repair due to rupture risk, whereas selected femoral, renal, aortic, cardiac, and neurovascular pseudoaneurysms may be observed or treated with minimally invasive techniques when carefully chosen and monitored, ideally within multidisciplinary vascular care pathways [^86880b0e] [^368a86b3] [^f30c9438] [^d8803920] [^395ef0e7] [^af8c839e].

---

In select cases, **conservative management** of pseudoaneurysms is feasible, but only with strict criteria and close surveillance. Small (< 2 cm), asymptomatic, stable femoral pseudoaneurysms may be observed with serial ultrasound, as 40–70% thrombose spontaneously, especially off anticoagulation [^3e078570] [^fef68b6b]. Observation is **not appropriate for visceral, renal, or aortic pseudoaneurysms** because of their high rupture risk; these generally require endovascular or surgical repair [^86880b0e] [^f30c9438] [^2ca0d7a6]. Conservative management should be abandoned if the lesion enlarges, becomes symptomatic, or fails to thrombose within 2–4 weeks, prompting definitive therapy [^fef68b6b].

---

## Criteria for conservative management

Conservative management is generally considered for pseudoaneurysms that meet the following criteria:

- **Size**: Small pseudoaneurysms, typically less than 2 cm in diameter, have a higher likelihood of spontaneous thrombosis and resolution [^fef68b6b].

- **Symptoms**: Asymptomatic pseudoaneurysms without signs of expansion, rupture, or infection are more suitable for conservative management.

- **Location**: Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms, particularly those arising from iatrogenic catheterization, are more amenable to conservative management due to their accessibility for ultrasound monitoring and higher spontaneous thrombosis rates [^3e078570].

- **Patient factors**: Patients with significant comorbidities, high surgical risk, or those who are hemodynamically stable may be considered for conservative management.

---

## Evidence supporting conservative management

Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of conservative management in selected patients:

- **Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms**: A study by Liau et al. (2007) reported that 42% of femoral pseudoaneurysms managed conservatively thrombosed spontaneously, with an additional 42% remaining stable without intervention. Only 16% required delayed treatment due to expansion or persistence [^3e078570].

- **Ultrasound-guided compression or thrombin injection**: For pseudoaneurysms that fail to thrombose spontaneously, ultrasound-guided compression or thrombin injection has been shown to be highly effective, with success rates exceeding 90% in some series [^368a86b3] [^aca26316].

- **Visceral artery pseudoaneurysms**: While conservative management is generally not recommended for visceral artery pseudoaneurysms due to their high rupture risk, some case reports have documented spontaneous thrombosis and resolution in select cases. However, these cases are rare and not generalizable [^f30c9438].

---

## Risks and limitations of conservative management

Conservative management carries inherent risks and limitations:

- **Rupture risk**: Pseudoaneurysms, by definition, lack a complete arterial wall and are prone to rupture, which can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage [^dd7fbe17].

- **Expansion**: Pseudoaneurysms may enlarge over time, increasing the risk of rupture and necessitating intervention [^3e078570].

- **Failure of spontaneous thrombosis**: Not all pseudoaneurysms will thrombose spontaneously, and some may persist or enlarge despite conservative management [^3e078570].

- **Limited evidence**: The evidence supporting conservative management is largely based on small retrospective studies and case series, with limited high-quality randomized controlled trials.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements provide the following recommendations:

- **Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms**: Conservative management with serial ultrasound surveillance is reasonable for small, asymptomatic pseudoaneurysms, particularly if the patient is not on anticoagulation therapy. Intervention is recommended for pseudoaneurysms larger than 2 cm, symptomatic lesions, or those that fail to thrombose spontaneously within a reasonable timeframe [^fef68b6b] [^368a86b3].

- **Visceral artery pseudoaneurysms**: Conservative management is generally not recommended due to the high risk of rupture. Endovascular embolization or surgical repair is the preferred treatment approach [^86880b0e] [^f30c9438].

- **Aortic pseudoaneurysms**: Conservative management may be considered in select cases with careful surveillance, but most cases require surgical or endovascular intervention due to the high risk of rupture [^2ca0d7a6] [^3d76bc2e].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Conservative management of pseudoaneurysms is feasible in carefully selected patients with small, asymptomatic, stable lesions, particularly in the femoral artery. However, this approach requires **close surveillance** with serial imaging and a low threshold for intervention if the pseudoaneurysm enlarges, becomes symptomatic, or fails to thrombose spontaneously. Conservative management is **not appropriate for visceral, renal, or aortic pseudoaneurysms** due to their high rupture risk, and definitive endovascular or surgical intervention is generally recommended in these cases.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: a management-based classification system [^d80c8260]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Managing peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms is complex and challenging. Advances in imaging technology and interventional radiology have had an enormous impact on both the diagnosis and the treatment of this condition. Pseudoaneurysms can arise in a number of different clinical settings but are associated mostly with pancreatitis and pancreatobiliary surgery.

Initially, the high mortality associated with this condition is due to uncontrolled torrential bleeding. If the patient survives this initial phase there is a risk of rebleeding, which can occur from days to years after the initial presentation. The additional late mortality may be substantial if patients are not managed appropriately during their initial presentation. Treatment strategies should be based on the mechanisms that lead to the formation of pseudoaneurysms and to the ongoing pathophysiological processes that result in rebleeding.

Currently, the best method of assessing a relatively stable patient is a computerised tomography (CT) angiogram with or without a formal angiogram. This usually provides an accurate diagnosis but also allows, if required, radiological intervention by embolisation of the feeding vessel or the pseudoaneurysm itself. If visceral ischaemia distal to the pseudoaneurysm is a concern, a stent may be placed. Patients with haemodynamic instability may need immediate surgical intervention, although this can be fraught with danger even in experienced hands.

There are no data on definitive long-term management strategies for this condition. This is partly due to its low rate of occurrence but also because of a poor understanding of the pathophysiological processes involved. The mechanisms by which most peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms are formed are thought to be related to the underlying inflammation, the presence of pancreatic juices, and the subsequent infection. In postoperative patients, pseudoaneurysms are often associated with intra-abdominal sepsis due to anastomotic leakage. Unless these underlying processes are dealt with adequately, the risk of further bleeding can be substantial.

The aim of this article is to review the literature regarding pancreatic pseudoaneurysms with an emphasis on current treatment practices. We also propose a management classification system based on the pathophysiological processes and the exact anatomical site of the pseudoaneurysm. A classification such as this may help with decision making during initial and definitive management to minimise the risk of rebleeding and to reduce late mortality.

### Interventional radiology in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of pseudoaneurysms [^263e3106]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Arterial wall disruption, as a consequence of inflammation/infection, trauma (penetrating or blunt), or iatrogenic causes, may result in pseudoaneurysm formation. Currently, iatrogenic causes are increasing as a result of the growth of endovascular intervention. The frequency of other causes also seems to be increasing, but this may simply be the result of increased diagnosis by better imaging techniques, such as multidetector contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Clinically, pseudoaneurysms may be silent, may present with local or systemic signs, or can rupture with catastrophic consequences. Open surgical repair, previously the mainstay of treatment, has largely been replaced by image-guided occlusion methods. On the basis of an experience of over 100 pseudoaneurysms, treatments at various anatomical sites, imaging modalities used for accurate diagnosis, current changing therapeutic options for pseudoaneurysm management, approved embolization agents, and clinical follow-up requirements to ensure adequate treatment will be discussed. Image-guided direct percutaneous and endovascular embolization of pseudoaneurysms are established treatment options with favorable success rates and minimal morbidity. The pendulum has now swung from invasive surgical repair of pseudoaneurysms to that of image-guided interventional radiology.

### Diagnosis and management of pseudoaneurysms: an update [^cae16b16]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

"Pseudoaneurysm" is a term that describes disruption of an artery with patent flow in a defined space beyond the confines of the vessels. A pseudoaneurysm can involve any vascular bed and is usually associated with direct arterial injury or erosion of an artery by an adjacent tumor or inflammation. In this article, we discuss different clinical settings and various imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, as well as conventional angiography used for the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysms. We also describe the role of newer endovascular, percutaneous, and traditional surgical approaches for the treatment of visceral and peripheral pseudoaneurysms in different clinical circumstances.

### Pseudoaneurysms and the role of minimally invasive techniques in their management [^88d58b67]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms are common vascular abnormalities that represent a disruption in arterial wall continuity. Some complications associated with pseudoaneurysms develop unpredictably and carry high morbidity and mortality rates. The advent of new radiologic techniques with a greater sensitivity for asymptomatic disease has allowed more frequent diagnosis of pseudoaneurysms. Conventional angiography remains the standard of reference for diagnosis but is an invasive procedure, and noninvasive diagnostic modalities (eg, ultrasonography [US], computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography) should be included in the initial work-up if possible. A complete work-up will help in determining the cause, location, morphologic features, rupture risk, and clinical setting of the pseudoaneurysm; identifying any patient comorbidities; and evaluating surrounding structures and relevant vascular anatomy, information that is essential for treatment planning. Therapeutic options have evolved in recent years from the traditional surgical option toward a less invasive approach and include radiologic procedures such as US-guided compression, US-guided percutaneous thrombin injection, and endovascular management (embolization, stent-graft placement). The use of noninvasive treatment has led to a marked decrease in the morbidity and mortality rates for pseudoaneurysms.

### Vascular pseudoaneurysms in urology: clinical characteristics and management [^5757fdd9]. Journal of Endourology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Vascular pseudoaneurysm is a well-documented complication that results after injury to an arterial wall. We review the urologic literature for all reported postprocedural and post-traumatic cases of pseudoaneurysm.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the peer-reviewed literature was performed for reported cases of vascular pseudoaneurysm, with emphasis on clinical presentation and treatment options.

Results

Vascular pseudoaneurysm is a high-pressure collection of blood that communicates directly with an arterial vessel. The clinical presentation varies, depending on the location and size of the lesion, and can be quite dramatic and potentially life threatening. There may be an increasing incidence of pseudoaneurysms after minimally invasive and laparoscopic techniques. Selective and superselective embolization is the preferred treatment for patients with vascular pseudoaneurysms.

Conclusions

Vascular pseudoaneurysm is an important but rare complication that is increasingly reported after minimally invasive urologic surgery. This diagnosis necessitates a high index of suspicion and radiologic acumen. Treatment is individually tailored to each patient, but selective embolization appears to be the standard of care.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: a management-based classification system [^c0c8dbee]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms can arise in a number of different clinical settings but are associated mostly with pancreatitis and pancreatobiliary surgery. The aim of this study is to review the current literature and to propose a management classification system based on the pathophysiological processes and the exact anatomical site of peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature from 1995 to 2012 was performed. Articles on studies describing peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms in the setting of pancreatitis or major hepatic or pancreatic surgery with more than ten patients were included. Seventeen eligible studies were identified and reviewed.

Results

The demographic characteristics of the patients in all studies were similar with a predominance of males and a mean age of 55 years. The overall mortality rate varied greatly among the studies, ranging from 0 to 60%. Embolisation was the first line of management in the majority of the studies, with surgery reserved for failed embolisation or for haemodynamically unstable cases. Embolisation of the hepatic artery or its branches was associated with high rates of morbidity (56%) and hepatic failure (19%). More recent studies show that stents are used increasingly for vessels that cannot be embolised safely. Late bleeding, a major cause of mortality and morbidity, is generally underreported. The proposed classification system is based on three factors: (1) the type of artery from which the pseudoaneurysm arises, (2) whether communication with the gastrointestinal tract is present, and (3) whether there is high concentration of pancreatic juice at the bleeding site.

Conclusion

The management of peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms usually comprises a combination of interventional radiology and surgery and this may be assisted by a logical classification system.

### Renal pseudoaneurysm: an overview [^f30c9438]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Renal pseudoaneurysm is a rare vascular lesion that arises when an arterial injury within the kidney leads to contained hemorrhage. The associated hematoma forms outside the arterial wall and is typically surrounded by a layer of fibrous inflammatory tissue and blood clot. These lesions are unstable and their rupture can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. Renal pseudoaneurysm has been reported to occur in various clinical scenarios, including after renal trauma, surgery and percutaneous procedures, as well as inflammatory and neoplastic processes within the kidney. Endovascular selective angioembolization is the mainstay of treatment, although surgery might be indicated when hemostasis and repair of the arterial wall defect are required. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided embolization is an additional option for patients with unfavorable vascular anatomy, or who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to the use of intravenous contrast agents. Some evidence suggests that these lesions can regress without intervention, although observation alone is not recommended as a management strategy in the vast majority of patients owing to the high risk of rupture. Evaluation and management of patients with renal pseudoaneurysm must take into account each individual's circumstances, due to the difficulty of accurately predicting the probability of spontaneous resolution or rupture.

### Management and outcome of bleeding pseudoaneurysm associated with chronic pancreatitis [^3c23a4ac]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Management of bleeding pseudoaneurysms remains challenging for clinicians. Angiography is valuable in localizing bleeding pseudoaneurysms. In this limited series, patients with bleeding pseudoaneurysms associated with chronic pancreatitis treated by surgery appeared to achieve good results.

### A 34-year-old man with a neck mass [^cfb03bb6]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment of pseudoaneurysms generally requires a combination of medical therapy and surgery. For tubercular pseudoaneurysms, anti-TB drug therapy alone may not be adequate, because there is a risk of persistent infection and rupture. Patients with HIV-associated pseudoaneurysms should receive effective ART, as would be recommended for other HIV-associated complication. Surgery should be performed urgently for both tubercular and HIV-associated pseudoaneurysms regardless of the size, because rupture may occur at any size. Surgical treatment may be open or endovascular, depending on the location and length of the pseudoaneurysm, age and general condition of the patient, and the surgeon's experience. Endovascular surgery to insert a stent at the site of the pseudoaneurysm is minimally invasive and a preferred option for patients who cannot withstand open surgery. Although embolization has been used extensively to treat visceral or iatrogenic small vessel aneurysms, it has not been used to treat TB- or HIV-associated large vessel pseudoaneurysms. Recurrence in other sites after resection has been reported in both tubercular and HIV-associated pseudoaneurysms.

This case highlights the challenges of diagnosing and managing patients with pseudoaneurysm in resource-limited settings with high prevalence of both HIV and TB. Some blood and microbiology tests that should have been performed in the workup of this patient were unavailable at the hospital. MRI and CT imaging are not readily available, limiting the capacity to confirm the diagnosis radiologically. Despite the limited investigations, the attending clinical team managed the patient by applying good clinical judgment informed by knowledge of local disease patterns. Finally, vascular surgery is not often available, and most patients cannot afford to travel to other countries for vascular surgery. A combination of these factors inevitably contributes to the high mortality associated with pseudoaneurysms in low-resource settings.

### Surgery versus non-surgical treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysms [^aca26316]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Femoral pseudoaneurysms may complicate up to 8% of vascular interventional procedures. Small pseudoaneurysms can spontaneously clot, while others need definitive treatment. Surgery is considered the gold-standard treatment, although is not without risk in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. Less invasive treatment options, such as Duplex ultrasound-guided compression and percutaneous thrombin injection are available, however, evidence of their efficacy is limited.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatments for femoral pseudoaneurysms resulting from endovascular procedures, specifically assessing less invasive treatment options such as ultrasound-guided compression or percutaneous thrombin injection.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group's Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005 (last searched October 12, 2005). Additional searches were also made of bibliographies of papers found through these searches and by handsearching relevant journals.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing two treatments for femoral pseudoaneurysms following vascular interventional procedures were considered for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two studies were included in the analysis: ultrasound-guided application of a mechanical device (FemoStop) versus blind application; ultrasound-guided compression versus percutaneous thrombin injection. Data were extracted independently by both authors.

Main Results

Mechanical compression with a FemoStop was effective in achieving thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm although ultrasound-guided application of this failed to confer any benefit (relative risk (RR) 1.07; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.75 to 1.53, P = 0.7). Percutaneous thrombin injection was more effective than ultrasound-guided compression in achieving thrombosis of a pseudoaneurysm (RR 7.50; 95% CI 2.06 to 27.25, P = 0.002 at 24 hours after treatment; RR 2.50; 95% CI 1.35 to 4.65, P = 0.004 at 48 hours after treatment). There was no statistically significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups and no complications were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The limited evidence base appears to support the use of thrombin injection as an effective treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysm. A pragmatic approach may be to use ultrasound-guided compression as first-line treatment, reserving thrombin injection for those in whom the procedure fails.

### Management of post-traumatic maxillofacial pseudoaneurysms: review of the literature and suggested algorithm [^2ccaf3c4]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A pseudoaneurysm (PA) is a collection of blood caused by an incomplete tear in the vessel wall. PA can be arterial or venous in origin. In the maxillofacial region, arterial PA can result from surgical interventions. Venous PAs in the maxillofacial region have never been described. A standardized protocol for management of post-traumatic PAs in the maxillofacial region would help clinicians make treatment decisions. On the basis of the available literature and our institutional experience, we present an algorithm for management of post-traumatic maxillofacial PAs. We also present patients from our institution who illustrate some of the management options in the algorithm.

### Pseudoaneurysm inside of a true aneurysm [^6e0b2f5b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Left ventricular pseudoaneurysms and true aneurysms are two possible complications of myocardial infarction. However, while pseudoaneuryms require urgent surgical resection, true aneuryms can often be managed medically, making imperative an accurate diagnosis.

The authors describe a case of a delayed rupture of a true aneurysm that was contained and gave rise to a pseudoaneurysm inside of a true aneurysm. The echocardiography allowed the differential diagnosis for a timely surgical intervention which resulted in the patient's full recovery.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: a management-based classification system [^beab24f9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Of course, there are delayed complications other than rebleeding that can occur after initial control of the bleeding pseudoaneurysm. They are related to the ongoing pathology as well as foreign body (coils or stents) placement. Carr et al. described 3/16 patients with pancreatitis treated for a pseudoaneurysm who developed late complications. One patient required drainage for an infection of a thrombosed pseudocyst and two others had problems with coil migration into the left and right hepatic arteries, respectively, causing left lobar infarction in one. This highlights the importance of investigating and treating any associated pathology as well as dealing with the bleeding pseudoaneurysm. These patients are often unstable and require prioritisation of treatment, usually by controlling the bleeding first, resuscitation second, and then a planned approach to fixing the precipitating pathology. The timing of endoscopic or surgical management of a pseudocyst, or operative intervention for an anastomotic leak, is often difficult because of sepsis or malnutrition. These patients are best managed in a tertiary institution by a multidisciplinary team in a high-dependency or intensive care environment.

Although embolisation has made a dramatic impact on the management of acute bleeding from peripancreatic pseudocysts, radiological management may only be a bridge treatment for some patients. It would be ideal to be able to distinguish a patient as being in one of three groups at the time of presentation: those that can be successfully treated with embolisation alone without the risk of delayed rebleeding, those in whom embolisation may provide only a bridge to possible further surgery, and those who will require early endoscopic or surgical intervention. A management classification of peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms is proposed, based on the following factors that are identified after appropriate imaging (Table 4; Fig. 1 A): (1) the vessel of origin, (2) the presence or absence of communication with the GIT, and (3) the presence or absence of pancreatic juice at the bleeding site. The first factor influences the selection of the initial haemostatic strategy (embolisation, stent, of surgery), while the other two factors may influence the decision for definitive endoscopic or surgical management (Fig. 1 B).

### Treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysms [^b2c63700]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Femoral pseudoaneurysms may complicate up to 8% of vascular interventional procedures. Small pseudoaneurysms can spontaneously clot, but sometimes definitive treatment is needed. Surgery has traditionally been considered the 'gold standard' treatment, although it is not without risk in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. Less invasive treatment options such as Duplex ultrasound-guided compression and percutaneous thrombin injection are available, however, evidence of their efficacy is limited. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatments for femoral pseudoaneurysms resulting from endovascular procedures, specifically assessing less invasive treatment options such as blind manual or mechanical compression, ultrasound-guided compression, or percutaneous thrombin injection.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched December 2008) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4). Additional searches were also made of the bibliographies of papers found through the electronic searches, and by handsearching relevant journals.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two treatments for femoral pseudoaneurysms following vascular interventional procedures were considered for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four studies were included in the analyses comparing: manual compression versus ultrasound-guided compression; ultrasound-guided application of a mechanical device (FemoStop) versus blind application; and ultrasound-guided compression versus percutaneous thrombin injection (two studies). There were no studies with a surgical intervention arm. Data were extracted independently by both authors.

Main Results

Compression (manual or FemoStop) was effective in achieving pseudoaneurysm thrombosis although ultrasound-guided application failed to confer any benefit (risk ratio (RR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.04). Percutaneous thrombin injection was more effective than a single session of ultrasound-guided compression in achieving primary pseudoaneurysm thrombosis within individual RCTs but merged data failed to show statistical significance (RR 2.81; 95% CI 0.44 to 18.13). There was no statistically significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups and no complications were reported apart from one deep vein thrombosis in the compression group.

Authors' Conclusions

The limited evidence base appears to support the use of thrombin injection as an effective treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysm. A pragmatic approach may be to use compression (blind or ultrasound-guided) as first-line treatment, reserving thrombin injection for those in whom the compression procedure fails.

### Visceral and peripheral arterial pseudoaneurysms [^2cffd2fe]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Pseudoaneurysms are not rare, and various conditions can cause a pseudoaneurysm in all the cardiovascular systems. In this article, we discuss and show images of pseudoaneurysms of various arteries caused by various conditions.

Conclusion

CT, MRI, sonography, and angiography may all be valuable in the imaging workup of pseudoaneurysms. Knowledge of the various appearances of pseudoaneurysms and of the proper management is essential to prevent a catastrophic outcome in cases of pseudoaneurysm.

Pseudoaneurysms are a recognized complication of arterial catheterization. Until recently, the standard method of treatment has been surgical. The past decade has seen the introduction of several minimally invasive techniques that have largely replaced surgical treatment of pseudoaneurysms. The most commonly used methods are ultrasound-guided compression and percutaneous injection of thrombin into the pseudoaneurysm. This review article describes all the methods available for the treatment of postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms, presents results from the largest published series, and discusses the relative merits of each technique.

### Imaging of vascular pseudoaneurysms in the thorax and abdomen [^92010a51]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

This review article illustrates a spectrum of arterial pseudoaneurysms that may occur in various locations throughout the thoracoabdominal region. This article discusses the common etiologies and typical clinical presentations of arterial pseudoaneurysms as well as the imaging modalities employed in their diagnosis and potential treatment options.

Objective

The goal of this review article is to familiarize radiologists with the diagnosis of thoracoabdominal arterial pseudoaneurysms, the prompt identification and treatment of which are crucial in this patient population.

Conclusion

In summary, a thorough understanding of the etiologies, imaging characteristics, and clinical implications of pseudoaneurysms can help optimize identification and management of this spectrum of disease.

### Anastomotic pseudoaneurysms… [^360cf803]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Anastomotic pseudoaneurysms continue to be a late complication of vascular grafting procedures. We reviewed the records of 48 patients who presented with 65 abdominal or lower extremity anastomotic pseudoaneurysms during 1977 to 1985. The interval between the original operation and the development of a pseudoaneurysm was
6. 2 years. Most patients underwent resection of the involved segment of graft and artery with placement of an interposition graft. Graft patency was 97. 5% during a mean follow-up of
2. 4 years, and one operative mortality occurred. Four patients had emergency procedures; one patient underwent reconstruction, and three others underwent resection of the pseudoaneurysms alone. Two of those patients died, and the one survivor eventually required a high amputation.

We recommend aggressive diagnosis and surgical reconstruction in these patients usually by interposition grafts or anastomotic revisions because the short- and long-term results are excellent. Morbidity and mortality are greatly increased when these procedures are done emergently. Dennis JW, Littooy FN, Greisler HP, Baker WH.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: a management-based classification system [^4bdf47f6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms can be further subclassified into:
type A where there is no communication with the GIT
type B where there is a communication with the GIT

In type A, bleeding tends to be low volume, often creating a haematoma within a confined space. In the retroperitoneal space, the expanding haematoma results in rising pressure, which usually compresses the bleeding site. These patients may develop acute renal failure as a result of an abdominal compartment syndrome. In type B, patients frequently have a sentinel bleed that may be followed by a catastrophic haemorrhage. Acute bleeding can be controlled by either embolisation or a stent, but these patients possibly have a higher risk of rebleeding and infection as a result of contamination from the GIT. A more definitive surgical procedure to deal with the pseudoaneurysm may need to be considered after haemodynamic stabilisation with embolisation or an endovascular stent. In patients in whom aneursymal coils and glue or an endovascular stent is exposed to a significant amount of GIT contents, the risk of infection could lead to rebleeding. This risk of rebleeding has to be balanced against the risk of surgical intervention. A long and narrow communication in an elderly patient can be observed, while a short and wide communication in young patient may need a more definitive surgical approach.

We suggest a further subclassification according to exposure to pancreatic juice:
i. type 1 is no exposure to pancreatic juice
ii. type 2 is exposure to pancreatic juice

In a type 2 pseudoaneurysm, enzymes within the pancreatic juice can chemically digest the artery wall. This may lead to further pseudoaneurysm formation or a breaking of the seal between the native arterial wall and the stent or embolisation agent. Patients with a pseudoaneurysm and pseudocyst following pancreatitis and endoscopic transgastric drainage of a pseudocyst may convert type 2 into type B. Some of these patients then can be managed conservatively while others may require more definitive surgical management in the long run. The main cause of a pseudoaneurysm following pancreatic surgery is pancreatic fistula. In some patients with an ISGPF type C pancreatic fistula and a pseudoaneurysm, completion pancreatectomy can salvage the situation. Others may have to be managed by diverting the pancreatic juice away from the pseudoaneurysmal vessel.

In summary, peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms may be classified by a combination of the above factors as summarised in Table 5.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^86880b0e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Visceral artery aneurysms — natural history, rupture risk, and general management: Splenic artery aneurysms are thought to have a particular tendency toward rupture, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy, and visceral artery pseudoaneurysms certainly have a higher rupture potential than true aneurysms. There is no firm evidence that calcification in a visceral artery aneurysm protects against a risk of rupture, and when rupture occurs it can involve the peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneal space, gastrointestinal tract, or biliary tract, with free rupture into the peritoneal cavity resulting in hemoperitoneum often termed abdominal apoplexy and it may also be manifested with life-threatening gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Although not directed by randomized prospective trials, general principles of management of visceral artery aneurysms do exist; because of their potential for rupture, most visceral artery pseudoaneurysms, mycotic aneurysms, and many larger true aneurysms warrant intervention, and treatment can generally be accomplished by either open surgical or endovascular approaches. The treatment goal is to prevent aneurysm expansion and potential rupture by exclusion from the arterial circulation while maintaining necessary distal or collateral bed perfusion; in areas of the visceral circulation with an abundance of collateral flow, for example, in the splenic artery, proximal and distal ligation of the aneurysm segment is a viable surgical option, and endovascular isolation can be achieved either by placement of a stent graft or by coil embolization of the proximal and distal arterial segment. The preferred treatment of an individual patient and aneurysm must be carefully based on the particular anatomy and any associated clinical conditions as well as the underlying condition of the patient, and the purpose of these guidelines is to inform the diagnosis, treatment options, screening, and follow-up of visceral aneurysms based on the available published literature and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

### Mycotic carotid pseudoaneurysm: staged endovascular and surgical repair [^06c41e7f]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Mycotic carotid pseudoaneurysms are rare and challenging to manage. Traditional surgical approaches are technically demanding and can be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The use of endovascular stents in infected fields remains controversial, and long-term efficacy has not been fully clarified. We describe a case where a combined staged endovascular and open surgical approach was used to successfully manage a mycotic carotid pseudoaneurysm that developed following dental extraction. A covered endovascular stent was used to temporarily exclude the infected pseudoaneurysm, before proceeding to early definitive surgical management. We suggest that staged endovascular therapy followed by early surgical repair should be considered for this difficult surgical problem.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: a management-based classification system [^4e81ba15]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

The overall reported success rates of embolisation are high, but this often includes multiple embolisations as well as prolonged supportive treatment. As a single procedure, embolisation alone has a substantial failure rate. The primary failure rate in the studies reviewed ranged from 0 to 50%, with a rebleeding rate of 0–38% (Table 2). Overall, this translates into a total failure rate of between 6 and 55%, with half of the studies (median of all studies) having a failure rate of greater than 23%. Of the combined 262 patients embolised or stented in all reviewed studies, 51 required a secondary procedure (either re-embolisation or surgery).

Although embolisation was used as first line treatment in most of the recent studies, surgery still remains an important treatment modality, especially in the setting of a haemodynamically compromised patient or when angiographic management fails. The low operation rates in some studies suggest that haemodynamically compromised patients may still be treated radiologically at first. For this to work optimally, the initial radiological intervention should be carried out in an angio-theatre suite, so if it fails, immediate surgical intervention is possible. Other indications for surgery included situations where access to the bleeding vessel was impossible radiologically and when there was failed visualisation or failed embolisation of the bleeding vessel for definitive management of the underlying cause or for other coexisting abdominal pathologies. The indications and outcomes of operative management in the studies reviewed are summarised in Table 3.

### Abdominal and pelvic aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms: imaging review with clinical, radiologic, and treatment correlation [^3a20f827]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

Abnormally enlarged visceral arteries in the abdomen and pelvis must be recognized radiologically because early treatment can improve the quality of life and prevent life-threatening complications. These lesions, typically classified as aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, are being detected more frequently with increased utilization of imaging and have various causes (eg, atherosclerosis, trauma, infection) and complications that may be identified radiologically. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging often enable detection of visceral vascular lesions, but angiography is important for further diagnosis and treatment. Endovascular treatment is often the first-line therapy. Endovascular intervention or open surgical repair is necessary for all visceral pseudoaneurysms and is likely indicated for visceral aneurysms 2 cm or more in diameter. Endovascular exclusion of flow can be achieved with coils, stents, and injectable liquids. Techniques include embolization ("sandwich" or "sac-packing" technique), exclusion of flow with luminal stents, and stent-assisted coil embolization. Management often depends on the location and technical feasibility of endovascular repair. Embolization is usually preferred for aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms within solid organs, and the sandwich technique is often used when collateral flow is present. Covered stent placement may be preferred to preserve the parent artery when main visceral vessels are being treated. It is usually tailored to lesion location, and a cure can often be effected while preserving end-organ arterial flow. Posttreatment follow-up is usually based on treatment location, modality accuracy, and potential consequences of treatment failure. Follow-up imaging may help identify vessel recanalization, unintended thrombosis of an artery or end organ, or sequelae of nontarget embolization. Retreatment is usually warranted if the clinical risks for which embolization was performed are still present.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^c1da5705]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee convened an expert writing group, tasked with writing up-to-date recommendations on the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms (VAAs) and visceral and renal artery pseudoaneurysms (VAPAs). This document is not a clinical practice guideline or a systematic review of the literature. As with all CIRSE Standards of Practice documents, this document is not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care but recommends a reasonable approach to and best practices for endovascular treatment of VAAs and VAPAs. Institutions should regularly review their internal procedures for development and improvement, taking into account international guidance, local resources and regular internal morbidity and mortality reviews.

A summary of key recommendations on the endovascular management of visceral and renal aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms can be found in Table 1.

### Successful management of a delayed-presented and complicated right ventricular pseudoaneurysm: a case report and literature review [^5ebdac9e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In these cases, therapeutic options include surgical interventions, reconstructive patch implantations, and medical treatments. These should be selected based on the severity of the symptoms and the pseudoaneurysm's anatomic features.

The clinical presentation of pseudoaneurysms can vary, ranging from asymptomatic cases to symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and arrhythmia. This variability often creates diagnostic challenges. It is crucial to differentiate these ventricular outpouchings to evaluate and treat them effectively. Accurate diagnosis, supported by advanced imaging techniques, plays a significant role in determining the optimal approach, whether surgical or conservative. RV pseudoaneurysms are extremely rare compared to left ventricular pseudoaneurysms. Throughout the cardiac cycle, pseudoaneurysms expand outward in response to increased ventricular pressure. Due to their lack of myocardial tissue, they are very prone to potentially catastrophic rupture, underscoring the critical need for prompt identification and surgical intervention. Therefore, rapid and precise diagnosis is essential for effectively managing these intricate cardiac conditions. However, as seen in this study, the presentation with RV failure symptoms can suggest pseudoaneurysms. This is concluded by Yeo et al. who confirmed that 48% of these lesions are discovered incidentally without any obvious clinical presentation.

Considering the management of RV pseudoaneurysm, there is no consensus, and guidelines have not mentioned the definite therapeutic approach. However, considering the lack of a myocardial layer and the risk of rupture, which can result in lethal complications, aggressive treatment might be necessary. The treatment's main aim is to reduce cardiac rupture incidence. The LV pseudoaneurysm treatment is surgical repair. However, since no trial has been done on RV pseudoaneurysm due to its paucity, the definite treatment is unknown. The percutaneous treatment of the LV pseudoaneurysm has been introduced before. The RV pseudoaneurysm treatment via percutaneous interventions was done successfully, and now it is one of the options that is considered when sufficient logistics and expertise are available. In conclusion, this anatomical abnormality should be treated based on the circumstances of outpouching, patient, available options, and overall judgment of the medical team regarding the risk of rupture.

### Systematic review of the evaluation and management of coronary pseudoaneurysm after stent implantation [^c2188deb]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Pseudoaneurysm (PSA) formation is a rare but well-known complication of coronary stenting. It develops after a procedural perforation disrupts the integrity of the vessel wall but is contained by a single wall layer, usually pericardium, extravascular thrombosis and later fibrosis. Medical literature of PSA consists primarily of case reports. A systematic review of pseudoaneurysm after coronary stenting was performed to summarize its presentation, diagnostic imaging modalities, natural history, and management approaches. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic to hemodynamic collapse, size from small to "giant", and treatment approaches from surgical or percutaneous exclusion to "watchful waiting" and imaging surveillance. Based on current information, a management algorithm is provided recommending urgent to emergent exclusion for symptomatic PSA, elective exclusion for large and giant PSA, and "watchful waiting" and periodic imaging surveillance for small to moderate sized PSA.

### Aortic pseudoaneurysm after type A aortic dissection: results of conservative management [^3d76bc2e]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Aortic pseudoaneurysms after acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) repair have been reported as high as 10–24% and surgical treatment is usually recommended. The objective of this article is to examine the safety and efficacy of a conservative approach to aortic pseudoaneurysm and to compare this approach to standard surgical treatment. We retrospectively examined 39 patients who had an aortic pseudoaneurysm after ATAAD surgery in order to examine outcomes (baseline characteristics, presentation and freedom from aortic events and mortality). We initially identified 31 patients treated conservatively (CT). After close follow up, 5 of them were operated so 13 patients were treated surgically (ST) and analyzed at a long-term follow-up while 26 were in the conservative group. Mean follow- - up of the whole cohort was 7.9 ± 5.9 years. The freedom from aortic-related mortality at 1, 5, and 10 years was 100%, 83.3% and 72.9% for the ST group and 95.8%, 77.3%, and 77.3% for the CT group (P = 0.35). A conservative approach to aortic pseudoaneurysms could be justified in asymptomatic patients. A close follow-up by a dedicated aortic clinic is mandatory so that patients are referred for surgery when necessary.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^26ee4e1b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Arteriovenous (AV) access aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm — monitoring and documentation: All dialysis providers should be able to assess, recognize, and diagnose aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm formation in an AV access, and the size of the aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm should be measured at minimum in 2 dimensions, preferably with ultrasound imaging and documented in the medical records at least every quarter along with the overlying skin changes; this frequency was established by consensus of the Work Group given that there are no published recommendations for surveillance or serial imaging, although the AV access should be examined at each dialysis session per routine. Close monitoring of an enlarging aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm or those that show signs or symptoms of concern with low threshold for surgical intervention should be the guiding principle, and patients should also be instructed on the appropriate assessment and monitoring of their AV access and provided instructions for emergency care and appropriate contacts for definitive treatment.

### Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is the treatment of choice for femoral pseudoaneurysms… [^368a86b3]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Hypothesis Ultrasound-guided injection of thrombin is the treatment of choice for femoral pseudoaneurysms. Design A prospective study of patients undergoing a single form of treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysms. Setting Patients were treated at 2 tertiary care, university-affiliated hospitals. Patients Forty consecutive patients with femoral pseudoaneurysms resulting from diagnostic and therapeutic catheterizations for peripheral arterial, coronary arterial, and cerebrovascular diseases were evaluated. Intervention Thrombin was injected directly into the pseudoaneurysms under ultrasonographic guidance. Main Outcome Measure Thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm following thrombin injection was the goal of treatment. Results All 40 patients had initial complete thrombosis of their femoral pseudoaneurysms. In each case, except for one, the aneurysm was noted to have thrombosed on follow-up duplex ultrasongram. There was one complication.

Conclusion Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is the treatment of choice for femoral pseudoaneurysms. The injection was performed by a vascular surgeon. Once the needle tip was seen within the false aneurysm, a 1-mL syringe was used to inject one half to 1 mL of a 1000-U/mL solution of bovine thrombin in all cases. Most patients required only 0. 5 mL of thrombin to accomplish pseudoaneurysmal thrombosis. One patient required a second injection. In their entire case series, there was only 1 failure and 1 complication. One patient had a brachial artery thrombosis that resolved spontaneously. Twenty-nine of the false aneurysms in this case series were injected while the patient was receiving anticoagulant therapy, with excellent results. Lennox et al10 had success in all 18 of their patients undergoing thrombin injection while receiving anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulation is not a contraindication to this technique.

Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection of femoral pseudoaneurysms is safe, quick, painless, and effective. It is superior to compression therapy and surgery. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection should be the initial treatment of femoral pseudoaneurysms. Additional studies are needed before it can be recommended as the treatment of choice for pseudoaneurysms in other anatomical locations.

### Thirty-three-year follow-up of pseudoaneurysm of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa without surgical treatment: a case report and literature review [^df0e2767]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudoaneurysm of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa (PMAIF) is a rare complication of infective endocarditis or aortic valve surgery. Surgical treatment is suggested, but the long-term follow-up of conservative management remains unclear.

Case presentation

A 33-year follow-up of a patient who developed PMAIF six years after aortic valve replacement is reported. The patient presented to our center with dyspnea, and the echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 20% and a PMAIF measuring 7 × 10 mm. Despite being advised to undergo surgery, the patient declined due to fear of surgical outcomes. Consequently, conservative treatment with close observation but without surgery was initiated. During the 33-year follow-up period, the patient did not experience any adverse health effects.

Conclusion

Surgical intervention should be considered whenever the PMAIF is diagnosed. However, in any case that the surgery was not applicable, conservative management might lead to long-term survival, based on this and similar case reports in the literature.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: a management-based classification system [^f5be6dd5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

In the pancreatitis studies, outcomes for surgical and nonsurgical intervention were similar except in the earlier studies. Specifically, the study by De Perrot et al. published in 1999, stood out in that it demonstrated a high mortality rate in patients who were embolised (33%) compared with a zero mortality rate for the surgical patients. This may reflect relative inexperience with embolisation techniques at a time when surgical therapy was the standard approach.

Obviously, patient selection and timing play important roles in determining the morbidity and mortality of either procedure. Bergert et al. demonstrated this by dividing their patients into those requiring urgent and those requiring semiurgent intervention. Three of nine (33%) urgent surgical patients died compared with only one of ten (10%) semiurgent patients. Herein lies the difficulty in comparing outcomes of surgical and embolisation groups in these case series where the indications and underlying pathologies for embolisation and surgery may be different. This makes statistical comparisons between the outcomes of these two modalities difficult and probably unnecessary. Nonetheless, some authors have attempted statistical analyses. For example, Udd et al. in a series of 33 pseudoaneurysmal bleeds from chronic pancreatitis, found no difference in morbidity and mortality between the embolisation and surgical groups. Similarly, Roulin et al. performed a meta-analysis comparing laparotomy and interventional radiology for delayed postoperative haemorrhage following pancreatic surgery and, not surprisingly, found a higher mortality rate in the surgical group.

Guideline 17: AV access aneurysms — indications and urgency specify that "All symptomatic AV access aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms should be evaluated and managed" and patients with threatened skin or ulceration "should be treated urgently or emergently to prevent significant hemorrhage". Aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm-related access dysfunction "require treatment to maintain AV access to provide effective dialysis", patients with "high-output heart failure merit treatment", and "Patients with pain and/or unacceptable cosmetic disfigurement due to their aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm need an individualized treatment plan that considers the risks associated with potential loss of their AV access". However, aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm "size alone is likely not an indication for treatment in the absence of symptoms or threatened skin", although "rapidly enlarging AV access aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms merit closer follow-up and a lower threshold for intervention". Large asymptomatic AVG pseudoaneurysms may need "careful monitoring and active treatment"; "12-mm AVG pseudoaneurysms be repaired because they exceed the typical 6-mm graft diameter 2-fold". "All anastomotic aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms require evaluation and active consideration for repair" and "Finally, all infected AV access aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms merit treatment (Guideline 16)".

### Nonoperative management of traumatic aortic pseudoaneurysms [^d8803920]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Current blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) guidelines recommend early repair of traumatic pseudoaneurysms (PSAs) due to risk for subsequent aortic rupture. Recent analyses indicate that early repair is required only in the setting of high-risk features, while delayed repair is safe and associated with lower morbidity and mortality in appropriately selected patients. To evaluate the appropriate indications for nonoperative management (NOM) of traumatic PSAs, we performed a systematic review of studies reporting outcomes for this management strategy. We hypothesized that NOM is safe in appropriately selected patients with traumatic aortic PSAs.

Methods

English language single- and multi-institutional series reporting NOM of traumatic thoracic aortic PSAs were identified by systematic literature search and review. A descriptive analysis was performed of NOM, with stratification by lesion size and patient follow-up. The primary outcomes were late aortic intervention, aortic-related death, and all-cause mortality.

Results

Eighteen studies, which included 937 patients with traumatic PSAs, were analyzed. One hundred ninety-one patients were managed nonoperatively. The primary indication for NOM was prohibitive risk for aortic repair due to severe comorbidities or concurrent injuries. Where reported, PSAs with < 50% circumferential involvement accounted for 88% of lesions selected for NOM. Late interventions were required in 4% of patients. Inpatient aortic-related mortality was 2%, and all-cause inpatient mortality was 32%. Although survival at up to 4–7 years was reported, postdischarge follow-up after PSA NOM was limited to < 1 year in most studies.

Conclusions

NOM of traumatic aortic PSAs is a common practice in BTAI series reporting lesion-specific management, and is associated with low rates of treatment failure. These findings suggest that routine early repair may not be required for traumatic PSAs, particularly for lesions limited to < 50% of the aortic circumference. Definitive repair can be delayed until patient stability and repair timing can be guided by assessment of lesion stability on follow-up imaging.

### Analysis of outcomes of endovascular embolisation: a cross-sectional two-center study on 46 visceral artery pseudoaneurysms [^f6c18597]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

In general, asymptomatic true visceral artery aneurysms that are less than 2 cm can be followed up without further management (Jesinger et al; Madhusudhan et al.). On the other hand, pseudoaneurysms must be managed regardless their presentation, size and location owing to their high possibility of rupture (Madhusudhan et al.).

Endovascular management of VAPAs has been widely used as a safe and effective alternative treatment to the more invasive surgical procedures with higher mortality rate reaching 5% and mortality increases substantially if emergency surgery is required for aneurysm rupture repair (Loffroy; Cappucci et al; Venturini et al; Martinelli et al.). Endovascular treatment options include techniques for parent artery preservation: sac packing with embolic materials e.g. (coils, or glue e.g. onyx and N-butylcyanoacrylate), stent graft exclusion, balloon remodeling or stent-assisted coiling and parent artery sacrifice techniques: trapping or inflow occlusion (Madhusudhan et al.). The current study was designed to review the outcome of different embolic materials and techniques used in the endovascular management of visceral artery pseudoaneurysms. True visceral artery aneurysms are uncovered in this article.

Previous studies examining the natural history of femoral pseudoaneurysms (PSAs) were performed before the current era of anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy. The purpose of our study was to elucidate in a vascular surgeon directed approach to PSAs, the association between medication use and the failure of conservative, observation-only management.

Methods

We retrospectively examined 308 femoral iatrogenic PSAs diagnosed via duplex imaging at our institution during a 10-year time period (2004–2013). Information on PSA characteristics, treatment, and antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medication usage was obtained. We identified patients who failed observation-only conservation management, with failure defined as the need for delayed treatment because of PSAs triggered by either expansion (≥ 1 cm increase or size enlarging to ≥ 3 cm) and/or persistence (≥ 15 days).

Results

Immediate and/or acute treatments of PSAs included 1 ultrasound-guided compression, 14 surgical repairs, and 126 thrombin injections. Of the 167 PSAs initially managed by observation only, 70 (42%) were found by ultrasound imaging to thrombosis spontaneously. An additional 70 (42%) patients had the diagnosis of PSA < 3 cm and were managed conservatively with only clinical follow-up. Twenty-seven PSAs (16%) originally managed conservatively required additional treatment because of expansion and/or persistence. Patients receiving dual-antiplatelet therapy had higher rates of failed conservative management (44%) than patients not on dual therapy (9%, P < 0.01). The number of antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medications used during observation was larger in patients failing conservative management (2.0 ± 0.7) versus patients not requiring additional intervention (1.5 ± 0.7, P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Most of the PSAs initially managed with observation-only did not require additional intervention. However, anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet agents use associated with PSAs required further intervention after failing observation-only management. When observation is the chosen strategy for PSA management, especially in the setting of aggressive antithrombotic and dual-antiplatelet therapy, surveillance is required to ensure proper resolution.

### Multimodality imaging of diseases of the thoracic aorta in adults: from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging: endorsed by the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^84b9b5ba]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Complications after aortic repair — surveillance priorities and pseudoaneurysm: Total removal of diseased aorta is seldom possible and anastomoses are potential sites for late complications; therefore, periodic postoperative surveillance by cardiovascular imaging specialists who are familiar with aortic diseases and surgical procedures cannot be overemphasized, and early detection can facilitate optimal management, including reoperation when appropriate. Potential postoperative complications include anastomotic leakage, disruption, dehiscence; pseudoaneurysm (at proximal, distal, or coronary anastomotic site); progressive AR; involvement of aortic branches; perigraft infection; compression of graft by hematoma (inclusion technique); aneurysmal dilatation of false lumen (status post dissection repair); compression or collapse of true lumen (by expanding false lumen); frank rupture; anastomotic stenosis; development of recurrent dissection or aneurysm proximal to a graft in patients in whom a supracoronary procedure has been performed; aortoesophageal or aortopulmonary fistula; and graft herniation into thoracotomy defect. Pseudoaneurysm is an important early or late complication that can occur after surgery for aneurysm dissection and in the vast majority of patients is not associated with any clinical symptoms, emphasizing the need for surveillance imaging; pseudoaneurysms usually occur at anastomoses and more often originate from partial dehiscence of proximal or distal suture lines or at the site of coronary reimplantation. Management depends on size, change over time, and clinical status; small, sterile pseudoaneurysms can remain stable for years without intervention; they are readily detectable by both CT and MRI, while transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is reliable for the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta but can miss distal ascending lesions because of the interposition of the trachea.

### Endovascular repair of an asymptomatic aortic pseudoaneurysm after penetrating injury [^96df968e]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Penetrating injuries to the aorta usually result in immediate life-threatening hemorrhage. Because these lesions are typically either fatal or identified and controlled surgically, chronic pseudoaneurysms after penetrating aortic trauma are rare. Most of these patients present with rupture or local complications, and management before the endovascular era has historically been open repair. As such, there are limited data to guide the modern management of an asymptomatic, posttraumatic aortic pseudoaneurysm. Here, we describe a 54-year-old man who was diagnosed with an incidental, supraceliac aortic pseudoaneurysm 14 years after an abdominal stab wound. He underwent successful and uncomplicated endovascular repair.

### Evaluating the safety and efficacy of medical management in extracranial pseudoaneurysms: a comparative study [^af8c839e]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

As endovascular interventions become safer and their use more prevalent for treating extracranial pseudoaneurysms, fewer pseudoaneurysms are treated with medical therapy alone. This study aimed to assess the indications for intervention and the safety of medical management.

Methods

A dual-center retrospective analysis was conducted on patients diagnosed with extracranial carotid and vertebral pseudoaneurysms between December 2006 and June 2023.

Results

Of 145 pseudoaneurysms, 121 (83%) received medical therapy, 22 (15%) were treated endovascularly, and 2 (1.4%) were treated with open surgery. In the medical group, there were 2 (1.9%) complications, one unrelated to the pseudoaneurysm. In the intervention group, there were 3 (16%) complications, with 1 patient requiring two retreatments and sacrifice of the vessel. Major trauma (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.3–14; p = 0.02), use of digital subtraction angiography as the initial imaging modality (OR 9.8, 95% CI 2.5–42; p < 0.01), and a maximum lesion diameter > 6 mm (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.4–25; p = 0.03) proved to be significant in the decision to intervene. At a median follow-up of 18.1 months, 94.7% of the lesions treated with intervention healed completely compared with 19% of aneurysms in the medical group. Among those medically managed that did not resolve, the median change in diameter was -0.4 mm (IQR -1.8 to 0.4 mm). Age ≤ 50 years and aneurysm maximum diameter ≤ 6 mm predicted healing at follow-up in the medical group with 92% specificity and 65% sensitivity (area under the curve 0.87). At follow-up, 98% of patients were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2).

Conclusions

Medical management alone is safe for most extracranial pseudoaneurysms, resulting in significantly fewer complications than endovascular intervention. Maximum diameter ≤ 6 mm and age ≤ 50 years were significant predictors of pseudoaneurysm resolution with medical therapy alone. Lesions that do not heal do not cause further symptoms or require additional intervention.

Management and outcome

Table 2 summarizes the evaluation results and outcomes for the 9 patients with bleeding pseudoaneurysms. Seven patients initially underwent surgery for bleeding pseudoaneurysms; 2 of these received operations without a preoperative diagnosis of a bleeding pseudoaneurysm. Embolization was performed as the initial treatment in 2 patients who experienced rebleeding 1 month and 5 months later, respectively. Rebleeding control was successful in 1 patient treated by re-embolization (case 4) and 1 patient treated surgically (case 3).

Two patients developed recurrent pseudocysts after surgery; 1 (case 7) underwent gastrocystostomy for persistent abdominal pain; the other (case 8) received revision for a drainage tube due to occlusion detected by a radiologist. No recurrent bleeding or pseudocysts were observed in these 2 patients. Two patients developed pseudocysts following embolization (case 3) and surgery (case 6) at 1 month and 6 weeks, respectively; both rebled and were treated successfully with surgery after embolization failure. Overall, bleeding pseudoaneurysms were treated with 5 arterial embolizations and 9 operations and success rates were 20% (1/5) and 88.9% (8/9), respectively. One patient (case 3) died from sepsis following treatment for an angiographic complication (bleeding of the right external iliac and femoral arteries). No surgery-related mortality existed. Figure 2 shows a flow chart of management and outcomes in relation to bleeding pseudoaneurysms treatment.

### Iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm: a rare complication of sinonasal surgery [^b7613675]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We report 2 patients with iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms, which developed following sinus surgery.

Method

Case reports and a review of literature of the management of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm.

Results

For one patient who presented with massive epistaxis, the only lifesaving option available was to perform an urgent angiogram followed by selective embolization of the feeding vessel. In the second patient who presented with persistent nasal obstruction and discharge and no epistaxis, a traumatic aneurysm of the internal carotid artery was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging scan that was later confirmed by angiography; he, however, declined further treatment.

Conclusion

Iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms that develop following a vascular injury, though rare, can cause life-threatening epistaxis or a thromboembolism. In this report, we describe 2 different manifestations of iatrogenic vascular malformations following sinus surgery. The role of angiography and subsequent endovascular therapy in the management of these lesions is emphasized.

### Endovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysms [^dd7fbe17]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudoaneurysms (PA) are contained disruptions of the vascular wall leading to turbulent blood flow and hematoma formation (Keeling et al.). Unlike true aneurysms, PAs are contained by only one or two of the three normal arterial wall layers, typically the adventitia alone (Hemp and Sabri). Arterial damage leading to the formation of PAs may be caused by trauma, inflammation, infection, or iatrogenic sources (Keeling et al; Hemp and Sabri; McDermott et al.). PAs secondary to trauma may be related to either blunt or penetrating arterial trauma. While many PAs may be asymptomatic, they can present with swelling, pain, or mass effect (Saad et al.). Due to the weakened arterial walls, PAs have a high risk of growth and rupture, leading to life-threatening hemorrhage and mortality, requiring urgent treatment.

### Femoral pseudoaneurysms after percutaneous access [^ef4555eb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The femoral artery has been the primary percutaneous-based arterial access site for coronary artery catheterizations for more than three decades. Noncardiac percutaneous-based procedures have also been performed primarily with femoral access and have increased in number exponentially by vascular specialists in past decades. Groin complications are infrequent in incidence after femoral arterial access for cardiac and peripheral diagnostic and interventional cases, with groin hematomas and pseudoaneurysms being the most common. Until ultrasound-based treatment modalities became the mainstay of treatment, vascular surgeons were the primary specialty managing pseudoaneurysms, but now other specialties also manage these cases. This review outlines the clinical implications and current issues relevant to understanding the ideal treatment strategy for this common complication.

### Is open repair still the gold standard in visceral artery aneurysm management? [^94af4e7f]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Visceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms represent a rare disease with high mortality. The aim of this study was to report a single center experience of open repair (OR) and endovascular treatment (ET) of 94 patients, and to analyze short- and midterm results.

Methods

Between 1988 and 2010, 94 patients, 43 men and 51 women, mean age of 57.6 years (range, 23–87 years), were referred to our Institute with a diagnosis of visceral artery aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. Arteries involved were splenic artery in 44 cases, hepatic artery in 17, renal artery in 18, superior mesenteric artery in six, celiac trunk in three, gastroduodenal in two, and pancreaticoduodenal in four. An abdominal aortic aneurysm coexisted in three (3%) cases, whereas in six (6%) cases, there were multiple visceral aneurysms. ET was indicated based on the anatomical location of the aneurysm or for patients at high risk for surgery.

Results

A total of 74 patients underwent OR, whereas ET was performed in 20 patients. Technical success was achieved in all cases treated by open surgery. Splenectomy was performed in 11 cases, and in six, splenic autotransplantation was performed. At 6 months of follow-up, a Tc99m-labeled red cell scintigraphy showed that autotransplants were viable in four patients (67%). No cases of pancreatitis or splenic infarction were observed. Among renal artery aneurysms, nephrectomy was necessary in one case of renal infarction for massive thrombosis of the ex-vivo reconstructed renal artery. Four surgical conversions were recorded (one thrombosis of the hepatic artery, one massive hemorrhage after embolization of superior mesenteric artery aneurysm, and two cases of sac enlargement after 24 and 48 months). An endoleak was present in a patient treated for a splenic artery aneurysm, but it resolved spontaneously after 6 months. No complications were observed in patients undergoing surgical conversion after ET. Perioperative mortality in the surgical group was 1.3% (1/74). There was no perioperative mortality in the endovascular group. No statistically significant difference was found between groups in terms of perioperative mortality (p = 1.00). Perioperative morbidity was 9.4% (7/74) in the surgical group, and 10% (2/20) in the endovascular group (p = 1.00). Follow-up was available for 16 patients in the endovascular group (80%) and 63 in the surgical group (85%), with a mean duration of 42 months (1–192 months). In the whole cohort, actuarial survival at 10 years was 68%. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 1 and 5 years were 100% and 85%, respectively, for OR, and 100% and 40%, respectively, for ET, with no significant difference between the two groups

Conclusion

ET is safe and feasible in selected patients, but incomplete exclusion may be observed, requiring late surgical conversion in a significant number of patients. Long-term results (high survival, low complication rate) confirm the durability of the surgical approach that in our experience remains the gold standard with satisfactory results, especially for aneurysms involving the visceral hilum.

### Endovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysms [^0b9072e1]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudoaneurysms (PAs) caused by traumatic injury to the arterial vasculature have a high risk of rupture, leading to life-threatening hemorrhage and mortality, requiring urgent treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine the technical and clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment of visceral and extremity traumatic pseudoaneurysms.

Methods

Clinical data were retrospectively collected from all patients presenting for endovascular treatment of PAs between September 2012 and September 2018 at a single academic level one trauma center. Technical success was defined as successful treatment of the PA with no residual filling on post-embolization angiogram. Clinical success was defined as technical successful treatment with no rebleeding throughout the follow-up period and no reintervention for the PA.

Results

Thirty-five patients (10F/25M), average age (± stdev) 41.7 ± 20.1 years, presented with PAs secondary to blunt (n = 31) or penetrating (n = 4) trauma. Time from trauma to intervention ranged from 2 h - 75 days (median: 4.4 h, IQR: 3.5–17.1 h) with 27 (77%) of PAs identified and treated within 24 h of trauma. Average hospitalization was 13.78 ± 13.4 days. Ten patients underwent surgery prior to intervention. PA number per patient ranged from 1 to 5 (multiple diffuse). PAs were located on the splenic (n = 12, 34.3%), pelvic (n = 11, 31.4%), hepatic (n = 9, 25.7%), upper extremity/axilla (n = 2, 5.7%), and renal arteries (n = 1, 2.9%). Technical success was 85.7%. Clinical success was 71.4%, for technical failure (n = 5), repeat embolization (n = 1) or post-IR surgical intervention (n = 4). There was no PA rebleeding or reintervention for any patient after discharge over the reported follow-up periods. Three patients died during the trauma hospitalization for reasons unrelated to the PAs.

Conclusions

Endovascular treatment of traumatic visceral and extremity PAs is efficacious with minimal complication rates and low reintervention requirements.

### Open versus endovascular treatment of visceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^20bb8691]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Visceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms (VAAP) represent a rare and potential life-threatening disease with a documented incidence of 0.1–2.0%. Treatment options for VAAP vary from open approach with aneurysm excision, exclusion and revascularization to endovascular techniques. Aneurysm anatomy and pathogenesis dictate treatment choice. The purpose of this study was to compare the perioperative, short- and mid-term outcomes of open and endovascular approaches.

Methods

Between January 2007 to April 2015, patients with VAAP who underwent surgical treatment, either by endovascular technique (endovascular surgery [EV] group) or by open surgery (OS group), were selected for analysis. Aneurysm's anatomy and pathogenesis dictated treatment choice. Demographic variables, surgical data, and postoperative follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative computed tomography scans were evaluated for aneurysm characteristics.

Results

A total of 296 consecutive patients were identified with VAAP. Surveillance without intervention occurred in 183 patients, and 113 underwent surgical treatment: 57 by EV technique and 56 by OS. The VAAP sites were: splenic (50.9/5.4%), renal (7.0/50%), superior mesenteric (7.0/7.1%), celiac (12.3/17.9%), hepatic (14.0/5.4%), gastroduodenal (7.0/7.1%), and pancreaticoduodenal (1.8/7.1%). Eight urgent surgeries occurred in EV and 5 in OS group (P = 0.39). Operative time and estimated blood loss were 122 ± 54 vs. 312 ± 157 min (P < 0.001) and 5 (interquartile range [IR], 0–50) vs. 550 (IR, 200–980) mL (P < 0.001) in groups EV and OS, respectively. The intraoperative and postoperative major complications, including end-organ infarction, and reinterventions were comparable between the groups. Transfusion of blood products was necessary in 12.3% (EV) and 42.9% (OS; P < 0.001). Median hospital length of stay was 1 (IR, 1–3) and 6 (IR, 4–9) days in groups EV and OS, respectively (P < 0.001). Short-term technical success was achieved in 98.2% (EV) and 96.4% (OS). During the median follow-up period of 16 (IR, 7.1–43.9) months, the clinical success was 91.2% and 92.9% (P = 0.74), and the overall survival was 94.7% and 96.4% (P = 1.0) in groups EV and OS, respectively.

Conclusions

Open and endovascular approaches have similar rates of technical and clinical success, as well as mortality during follow-up. However, periprocedural morbidity was significantly higher in cases treated by OS. Although longer-term follow-up is needed to access the durability of the endovascular treatment, initial successful outcomes and low reintervention rates make it a safe and feasible approach.

The common femoral artery is commonly used as arterial access for a wide range of radiological and cardiological procedures. Pseudoaneurysm formation is the most common arterial complication of femoral artery catheterization, and is diagnosed using colour Doppler ultrasound. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection has replaced ultrasound-guided compression as the first-line treatment. The practicalities of thrombin injection (technique and types of thrombin available) and other treatment options are discussed. Awareness of pseudoaneurysm formation and the treatment options allows prompt diagnosis and successful treatment.

### Endovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysms [^923385c3]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

This study was limited by retrospectively collected data with a small number of available patients. Follow-up data was therefore limited to available recorded information. Trauma patients are typically transported to the nearest hospital after an event and in many cases choose to follow-up with other physicians or health care institutions, limiting availability of information. For the purpose of ensuring a traumatic etiology, PAs treated more than 3 months post trauma were excluded, however, this approach may have conservatively eliminated PAs with further delayed presentations. Additionally, seven patients in this study underwent surgical intervention near the subsequently treated PA site, prior to IR PA embolization. Three of these cases were performed over a day apart, potentially confounding the etiology of true traumatic PAs with potentially iatrogenic PAs. Finally, as mentioned previously, the trauma patient cohort typically has significant injuries relating to the overall trauma, which may confound the clinical outcomes relating to PA treatment in isolation. Further randomized controlled data of endovascular management of traumatic PAs will be crucial in better understanding the clinical course of traumatic PAs.

### Pseudoaneurysm in children: diagnosis and interventional management [^3511531e]. Pediatric Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms (PAn) are uncommon in adults and even less common in children. They are most often encountered after iatrogenic arterial injury. Presentation may be substantially delayed after the iatrogenic event, and diagnosis can be difficult, especially when the PAn occurs in an unexpected location. Treatment of PAn has evolved during the last two decades from a reliance on surgical resection to US-guided compression, coil embolization, covered stents, and stent-graft exclusion. More recently, direct percutaneous US-guided thrombin injection has been used in the treatment of PAn. We present three cases of successful PAn thrombosis by US-guided percutaneous thrombin injection in children, one of the epigastric artery and two of the femoral artery.

### Ruptured femoral pseudoaneurysm presenting as a lateral abdominal wall hematoma [^ad405db9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Lateral abdominal wall hematomas are rare. We describe a patient with a delayed rupture of a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, who presented with such a hematoma. In contrast to other types of abdominal wall hematomas, which are often managed conservatively, a ruptured femoral artery pseudoaneurysm frequently requires emergent surgical intervention. Rupture of a pseudoaneurysm can be catastrophic. Due to the rising incidence of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms and shorter hospital stays, it is useful for the emergency physician to be familiar with the diagnosis and management of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms and their potentially life-threatening complications.

### Interventional treatment of peripancreatic aneurysms: can one strategy fit all? [^4500fd01]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

To address the issues not covered in current recommendations on PPA management, we developed a tailored algorithm for PPA treatment. This algorithm is based on the various treatment strategies performed on the current PPA collective, taking into account the unique clinical presentations and challenges observed in these cases.

The initial step in the algorithm is to determine whether the aneurysm is located in a critical or non-critical position.

Percutaneous embolization is the therapy of choice for PPAs situated in non-critical positions.

For PPAs in critical positions, therapy considerations become more complex, requiring the evaluation of three distinct scenarios:
In the life-threatening situation of an actively bleeding aneurysm, immediate intervention is essential. The initial goal is to embolize the aneurysm while preserving the feeding vessel whenever possible. Due to the urgency, this approach is often not feasible. In such cases, primary embolization of the PPA is the preferred approach, followed by secondary recanalization of any associated VA stenosis. Pseudoaneurysms, regardless of their size and position, also require urgent treatment.
The second scenario involves true aneurysms exceeding an AVR greater than 3, indicating a substantially increased risk of rupture. Accordingly, the recommended treatment approach parallels that of pseudoaneurysms. Unlike emergent cases, these interventions can be scheduled electively, allowing for thorough preprocedural planning and patient optimization. Prior to addressing the aneurysm, recanalization of the VA stenosis should be performed to mitigate the risk of transient visceral ischemia during the procedure.
The third scenario involves true aneurysms with an AVR < 3. In this case, a watch-and-wait strategy can be considered with regard to the PPA, while VA revascularization should be considered to potentially mitigate aneurysmal growth. The revascularization can be performed via an endovascular or open approach, depending on the underlying lesion. Monitoring of the PPA allows for differentiation of growing and stable subtypes. A CT check should be done every 6 months within the first year and every 12 months thereafter. Growing subtypes should then be treated, when the AVR exceeds 3.

Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) observation criteria and cohort outcomes — nonoperative management can be appropriate in selected cases: General guidelines state that true SAAs < 3 cm, asymptomatic, and showing little or no growth can be safely observed and monitored with serial imaging studies, whereas splenic artery pseudoaneurysms and SAAs in women who are either pregnant or of childbearing age should be treated regardless of size. In a Mayo Clinic review of 217 patients, 168 underwent nonoperative management for a mean period of 75 months, with mean aneurysm size 2.1 cm (range 0.8 to 5 cm); approximately half had serial imaging, only 10% showed growth averaging 0.06 cm/y, no rupture or other complications occurred, and only 3 of the original 168 required eventual intervention because of aneurysm growth. A Cleveland Clinic series of 128 SAAs managed over a 15-year period reported an observational cohort of 66 SAAs with mean size 1.7 cm (range 0.4 to 4.2 cm); serial imaging was available for 94%, patients had an average of 2.5 CT scans during 4.6 years of follow-up, the average growth rate was a nominal 0.2 mm/y, and there were again no ruptures or other complications in the observed group.

Celiac artery aneurysm (CAA) rupture risk and pseudoaneurysm differences — Reported mortality after ruptured CAA approaches 100%. The overall reported risk for rupture appears to range from 10% to 20%, and rupture has been reported to occur in approximately 5% of celiac trunk aneurysms ranging from 15 to 22 mm in diameter and in 50% to 70% of those that exceed 32 mm in diameter. In a review of 233 patients with 253 visceral artery aneurysms, the rate of rupture at presentation was significantly higher in visceral pseudoaneurysms than in true aneurysms (76.3% vs 3.1%), with 55 ruptures. In one series with 48 visceral aneurysms, 80% of 28 pseudoaneurysms were symptomatic at presentation versus 30% of 20 true aneurysms. In another series of 155 patients with visceral aneurysms, there was no significant difference of the diameters between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (36.9 vs 33.6 mm), and most of the ruptures were in pseudoaneurysms (80%).

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^7a59cfb3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Rationale/Background — Incidence and management considerations for AV access aneurysms: The reported incidence has ranged from 5% to 60% in clinical series, and one report noted an incidence of 0.04 per 1,000 patient days. Aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms can lead to skin erosion with hemorrhage, access dysfunction, pain, and cannulation difficulties, and symptomatic lesions with skin erosion/ulceration and hemorrhage that represent a risk for a future life-threatening surgical emergency merit immediate assessment and appropriate treatment. The size of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) aneurysm alone is not an indication for surgical treatment, the optimal approach is individualized within local expertise, and a covered intraluminal stent may be a helpful temporizing measure in urgent or emergent settings although it is not recommended for routine anatomic indications.

### Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the liver and spleen in children: is routine screening warranted? [^0e31063a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although blunt injury to the spleen and liver can lead to pseudoaneurysm formation, current surgical guidelines do not recommend follow-up imaging. Controversy exists regarding the clinical implications of these traumatic pseudoaneurysms as well as their management.

Methods

Retrospective review of children treated nonoperatively for isolated blunt liver and spleen trauma between 1991 and 2008 was undertaken. Patient demographics, grade of injury, and follow-up Doppler ultrasound results were obtained.

Results

Three hundred sixty-two children were identified. One hundred eighty-six of them had splenic injuries, and 10 (5.4%) developed pseudoaneurysms. They were associated with grade III (3/39 [8%]) and grade IV (7/41 [17%]) injuries. In 7 patients, the pseudoaneurysm thrombosed spontaneously. Angiographic embolization was required in 2 children, and one underwent emergency splenectomy for delayed hemorrhage. Of the 176 patients who had liver injuries, 3 (1.7%) developed pseudoaneurysms. All 3 were associated with grade IV injuries (3/11 [27%]). One child underwent early embolization, while 2 developed delayed hemorrhage requiring emergent treatment.

Conclusions

Pseudoaneurysm development after blunt abdominal trauma is associated with high-grade splenic and liver injuries. Routine screening of this group of patients before discharge from hospital may be warranted because of the potential risk of life-threatening hemorrhage.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^8a634042]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms is an effective, minimally invasive treatment that has been successfully used since the early 1990s, with refined and expanded techniques and tools currently offering excellent outcomes. Due to increased detection of such lesions in recent years, many of which are asymptomatic, revision of the indications for intervention and the correct endovascular treatment approaches has become essential.

Purpose

This document will presume that the indication for treatment is clear and approved by the multidisciplinary team and will define the standards required for the performance of each intervention, as well as their relative advantages and limitations. CIRSE Standards of Practice documents are not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care, but recommend a reasonable approach to, and best practices for, the performance of the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms.

Methods

The writing group was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognised expertise in endovascular treatments. The writing group reviewed the existing literature on visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, performing an evidence search using PubMed to identify publications in English and relating to human subjects from 1990 to 2022. The final recommendations were formulated through consensus.

Results

Endovascular treatment has an established role in the successful management of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, and this Standards of Practice document provides up-to-date recommendations for its safe performance.

### EUS-guided pseudoaneurysm embolization [^290b4844]. VideoGIE (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pseudoaneurysm (PA) formation is a rare but life-threatening adverse event of pancreatitis. Ruptured PAs account for 60% of cases of pancreatitis-related acute hemorrhage, which carries a mortality of 34% to 52%. Up to 75% will spontaneously rupture; therefore, several guidelines recommend urgent treatment. Endovascular treatment is the treatment of choice; however, EUS-guided embolization can be an effective salvage strategy.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the management of visceral artery aneurysms [^43484b1e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The evidence supporting management decisions of visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) is sparse. Practice guidelines are needed to help patients and surgeons choose between endovascular and open surgery approaches.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases, and Scopus for studies of patients with VAAs. Studies were selected and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed when appropriate.

Results

We included 80 observational studies that were mostly noncomparative. Data were available for 2845 aneurysms, comprising 1279 renal artery, 775 splenic artery, 359 hepatic artery, 226 pancreaticoduodenal and gastroduodenal arteries, 95 superior mesenteric artery, 87 celiac artery, 15 jejunal, ileal and colic arteries, and 9 gastric and gastroepiploic arteries. Differences in mortality between open and endovascular approaches were not statistically significant. The endovascular approach was used more often by surgeons. The endovascular approach was associated with shorter hospital stay and lower rates of cardiovascular complications but higher rates of reintervention. Postembolization syndrome rates ranged from 9% (renal) to 38% (splenic). Coil migration ranged from 8% (splenic) to 29% (renal). Otherwise, access site complication were low (< 5%). Pseudoaneurysms tended to have higher mortality and reintervention rates.

Conclusions

This systematic review provides event rates for outcomes important to patients with VAAs. Despite the low certainty warranted by the evidence, these rates along, with surgical expertise and anatomic feasibility, can help patients and surgeons in shared-decision making.

### Iatrogenic femoral pseudoaneurysm and secondary ipsilateral deep vein thrombosis: an indication for early surgical exploration [^d51b0072]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysm formation often complicates transfemoral interventional procedures. Nonsurgical treatment consists of femoral compression and thrombin injection under ultrasound guidance. We report a 74-year-old man who was diagnosed with a pseudoaneurysm, following coronary angiography. Duplex ultrasound revealed deep vein thrombosis of the ipsilateral common femoral vein. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection was unsuccessfully performed, and the patient subsequently underwent surgical exploration for repair of the pseudoaneurysm and release of the venous compression. The increased local inflammation, because of the thrombosis, added in surgical difficulties. We conclude that early surgical intervention should be considered as a primary strategy in patients with femoral pseudoaneurysms and deep vein thrombosis secondary to femoral compression.

### Adult moyamoya disease and syndrome: current perspectives and future directions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^69801264]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Role of endovascular management in moyamoya disease — For ischemic moyamoya, endovascular treatment with stent or angioplasty has a low success rate (25%) and high complication rates, including devastating hemorrhage in 7% to 10%, without evidence of improved natural history. In hemorrhage associated with pseudoaneurysms of moyamoya collaterals, endovascular obliteration (typically distal parent vessel occlusion) can be used; open surgery has a complication rate of 21% to 70% and conservative treatment is associated with 40% rebleeding. Both endovascular direct obliteration and revascularization surgery are described as safe options with success rates of ≈80%. Data on thrombolysis/mechanical thrombectomy are limited, with a systematic review of 10 case reports showing successful reperfusion in 2 of 4 patients undergoing thrombectomy and improvement in 5 of 9 patients with reported functional outcomes.

### Dissecting pseudoaneurysms: predictors of symptom occurrence, enlargement, clinical outcome, and treatment [^71a31d6c]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries can result in the development of aneurysmal dilations. These dissecting pseudoaneurysms can enlarge and cause symptoms. The objective of this study is to provide insight into the progression of dissecting pseudoaneurysms and the treatments required to manage them. METHODS A review of the electronic medical records was conducted to detect patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissection. An imaging review was conducted to identify patients with dissecting pseudoaneurysms. One hundred twelve patients with 120 dissecting pseudoaneurysms were identified. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the factors associated with undergoing further interventions other than medical treatment, pseudoaneurysm enlargement, pseudoaneurysms resulting in ischemic and nonischemic symptoms, and clinical outcome. RESULTS Overall, 18.3% of pseudoaneurysms were intracranial and 81.7% were extracranial, and the average size was 7.3 mm. The mean follow-up time was 29.3 months; 3.3% of patients had a recurrent transient ischemic attack, no patients had a recurrent stroke, and 14.2% of patients had recurrence of nonischemic symptoms (headache, neck pain, Horner syndrome, or cranial nerve palsy). Follow-up imaging demonstrated that 13.8% of pseudoaneurysms had enlarged, 30.2% had healed, and 56% had remained stable. In total, 20.8% of patients had an intervention other than medical treatment. Interventions included stenting, coiling, flow diversion, and clipping. Predictors of intervention included increasing size, size > 10 mm, location in the C 2 (petrous) segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA), younger age, hyperlipidemia, pseudoaneurysm enlargement, and any symptom development. Significant predictors of enlargement included smoking, history of trauma, C 2 location, hyperlipidemia, and larger initial pseudoaneurysm size. Predictors of pseudoaneurysm resulting in recurrent ischemic and nonischemic symptoms included increasing size and location in the petrous segment of the ICA. Smoking was a predictor of unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS Dissecting pseudoaneurysms have a benign course and most will not cause symptoms or enlarge on follow-up. Medical treatment can be a sufficient, initial treatment for dissecting pseudoaneurysms.

### Endovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysms [^434b3637]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Here we present one of the largest case studies of endovascular management of traumatic PAs to date, covering a range of PAs locations both in the viscera and extremities. Our technical success and clinical success rates were 85.7% and 71.4%, respectively, which are similar to the previously reported mixed etiology/type and organ-specific series in the literature. Our cohort experienced no severe, life threatening, or disabling complications of treatment and nor any significant morbidities or mortalities secondary to endovascular treatment or PA re-bleeding.

Endovascular treatment of PAs has become increasingly common over surgical management (Sclafani et al; Berceli). Previous studies comparing endovascular versus surgical treatment have reported shorter procedural times, less blood loss, reduced transfusion requirements, and shorter lengths of stay for the treatment of both true aneurysms and PAs (Batagini et al; Sachdev et al.). These studies also found no difference between surgery and endovascular treatment in technical or clinical success, major complication rate, or overall survival (Batagini et al; Sachdev et al.). Further, additional studies have pointed out the advantages of endovascular management in having lower risk than traditional surgical approaches while allowing for precise localization of the PA as well as assessment of the collateral vasculature (Hemp and Sabri; Clark et al; Salam et al.). Recent randomized controlled data has additionally shown that prophylactic splenic artery embolization after high risk splenic trauma results in fewer splenic PAs, secondary embolizations, and shorter hospitalizations, without increasing complication rates or compromising future splenic viability compared to surveillance (Arvieux et al.).

However, traumatic patients in particular are difficult to manage, typically presenting with a plethora of injuries in addition to vascular trauma and PA formation. Therefore, it may be difficult to discern outcomes of PA management from overall morbidity and treatment requirements. In this cohort, 42.8% required post-IR embolization transfusions. This requirement may be related to blood loss secondary to the PA or related to the overall trauma. In addition, three patients with splenic PAs required splenectomy after successful IR treatment of a splenic PA, however, all had extensive splenic injury (grade ≥ 3). Previous studies have indicated that higher-grade splenic injuries have a higher likelihood of splenectomy (Zarzaur et al.). It is worth noting, that our institution does not perform proximal splenic artery coil embolization for splenic hemorrhage control, which is an option to control diffuse splenic parenchymal hemorrhage in high grade splenic injuries.

### Treatment protocol of traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the superficial temporal artery [^d1fb11e3]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysm of the superficial temporal artery is an unusual complication. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and radiologic study. The standard treatment is surgical ligation and resection, and other treatment options include radiologic intervention, thrombin injection, and conservative treatment. In this article, the authors report several cases of pseudoaneurysm and suggest a treatment protocol to manage pseudoaneurysm of the superficial temporal artery. We conducted a retrospective review of 11 patients who underwent treatment of superficial temporal artery pseudoaneurysm between April 2002 and July 2011. According to the duration of the aneurysm, we divided the superficial temporal artery pseudoaneurysms into 3 stages: "Acute" stage is less than 3 weeks, "Subacute" stage is from 3 weeks to 3 months, and "Chronic" stage is more than 3 months. Among the 11 patients who were diagnosed with superficial temporal artery pseudoaneurysms, 7 cases were treated by surgical resection, 2 cases by conservative treatment, 2 cases by thrombin injection, and 1 case by radiologic intervention. There was no recurrence during the follow-up periods. The most successful standard treatment is surgical resection. More recently, many nonsurgical treatments have been used, such as conservative treatment, thrombin injection, endovascular embolization, or coiling. Every method has its advantages and disadvantages and should be chosen according to the chronicity and size of the pseudoaneurysm, patient's clinical status, including hemodynamic stability, patient's aesthetic preferences, and compliance. The authors suggest a systematic treatment protocol depending on the stage of the pseudoaneurysm, patients' status, and preferences.

### Emergency treatment of haemorrhaging coeliac or mesenteric artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms in the era of endovascular management [^79bbd7bd]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients requiring emergency treatment of visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) can be treated by endovascular or surgical techniques. Outcomes after failed attempts at endovascular control are unclear as is the present role of surgery. This study reviewed treatment and outcomes of a contemporary cohort of patients with symptomatic VAAs at a tertiary referral centre.

Methods

Patients undergoing emergency treatment of a VAA of the coeliac, mesenteric arteries, or their branches were identified over a 5-year period. Patient variables, treatments, and outcomes were assessed.

Results

Forty-eight patients underwent 65 radiological and two surgical procedures. Pseuodaneuryms were present in 45 (94%) of patients. Interventional radiology procedures were the initial treatment in every patient. The initial success was 40 out of 48 (83%). Patients requiring more than one procedure were all successfully treated. Regarding initial failures, if the VAA sac could not be accessed at angiography an alternative procedure to control the VAA was required in every case. If initial endovascular treatment failed, repeating the same procedure was successful in half of the patients. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous VAA embolisation was used in four patients. The 30-day mortality was eight out of 48 (17%). There were four recorded complications including one death directly attributable to VAA treatment.

Conclusions

Patients needing emergency treatment of a VAA could be well served by non-surgical management. When the initial attempt at control of bleeding is unsuccessful it is important to consider non-conventional means of accessing these arteries. The need for surgery, in selected centres, may exist for a small group of patients after initial failed radiological treatment only.

### Conservative treatment of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm after mitral valve replacement due to early left ventricular rupture: a case report [^395ef0e7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Although prompt surgical repair have been recommended as the method of first choice to prevent LVPA rupture, surgical repair may be hesitant because of the high mortality rate. In consideration of her extremely low body mass index and advanced comorbidity in our case, immediate surgery of this LVPA was believed to have an exceedingly high mortality rate. However, the aneurysmal neck and dimension of the LVPA was fortunately small, which made a conservative management feasible and successful despite continuation of warfarin therapy. During the long-term follow-up, the patient showed stable clinical and hemodynamic conditions. This interesting case suggests that conservative treatment can be an alternative in appropriate patients.

Although 30–40% of untreated pseudoaneurysms rupture in the first year, the treatment strategy remains controversial. Surgery is suggested for patients with large or expanding false aneurysms. Conservative strategies yielded positive results in several cases. Sakai et al. reported that 7 out of 8 patients with a LVPA after mitral valve repair were managed conservatively, and indicated that conservative management may be possible if the pseudoaneurysm is small and its neck is very narrow. Factors that favor a conservative management include high surgical risks, no clinical symptom, small pseudoaneurysm less than 3 cm, small aneurysmal neck and stable echocardiographic and clinical manifestations. Percutaneous approaches to closure of LVPA have recently been described. For a population of elderly, fragile patients with severe comorbidities, percutaneous closure of the LVPA seems to be a viable minimally invasive option. Anatomy, the size and the width of the neck of the LVPA should be considered when an optimal approach is planned. The disadvantage of these devices is the possibility of mechanical compression of adjacent epicardial coronary vessels.

We presented a rare case of conservatively managed LVPA after early LV rupture. This case suggests that medical treatment LVPA patients has a limited but acceptable role in selected and unusual circumstances.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^a1f228b2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) natural history and rupture risk — overall mortality of ruptured SAAs is high, and pregnancy markedly increases risk: The overall mortality of ruptured SAAs is as high as 25%. SAAs in young women are thought to have a particular tendency toward rupture, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy, and pregnancy may be associated with 20% to 50% of all ruptures. Rupture of an SAA during pregnancy has devastating maternal and fetal mortality rates of 80% and 90%, respectively. Splenic artery pseudoaneurysms certainly have a higher rupture potential than true aneurysms; in one series of 48 visceral aneurysms, 80% of 28 pseudoaneurysms were symptomatic at presentation vs 30% of 20 true aneurysms. In a review of 233 patients with 253 visceral artery aneurysms, rupture at presentation was significantly more frequent for visceral pseudoaneurysms than true aneurysms (76.3% vs 3.1%), with 35 ruptures reported, and the authors concluded that visceral pseudoaneurysms are at increased risk for rupture and that diameter is not necessarily a reliable predictor of rupture.

### Endovascular management of hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage complicating pancreaticoduodenectomy [^45f749cb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a morbid complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy. Determining its etiology is often a daunting challenge in that both common and unusual mechanisms may be operative. Visceral artery pseudoaneurysms, although rare, must be considered in that minimally invasive means are available for effective therapy. Our recent experience with two cases highlights the importance for both general and vascular surgeons to be aware of the diagnostic and therapeutic role for early angiography and deployment of endovascular techniques to achieve a successful outcome.

Celiac artery aneurysm (CAA) — treatment selection and follow-up: We recommend emergent intervention for ruptured CAAs. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High). We recommend treatment of nonruptured celiac artery pseudoaneurysms of any size in patients of acceptable operative risk because of the possibility of rupture. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We recommend treatment of nonruptured celiac artery true aneurysms > 2 cm, with a demonstrable increase in size, or with associated symptoms in patients of acceptable risk because of the risk of rupture. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). We suggest observation over intervention for small (< 2 cm), stable asymptomatic CAAs or those in patients with significant medical comorbidities or limited life expectancy. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). In patients with ruptured CAA discovered at laparotomy, we suggest ligation if sufficient collateral circulation to the liver can be documented. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). In patients with ruptured CAA diagnosed on preoperative imaging studies who are stable, we recommend treatment with open surgical or appropriate endovascular methods based on the patient's anatomy and underlying clinical condition. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). For the elective treatment of CAA, we suggest using an endovascular intervention if it is anatomically feasible; however, elective treatment may appropriately involve open surgical, endovascular, or laparoscopic methods of intervention, depending on the patient's anatomy and underlying clinical condition. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). To determine the need for revascularization of the celiac artery and its branches in treating CAA, we suggest evaluating the status of the superior mesenteric artery, gastroduodenal artery, and other relevant collateral circulation, which must be carefully documented on preoperative CTA or angiography. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We suggest screening patients with CAAs for other arterial aneurysms. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). In patients in whom a CAA is being observed with a nonoperative or noninterventional approach, we suggest annual surveillance with CTA scans to assess for growth.

### Endovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysms [^0e268c41]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

In the past, identified PAs were treated surgically with arterial reconstruction, ligation, or end organ resection (Keeling et al; Batagini et al; Sachdev et al.). Given the unstable nature of these patients, morbidity and mortality rates could be as high as 50% for surgical repair (Mandel et al; Stabile et al.). Endovascular treatment of PAs is now increasingly common with advancements in medical management, imaging, endovascular techniques, and available embolic agents, however, minimal data currently exists reporting these outcomes (Saad et al; Sclafani et al; Shanmuganathan et al.). While multiple case series have investigated the endovascular treatment of PAs, these cover PAs of mixed etiologies (e.g. trauma, infection, iatrogenic), combine outcomes of injury type (e.g. blush/active bleeding, true aneurysms, and PAs), or report a single organ alone (McDermott et al; Batagini et al; Sachdev et al; D'Souza et al; Guillon et al; Loffroy et al; Tessier et al; Tulsyan et al; Venkatesh et al; Zarzaur et al.). Two case series with specific outcomes of traumatic pseudoaneurysms have been reported, however, assessing specifically the liver (n = 7) in patients failing initial conservative management, or the kidney (n = 3) (Osterballe et al; Yamacake et al.). The purpose of this study was to determine the technical and clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment of visceral and extremity traumatic pseudoaneurysms.
