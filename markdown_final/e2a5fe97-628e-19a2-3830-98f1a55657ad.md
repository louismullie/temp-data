## Question

Are there any studies on using toradol for fever verses pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are studies on using Toradol (ketorolac) for fever versus pain, and how the evidence compares. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic plausibility that ketorolac has antipyretic activity. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about indications for fever versus pain. Next, I will search for direct clinical studies of ketorolac's antipyretic effect. After that, I should review the strength and breadth of analgesic evidence to contrast with the fever data. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-aware conclusion and note limitations that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis, because if ketorolac lacks antipyretic activity, the question is moot. Ketorolac is a nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor that reduces prostaglandin synthesis, which is the same pathway that mediates fever; multiple FDA labels explicitly state ketorolac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties, so pharmacologically it should lower fever when given systemically [^9062b2a9] [^9c852cde] [^fd7f9b57].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory status before inferring clinical use. The FDA labeling for systemic ketorolac is for short-term management of moderately severe acute pain, typically up to 5 days, and it is not indicated for fever; importantly, IV ibuprofen is the only IV NSAID in the U.S. with an explicit antipyretic indication, which underscores that ketorolac's antipyretic effect, while real pharmacologically, is not a labeled use [^c2465329] [^2cf6532a] [^f217370e].

> I will now examine direct clinical evidence for antipyretic efficacy. There is a small, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in febrile adults showing that IV ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg (max 30 mg) reduced temperature by about 0.8°C at 60 minutes versus 0.4°C with placebo, with an odds ratio of 7.1 for becoming afebrile at 60 minutes; this supports a modest antipyretic effect, but the sample is tiny and the study is old, so the certainty is low [^19a6e296].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should contrast this with the analgesic evidence base. Ketorolac has robust analgesic data across multiple randomized trials and settings, including ED acute pain where 10–30 mg IV doses show similar efficacy with a ceiling effect around 10 mg, postoperative opioid-sparing benefits, and specific conditions like renal colic and biliary colic; systematic reviews and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate clinically meaningful pain reduction and opioid-sparing effects, which far exceed the limited fever data in both quantity and quality [^386a871e] [^f8bdb453] [^cf108d74] [^3c6b1950] [^4643cbf3].

> Let me consider formulation-specific signals that might hint at antipyretic utility. In a postoperative intranasal ketorolac study, pyrexia rates were significantly lower with 31.5 mg IN every 8 hours compared with placebo, suggesting antipyretic activity in inflammatory postoperative contexts; however, this was a secondary outcome and not a dedicated antipyretic trial, so it should be interpreted cautiously [^0fd4a463].

> I should double-check safety constraints because they influence whether ketorolac is reasonable for fever even if it can lower temperature. Ketorolac carries boxed warnings for GI bleeding and ulceration, is contraindicated in active GI disease or bleeding, and has additional risks in renal impairment, coagulopathies, and late pregnancy; these risks are nontrivial and argue against routine antipyretic use when safer alternatives like acetaminophen or ibuprofen exist, especially given the lack of a fever indication and the short maximum duration of therapy [^2cf6532a] [^a679d714] [^826078de].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is special, like refractory fever in a monitored setting where NSAIDs are otherwise indicated for pain? In that narrow context, a single dose of ketorolac may reduce fever modestly, but I need to ensure we do not generalize this to standard practice; the balance of benefit–risk still favors agents with established antipyretic indications and better safety profiles for fever control, particularly outside of pain-directed indications [^19a6e296] [^f217370e].

> In summary, yes — there is a small study demonstrating antipyretic activity of IV ketorolac, and mechanistic labeling confirms antipyretic properties, but the analgesic evidence is vastly stronger and more extensive, and ketorolac is not indicated for fever; clinically, it should not be used primarily for antipyresis given safety concerns and the availability of safer, indicated alternatives [^19a6e296] [^9062b2a9] [^c2465329] [^f217370e].

Toradol (ketorolac) is **FDA-approved for acute pain** [^c2465329] and is widely supported by robust evidence for analgesia [^386a871e] [^f8bdb453], including ED and postoperative settings [^0fd4a463] [^c6c38f10]. In contrast, **evidence for antipyretic use is limited** to a small, older RCT showing modest fever reduction [^19a6e296], and ketorolac is not FDA-approved for fever [^c2465329]. Given its higher GI, renal, and bleeding risks compared with other NSAIDs, ketorolac should not be used solely for fever; acetaminophen or ibuprofen are preferred antipyretics [^0cec0d82].

---

## Clinical evidence for ketorolac in pain management

Ketorolac has **extensive evidence for acute pain**, including:

- **ED acute pain**: Multiple RCTs show ketorolac 10–30 mg IV provides rapid, effective analgesia [^386a871e] with a ceiling effect at 10 mg [^f8bdb453]; it is noninferior to higher doses and reduces opioid requirements [^f8bdb453].

- **Postoperative pain**: Ketorolac reduces opioid consumption by ~26–36% [^b393afa9] [^c6c38f10] and improves pain control in postoperative patients [^cf108d74].

- **Renal colic**: Ketorolac is effective for renal colic [^3c6b1950], with similar efficacy across 10–30 mg IV doses [^3c6b1950].

- **Migraine**: Ketorolac is effective for acute migraine [^0fb1c461], with efficacy comparable to meperidine and superior to intranasal sumatriptan in some studies [^0fb1c461].

---

## Clinical evidence for ketorolac in fever management

Evidence for ketorolac as an **antipyretic is limited**:

- **Single RCT**: A small, double-blind trial (n = 40) found IV ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg reduced temperature by 0.8°C at 60 minutes vs 0.4°C with placebo, with an OR of 7.1 for becoming afebrile [^19a6e296]. The authors concluded ketorolac has antipyretic properties, but the study is small and dated.

- **Lack of approval**: Ketorolac is not FDA-approved for fever [^c2465329], and no current guidelines recommend it for antipyresis.

- **Comparative safety**: Ketorolac has higher risks of GI bleeding, renal impairment, and platelet dysfunction than other NSAIDs, limiting its suitability for routine fever control [^0cec0d82].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Ketorolac has **significant safety limitations** compared with other NSAIDs:

| **Adverse effect** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal bleeding | Higher risk than many NSAIDs; contraindicated in active GI ulcers or bleeding [^2cf6532a] [^0cec0d82] |
| Renal impairment | Contraindicated in advanced renal impairment; use cautiously in elderly or dehydrated patients [^373ea1f3] [^9d655fa7] |
| Platelet dysfunction | Increases bleeding risk; contraindicated in coagulopathies or perioperative settings with high bleeding risk [^7d6efcd8] |
| Cardiovascular risk | NSAID class risks apply; use caution in patients with CV disease [^55ba7520] |

---

## Comparison with other antipyretics

Ketorolac is **less suitable for fever** than standard antipyretics:

| **Medication** | **Fever efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Approval status** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen | High efficacy; first-line antipyretic | Excellent; minimal GI/renal/platelet effects | FDA-approved for fever |
| Ibuprofen | High efficacy; first-line antipyretic | Good; GI/renal risks but lower than ketorolac | FDA-approved for fever |
| Ketorolac | Limited evidence; modest fever reduction | Higher GI/renal/bleeding risks | Not approved for fever |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend ketorolac for fever**; acetaminophen or ibuprofen remain first-line antipyretics due to superior safety and established efficacy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Ketorolac has **strong evidence for acute pain** [^386a871e] but **limited evidence for fever** [^19a6e296] and is not approved for antipyresis [^c2465329]. Given its higher adverse-event risk, ketorolac should not be used solely for fever; acetaminophen or ibuprofen are preferred. Ketorolac may be considered for pain with concurrent fever only when its analgesic benefit is clearly indicated and alternatives are unsuitable.

### Antipyretic effectiveness of intravenous ketorolac tromethamine [^19a6e296]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We assessed the antipyretic effectiveness of intravenously administered ketorolac tromethamine in the febrile adult. A double-blind placebo controlled trial enrolling a convenience sample of febrile (T > 38.0 degrees C, oral) patients (18–65 years old) randomized to receive either 0.5 mg/kg (max 30 mg) intravenous ketorolac or placebo. Oral temperatures were recorded every 15 min during the 1-h study period. There were 20 patients in each group. At 60 min, the temperature decrease was 0.4 degrees C (95% CI: 0.0 degrees, 0.7 degrees) for the control group and 0.8 degrees C (95% CI: 0.5 degrees, 1.1 degrees) for the ketorolac group. Logistic regression modeling of afebrile at 60 min, controlling for baseline temperature, yielded an odds ratio for ketorolac of 7.1 (95% CI: 1.3, 39.5). In conclusion, our data support that intravenously administered ketorolac has antipyretic properties.

MEDICATION GUIDE FOR NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs)

(See the end of this Medication Guide for a
list of prescription NSAID medicines.)

What is the most important information I should know about
medicines called Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

NSAID medicines may increase the chance of a heart attack or
stroke that can lead to death. This chance increases:

with longer use of NSAID medicines
in people who have heart disease

NSAID medicines should never be used right before or after a
heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)".

NSAID medicines can cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach
and intestines at any time during treatment. Ulcers and bleeding:

can happen without warning symptoms
may cause death

The chance of a person getting an ulcer or bleeding
increases with:

taking medicines called "corticosteroids" and "anticoagulants"
longer use
smoking
drinking alcohol
older age
having poor health

NSAID medicines should only be used:

exactly as prescribed
at the lowest dose possible for your treatment
for the shortest time needed

What are Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

NSAID medicines are used to treat pain and redness, swelling, and heat
(inflammation) from medical conditions such as:

BOXED WARNING

WARNING Ketorolac tromethamine, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is indicated for the short-term (up to 5 days in adults) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level. Oral ketorolac tromethamine is indicated only as continuation treatment following intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine, if necessary. The total combined duration of use of oral ketorolac tromethamine and ketorolac tromethamine injection should not exceed 5 days. Ketorolac tromethamine is not indicated for use in pediatric patients and it is NOT indicated for minor or chronic painful conditions. Increasing the dose of ketorolac tromethamine beyond the label recommendations will not provide better efficacy but will increase the risk of developing serious adverse events. GASTROINTESTINAL RISK

Ketorolac tromethamine can cause peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding and/or perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine is CONTRAINDICATED in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events (see WARNINGS).

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug which, when administered systemically, has demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic activity. The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Two drops of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution instilled into the eyes of patients 12 hours and 1 hour prior to cataract extraction achieved a mean ketorolac concentration of 95 ng/mL in the aqueous humor of 8 of 9 eyes tested (range 40 to 170 ng/mL).

One drop of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution was instilled into 1 eye and 1 drop of vehicle into the other eye three times daily in 26 healthy subjects. Five (5) of 26 subjects had detectable concentrations of ketorolac in their plasma (range 11 to 23 ng/mL) at Day 10 during topical ocular treatment. The range of concentrations following three times daily dosing of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution are approximately 4 to 8% of the steady state mean minimum plasma concentration observed following four times daily oral administration of 10 mg ketorolac in humans (290 ± 70 ng/mL).

### The safety and analgesic efficacy of intranasal ketorolac in patients with postoperative pain [^0fd4a463]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of intranasal ketorolac tromethamine (ketorolac) for postoperative pain.

Methods

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients undergoing major surgery who were randomized to receive intranasal ketorolac, 10 mg or 31.5 mg, [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED]or placebo every 8 h for 40 h. After surgery, patients with pain intensity of at least 40 on a 100-mm visual analog scale were assessed at 30 min and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48 h after receiving the study drug. Patient-controlled i.v. morphine provided supplemental analgesia.

Results

Among 127 patients enrolled, morphine use during the first 24 h was significantly less in patients receiving 31.5 mg [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] of ketorolac (37.8 mg) than in the placebo group (56.5 mg) and in the 10-mg ketorolac group (54.3 mg). Over 48 h, the 31.5-mg ketorolac [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] group used significantly less morphine than the placebo group. Summed pain intensity differences at 4 and 6 h significantly favored the 31.5-mg ketorolac [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED]group over the other groups. The rates of pyrexia and tachycardia were significantly lower in the ketorolac 31.5-mg [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED]group than in the placebo group. Other adverse events were reported with similar frequency in all treatment groups and most were considered unrelated to treatment.

Conclusion

Thirty milligrams of intranasal ketorolac demonstrated significant analgesic efficacy compared to 10 mg of intranasal ketorolac and placebo.

### Comparison of intravenous ketorolac at three single-dose regimens for treating acute pain in the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial [^386a871e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used extensively for the management of acute and chronic pain, with ketorolac tromethamine being one of the most frequently used parenteral analgesics in the emergency department (ED). The drugs may commonly be used at doses above their analgesic ceiling, offering no incremental analgesic advantage while potentially adding risk of harm. We evaluate the analgesic efficacy of 3 doses of intravenous ketorolac in ED patients with acute pain.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial to assess the analgesic efficacy of 3 doses of intravenous ketorolac (10, 15, and 30 mg) in patients aged 18 to 65 years and presenting to the ED with moderate to severe acute pain, defined by a numeric rating scale score greater than or equal to 5. We excluded patients with peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, renal or hepatic insufficiency, allergies to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pregnancy or breastfeeding, systolic blood pressure less than 90 or greater than 180 mm Hg, and pulse rate less than 50 or greater than 150 beats/min. Primary outcome was pain reduction at 30 minutes. We recorded pain scores at baseline and up to 120 minutes. Intravenous morphine 0.1 mg/kg was administered as a rescue analgesic if subjects still desired additional pain medication at 30 minutes after the study drug was administered. Data analyses included mixed-model regression and ANOVA.

Results

We enrolled 240 subjects (80 in each dose group). At 30 minutes, substantial pain reduction was demonstrated without any differences between the groups (95% confidence intervals 4.5 to 5.7 for the 10-mg group, 4.5 to 5.6 for the 15-mg group, and 4.2 to 5.4 for the 30-mg group). The mean numeric rating scale pain scores at baseline were 7.7, 7.5, and 7.8 and improved to 5.1, 5.0, and 4.8, respectively, at 30 minutes. Rates of rescue analgesia were similar, and there were no serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes showed similar rates of adverse effects per group, of which the most common were dizziness, nausea, and headache.

Conclusion

Ketorolac has similar analgesic efficacy at intravenous doses of 10, 15, and 30 mg, showing that intravenous ketorolac administered at the analgesic ceiling dose (10 mg) provided effective pain relief to ED patients with moderate to severe pain without increased adverse effects.

Physicians, when prescribing ketorolac tromethamine, should inform their
patients or their guardians of the potential risks of ketorolac tromethamine
treatment (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE
REACTIONS sections), instruct patients to seek medical advice if they
develop treatment-related adverse events, and advise patients
not to give ketorolac tromethamine tablets to other
family members and to discard any unused drug.

Remember that the total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine
tablet and ketorolac tromethamine IV or IM dosing is not to exceed 5 days in
adults. Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric
patients.

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating
therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.
Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that
accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side
effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even
death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients
should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath,
weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing
any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance
of this follow-up (see WARNINGS:
Cardiovascular Effects).
Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and
rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result
in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and
bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the
signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical
advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain,
dyspepsia, melena and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance
of this follow-up (see WARNINGS:
Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and
Perforation).
Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side
effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result in
hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur
without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin
rash and blisters, fever or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and
should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms.
Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type
of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain
or edema to their physicians.
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of
hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper
quadrant tenderness and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be
instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g.,
difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients
should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine should be
avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus
arteriosus.

12 C LINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug which, when administered systemically, has demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic activity. The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

One drop of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution was instilled into one eye and one drop of vehicle into the other eye TID in 26 healthy subjects. Five of 26 subjects had detectable concentrations of ketorolac in their plasma (range 11 to 23 ng/mL) at day 10 during topical ocular treatment.

Two drops of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution instilled into the eyes of patients 12 hours and 1 hour prior to cataract extraction achieved a mean ketorolac concentration of 95 ng/mL in the aqueous humor of 8 of 9 eyes tested (range 40 to 170 ng/mL).

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^f217370e]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a well known and long history of use. Oral ibuprofen was approved in the USA over 40 years ago and has been a nonprescription drug for more than 30 years. IV ibuprofen (Caldolor ®, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. Nashville, TN, USA) was first approved in 2009 for the management of mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain in conjunction with narcotics, and for the reduction of fever in adults. It is the only IV NSAID approved for the treatment of fever in the USA. Since 2002, the safety and effectiveness of IV ibuprofen has been investigated in ten clinical studies, Phases II–IV, conducted under a corporate investigational new drug application (Table 1).

Two other IV NSAIDs are currently available in the US market, ketorolac tromethamine injection ("ketorolac", Toradol, Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA) and diclofenac sodium injection ("diclofenac", Dyloject™, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA). Ketorolac injection was approved in 1989 for the short-term management of moderately severe, acute pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. Ketorolac is contraindicated for use in excess of 5 days, for minor or chronic pain, and for use in pediatric patients. Additional limitations on ketorolac administration include prohibitions against all preoperative use, in patients with active ulcers or who are otherwise at a high risk of bleeding, those with advanced renal impairment, and women who are nursing. Diclofenac sodium injection was approved in December 2014 for the management of mild to moderate pain or moderate to severe pain either alone or in combination with opiates. Diclofenac is only approved for use in adults and is contraindicated in patients with known moderate to severe renal insufficiency who may become volume depleted. Neither of these IV NSAIDs are indicated for the treatment of fever.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ketorolac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of SPRIX, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), an early component of the arachidonic acid cascade, resulting in the reduced synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclin.

Ketorolac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Ketorolac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because ketorolac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

### An analysis of harms reporting in systematic reviews regarding ketorolac for management of perioperative pain [^f126f059]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Owing to the frequent perioperative use of ketorolac tromethamine and its ability to minimise postoperative opioid requirements, it is important to continually reassess harms associated with its use. Our primary objective was to investigate the extent of harms reporting in systematic reviews (SRs) on ketorolac for perioperative pain.

Methods

In May 2022, we conducted a search of major databases, MEDLINE (PubMed and Ovid), Embase, Epistemonikos, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify eligible SRs on ketorolac for perioperative pain. Screening and data extraction were performed in masked, duplicate fashion. A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) was used to appraise the methodological quality of included SRs. Corrected covered area (CCA) was calculated to determine overlap of primary studies between SR dyads.

Results

A total of 28 SRs evaluating 630 primary studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven SRs (7/28, 25%) reported no harms and 17 SRs (17/28, 60.7%) reported ≤ 50% of harms items. A significant association was found between completeness of harms reporting and whether harms were specified as a primary outcome (P < 0.001). No other associations were statistically significant. Regarding methodological quality, 22 SRs were appraised as 'critically low' (22/28, 78.6%), 5 as 'low' (5/28, 17.9%), and 1 as 'high' (1/28, 3.6%). One SR dyad had a CCA > 50% but neither reported harms.

Conclusions

The extent of harms reporting in systematic reviews was inadequate. Given the importance that systematic reviews have on guiding perioperative decision-making, it is essential to improve the completeness of harms reporting.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Postoperative Pain

The effect of SPRIX on acute pain was evaluated in two multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

In a study of adults who had undergone elective abdominal or orthopedic surgery, 300 patients were randomized and treated with SPRIX or placebo administered every 8 hours and morphine administered via patient controlled analgesia on an as needed basis. Efficacy was demonstrated as a statistically significant greater reduction in the summed pain intensity difference over 48 hours in patients who received SPRIX as compared to those receiving placebo. The clinical relevance of this is reflected in the finding that patients treated with SPRIX required 36% less morphine over 48 hours than patients treated with placebo.

In a study of adults who had undergone elective abdominal surgery, 321 patients were randomized and treated with SPRIX or placebo administered every 6 hours and morphine administered via patient controlled analgesia on an as needed basis. Efficacy was demonstrated as a statistically significant greater reduction in the summed pain intensity difference over 48 hours in patients who received SPRIX as compared to those receiving placebo.

### Interventions for the prevention or treatment of epidural-related maternal fever: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6bb4e130]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for further research

Further high-quality RCT evidence and mechanistic research is needed to be able to make recommendations for the appropriate management of ERMF. The current evidence base is methodologically diverse, as there is inconsistency in the assumed underlying aetiology of intrapartum fever and the type of intervention being trialled. Anti-inflammatory interventions warrant further scrutiny. The divergence in results of studies examining steroid administration suggest that higher dose steroids may offer a therapeutic intervention worth testing rigorously. However, this must be balanced against potential side effects of such doses. Studies examining the effect of paracetamol, which yielded little evidence, arguably used insufficient doses to credibly anticipate a treatment effect. Other, novel anti-inflammatory interventions are yet to be adequately examined in trials. In a retrospective study, women who received magnesium sulphate in labour, for hypertensive conditions of pregnancy, were less likely to develop fever. Parturients who developed fever were more likely to be nulliparous, have prolonged labour, receive epidural analgesia, and to require delivery by Caesarean section. Therefore this finding must be regarded in its context; an uncontrolled study, with many potential confounders. It is interesting nonetheless. Trials examining the effects of altering the temperature of anaesthetic solutions at administration are potentially promising but face many challenges to conduct in practice. Methods of reduced dose epidural, especially intermittent administration of local anaesthetic, appear to be comparatively most effective at reducing the incidence of intrapartum fever and future trials should also record neonatal outcomes including the rates of sepsis evaluation and admission to Level 2 care, to evaluate the consequences of the intervention itself, and the development of fever, on the neonate.

### Comparison of intravenous ketorolac at three doses for treating renal colic in the emergency department: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^3c6b1950]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is extensively used for the management of renal colic in the emergency department (ED). It has been proposed that ketorolac is used at doses above its analgesic ceiling with no more advantages and increased risk of adverse effects. In this study, we compared the analgesic effects of three doses of intravenous ketorolac in patients with renal colic.

Methods

This noninferiority, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluated the analgesic efficacy of three doses of intravenous ketorolac (10, 20, and 30 mg) in adult patients presenting to the ED with renal colic. Exclusion criteria consisted of age > 65 years, active peptic ulcer disease, acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage, renal or hepatic insufficiency, NSAID hypersensitivity, pregnancy or breastfeeding, unstable vital signs, and patients who had received analgesics in the past 24 hours. Pain was recorded every 15 minutes from baseline up to 60 minutes, and the primary outcome was pain reduction at 30 minutes. If patients still required additional pain medications at 30 minutes, they would receive 0.1 mg/kg intravenous morphine sulfate as a rescue analgesic.

Results

A total of 165 subjects enrolled in this study, 55 in each group. The median visual analog scale score in 30 minutes was improved from 90 at baseline to 40 among subjects who were randomized to 30-mg group. This improvement was 40 and 50 mm in 20- and 10-mg ketorolac treatment arms, respectively, with no significant difference between the three doses (p < 0.05). Secondary outcomes showed similar rescue analgesic administration and adverse effects. There was no serious adverse event.

Conclusion

Ketorolac at 10-, 20-, and 30-mg doses can produce similar analgesic efficacy in renal colic.

### A randomized, controlled trial to compare ketorolac tromethamine versus placebo after cesarean section to reduce pain and narcotic usage [^b6999460]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether postcesarean section administration of ketorolac tromethamine reduces pain and narcotic usage.

Study Design

A double-blinded randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ketorolac tromethamine was performed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ketorolac tromethamine or placebo. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was used for pain control. Visual analog scales (VAS) were administered postoperatively to assess pain levels. Morphine equivalents and attempts were recorded.

Results

There were 22 patients in each arm of the study. There was no significant difference between patient demographics, blood loss, and type of anesthesia. Pain scores were significantly different at 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (P = 0.033). There was a significant decrease in pain medication usage (P = 0.008) in the study group.

Conclusion

Ketorolac tromethamine is efficacious in reducing postoperative pain and narcotics usage after cesarean section.

Results

Study characteristics

All ten, company-sponsored, Phase II–IV studies conducted with IV ibuprofen in adult patients were included in this analysis and comprise the clinical trial safety database for IV ibuprofen (Table 1). The studies were conducted between 2002 and 2014. There were eight controlled and two open-label designs. In the eight controlled studies, which were all randomized and double-blind, subjects received either IV ibuprofen (Caldolor ®) or comparator – IV ketorolac or placebo. Of the eight controlled studies, five evaluated the benefit of IV ibuprofen to treat pain (surgical), two to relieve fever, and one for the treatment of pain and fever. Doses of IV ibuprofen ranged from 100 to 400 mg for the indication of fever and up to 800 mg for pain. In the two open-label, surveillance trials, all subjects received IV ibuprofen. One of these studies investigated IV ibuprofen for pain (surgical) and one for pain (any etiology) or fever. Doses of IV ibuprofen were either 400 mg (fever) or 800 mg (pain) in these studies. Safety data in the form of serious AEs (SAEs) were available from all ten studies, whereas AE (nonserious) data were available from eight studies. Clinically significant laboratory parameters were collected in six studies. Safety sub-analyses were conducted based on the different administration conditions used in several of the studies. Four trials investigated a shortened infusion time for IV ibuprofen (ie, 5–10 vs 30 minutes);–four studies allowed dosing prior to surgery.–

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^0cec0d82]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

In general, NSAIDs have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties, and their use is associated with recognized gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) risks which are generally believed to be derived from the relative level of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) or COX2 inhibition. All three IV NSAIDs mentioned above are considered nonselective in terms of their COX1 and COX2 inhibition because they are capable of inhibiting both isoforms. However, Warner et al extensively investigated the COX1 and COX2 inhibitory capacity of over 40 NSAIDs using two in vitro assays, and their results permit ranking of these NSAIDs in terms of COX1 preference – ketorolac > ibuprofen > diclofenac – where ketorolac is the most COX1 selective, diclofenac is weakly COX2 selective (fourfold), and ibuprofen is essentially balanced (nonspecific). These in vitro results suggest that ibuprofen may have a preferable safety profile over ketorolac in terms of GI complications and over diclofenac in terms of CV complications. This hypothesis is supported by the clinical literature which demonstrates that ketorolac can be as much as fivefold more gastrotoxic than other NSAIDs. A meta-analysis of 28 studies pooled the relative risk (RR) of GI complications following usage of individual NSAIDs and found that ibuprofen had one of the most favorable risk profiles (RR = 1.8) as compared to diclofenac at 3.3 and ketorolac at 11.5. Further meta-analysis demonstrated that ibuprofen also had one of the lowest risk ratios for CV events, whereas diclofenac conferred a high risk of CV complications. A retrospective chart analysis of 9,658 patients receiving inpatient NSAID therapy concluded that diclofenac and aspirin were the NSAIDs most commonly associated with the emergence of adverse events (AEs).

Until recently, limited data have been available on the use of IV ibuprofen in hospitalized patients. Additional Phase IV trials have been conducted following the approval of IV ibuprofen by the FDA in 2009. This review presents a cumulative analysis of the clinical safety data available regarding the use of IV ibuprofen for the treatment of pain and fever in hospitalized adults.

### Acetaminophen vs ibuprofen for fever or pain in children younger than 2 years… [^06f6a735]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this meta-analysis of 19 studies with 241 138 participants, ibuprofen, compared with acetaminophen, was associated with reduced temperature at less than 4 hours and 4 to 24 hours and less pain at 4 to 24 hours. Adverse events were uncommon. Meaning In this study, use of ibuprofen vs acetaminophen for the treatment of fever or pain in children younger than 2 years was associated with reduced temperature and less pain within the first 24 hours of treatment, with equivalent safety. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, use of ibuprofen vs acetaminophen for the treatment of fever or pain in children younger than 2 years was associated with reduced temperature and less pain within the first 24 hours of treatment, with equivalent safety. Two authors independently extracted data using a prespecified form. The primary outcomes were fever or pain within 4 hours of treatment onset.

Secondary outcomes included fever within 4 hours and fever or pain at 4 to 24 hours, 1 to 3 days, and more than 3 days. Overall, 11 studies reported data from randomized studies involving 28 450 participants. Of these, 9 reported fever outcomes, 29, 30, 32–36, 39, 40 4 reported pain outcomes, 33, 35, 39, 40 and 9 reported safety outcomes. Two randomized studies were at high risk of bias. All nonrandomized studies were at moderate or serious risk of bias. For continuous fever outcomes, moderate-quality evidence showed that, compared with acetaminophen, ibuprofen was associated with reduced temperature at 4 to 24 hours from treatment onset.

For continuous pain outcomes, moderate-quality evidence showed that compared with acetaminophen, ibuprofen was associated with less pain at 4 to 24 hours from treatment onset.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection, USP in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection, USP is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

Hypertension

NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

### Intranasal ketorolac tromethamine (SPRIX (R)) containing 6% of lidocaine (ROX-828) for acute treatment of migraine: safety and efficacy data from a phase II clinical trial [^acd0ded2]. Cephalalgia (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Ketorolac is a non-triptan, non-opioid, mixed cyclooxygenase (COX)1/2-inhibitor for short-term management of moderate-to-severe acute pain. This trial evaluated an intranasal formulation of ketorolac tromethamine (SPRIX®) containing 6% lidocaine (ROX-828) for the acute treatment of migraine with and without aura as defined by the International Headache Society.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to self-treat with intranasal ROX-828 (31.5mg ketorolac tromethamine/200µL, containing 6% of lidocaine) or placebo (with 6% lidocaine) within four hours of a new migraine attack rated ≥ moderate in pain intensity. Assessments included headache intensity and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, photophobia) measured at baseline and at regular intervals through 48 hours post-dosing, and global impression of efficacy (seven-point scale) measured at two hours.

Results

Randomized patients who had a migraine attack (N = 140) were evaluable (ROX-828, N = 68; placebo, N = 72). Patients receiving ROX-828 showed a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in pain relief at all time points except 0.5 and 24 hours compared with those who received placebo. More patients achieved pain-free status with ROX-828 than with placebo at 1.5, 3, 4, 24 and 48 hours (p < 0.05); significance at the two-hour time point, which was the primary endpoint, was not met. Patients' global impression of efficacy showed statistically significantly better results for patients receiving ROX-828 than for those receiving placebo. Associated migraine symptoms were significantly improved (p < 0.05) with ROX-828 relative to placebo at several time points throughout the observation period. The most frequently reported adverse events in both groups were associated with nasal discomfort.

Conclusion

Self-administered intranasal ROX-828 was well tolerated. While the primary endpoint was not met, the results provide preliminary evidence that ROX-828 improves migraine pain.

Emergency department analgesia — ketorolac versus acetaminophen-codeine randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrolled a convenience sample of 122 at 6 EDs, with patients receiving either ketorolac 10 mg orally or acetaminophen-codeine 600mg acetaminophen, 60mg codeine; subjects were evaluated at 30 and 60 min and then hourly until 6 h, study medication was given every 4 to 6 h, and pain and functional capacity were assessed for up to 7 days with telephone follow-up on day 3 or 4 and final in-person assessment at 7 to 9 days; calculated sample size was n = 70 per group to discern a 20% difference. Ketorolac patients completed diaries for 4.4 days versus 5.2 days for acetaminophen-codeine; after day 1, 24% versus 31% reported "a lot" or "complete" relief of pain, and time to peak relief was 2.6 days for both groups. Adverse events occurred in 21 of 62 (34%) ketorolac patients and 38 of 59 (64%) acetaminophen-codeine patients, and neither agent was superior in terms of analgesic efficacy. Limitations included convenience sampling, target sample size not reached, no adjustment for within-subject correlations repeated-measures outcomes, and no intention-to-treat analysis.

### Intravenous acetaminophen is superior to ketamine for postoperative pain after abdominal hysterectomy: results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial [^0fbc3c37]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hysterectomy is the second-most-common gynecological surgery in the United States after cesarean section. Nearly 40% of American women undergo hysterectomy before the age of 60 years. Of the various surgical approaches to hysterectomy (abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, or open), the open abdominal approach has been correlated with relatively greater postoperative pain.

Because these surgeries are painful, optimal perioperative pain management is of utmost importance and contributes to greater patient satisfaction, fewer adverse events, shorter hospital stays, and reduction in health care costs. Pain management can take many forms. Although systemic opioid analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) remain at the forefront of pain management, this class of medications is associated with multiple common adverse reactions (pruritus, nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory complications, urinary retention, and altered mentation). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ketamine, acetaminophen, and local anesthetics have all been reported to reduce postoperative opioid consumption.–

Although oral and rectal forms of acetaminophen have been in use for decades, intravenous (IV) acetaminophen has only recently become available. Despite its recent introduction, it has become a routine analgesic in operating rooms and inpatient wards. Its analgesic action has not been fully elucidated, but evidence suggests that it is mediated by both cannabinoid and serotonergic pathways in the central nervous system and, to a lesser degree, though peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. It also lowers fever by acting directly on the thermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus.–Intravenous acetaminophen has been shown to have significant opioid-sparing effects for a multitude of surgical procedures, including abdominal hysterectomies. Clinical studies have suggested that 1 g IV acetaminophen is as effective as 30 mg IV ketorolac (NSAID) or 10 mg intramuscular morphine, but no study has compared the analgesic efficacy of IV acetaminophen with the efficacy of IV ketamine.

Ketamine is an anesthetic agent used for anesthesia, sedation, and analgesia. As an N-methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine reduces the sensitivity of the central nervous system to painful stimuli. In this study, we hypothesized that IV acetaminophen would be more effective than IV ketamine as an analgesic and would have significantly lower sedation scores and fewer adverse effects.

### Ketorolac as an analgesic in pediatric acute pain management: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c19d7a0d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pain is a common complaint in the pediatric emergency department. Ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is approved for use in adults but remains underinvestigated in pediatric patients. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ketorolac for acute pain management in children.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CENTRAL. Studies investigating the use of Ketorolac for acute pain in children were included. We followed the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (version 5.1.0).

Results

Twenty-four studies were included in this systematic review. The mean change in pain scores with Ketorolac was -2.06 (95% CI: -5.01 to 0.88, P < 0.01). The pooled rate of pain freedom at discharge in 103 patients across 3 studies was 66.06% (95% CI: 49.64–82.47, P = 0.02). The pooled rate of discharge from the emergency department in 130 patients across three studies was 85.34% (95% CI: 58.83–100, P < 0.01). The pooled rate of gastrointestinal adverse events in 267 patients across four studies was 1.53% (95% CI: 0.00–3.39, P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Ketorolac appears to be a safe and effective option for managing acute pain in the pediatric population. The results indicate significant pain reduction and a relatively low risk of adverse events. However, randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate these findings and establish appropriate dosing regimens.

### Postoperative ketorolac tromethamine use in infants aged 6–18 months: the effect on morphine usage, safety assessment, and stereo-specific pharmacokinetics [^b195918d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have been useful for treating postoperative pain in children. The only parenteral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug currently available in the United States is ketorolac tromethamine with cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 effects. Information on the pharmacokinetics of ketorolac in infants is sparse, making dosing difficult. Ketorolac is administered as a racemic mixture with the S(-) isomer responsible for the analgesic effect. In this study, we describe the population pharmacokinetics of ketorolac in a group of 25 infants and toddlers who received a single IV administration of racemic ketorolac and evaluate the potential influence of patient covariates on ketorolac disposition.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, ketorolac pharmacokinetic, safety, and analgesic effects were studied in 37 infants and toddlers (aged 6–18 mo) postoperatively. On postoperative day 1, infants were randomized to receive placebo, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg ketorolac as a 10-min IV infusion. Blood samples were collected up to 12-h after dosing. The data were analyzed using noncompartmental and compartmental (nonlinear mixed-effects model) means. The patient covariates, including body weight, age, and surgical procedure, were analyzed in a stepwise fashion to identify their potential influence on ketorolac pharmacokinetics.

Results

The data were best described by a two-compartmental model. Inclusion of covariates did not significantly decrease the nonlinear mixed-effects model objective function values and between-subject variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters of nested models. The mean and standard error of the estimates of the R(+) isomer were central volume of distribution 1200 ± 163 mL (coefficient of variation of interindividual variability, 13.6%), peripheral volume of distribution 828 ± 108 mL (13.0%), clearance from the central compartment 7.52 ± 0.7 mL/min (9.3%), and extrapolated elimination half-life 238 ± 48 min. Those of the S(-) isomer were 2320 ± 34 (14.6%), 224 ± 193 mL (86.2%), 45.3 ± 5.5 mL/min (12.1%), and 50 ± 42 min respectively. Dosing simulations, using population pharmacokinetic parameters, showed no accumulation of S(-) ketorolac but steady increases in R(+) ketorolac. Safety assessment showed no adverse effects on renal or hepatic function tests, surgical drain output, or continuous oximetry between placebo and ketorolac groups. Cumulative morphine administration showed large interpatient variability and was not different between groups.

Conclusion

The stereo-isomer-specific clearance of ketorolac in infants and toddlers (aged 6–18 mo) shows rapid elimination of the analgesic S(-) isomer. No adverse effects on surgical drain output, oximetry measured saturations, renal or hepatic function tests were seen. Simulation of single dosing at 0.5 or 1 mg/kg every 4 or 6 h does not lead to accumulation of S(-) ketorolac, the analgesic isomer, but does result in increases in R(+) ketorolac. Shorter dose intervals may be needed in infants older than 6 mo.

### Ketorolac in the era of cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a systematic review of efficacy, side effects, and regulatory issues [^cf108d74]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The recent introduction of oral COX-2 selective NSAIDs with potential for perioperative use, and the ongoing development of intravenous formulations, stimulated a systemic review of efficacy, side effects, and regulatory issues related to ketorolac for management of postoperative analgesia.

Design

To examine the opioid dose sparing effect of ketorolac, we compiled published, randomized controlled trials of ketorolac versus placebo, with opioids given for breakthrough pain, published in English-language journals from 1986–2001. Odds ratios were computed to assess whether the use of ketorolac reduced the incidence of opioid side effects or improved the quality of analgesia.

Results

Depending on the type of surgery, ketorolac reduced opioid dose by a mean of 36% (range 0% to 73%). Seventy percent of patients in control groups experienced moderate-severe pain 1 hour postoperatively, while 36% of the control patients had moderate to severe pain 24 hours postoperatively. Analgesia was improved in patients receiving ketorolac in combination with opioids. However, we did not find a concomitant reduction in opioid side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting). This may be due to studies having inadequate (to small) sample sizes to detect differences in the incidence of opioid related side effects. The risk for adverse events with ketorolac increases with high doses, with prolonged therapy (> 5 days), or invulnerable patients (e.g. the elderly). The incidence of serious adverse events has declined since dosage guidelines were revised.

Conclusions

Ketorolac should be administered at the lowest dose necessary. Analgesics that provide effective analgesia with minimal adverse effects are needed.

Fever

The most prescribed medicines for fever were paracetamol (n = 267 of 272 (98.2%) services), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (n = 46 of 272 (16.9%) services) and metamizole (n = 15 of 272 (5.5%) services) (table 1). NSAIDs prescribed were ibuprofen, representing 11 of 48 (22.9%) prescribed NSAIDs, diclofenac (n = 7 (14.6%)) and ketorolac (n = 1 (2.1%)). In 29 (60.4%) cases, the type of NSAID prescribed was not stated (online supplemental appendix 5a).

Prescribing for fever tended to be similar across world regions except for metamizole. Metamizole was not prescribed in the UK, while 32% and 3.4% of services in the rest of Europe and the world respectively prescribed it (online supplemental appendix 5b). Prescribing for fever was similar across settings (online supplemental appendix 5c).

Thirty-seven services indicated how quickly medicines worked; 17 (45.9%) responded that they worked within 30 min and 19 (51.4%) within over 31 min. One (2.7%) service said this varied.

Out of f 201, 188 (93.5%) respondents on the effectiveness of these medicines considered them to be effective or to have some effect, while the remaining reported limited effect (10, 5%), no effect (1, 0.5%) or unclear effect (2, 1%) (online supplemental appendix 5d). There was an indication of variation in recommendations across countries regarding what to prescribe for fever.

### Lidocaine hydrochloride, ketorolac tromethamine (acunistat-30) [^84f272e1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of action

Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.

Hemodynamics

Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded.

### Ketorolac tromethamine pretreatment suppresses sufentanil-induced cough during general anesthesia induction: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^54d34f16]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the possible adverse reactions and safety of ketorolac tromethamine injection pretreatment, we compared the mean arterial pressure, heart rate and blood oxygen saturation values of the two groups of patients at different time points. The results suggest that pretreatment with ketorolac tromethamine injection does not have adverse effects on the vital signs of patients. Additionally, the results showed that the incidence of nausea, delayed recovery, dizziness, drowsiness and respiratory depression was not significantly increased when ketorolac tromethamine was used in advance, making it safe for patients. However, it is undeniable that one of the main risks of NSAIDs, such as ketorolac tromethamine, is that they may affect bleeding during and after the operation by inhibiting platelet function. However, the dosage of drugs used in this study was not large and was within the scope of reasonable use in the instructions. In addition, this study has limited the research subjects; for example, patients who had a history of peptic ulcer or bleeding, liver or kidney disease, or blood system diseases before operation were excluded. Under these premises, ketorolac tromethamine will not have a significant impact on the operation or postoperative bleeding.

There are also some deficiencies in our research. First, due to the limitation of objective conditions, we have not studied the mechanism of ketorolac tromethamine in inhibition of the cough response and cannot give more reasonable inferences about the relevant mechanisms. We describe the relevant effects objectively because there is no relevant report about ketorolac tromethamine injection or other nonsteroidal drugs inhibiting sufentanil-induced cough. Second, the pretreatment dose of ketorolac tromethamine that was used (0.5 mg/kg) may not be the most appropriate dose for ketorolac tromethamine to inhibit the sufentanil-induced cough response, but it was given according to the early postoperative analgesic dose recommended in the drug instructions. Third, our study was a single center study with a small sample size. To determine whether pretreatment with ketorolac tromethamine injection can reduce the sufentanil-induced cough response, we still need a large sample and multicenter study.

### Evidence-based guidelines for prehospital pain management: recommendations [^9dea1608]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Intravenous NSAIDs versus IV opioids — We suggest either IV NSAIDs or IV opioids for the initial management of moderate to severe pain in the prehospital setting. (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding pain severity at 15 minutes, partial, or full relief of pain, or time to analgesic effect, and the evidence did not demonstrate any clinically significant difference in pain severity at 30 or 60 minutes. The panel expressed concern that there was evidence of significant sub-therapeutic dosing of the NSAID, ketorolac, in the limited data available, and noted a small difference in cost with the intervention (NSAIDs, specifically ketorolac) being more costly than opioids; at least one study suggested that adverse events were more common with morphine, including drowsiness/sleeping and nausea/vomiting. Intravenous NSAIDs, including ketorolac, may be attractive as a first line analgesic in patients who are intolerant or allergic to opioids or who prefer a lower risk of side effects, and the panel noted that ketorolac is already in use in many EMS systems.

### Comparing the effects of ketorolac and paracetamol on postoperative pain relief after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A randomized clinical trial [^15dbb6a3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study found no association between the use of 0.5 mg/kg ketorolac and mortality, MI, or clinically important hemorrhage. These results, however, are limited by unexpected differences in the baseline characteristics of the number of on-pump CABG patients and STS risk scores. On-pump CABG means a patient placed on cardiopulmonary bypass throughout surgery. The STS risk score is intended for all patients who undergo CABG surgery and helps as a prognosticator of postoperative mortality.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First; the sample size was small second; this study was single-centered. We recommended future trials with a large sample size, multi-center and long duration of follow-up.

### Comparing the efficacy of combining ketorolac and paracetamol (acetaminophen) with paracetamol alone on postoperative pain after laminectomy. A double-blinded randomized clinical trial [^4875d915]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

As for the comparison of different analgesic drugs, especially comparing paracetamol with NSAIDs, no significant differences were reported. However, recent studies have shown that a multimodal therapeutic approach, which involves the use of several analgesic drugs in combination, can be a preferable and beneficial approach to controlling postoperative pain.

However, there are still insufficient and confirmed sources about the synergistic and combined effect of paracetamol and NSAIDs, and the effect has not been tested and proven in all types of surgery. Furthermore, there is a hypothesis that the effectiveness may depend on the type of therapeutic procedure and may not have significant effective results for all surgeries. These uncertainties and limitations highlight the need for further research in this area.

Considering that more research is needed on the effectiveness of this approach Paracetamol is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of acute pain. And also, according to Guan et al.'s study, a meta‑analysis of randomized controlled trials on the safety and efficacy of Ketorolac as a postoperative pain management in lumbar spine surgery.

Ketorolac is an NSAID that belongs to the class of heteroaryl acetic acid derivatives. It is a non-selective COX inhibitor used as an analgesic. Ketorolac is administered as its tromethamine salt orally, intramuscularly, intravenously, and as a topical ophthalmic solution.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of combined drug therapy of paracetamol and ketorolac with paracetamol alone as a postoperative pain relief approach after the Laminectomy surgery. To our knowledge, there is no study that compares the efficacy of combining the two drugs Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) and Ketorolac with Paracetamol.

### A review of the use of ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% in the treatment of post-surgical inflammation following cataract and refractive surgery [^e1fe5ad5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% ophthalmic solution, a recent reformulation containing 20% less active ingredient that the original formulation, is indicated for the reduction of ocular pain and burning/stinging following corneal refractive surgery. Clinical studies have shown ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% to be as effective as ketorolac tromethamine 0.5% to control inflammation after cataract surgery including prevention of cystoid macular edema (CME). Its efficacy to inhibit miosis during cataract surgery as well as its role in the treatment of dry eye has been reported. The purpose of this paper is to review the use of ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% in the treatment of post-surgical inflammation following cataract and refractive surgery.

### Perioperative NSAIDs and long-term outcomes after cancer surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4967dbef]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Dose and Duration

Due to inconsistency between studies, it was difficult for this review to draw conclusions on optimal dose or duration. In ketorolac use, more favourable outcomes were seen in studies which looked at a single dose rather than multiple doses, where no effect was seen. However, the timings of these doses could be responsible for this trend, rather than dosage, as single doses were all intraoperative and multiple doses all postoperative. Dosage also appeared to be dependent on patient factors such as weight and renal function. Further research will be required to identify any dose-dependent difference in outcomes.

### Interventions for the prevention or treatment of epidural-related maternal fever: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4834f53e]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The evidence in this review has several limitations, the most significant of which is the level of bias within included studies. All but seven studies were assessed as raising high or some concerns regarding risk of bias, most commonly because they failed to undertake or report intention-to-treat analyses. A large number of included studies suffered participant attrition, either through post-randomisation exclusions or deviations from intended interventions. A sensitivity analysis, excluding trials at high risk of bias, reduced the overall treatment effect of methods of reduced dose epidural, indicating that the presence of bias was likely to have influenced the results of this review. An explanation for this may be that because of inconsistent reporting across studies, results from intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were combined for the meta-analysis. It can be argued that strict intention-to-treat analysis is inappropriate in obstetric trials because of increased susceptibility to participant attrition and crossover between trial arms. Per-protocol or similar analysis may yield useful information in the context of an intervention which has lower analgesic effectiveness and therefore more susceptible to participant adherence and attrition from original group allocation. However, trials that deviate from an intention-to-treat can overestimate treatment effects, so it is highly likely that combining the results of intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses has introduced bias into the quantitative synthesis.

A challenge faced by all trials involving the perinatal period is the necessary time-sensitive nature of recruitment of women who may be distressed, anxious, and in pain. Typically, women are recruited for perinatal research once they are in labour and are eligible but this has ethical implications for informed consent as women may not have enough time to understand the trial information and associated risks so may erode relationships between the caregivers and the parturient if recruitment is not handled appropriately. In regard to trials of epidural analgesia, Jackson and colleaguesconcluded that labouring women have an understanding of epidural risks, and this is not influenced by labour pain, anxiety, or duration of labour. However, when evaluating epidural risks the women is also anticipating a major benefit in the form of adequate pain relief which may influence the decision to provide informed consent. Two trials in this review attempted to avoid these ethical challenges of recruiting women in active labour by instead recruiting participants antenatally, an approach recommended by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists. However, this meant allocation concealment was not possible and both trials suffered participant attrition and crossover between trial arms as a consequence.

### Comparative effectiveness of ketorolac dosing strategies for emergency department patients with acute pain [^f8bdb453]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Ketorolac is a commonly used nonopioid parenteral analgesic for treating emergency department (ED) patients with acute pain. Our systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence by comparing the efficacy and safety of differing ketorolac dosing strategies for acute pain relief in the ED.

Methods

The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022310062). We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and unpublished sources from inception through December 9, 2022. We included randomized control trials of patients presenting with acute pain to the ED, comparing ketorolac doses less than 30 mg (low dose) to ketorolac doses more than or equal to 30 mg (high dose) for the outcomes of pain scores after treatment need for rescue analgesia, and incidence of adverse events. We excluded patients in non-ED settings, including postoperative settings. We extracted data independently and in duplicate and pooled them using a random-effects model. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

Results

This review included 5 randomized controlled trials (n = 627 patients). Low-dose parenteral ketorolac (15 to 20 mg), as compared to high-dose ketorolac (≥ 30 mg), probably has no effect on pain scores (mean difference 0.05 mm lower on 100 mm visual analog scale, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.91 mm to +5.01 mm; moderate certainty). Further, low-dose ketorolac at 10 mg may have no effect on pain scores compared to high-dose ketorolac (mean difference 1.58 mm lower on 100 mm visual analog scale, 95% CI -8.86 mm to +5.71 mm; low certainty). Low-dose ketorolac may increase the need for rescue analgesia (risk ratio 1.27, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.87; low certainty) and may have no difference on rates of adverse events (risk ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.33; low certainty).

Conclusion

In adult ED patients with acute pain, parenteral ketorolac given at doses of 10 mg to 20 mg is probably as effective in relieving pain as doses of 30 mg or higher. Low-dose ketorolac may have no effect on adverse events, but these patients may require more rescue analgesia. This evidence is limited by imprecision and is not generalizable to children or those at higher risk of adverse events.

### Sublingual hyoscyamine sulfate in combination with ketorolac tromethamine for ureteral colic: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^6d898690]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of hyoscyamine sulfate in combination with ketorolac tromethamine for the reduction of pain in emergency department patients with ureteral colic.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study at 2 EDs with residency programs in emergency medicine. Patients were at least 18 years old and presented to the ED with an initial history and physical examination consistent with ureteral colic. Patients received a single intravenous dose of 30 mg of ketorolac tromethamine given over a 1-minute period with either a single sublingual dose of 0.125 mg of hyoscyamine sulfate or a placebo. If inadequate analgesia was noted after 30 minutes, a standard dose of meperidine could be administered for rescue. All other treatments including intravenous fluids and antiemetics were standardized. The main study outcome was change in visual analog scale pain score from baseline to 30 minutes.

Results

Seventy-two patients were evaluated for inclusion. Thirteen patients who had self-administered pain medications within 4 hours of presentation were excluded before randomization. Sixteen patients who did not have a renal calculus confirmed by either intravenous urogram or helical computed tomography were also excluded from efficacy analysis. There did not appear to be any clinically important differences in the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. The repeated-measures analysis of the remaining 43 patients showed no clinically important difference in pain score using the visual analog scale at any time point. There were no clinically important differences between the 2 study groups for amount of rescue meperidine administered or end-of-study global satisfaction scores.

Conclusion

Hyoscyamine sulfate did not provide any additional pain relief from ureteral colic when administered with ketorolac tromethamine. There was no clinically important difference in change of pain scores at 30 minutes in patients with ureteral colic receiving supplemental hyoscyamine sulfate.

Risk of bias

The risk of bias across studies was variable (Fig 2). Full explanations for the risk of bias judgements are included in Supplementary file 4. No studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias.

Fig 2
Risk of bias of individual studies.

Thirty trials reported appropriate allocation sequence generation, using either a computer-based random number generator or random number tables, or a web-based randomisation programme, and the remaining four trials did not provide information on the randomisation. Twenty-one trials concealed the allocation sequence until participants were assigned to intervention by using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, and two trials, reported using identical preparations of the study drugs. Ten trials did not provide any information on allocation concealment, and one trial stated that allocation was not concealed at all. Twenty trials stated that participants were blinded. The clinical teams and clinicians delivering the intervention were blinded in 15. It was unclear whether participants and clinical teams were blinded in oneand six, trials, respectively. In the remaining 13 trials, all participants and clinical teams were aware of the assigned intervention groups.

Trials did not perform intention-to-treat analysis, and therefore suffered attrition bias, if participants were excluded after randomisation; usually if they delivered via Caesarean section or within 2 h of the trial intervention, or if they did not receive the trial intervention they were randomised to. In seven trials these post-randomisation exclusions were balanced between treatment groups, but in two of these more than 25% of participants were excluded from the final analysis. In three trials more participants were excluded in the intervention group, and another four trials excluded more from the control group. Two trials which both compared the intervention intravenous remifentanil PCA to epidural analgesia suffered more crossover from the intervention to control group rather than vice versa, meaning across these two trials 285 of 516 participants did not receive the intervention they were randomised to. Finally, one trial with four treatment arms did not include a CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) diagram, so it was unclear from which treatment groups participants were excluded.

### Comparative efficacy of therapeutics for chronic cancer pain: a Bayesian network meta-analysis [^34a15bdf]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

A total of 40 nodes were included in our global efficacy network meta-analysis, with each node representing a unique intervention or placebo (Fig 2B). The nodes with the most direct interactions in the network were placebo (23 interactions), morphine ER (eight interactions), and codeine plus aspirin (five interactions; Fig 2B). The model fit was good (Data Supplement). Pooled network OR values indicate that lidocaine (network OR, 0.04; 95% CrI, 0.01 to 0.18), codeine plus aspirin (network OR, 0.22; 95% CrI, 0.08 to 0.63), pregabalin (network OR, 0.29; 95% CrI, 0.08 to 0.92), ketorolac tromethamine (network OR, 0.29; 95% CrI, 0.08 to 0.99), and ketoprofen (network OR, 0.32; 95% CrI, 0.10 to 0.97) showed significantly superior global efficacy over placebo (Data Supplement). SUCRA analysis provided a ranking of each medication class according to its global efficacy (Data Supplement). The top-ranked interventions for global efficacy were lidocaine (SUCRA score, 98.1), codeine plus aspirin (SUCRA score, 81.1), and pregabalin (SUCRA score, 73.8; Fig 2C).

τ² estimates indicate no significant statistical heterogeneity, and no significant loop inconsistency was observed (Data Supplement). There was evidence of significant publication bias (Data Supplement).

### Comparison of intravenous ketorolac and meperidine in the treatment of biliary colic [^4643cbf3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To compare the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of intravenous (IV) ketorolac tromethamine with IV meperidine in the treatment of biliary colic, a prospective, randomized, double blind study was carried out upon a convenience sample of patients at a large inner city facility. Patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years of age with a history and physical examination consistent with biliary colic were enrolled over a 2-year period. Patients were randomly assigned to receive ketorolac 30 mg IV or meperidine 50 mg IV. Pain was quantified using a 4-point verbal rating system (VRS) as well as a visual analog scale (VAS). Patients were queried about their pain at times 0, 12 h, 1 h, and 2 h after administration of the study medication. Adverse effects were also recorded. A total of 324 patients completed the study protocol with 175 patients receiving ketorolac and 149 receiving meperidine. Patient demographics were similar for both groups with mean age for the ketorolac group of 36.1 years and for the meperidine group of 34.6 years. Both groups were predominantly Latino and over 80% of patients in both groups were female. No significant difference in pain control was found between ketorolac and meperidine in either the VAS or VRS for any time interval studied. The mean change in the VAS at time 2 h was 6.2 cm ± 3.6 cm for the ketorolac group, compared with 6.7 cm ± 3.6 cm for the meperidine group (p = 0.25). Although no significant difference was found in overall drug tolerability, patients receiving meperidine reported higher incidences of nausea and of dizziness than those receiving ketorolac (p = 0.009 and 0.003, respectively). Ketorolac tromethamine is a well-tolerated, effective medication in the treatment of acute biliary colic. It showed similar efficacy to meperidine with a decreased number of adverse effects.

### Ketorolac tromethamine [^ad140641]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Inform pregnant women to avoid use of ketorolac tromethamine and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with ketorolac tromethamine is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy).

Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.

Drug Interactions

Ketorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%). There is no evidence in animal or human studies that ketorolac tromethamine induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.

Warfarin, Digoxin, Salicylate, and Heparin

The in vitro binding of warfarin to plasma proteins is only slightly reduced by ketorolac tromethamine (99.5% control vs 99.3%) when ketorolac plasma concentrations reach 5 to 10 mcg/mL. Ketorolac does not alter digoxin protein binding. In vitro studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of salicylate (300 mcg/mL), the binding of ketorolac was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels. Therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, warfarin, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, acetaminophen, phenytoin and tolbutamide did not alter ketorolac tromethamine protein binding.

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^8904eb1f]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Patient population: demographics, exposure, and indications

For the purposes of this analysis, the safety population consisted of 1,752 adults who received at least one dose of any study drug. IV ibuprofen was administered to 1,220 (69.6%) patients, 452 (25.8%) received placebo, and 80 (4.6%) received IV ketorolac as an active control. Of the 1,220 subjects that received IV ibuprofen, 173 were treated for fever and 1,087 were treated for pain, with 40 of these patients being treated for both indications. Reasons for pain were both nonsurgical (N = 100) and surgical (N = 987) (Figure 1). The etiologies of nonsurgical pain included, for example, abdominal, back, and burn and are summarized elsewhere. Surgeries were predominantly gynecological or orthopedic in nature, and the most common procedure was hysterectomy (36.4%, Table 2).

The mean age in years was similar between the treatment groups, 47 for patients receiving IV ibuprofen, 44 for placebo, and 46 in the active control group (Table 3). While the majority of the study population were between the ages of 18 and 65 years (89%) and female (67%), there were 187 who were 65 years or older (defined as "elderly"). Of those patients ≥ 65 years, 146 received IV ibuprofen, 34 received placebo, and 7 received IV ketorolac. Patient age was similarly distributed between all treatment groups (Figure 2). The average weight was also similar between the treatment groups (range: 82.5–88.5 kg).

On average, patients of either age stratum were treated with IV ibuprofen for 2 days with a maximum duration of 6 days (Table 4). The mean dose of IV ibuprofen received over the course of treatment was 2,860 mg, and the maximum received was 16,000 mg. The distribution of the most common, average, cumulative amount of IV ibuprofen received was biphasic with the highest proportions of patients receiving either 400–1,200 mg or 2,400–4,800 mg (37% each) during their hospitalization. Adults aged 18–64 years and elderly patients received similar amounts of IV ibuprofen for a similar duration.

Overall, 68% of patients received more than one dose of IV ibuprofen during their hospitalization, with five doses being the most common and 20 doses being the maximum (Table 4). The majority of patients were on an 800 mg regimen (78%).

### A double-blind, randomized comparison of intramuscularly and intravenously administered parecoxib sodium versus ketorolac and placebo in a post-oral surgery pain model [^6b56e025]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Parecoxib sodium is an injectable cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor developed for the treatment of acute pain. The analgesic efficacy of IV and IM parecoxib has been demonstrated in previous pilot studies using the post-oral surgery pain model.

Objective

This study was conducted to characterize the analgesic efficacy of parecoxib in healthy adults after oral surgery while comparing the efficacy and tolerability of the IV and IM routes of administration.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled, single-dose, single-center trial. Patients experiencing moderate to severe post-operative pain after the extraction of ≥ 2 impacted third molars were randomized to receive parecoxib sodium 20 mg IM, 20 mg IV, 40 mg IM, or 40 mg IV; ketorolac tromethamine 60 mg IM; or placebo. Patients assessed pain intensity and pain relief (PR) at baseline and at designated intervals for 24 hours after administration of study medication or until rescue medication was taken. Analgesic efficacy was assessed in terms of time-specific pain intensity difference (PID) and PR, time to onset of analgesia, and time to use of rescue medication.

Results

Three hundred four patients were randomized to treatment. Parecoxib sodium 20 and 40 mg IM or IV and ketorolac 60 mg IM were significantly superior to placebo in PID, PR, time to onset of analgesia, and time to use of rescue medication (P ≤ 0.05). Equal IV and IM doses of parecoxib were comparable on these measures; however, time to use of rescue medication was longer with IM compared with IV administration. Both doses of parecoxib were comparable to ketorolac 60 mg IM in time to onset of analgesia, but parecoxib 40 mg had a significantly longer duration of action (P ≤ 0.05). The few statistically significant differences in PID and PR between parecoxib 40 mg and ketorolac favored ketorolac versus parecoxib 40 mg IV at earlier time points and parecoxib 40 mg IM versus ketorolac at later time points (P ≤ 0.05). All treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Parecoxib IV and IM provided effective analgesia. The 40-mg dose was comparable to ketorolac 60 mg on most measures of analgesia but had a longer duration of action.
