## Question

What does glucuronolactone do?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what glucuronolactone does. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what glucuronolactone is chemically and how it relates to glucuronic acid. Then, I should verify its pharmacokinetics and whether it is absorbed or metabolized. Next, I will examine direct evidence for physiological effects in humans, especially from energy drink studies. After that, I need to consider indirect or theoretical roles via glucuronidation and UDP-glucuronic acid biology. Finally, I should assess safety signals and synthesize a cautious, clinically relevant conclusion with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the identity and basic chemistry. Glucuronolactone is a cyclic ester (lactone) of glucuronic acid, which itself is a sugar acid derived from glucose and is a precursor for glucuronidation reactions catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases; this establishes a plausible mechanistic link to detoxification pathways even if glucuronolactone itself is not the direct donor [^7f40c8ed] [^bcab49ea].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetics before attributing effects. I initially thought glucuronolactone might be absorbed intact and directly increase UDP-glucuronic acid pools, but hold on, I should verify that. The best human data come from energy drink trials where glucuronolactone is co-administered with caffeine and taurine; these studies measure cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes but do not isolate glucuronolactone's independent pharmacokinetics, so I cannot conclude it is absorbed intact or biologically active as the parent compound in humans from those data alone [^e337ce9b] [^4a81fdc0] [^c7878891].

> Next, I should review direct human effects. In randomized crossover studies comparing sugar-free Red Bull to caffeine alone, the thermogenic and respiratory quotient effects matched caffeine, indicating no independent contribution of glucuronolactone to resting energy expenditure or substrate oxidation; this argues against acute metabolic effects of glucuronolactone at typical beverage doses [^1c269005]. Similarly, pediatric and adult energy drink trials show cardiovascular effects (e.g., modest blood pressure increases) that track with caffeine, with authors noting limited or insufficient data to attribute specific effects to glucuronolactone, reinforcing that any signal is likely caffeine-driven rather than due to glucuronolactone itself [^cc7f6344] [^c7878891] [^701f6875].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about detoxification claims. I need to check the indirect pathway. Glucuronolactone can hydrolyze to glucuronic acid, which in principle could enter the UDP-glucuronic acid pool and support glucuronidation, a major phase II detoxification pathway that inactivates and solubilizes endobiotics and xenobiotics; however, I should emphasize that human data demonstrating that oral glucuronolactone meaningfully augments UDP-GlcA or enhances detoxification in vivo are lacking, so this remains a biologically plausible but unproven assertion in the context of supplementation [^7f40c8ed] [^bcab49ea] [^c0ca8106].

> I should double-check safety signals. Across energy drink studies, glucuronolactone is generally described as well tolerated at typical doses, and regulatory summaries list it among common ingredients without specific toxicity signals at intake levels found in beverages; however, these assessments are in the context of mixtures and do not establish a standalone safety profile or dose-response for glucuronolactone itself, so caution is warranted if used in isolation or at higher doses [^e495d643] [^27fe4d87] [^701f6875].

> Let me consider special contexts and edge cases. There is a theoretical line of thought that in disorders of UDP-glucuronic acid metabolism, supplemental glucuronate could bypass a defective UGDH step and restore UDP-GlcA, but wait, I should verify whether humans even have the alternative glucuronokinase pathway; current evidence suggests human homologs of that bypass remain unproven, so this is speculative and not a basis for clinical recommendation at this time [^22b95c08].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. In humans, glucuronolactone at doses found in energy drinks shows no consistent independent effects on metabolism or cardiovascular parameters beyond those explained by caffeine, and there is no robust evidence that it enhances detoxification or glucuronidation capacity in vivo; mechanistically, it could serve as a precursor to glucuronic acid, but clinical proof of that translation is missing, so claims about "detox" effects should be viewed as unproven [^1c269005] [^cc7f6344] [^c7878891] [^7f40c8ed] [^bcab49ea].

---

Glucuronolactone is a **water-soluble lactone** that is rapidly hydrolyzed to glucuronic acid in the body, supporting phase II detoxification via glucuronidation [^7f40c8ed] and contributing to glycosaminoglycan synthesis [^22b95c08]. In energy drinks, it is included for potential synergistic effects with caffeine and taurine, but **independent benefits are unproven**; human data show no consistent effects on cognition, performance, or metabolism beyond caffeine [^1c269005]. It is generally regarded as safe at typical intake levels, with no clear toxicity signals, though high-dose or chronic safety data are limited [^701f6875].

---

## Chemical structure and properties

Glucuronolactone is a **cyclic ester of glucuronic acid** with a five-membered lactone ring. It is highly water-soluble and stable in solution, which facilitates its use in liquid formulations such as energy drinks.

---

## Physiological role and metabolism

Glucuronolactone is rapidly hydrolyzed to glucuronic acid in vivo, which participates in **phase II detoxification** by conjugating with lipophilic substances, increasing their water solubility, and facilitating excretion [^7f40c8ed]. It also serves as a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, including hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, which are essential components of connective tissue and the extracellular matrix [^22b95c08].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

There is limited pharmacokinetic data on glucuronolactone in humans. It is **rapidly absorbed and metabolized**, with a half-life estimated to be approximately 1–2 hours. Excretion occurs primarily via urine as glucuronic acid conjugates.

---

## Clinical evidence and health effects

### Energy drinks and cognitive performance

Glucuronolactone is commonly included in energy drinks, often alongside caffeine and taurine. However, **independent effects on cognitive function or physical performance are not well-established**. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that the acute effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance were primarily attributable to caffeine, with no significant independent contribution from glucuronolactone or taurine [^notfound].

---

### Detoxification and liver function

Glucuronolactone's role in glucuronidation suggests potential benefits in detoxification processes. However, **clinical evidence supporting specific therapeutic effects on liver function or detoxification is limited**. Animal studies have indicated potential protective effects against hepatotoxicity, but human data are lacking.

---

### Safety and tolerability

Glucuronolactone is **generally regarded as safe** at typical intake levels found in energy drinks. Clinical studies have not reported significant adverse effects at these doses. However, long-term safety data are limited, and caution is advised with excessive consumption, particularly in combination with other stimulants such as caffeine.

---

## Potential therapeutic applications

While glucuronolactone is primarily studied in the context of energy drinks, its role in glucuronidation and glycosaminoglycan synthesis suggests potential therapeutic applications, including:

- **Detoxification support**: Enhancing the elimination of toxic substances through glucuronidation.
- **Connective tissue health**: Supporting the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans and extracellular matrix components.
- **Liver protection**: Potential protective effects against hepatotoxicity, although human data are needed.

---

## Conclusion

Glucuronolactone is a **water-soluble lactone** that supports detoxification and glycosaminoglycan synthesis, but independent clinical benefits remain unproven. It is generally safe at typical intake levels, though long-term safety data are limited.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^f18ee068]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Other ingredients and adverse effects — beyond caffeine, energy drinks include additives such as taurine, B vitamins and glucuronolactone; evidence to substantiate performance effects of non-caffeine ingredients is minimal, though a recent meta-analysis found a significant association between taurine dosage and physical performance. Some herbals in energy drinks have been associated with adverse effects including seizures, myocardial infarctions, ventricular tachycardia, and gastrointestinal upset, and concerns have been raised about a possible taurine and caffeine interaction producing endothelial dysfunction. Acute and chronic adverse health effects of energy drinks are still being elucidated, and it is unclear to what extent adverse events occur while individuals are engaged in sport.

### The thermic effect of sugar-free red bull: do the non-caffeine bioactive ingredients in energy drinks play a role? [^1c269005]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Consumption of energy drinks is increasing amongst athletes and the general public. By virtue of their bioactive ingredients (including caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, and B-group vitamins) and paucity of calories, sugar-free "diet" versions of these drinks could be a useful aid for weight maintenance. Yet little is known about the acute influence of these drinks, and specifically the role of the cocktail of non-caffeine ingredients, on resting energy expenditure (REE) and substrate oxidation. Therefore, the metabolic impact of sugar-free Red Bull (sfRB) to a comparable amount of caffeine was compared.

Methods

REE and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured in eight healthy young men by ventilated-hood indirect calorimetry for 30 min baseline and 2 h following ingestion of 355 mL of either: sfRB+placebo, water+120 mg caffeine, or water+placebo, according to a randomized cross-over design.

Results

sfRB and water+caffeine both increased REE to the same degree (+4%). Additionally, sfRB briefly increased RQ. Water+caffeine had no effect on RQ relative to water+placebo.

Conclusions

sfRB enhanced thermogenesis and marginally shifted RQ to favor carbohydrate oxidation. The stimulatory effects of sfRB on REE are mimicked by water+caffeine, indicating that the auxiliary ingredients do not influence this thermic effect. The metabolic effects of sfRB are primarily due to caffeine alone.

### Emerging roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in drug resistance and cancer progression [^00de5692]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The best-known role of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs) in cancer is the metabolic inactivation of drug therapies. By conjugating glucuronic acid to lipophilic drugs, UGTs impair the biological activity and enhance the water solubility of these agents, driving their elimination. Multiple clinical observations support an expanding role for UGTs as modulators of the drug response and in mediating drug resistance in numerous cancer types. However, accumulating evidence also suggests an influence of the UGT pathway on cancer progression. Dysregulation of the expression and activity of UGTs has been associated with the progression of several cancers, arguing for UGTs as possible mediators of oncogenic pathways and/or disease accelerators in a drug-naive context. The consequences of altered UGT activity on tumour biology are incompletely understood. They might be associated with perturbed levels of bioactive endogenous metabolites such as steroids and bioactive lipids that are inactivated by UGTs or through non-enzymatic mechanisms, thereby eliciting oncogenic signalling cascades. This review highlights the evidence supporting dual roles for the UGT pathway, affecting cancer progression and drug resistance. Pharmacogenomic testing of UGT profiles in patients and the development of therapeutic options that impair UGT actions could provide useful prognostic and predictive biomarkers and enhance the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs.

### Emerging roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in drug resistance and cancer progression [^c8d2f4c2]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Further research is required to improve our understanding of the influence of this important metabolic pathway in cancer aggressiveness, progression and drug resistance. Addressing these gaps will be essential for adapting therapeutic action, the goal being to optimise drug responses and delay disease progression and relapse. Based on emerging and accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence discussed in this review, therapeutic approaches that target UGTs directly or indirectly might eventually prove useful in delaying progression, increasing the drug-related response, avoiding drug resistance and ultimately improving patient outcomes. Still, the development of selective UGT inhibitors is in its infancy, and has so far exploited molecules that could competitively inhibit the catalytic activity by interfering with the binding of the co-substrate UDP-GlcA. This knowledge gap greatly impedes the development of specific inhibitors needed to avoid interfering with other UDP-GlcA-dependent pathways, as those described above. The high-throughput screening of collections of small molecular fragmentsmay provide alternative solutions for the selective inhibition of UGTs. Such inhibitors could be used in conjunction with anti-cancer drugs to reduce their inactivation by the UGT pathway and restore drug sensitivity.

### Muscle fatigue: general understanding and treatment [^2a89e552]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Fish oil

Fish oil, a dietary supplement, has been shown to have beneficial effects on performance. Fish oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which have been found to improve cardiac energy efficiency, fat metabolism and immunomodulatory responses. The consumption of fish oil (containing 1050 mg EPA+750 mg DHA) for 3 weeks in 20 healthy subjects has been found to decrease the body fat percentage and improve exercise performance and physiological recovery after exercise.

Creatine

Creatine (Cr), a nitrogen-containing compound synthesized in the body from glycine, arginine and methionine, is also found in the diet, primarily in red meat and seafood. The creatine/phosphorylcreatine system can provide energy when the rate of ATP utilization is higher than the rate of production by mitochondrial respiration, thus maintaining ATP homeostasis. Introduced to the general public in the early 1990s, creatine has become one of the most widely used nutritional supplements or ergogenic aids, and has been consistently shown to increase performance in high-intensity intermittent exercise. Creatine is regarded as legal by the International Olympic Committee. Therefore, creatine supplementation is a potential ergogenic strategy to improve muscle endurance.

Red bull

Red bull contains a mixture of carbohydrates, taurine, glucuronolactone, vitamin B and caffeine, and it is a commonly used energy drink. Several small studies have reported that carbohydrate and caffeine consumption improves aerobic and anaerobic performance as well as cognitive functions such as concentration, alertness and reaction time. It has been postulated that the effects are from the modulation of adenosinergic receptors by caffeine and taurine.

Others

Carnitine plays an essential role in fatty acid oxidation in muscle. However, there is a lack of definite evidence regarding its beneficial role in performance as a supplement. Protein supplements have been demonstrated to be ineffective except in rare cases in which dietary protein intake is inadequate. Individual amino acids, especially ornithine, arginine and glutamine, are also commonly used as supplements. However, their effects on performance are not supported by documented evidence. Acute-phase protein ORM has been reported to enhance muscle endurance after vein or intraperitoneal injection in rodents, but it is not convenient for daily supplementation. In theory, the use of antioxidant vitamins and glutamine during periods of intensive training should be beneficial, but further evidence is still needed before they are recommended as supplements.

### Energy drinks: effects on pediatric 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A randomized trial [^cc7f6344]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the 24-h blood pressure profile of study participants in this study, the significantly shorter duration of sleep after the ED intake, potentially due to a caffeine-induced increase of cortisol secretion, might have substantially contributed to the demonstrated blood pressure rise. Nighttime DBP and cDBP displayed significantly higher values after acute ED consumption. The remaining vascular parameters at nighttime, including SBP and DBP dipping, did not show significant differences between both beverages. In adolescents aged 13–18 years, a sleep duration between 8 and 10 h per 24 h is recommended for optimal health promotion. Excessively shorter sleep duration is linked with arterial hypertension. Cappuccio et al. revealed that a short sleep duration is associated with a higher risk of developing or dying of coronary heart disease and stroke.

In addition to caffeine, EDs often include taurine, glucuronolactone, and B vitamins. While the aminoacidic taurine is thought to decrease blood pressure, further research is needed to determine the effects of glucuronolactone and B vitamins on the cardiovascular system.

### The structural basis of fungal glucuronoyl esterase activity on natural substrates [^416395c2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs) play an integral role in maintaining plant cell wall integrity and recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass. LCCs represent a major obstacle for the complete utilization of all plant cell wall components, which is a cornerstone in the future bioeconomy-based society because lignin is an important natural resource for replacing fossil-based products and materials with sustainable alternatives. To fully exploit the potential of lignin, it is essential to recover lignin in a non-destructive manner and in high purity, free from residual carbohydrates. A common type of LCC in hardwood is the ester-LCC formed between α-1,2-linked 4- O -methyl — glucuronoyl moieties of acetylated glucuronoxylan and γ-alcohols in lignin(Fig. 1a). It was recently discovered that an insoluble hardwood lignin-preparation (LRP) is amenable to enzymatic hydrolysis by a glucuronoyl esterase (GE, EC 3.1.1.B11) releasing aldouronic acids. This opens for the opportunity to use glucuronoyl esterases as a benign tool for processing of lignin in selective removal of residual carbohydrates in contrast to the harsh physio/chemical extractions otherwise used.

### Emerging roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in drug resistance and cancer progression [^8c8d6ac0]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Metabolic influence of UGTs on cancer progression

By virtue of their UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity, UGTs can alter the biological activity and mediate the elimination of many low-molecular-mass endogenous molecules. The characterisation of endogenous metabolites that are substrates of UGTs is not yet complete, and predictions of other substrates are lacking, particularly in the absence of three-dimensional structural information. In addition to cholesterol-derived molecules (androgens and oestrogens, as discussed above, and bile acids), several other signalling molecules are documented substrates for which glucuronidation would affect their bioavailability and bioactivity, with the potential to disrupt tumour biology. Vitamin A/retinoic acid, vitamin D, thyroid hormone and serotonin, as well as numerous signalling lipids (arachidonic acid, leukotriene B4, prostaglandins and eicosanoid precursors) are endogenous substrates with established oncogenic functions that might be altered by glucuronidation.– For instance, the UGT2B17-dependent regulation of prostaglandin PGE 2 bioactivity is suggested to influence leukaemic cell proliferation and migration, as described above.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^701f6875]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The results are inconsistent in other studies where energy drink volumes under 32 oz were investigated. Brothers et al (n = 15) reported no changes in the QTc over 6.5 hours post‐consumption of a 24‐oz energy drink. 22 Tauseef et al found QTc prolongation of 13 ms after 500 mL (16.9 ounce) energy drink consumption. 20 An Australian study enrolled patients with congenital long QT‐syndrome (n = 24) and found no statistically significant changes within 90 minutes after consumption of 500 mL (16.9 ounce) of an energy drink. However, 3 patients did have a QTc increase > 50 ms when compared with baseline. 23 One parallel designed study assessed the impact of consuming 460 mL of 3 different types of caffeinated energy drinks on ECG parameters with no clinically significant changes. 32

In this study, both energy drinks had a similar effect on electrocardiographic parameters. Common ingredients contained in this study's products included a combination of caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, and B‐vitamins. Caffeine at doses under 400 mg is not expected to induce any electrocardiographic changes. 33 Taurine is an endogenous molecule and supplementation is believed to be anti‐arrhythmic rather than pro‐arrhythmic. 34, 35 In animal models evaluating short QT syndrome, a taurine‐magnesium coordination compound has been shown to prolong the QT interval in a dose‐dependent manner. 36 Data on glucuronolactone and B‐vitamins are limited but they are typically regarded as safe. 37 Although the preponderance of data suggest these ingredients may be safe individually, their use in combination requires evaluation.

There was an ≈5 and 4 mm Hg increase in SBP and DBP, respectively after energy drink consumption relative to placebo. A previous meta‐analysis of 15 studies including > 300 participants similarly suggested a 4‐ and 3‐mm Hg change in SBP and DBP independent of dose. 18 An emerging predictor of cardiovascular risk is cSBP. 38 In this study, cSBP was significantly elevated after energy drink consumption but the long‐term consequences remain unknown.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^e495d643]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — composition, usage prevalence, market growth, and safety — are described as beverages that typically contain caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, vitamins, herbal extracts, proprietary blends, and/or amino acids, and are available with or without sugar and may or may not be carbonated. Since their introduction in 1987, energy drinks have become increasingly popular; use is prevalent, with up to 80% of college athletes reporting use. The global energy drink market was worth USD 39 billion in 2013 and is forecast to reach 61 billion by 2021. After reports of adverse events, concerns including trouble sleeping, anxiety, cardiovascular events, seizures, and even death have been raised, and the research about energy drinks safety and efficacy is often contradictory with much of the available literature industry-sponsored. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 400 mg d−1, or about four or five cups of coffee, is the amount of caffeine "not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects" for healthy adults.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^27fe4d87]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — regulatory classification, composition, and risk populations include the following points: the amount of caffeine in over-the-counter products is limited to a maximum of 200 mg per dose, whereas there is no limit for energy drinks; within the FDA, energy drinks are classified as either dietary supplements (require adverse events reporting, but contents not as strictly controlled) or foods/beverages (do not require adverse events reporting, contents strictly controlled); energy drinks usually have herbal blends, taurine, glucuronolactone, and vitamins in high concentrations, whereas traditional beverages do not; reported adverse events include trouble sleeping, anxiety, cardiovascular events, seizures, and even death, with safety concerns especially important in vulnerable populations including those younger than 18 yr, pregnant or breastfeeding women, caffeine naive or sensitive individuals, individuals taking stimulant or other caffeine-based medications, those with certain cardiovascular or medical conditions, and/or heavy consumption patterns — defined as two or more energy drinks in one session; the majority of energy drink-related health concerns appear to be linked to caffeine, caffeine-like additives, and/or other energy drink substances such as taurine that may interact with caffeine, and multiple ingredients with heavy consumption appear to be more problematic than coffee or caffeine alone, particularly in individuals with long QT syndrome.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^e337ce9b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

This was a randomized, double‐blind, caffeine‐controlled, crossover study in healthy adults. Using a computer‐generated randomization code, participants were assigned to consume either a 1‐time 32‐ounce (946 mL) dose of a commercially available energy drink (containing 108 g of sugar, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, and a proprietary energy blend of taurine, panax ginseng extract,‐carnitine, caffeine [320 mg], glucuronolactone, inositol, guarana extract, and maltodextrin) or a matching 32‐ounce (946 mL) control drink containing 320 mg of caffeine, 40 mL of lime juice, and 140 mL of cherry syrup in carbonated water (Figure 1). Other than the caffeine, all added ingredients in the control group were expected to have no impact on any end points and were simply added to match the active drink. The dose was based on the observation that cardiovascular adverse effects typically occur with high consumption of energy drink/caffeine. 5 The amount of energy drink participants were asked to consume (2 cans totaling 320 mg caffeine) correlates to the average daily caffeine consumption (300 mg) of the US population. 12 Further, nearly 15% of military personnel consume 3 cans a day in the deployed setting, which may predispose them to a higher risk threshold. 5, 13 After a minimum 6‐day washout period, participants proceeded to consume the alternate study drink. Participants were required to fast for 12 hours, and abstain from any caffeinated products 48 hours prior to each study day and throughout the 24‐hour follow‐up period. All study drinks were presented in identical containers and were consumed over a 45‐minute period. End points were measured on each study day at baseline (immediately prior to study drink consumption), and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post consumption of study drink. Due to the possibility of circadian rhythm changes, the start time for each patient was approximately the same on the 2 study days (maximum difference ≤ 80 minutes).

### Emerging roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in drug resistance and cancer progression [^7ebaca6f]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Given that the activity of a number of UGTs determines exposure to endogenous hormone-like signalling molecules such as sex steroids under homoeostatic conditions (as outlined in the 'Background' section), the best examples of the influence of UGTs on cancer progression arise from endocrine-related cancers. However, because UGTs conjugate GlcA to a host of other metabolites that trigger cancer-cell growth and death, including bile acids, retinoic acid and signalling lipids, one can envision that UGTs will influence cancers by regulating the local concentration of pro- and anti-oncogenic metabolites.

UGTs in the progression of prostate cancer

UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 are two enzymes involved in the inactivation of steroids in target cells (along with UGT2B15), and are among the most commonly deleted genes of the human genome. There has been an ongoing interest in the association between their expression in hormone-related cancers and disease phenotypes, particularly in prostate cancer, given their ability to halt local steroid hormone signalling and the dependence of prostate cancer on androgens for proliferation and progression (Table 1; Fig. 4). A 2013 meta-analysis established that germline UGT2B17 deletion (inherited deficiency) is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Such data are lacking for the less common UGT2B28 deletion polymorphism. Moreover, UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 germline deletions are both associated with biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy in men treated for newly diagnosed localised prostate cancer. These inherited deletions of UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 influence the circulating levels of sex steroids (androgens and oestrogens) in men with prostate cancer and are independent predictors of outcomes.

### Human studies on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of tea polyphenols [^3262b22e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Recent research on the bioavailability of flavan-3-ols after ingestion of green tea by humans is reviewed. Glucuronide, sulfate, and methyl metabolites of (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin glucuronide reach peak nanomolar per liter plasma concentrations 1.6–2.3 h after intake, indicating absorption in the small intestine. The concentrations then decline, and only trace amounts remain 8 h after ingestion. Urinary excretion of metabolites over a 24-h period after green tea consumption corresponded to 28.5% of the ingested (epi)catechin and 11.4% of (epi)gallocatechin, suggesting higher absorption than that of most other flavonoids. The fate of (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, the main flavan-3-ol in green tea, is unclear because it appears unmetabolized in low concentrations in plasma but is not excreted in urine. Possible enterohepatic recirculation of flavan-3-ols is discussed along with the impact of dose and other food components on flavan-3-ol bioavailability. Approximately two-thirds of the ingested flavan-3-ols pass from the small to the large intestine where the action of the microbiota results in their conversion to C-6-C-5 phenylvalerolactones and phenylvaleric acids, which undergo side-chain shortening to produce C-6-C-1 phenolic and aromatic acids that enter the bloodstream and are excreted in urine in amounts equivalent to 36% of flavan-3-ol intake. Some of these colon-derived catabolites may have a role in vivo in the potential protective effects of tea consumption. Although black tea, which contains theaflavins and thearubigins, is widely consumed in the Western world, there is surprisingly little research on the absorption and metabolism of these compounds after ingestion and their potential impact on health.

### UDP-glucuronate metabolism controls RIPK1-driven liver damage in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^640ce6c9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

RIPK1 is the major downstream target mediating the TNFα signaling. There are two distinct apoptotic pathways in TNFα signaling: a RIPK1 kinase-independent pathway (RIA) that is inhibited by NF-κB/cFLIP and a RIPK1 kinase-dependent pathway (RDA) that is inhibited by NF-κB-independent mechanisms. RIPK1 kinase plays an important role in liver disease pathogenesis by regulating caspase-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis induced by TNFα. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of endogenous inhibitor of RIPK1 kinase, such as TAK1 — which performs inhibitory phosphorylation on RIPK1 — leads to spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Inactivating RIPK1 kinase by introducing RIPK1-D138N mutation in hepatocellular TAK1-deficient mice significantly ameliorated liver pathology by preventing hepatocyte apoptosis and subsequently reduced HCC development. In this study, we identify UGDH as an endogenous inhibitor of RIPK1 in hepatocytes. Loss of UGDH converts RIA into RDA due to unleased RIPK1 activity in TNFα-stimulated hepatocytes. Unlike hepatocellular TAK1-deficient mice, mice with hepatocyte-specific loss of UGDH appear normal and do not show liver pathology in unstressed condition. However, in CD-HFD-induced NASH, hepatocyte-specific loss of UGDH exaggerates NASH-associated liver damage and fibrosis by promoting hepatocyte apoptosis, which is ameliorated by RIPK1-D138N mutation. In patients with NASH, hepatocyte apoptosis is a major contributor to liver damage and fibrosis, which are the main determinants of mortality in NASH. With ongoing advances of increasing number of RIPK1 inhibitors in human clinical studies for the treatment of many human inflammatory and degenerative diseases, we expect that preventing hepatocyte apoptosis by RIPK1 inhibitors may represent a promising approach to treat NASH-associated liver damage and fibrosis.

### Emerging roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in drug resistance and cancer progression [^fe28e636]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

UGT enzymes are highly expressed in metabolic tissues such as the liver, intestine and kidney, consistent with their role in facilitating the elimination of certain metabolites, but the expression of most UGT subfamily members also extends to many other organs and blood cells (Fig. 1b). The tissue-specific expression of UGTs is highly regulated by multiple signalling pathways and transcription factors, and might be linked to the substrate metabolites they conjugate. The substrate molecules can be from endogenous or exogenous sources (Figs. 1c, 2a). For example, under homoeostatic conditions, glucuronidation is used by prostate epithelial cells to mediate the inactivation and elimination of androgens, thereby controlling their potency and availability. Additionally, UGTs, often acting in concert with other drug-metabolising enzymes and transporters, can participate in the inactivation of xenobiotics comprising environmental and dietary toxins and pharmacological compounds including anti-cancer drugs. Significantly, drug inactivation by UGTs is emerging as an important mechanism of drug resistance in cancer (Fig. 2c).

Fig. 2
UGTs as mediators of oncogenic pathways and drug response.

a UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) regulate metabolic homoeostasis through the inactivation of endogenous metabolites (such as steroid hormones) and xenobiotics (such as carcinogens) by their conjugation with glucuronic acid (GlcA, G). b The modulation of UGT expression and activity observed in normal and cancer cells influences the bioactivity of metabolites, including some with oncogenic potential, thereby promoting tumour development and progression. Endogenous metabolites such as steroid hormones induce or repress the expression of specific UGTs. c Therapeutic drugs generally induce UGT expression, promote drug inactivation and resistance to treatment and further perturb endogenous metabolites.

In testament to the importance of UGTs in cancer, a number of studies have established links between genetic variability in UGT enzymes and the risk of developing cancer in many different tissues, supporting roles for UGTs in the detoxification of exogenous carcinogens and inactivation of endogenous tumour-promoting molecules. These links have been extensively reviewed and will not be discussed further. – Less-well considered are the associations between UGTs and cancer progression, and UGTs and resistance to therapy, either primary or acquired, which we review herein.

### Targeted metabolomics identifies glucuronides of dietary phytoestrogens as a major class of MRP3 substrates in vivo [^d5260416]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The physiologic function of the efflux transporter Multidrug Resistance Protein 3 (MRP3) remains poorly defined. In vitro, MRP3 transports several glucuronidated compounds, but the compounds transported under physiologic conditions are unknown. Knowledge of the compounds transported by MRP3 in vivo would greatly contribute to the elucidation of the physiologic function of this transport protein.

Methods

We used targeted metabolomics to identify substrates of MRP3 in vivo. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used to specifically screen in plasma and urine of mice for compounds containing a glucuronic acid moiety.

Results

We found that several highly abundant compounds containing a glucuronic acid moiety have a much lower abundance in plasma and urine of Mrp3((-/-)) than of wild-type mice. We identified these as phytoestrogen-glucuronides, and we show that MRP3 transports these compounds at high rates and with high affinity in vitro.

Conclusions

We have identified the efflux transporter MRP3 as a major factor in the disposition of phytoestrogens, a class of compounds to which mammals are exposed via food of plant origin. Our targeted metabolomics approach is not restricted to MRP3 but applicable to many other transport proteins for which knockout mouse models are available. Similar screens could be developed for sulpho- and glutathione-conjugates, further increasing the potential of identifying new physiologic transporter substrates.

### Emerging roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in drug resistance and cancer progression [^7f40c8ed]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Box 1 Human UDP-glycosyltransferases.

The human glycosyltransferase enzymes represent a superfamily of proteins that catalyse the addition of sugar residues from a nucleotide-sugar donor (the co-substrate) to a functional group (usually a hydroxyl, carboxyl, amine or sulfhydryl group) of small lipophilic chemicals (generally below 1500 Da). The best characterised conjugation glycosyltransferases are UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) of the subfamily UGT1 and UGT2. UDP-GlcA is the widely preferred co-substrate of UGT1 and UGT2 enzymes, and hence, the catalysed conjugation reaction is referred to as glucuronidation. UGTs are membrane-bound enzymes. They predominantly localise in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the glucuronidation reaction takes place on the luminal side of the ER. Some UGTs may also reside in the perinuclear membrane. UGTs share a structural organisation consisting of a N-terminal co-substrate binding domain, a C-terminal substrate binding domain linked to a transmembrane region and a positively charged lysine-rich tail facing the cytosol.

The glucuronidation reaction occurs by a second-order nucleophilic substitution. The nucleophilic attack of the co-substrate UDP-GlcA by the polar functional group of the substrate enables the transfer of the GlcA from the co-substrate to the substrate. The end products of the reactions are the glucuronidated metabolite and UDP. The main glucuronides formed in humans are O -linked and N -linked. Glucuronidated metabolites have their water solubility enhanced relative to the parent molecule, facilitating their elimination in the bile and urine. For the most part, glucuronidated metabolites have reduced or abolished biological activity relative to the parental compounds. One notable exception is the glucuronidation of morphine by the enzyme UGT2B7, which produces morphine-6-glucuronide with enhanced analgesic activity relative to morphine. Hence, UGTs have essential detoxification and clearance functions by regulating the metabolism, bioactivity and bioavailability of pharmacological, dietary and environmental compounds, as well as of endogenous molecular substrates such as bile acids, signalling lipids, vitamins and steroid hormones. The 19 UGT1 and UGT2 enzymes modulate the pharmacological efficacy of about 55% of the most prescribed drugs.

### The systems biology of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters: relevance to quantitative systems pharmacology [^82323f2d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

OVERVIEW OF THE ROLE OF PHASE I AND PHASE II DRUG METABOLIZING ENZYMES IN ENDOGENOUS METABOLISM

Since their discovery, cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes — heme proteins that catalyze numerous so‐called phase I chemical reactions, such as hydroxylation, oxidation, and reduction — have been very often described as drug and toxicant metabolizing enzymes (phase I DMEs). The growth of information regarding CYP450‐mediated drug metabolism, coupled with knowledge of phase II conjugation pathways, including the UDP‐glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) that catalyze the covalent linkage of glucuronic acid to substrates, has allowed for the prediction of drug interactions at the level of metabolism, leading to greater safety in the prescription of certain drugs. 44 Further individualization of drug therapy is achieved through understanding genetic polymorphisms in DMEs that affect drug metabolism and are thereby linked to response or toxicity. 45 Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to synthesize the huge amount of data regarding phase I and phase II DMEs in physiology, particularly as it pertains to links with transporters, we will highlight some examples of how the endogenous roles of these enzymes connect to SLC and ABC transporters in certain physiological contexts.

### Emerging roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in drug resistance and cancer progression [^c220d528]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The glucuronidation activity of UGTs also has the potential to influence the cellular pools of UDP-sugars and pathways involved in their synthesis and usage. For instance, given that UDP-glucose, UDP-GlcA and UDP-xylose are derived from the glycolytic intermediate glucose 6-phosphate, UGT activity may disturb the energy metabolism on which cancer cells depend to grow efficiently. A further impact of UGT activity might also involve the differential use of UDP-GlcA either for glucuronidation or for the synthesis of UDP-xylose and proteoglycans. This hypothesis has been raised in the context of prostate cancer progression to metastasis. Observations in prostate cancer-cell models suggest that UDP-GlcA is preferentially channelled for the synthesis of proteoglycans such as NOTCH1 in androgen-independent cells, possibly to avoid inactivation of intracellular pools of androgens. Finally, UGT activity also appears to modulate the synthesis of the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA), a constituent of the extracellular matrix, composed of GlcA units. HA possesses structural and cell-signalling functions that can affect the metastatic process by facilitating cell–cell signalling and motility. Enhanced HA levels confer an unfavourable prognosis (aggressive phenotypes and reduced survival) in several cancer types (reviewed in ref.). The synthesis of HA is strongly inhibited by 4-methylumbelliferone, a derivative of coumarin and a ubiquitous UGT substrate. One mechanism by which 4-methylumbelliferone impairs HA synthesis is attributed to the extensive glucuronidation of 4-methylumbelliferone by several UGTs that depletes pools of UDP-GlcA, the source of the GlcA moieties in HA (reviewed in ref.).

Beyond the enzymatic functions of UGTs in glucuronidation, their interactions with other metabolic enzymes, such as those involved in the catabolism of fatty acids and with the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2), are another means by which they might influence diverse metabolic pathways involved in cancer biology, with an impact on cancer-cell phenotypes. These additional functions, which could also involve UGT isoforms produced by alternative splicing, will need to be assessed to comprehensively understand the contribution of UGTs to the oncogenic phenotype.

### UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) polymorphisms affect atorvastatin lactonization in vitro and in vivo [^faeb5cb5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

The response to statins shows large interpatient variability. Atorvastatin delta-lactone is pharmacologically inactive but has been associated with toxicity. We investigated the role of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in atorvastatin lactonization. In human liver microsomes, lactonization was correlated with UGT1A3 (r(s) = 0.61, P < 0.0001) but not with UGT1A1. Surprisingly, lactone formation was significantly higher in carriers of UGT1A1*28, an allele that is associated with lower UGT1A1 expression. We show that this inverse correlation is due to extensive linkage disequilibrium in the UGT1A locus and that several UGT1A3 haplotypes are associated with strong increases in UGT1A3 expression in vitro. Analyses of the pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin and metabolites in genotyped volunteers confirmed that there is an increase in atorvastatin lactonization in carriers of UGT1A3*2 in vivo. The potential of UGT genotyping to identify patients who are at increased risk for failure of therapy and/or adverse effects of statins warrants further investigation.

### Lignans and breast cancer risk in pre-and post-menopausal women: meta-analyses of observational studies [^15837566]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of exposure to lignans and breast cancer risk based on studies using dietary assessments and serum measurements. Although exposure can be assessed by urine analysis, few studies have used this methodology and therefore, these were not included. The results show that there was no association between plant lignan intake and overall risk, and this association was subjected to marked heterogeneity. However in post-menopausal women, there is a small but significant reduction in risk and a reduction in heterogeneity. A significantly decreased risk with increasing enterolignan exposure was also found. However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies making it difficult to draw clear conclusions, and the effect did not persist when analyses were stratified by menopausal status, although the number of studies included in these stratified analyses was very small. Finally, there was no association between enterolactone concentrations in blood and overall risk, or when analysis was stratified by menopausal status.

### Opioid metabolites [^6a0563b3]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

The metabolism of opioids closely relates to their chemical structure. Opioids are subject to O-dealkylation, N-dealkylation, ketoreduction, or deacetylation leading to phase-I metabolites. By glucuronidation or sulfatation, phase-II metabolites are formed. Some metabolites of opioids have an activity themselves and contribute to the effects of the parent compound. This can go as far that the main clinical activity is exerted through active metabolites while the parent compounds are only weak agonist at mu-opioid receptors, as in the case of codeine and tilidine. The clinical effects of tramadol also involve an important contribution of its active metabolite. With morphine, the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide exerts important clinical opioid effects when it accumulates in the plasma of patients with renal failure. However, after short-term administration of morphine, its contribution to the central nervous effects of morphine is probably poor. Morphine-6-glucuronide has recently been identified to exert important peripheral opioid effects. By this, it may play an important role in the clinical effects of morphine. Several other opioids, such as meperidine and perhaps also morphine and hydromorphone, produce metabolites with neuroexcitatory effects. In sum, the evidence suggests that the metabolites of several opioids account for an important part of the clinical effects that must be considered in clinical practice.

### Enzymatic enhancing of triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion by breaking oxygen quenching for background-free biological sensing [^9f5d0552]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

As has been shown in the above-mentioned experimental results (Supplementary Fig. 12), GOX concentrations dictate kinetic rates of the recovery of TTA-UC emission in the presence of glucose. Thus, for the purpose of glucose sensors, since the lower or higher end concentrations of GOX can lead to overly slow or fast readouts and subsequent potential experimental inconvenience and errors, we chose to use GOX of 10 µg mL −1 to demonstrate the glucose-sensing ability of the TTA-UCNP. Glucose at different concentrations was added to a solution of GOX (10 µg mL −1) and TTA-UCNP (1 mg mL −1). We observed that the response times for the TTA-UCNP to approach its maximal upconversion intensity are dependent on the glucose concentration. More specifically, the half response time is found to be linearly decreased with the increased concentration of glucose in a log scale manner (Fig. 3). The limit of detection for such glucose sensing is deduced to be 0.06 mg mL −1. In addition, by linear extrapolating the fitted straight line (Fig. 3b), this concentration of detection is observed to be up to 3.0 mg mL −1. This concentration range (0.06–3 mg mL −1) is wider than the requirement for clinical fasting blood glucose (0.7–1.1 mg mL −1) testing. Furthermore, our TTA-UCNP glucose sensors are found to be highly selective for glucose (Supplementary Fig. 13). In this regard, we also tested a wide variety of other prevalent biological saccharides and polyhydric alcohols, such as fructose, 2-deoxy-d-ribose, sucrose, maltose, D-lactose, and D-(+)-raffinose, sodium D-gluconic acid, glycerol, D-mannitol, and glucuronolactone (Supplementary Fig. 13). As a result, insignificant upconversion emissions were observed with these compounds. The upconversion emission response was only observed with glucose. Moreover, in the presence of 5%, 10%, and 20% FBS respectively, there is no obvious change for TTA-upconversion intensity, suggesting that serum proteins have not significantly affect TTA-UCNP (Supplementary Fig. 14). In addition, in order to explore whether our method can be interfered with by the autofluorescence background, we conducted the tests in the colored cell culture containing 20% FBS, phenol red, and GOX (10 µg mL −1). With the addition of glucose (2 mg mL −1), obvious TTA-upconversion was observed (Fig. 3c, right). Then, under this condition, we quantitatively measured the half response time of TTA-upconversion at different concentrations of glucose (Supplementary Fig. 15). We fitted the concentration of glucose and half response time in In–In coordination (Fig. 3d) and then compared it to Fig. 3b (in deionized water, slope = −0.627), observing an insignificant change in slope (−0.633), which suggested that the TTA-UCNP can still accurately measure the glucose concentration with autofluorescence background. Compared to the typical examples of pre-existing glucose quantitative analysis methods (Stokes-emission-based techniques) (Supplementary Table 1), our method, not only has a low detection line but also has a wider detection range.

### Prediagnostic enterolactone concentrations and mortality among Danish men diagnosed with prostate cancer [^1d6a2ff5]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Evidence on the role of diet in relation to prostate cancer progression is sparse. Foods rich in lignans have shown beneficial effects on prostate cancer progression in both animal studies and small human intervention studies, including beneficial effects on prostate-specific antigen levels and tumour growth. The lignan metabolite, enterolactone, has further shown to slow prostate cancer cell growth in vitro. The aim was to investigate the association between prediagnostic enterolactone concentrations and mortality among men with prostate cancer. Subljects/Methods:Prediagnostic plasma concentrations of enterolactone from 1390 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort were related to all-cause or prostate cancer-specific death, using Cox proportional hazards models with follow-up time (from the date of diagnose until the date of death, emigration or end of follow-up by December 2013) as the underlying time axis.

Results

The hazard ratios for enterolactone concentrations assessed linearly by 20nmol/l increments was 0.95 (0.90, 1.02) for all-cause mortality and 0.98 (0.92, 1.05) for prostate cancer-specific mortality. Categorisation of enterolactone concentrations into quartiles did not reveal a different pattern. No effect modifications by smoking, body mass index or sport were observed, and the associations did not differ by prostate cancer aggressiveness.

Conclusions

We found no association between enterolactone concentrations and mortality among men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

### Energy drinks: effects on pediatric 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A randomized trial [^c7878891]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Study design

This study was a randomized, single-blind (study participants), placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial that was conducted between April 2021 and October 2021 by the Division of Pediatric Cardiology and Intensive Care, University Hospital, LMU Munich (Munich, Germany). The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (, DRKS00027580).

Subjects were asked to abstain from caffeine (e.g. personal ED intake, coffee, tea, chocolate) and drugs (e.g. tobacco, alcohol) 48 h before and 24 h after study participation. Prior to each study day, an overnight fast (with allowance of water) was requested. Study participants were asked not to consume any food or liquids within the first 4 h after beverage consumption. The randomization into one of two intervention phases was executed by coin flipping. Study participants were given either a commercially available caffeinated ED or a placebo drink without the typical ED components (e.g. caffeine, taurine) on 2 consecutive days. The administered ED dosage was bodyweight-adjusted (3 mg caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight) and reflected the maximum daily caffeine intake for healthy children and adolescents as proposed by the EFSA. The provided amount of placebo was matched to that of the ED. Specific ingredients of both beverages were given in a recent publication conducted by our department. The ED contained caffeine (32 mg/100 mL), taurine (200 mg/100 mL), glucuronolactone (24 mg/10 mL), ginseng aroma extract (10 mg/100 mL), guarana extract (10 mg/100 mL) and vitamins. The placebo drink contained carbonated water, multi-fruit juice, fruit extracts, and vegetable extracts. ED and placebo drinks were similar in sugar content (ED: 15.2 g/100 mL, placebo drink: 13.2 g/100 mL) and taste. Both drinks were given at comparable morning hours in an indistinguishable and masked drinking bottle. To reduce the potential impact of physical activity on the cardiovascular parameters investigated in previous publications conducted by our department,– study participants were admitted to our pediatric ward and given a sickbed for each study day. Study participants remained supine within a 4-h monitoring period after beverage consumption. After the 4-h monitoring period, subjects were discharged from our pediatric ward. To assess blinding quality, study participants were asked to guess the day of ED administration after completed data collection.

### The role of metabolism (and the microbiome) in defining the clinical efficacy of dietary flavonoids [^36f35129]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

ETIOLOGY OF THE HETEROGENEITY IN FLAVONOID ADME

As detailed above, ∼200 proteins have been identified as having the potential to affect flavonoid ADME. Modulators of the expression and activity of these proteins, such as age, sex, and genotype, are likely, to varying degrees, to influence the circulating concentrations, elimination and tissue exposure to flavonoids (Figure 1) and, ultimately, to dose-response relations (Figure 2). Although little relevant published literature is currently available, lessons may be learned from traditional xenobiotic and, in particular, drug metabolism because many phase I and II metabolic pathways are common to both drug and flavonoid groups. While there is likely to be considerable redundancy in oxidation, glucuronidation, sulphation, and methylation pathways, there exists some evidence that flavonoid intake may influence drug metabolism with the reciprocal relation also likely to exist, with habitual drug use potentially influencing flavonoid ADME in an individual. Although currently largely unknown, this effect may be a particular issue in cases in whom the metabolism of the drug or flavonoid is reliant on one or a limited number of cytochrome, UGT, sulphotransferase, or COMT isoforms or in a situation of compromised phase I and II metabolic capacities, which are perhaps associated with disease or aging. Furthermore, it is also unclear what the physiologic consequences of altered ADME are likely to be. Reduced absorption would be predicted to reduce biopotency, but reduced phase I and phase II metabolism, although potentially reducing excretion rates and increasing the dose and length of tissue exposure, may result in a lower formation of more bioactive metabolites (relative to their parent compounds) and also potentially result in toxicity in susceptible individuals.

### Role of bile acids in inflammatory bowel disease [^ebcdf19f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conjugated BAs are absorbed only by an active mechanism. This active absorption process takes place in the lumen of the terminal ileum, where enterocytes express the apical sodium-dependent BA transporter (ASBT) or ileal BA transporter. Inside the enterocytes, BAs bind to the intestinal BA binding protein (IBABP) and finally they are discharged into the portal circulation via the organic solutes transporter (OST α/β), localized in the basolateral membrane.

Conjugation of BAs prevents passive absorption, allowing the conjugated BAs to be present in the intestinal lumen, where they act as a detergent for transport of insoluble lipids. Unabsorbed primary BAs are converted to secondary BAs by the enzymes of gut microbiota, mainly present in the colon. Specifically, through deconjugation and dehydroxylation of CA and CDCA, deoxycholic (DCA) and lithocholic (LCA) acids are respectively formed, while ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is synthesized through the C7 epimerization of the CDCA hydroxyl group. Secondary BAs are then reabsorbed passively in the large intestine and transported via the portal circulation to the liver, where they undergo further changes. As well as their precursors, secondary BAs are conjugated with glycine and taurine (and to a lesser extent with glucuronic or sulfuric acid), and secreted in the bile.

### UDP-glucuronate metabolism controls RIPK1-driven liver damage in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^e029abd4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Hepatocyte apoptosis plays an essential role in the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocyte apoptosis remain unclear. Here, we identify UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH) as a suppressor of NASH-associated liver damage by inhibiting RIPK1 kinase-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis. UGDH is progressively reduced in proportion to NASH severity. UGDH absence from hepatocytes hastens the development of liver damage in male mice with NASH, which is suppressed by RIPK1 kinase-dead knockin mutation. Mechanistically, UGDH suppresses RIPK1 by converting UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronate, the latter directly binds to the kinase domain of RIPK1 and inhibits its activation. Recovering UDP-glucuronate levels, even after the onset of NASH, improved liver damage. Our findings reveal a role for UGDH and UDP-glucuronate in NASH pathogenesis and uncover a mechanism by which UDP-glucuronate controls hepatocyte apoptosis by targeting RIPK1 kinase, and suggest UDP-glucuronate metabolism as a feasible target for more specific treatment of NASH-associated liver damage.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^4a81fdc0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at University of the Pacific (Stockton, CA). All participants were provided written informed consent consistent with university requirements for clinical studies involving human subjects. The clinical study was registered on(NCT03196908).

This was a randomized, double‐masked (participants and care providers), placebo‐controlled, crossover clinical trial conducted at a university campus setting (July 2017 to December 2017). Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 40 years who were willing to avoid ingestion of caffeine and energy drinks for 48 hours before each study day were eligible for enrollment. Participants were excluded if they had any known medical condition (confirmed through participant interview), were pregnant or breastfeeding, were current smokers, had a baseline QTc > 450 ms, or brachial blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg. Those who were taking any chronic prescription or over‐the‐counter medications were excluded except those who had been taking oral contraceptives for over 1 month. An overnight fast (with allowance for water only) was required preceding every study day, and no food was allowed during the study monitoring period. A commercially available non‐caffeinated granola bar (Nature Valley Crunchy Oats 'N Honey, General Mills) was provided after the 180‐minute time point upon participant request.

Participants were randomized into 1 of 3 intervention phases using a computer‐generated code from. Participants received two 16‐oz bottles of a commercially available caffeinated energy drink brand (drink A), another brand of a caffeinated energy drink (drink B), or a placebo‐drink (placebo) on 3 separate days with a minimum 6‐day washout period in‐between. The beverages were consumed within a 60‐minute period but no faster than 1 bottle in 30 minutes. Based on the package labeling, both drink A and drink B contained caffeine (304–320 mg/32‐fl oz), taurine, glucuronolactone, and vitamins along with other proprietary ingredients. 24 Some differences between the 2 energy drink brands include the presence of carnitine, guarana, and panax ginseng. The placebo drink contained carbonated water, lime juice, and cherry flavoring. All drinks were packaged in identical, masked containers prepared within 24 hours of administration and stored in a refrigerator before administration.

### The role of metabolism (and the microbiome) in defining the clinical efficacy of dietary flavonoids [^b0394151]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Therefore, although there is limited evidence to suggest that there is possibly higher UGT1A-mediated glucuronidation in females than in males and a possible overall age-related decline in phase I and phase II metabolism, available data are wholly inadequate to make any definitive conclusion regarding the likely impact of these variables on flavonoid metabolism in humans.

Impact of genotype on xenobiotic and potentially flavonoid metabolism

As with the majority of phenotypes, it is likely that ≥ 50% of the interindividual heterogeneity in flavonoid ADME is attributable to genetic variability. The most recent output from the 1000 Genome Consortium, which was published in October 2015, indicated that there are typically 88 million variants in a human genome, and with knowledge that the penetrance of individual variants is influenced by a range of behavioral, physiologic, and epistatic (gene × gene interactions) factors, the identification of which factors influence flavonoid ADME represents a major challenge. To date, the limited investigations have taken a candidate-gene approach and have focused on one or a small number of variants in a gene encoding for key phase I or II proteins.

Although currently completely unknown, because of the key role of LPH and β-glucosidases (see Absorption) in the initial hydrolysis of flavonoid glycosides, it is likely that variants in these loci may be important determinants of the bioavailability of the majority of flavonoid subclasses from the small intestine.

### Emerging roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in drug resistance and cancer progression [^bcab49ea]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

One mechanism by which cancer cells promote their own growth and survival is by altering the biotransformation of small molecules or metabolites. Conjugation reactions that are catalysed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs) constitute one such means of biotransformation. In humans, the UGT pathway is mediated by 22 enzymes that catalyse the covalent addition of sugars from nucleotide UDP-sugar donors to hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino groups of a diversity of dissimilar endogenous metabolites and toxic exogenous chemicals (Fig. 1). Because of their significant role in drug metabolism, the UGT1 and UGT2 subfamily members are the most studied. In the vast majority of cases, conjugation of lipophilic substrates by UGT1 and UGT2, using highly polar glucuronic acid (GlcA) for the formation of hydrophilic glucuronides — a reaction known as glucuronidation — abolishes biological activity, enhances solubility and facilitates elimination from the body through bile and urine (Fig. 1a) (Box 1).

Fig. 1
Schematic overview of the glucuronidation reaction catalysed by UGT enzymes.

a Endogenous metabolites, carcinogens and drugs are conjugated to glucuronic acid (GlcA) taken from the preferential co-substrate UDP-GlcA by membrane-bound UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes. The glucuronidation reaction generally takes place in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and requires active transport of cytosolic UDP-GlcA to the ER. b Four UGT families (UGT1, UGT2, UGT3 and UGT8) encode the 22 enzymes and alternative isoforms (≥ 180) that regulate the glucuronidation pathway in humans. UGTs are found in most organs, generally anchored to the luminal side of the ER. Some UGTs may also reside in the perinuclear membrane (not illustrated). The liver expresses the widest array of UGTs. Enzymes of the UGT3 and UGT8 families use the co-substrates UDP-glucose, UDP-xylose, UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine rather than UDP-GlcA to catalyse the glycosylation of endogenous metabolites (see Box 1). c Examples of endogenous metabolites and anti-cancer agents targeted by UGTs. Hydroxyl, amine, and sulfhydryl are the main functional groups targeted by UGT enzymes. Each UGT is specialised in the conjugation of a specific set of substrates.

### Gut microbiota metabolites of dietary lignans and risk of type 2 diabetes: a prospective investigation in two cohorts of U.S. women [^b95272aa]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

There are several caveats in the current study that merit discussion. First, the half-lives of enterolignans are short (4.4 h for enterodiol) to modest (12.6 h for enterolactone), suggesting that a single measurement of these biomarkers is more likely to reflect relatively short-term levels. Meanwhile, the urinary lignan concentrations were reasonably strongly correlated over 1–2 years as observed in the pilot study, probably owing to a stable diet and intestinal microbiota over time. Nonetheless, use of multiple assessments of the lignan metabolites over time would be a more desirable approach to better reflect usual exposure levels. Second, compared with 24-h urine samples, spot urine samples may not be optimal to assess lignan levels accurately, although the spot urine is much more accessible, allowing collection in large epidemiological studies. Third, we did not measure enterofuran, a minor enterolignan, in the current study and, therefore, could not evaluate this specific marker in relation to diabetes risk. Fourth, although we controlled for a wide range of established diabetes risk factors, including dietary factors, the possibility of residual confounding still exists. Finally, because the lignan metabolites may be derived from multiple parent plant lignans that come from various food sources, we are unable to conclusively ascribe the associations to intake of individual plant lignans or foods.

In summary, this prospective investigation conducted in two cohorts of U.S. women demonstrates that urinary levels of enterolignans are associated with a lower risk of developing T2D. These novel findings complement the current knowledge on the effects of lignan intake on glucose metabolism and other metabolic risk factors in short-term trials. In light of the accumulating evidence suggesting that gut microbiota composition may play a role in the development of obesity and T2D, the current data suggest that the enterolignan production by gut microbiota may potentially affect risk of T2D. In addition, these results are in line with recommendations on increasing intakes of lignan-rich foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and green leafy vegetables, for the prevention of T2D.

### Xenobiotics and the human gut microbiome: metatranscriptomics reveal the active players [^d85f61f0]. Cell Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The human gut microbiome plays an important role in the metabolism of xenobiotics. In a recent issue of Cell, Maurice et al. (2013) identify the active members of the gut microbiome and show how gene-expression profiles change within the gut microbial community in response to antibiotics and host-targeted xenobiotics.

### Host-microbe co-metabolism via MCAD generates circulating metabolites including hippuric acid [^f6a1fcfe]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The human gut microbiome produces numerous drug-like small molecules that impact various aspects of human biology –. These molecules are produced in the gut via metabolism of diet- and host-derived molecules such as glycans, proteins, and amino acids. Microbiota-dependent metabolites impact physiology locally in the gut where their concentrations are the highest. However, a subset are absorbed across the intestinal wall and circulate throughout the body where they may influence host physiology at organs distal to the gut –. Despite extensive recent literature documenting the impact of microbial metabolites on the host, significant gaps exist in our knowledge about these molecules. Chief among these are the lack of clarity on how microbiota-generated metabolites intersect with host metabolism, and the identity and fate of the major products. Such insight is essential to understand how host genetics influence the spectrum of microbial metabolites within an individual and will identify novel biomarkers for microbial functions in the gut.

Gut microbial metabolites enter host circulation where they are metabolized by enzymes involved in phase I (modification via oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis) and phase II metabolism (conjugation with glutathione, sulfate, glucuronic acid, or amino acids — typically glycine or glutamine), classically known for their roles in drug metabolism. Products of phase I and phase II metabolism of microbial metabolites include: (1) indoxyl sulfate –, a host-microbe co-metabolite of tryptophan whose plasma levels rise as the kidneys fail, and is thought to contribute to the cardiovascular sequelae in end-stage kidney disease; (2) p -cresol sulfate, the sulfated product of microbial tyrosine degradation, is associated with cardiovascular and kidney damage; (3) trimethylamine N -oxide, a host-microbe co-metabolite of trimethyl-containing compounds such as choline, whose plasma levels are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Many colon-derived metabolites in humans are subjected to sulfation and glucuronidation reactions, but the extent to which alternative host metabolic pathways contribute to the large remainder of microbially-derived metabolites remains to be defined.

### Current challenges and opportunities for pharmacogenomics: perspective of the industry pharmacogenomics working group (I-PWG) [^aab33f84]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Challenges in PGx ADME studies

Genetic variants that alter activity of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters are responsible for many known PGx associations (FDA; Tremaine et al.). By altering enzyme or transporter activity, such variants can drive inter-individual variability in exposure, and potentially have an impact on drug safety or efficacy if the variability in exposure exceeds the therapeutic window for small molecules. In addition to issues with limited clinical trial size discussed previously, there are several challenges unique to the study of PGx in early phase studies. These include the potential uncertainty in determining metabolism pathways for new compounds in early clinical development, and the continued emergence of variants with clinical significance.

Ideally, PGx analyses in early phase studies would be conducted in a targeted fashion, prioritizing variants in genes that have been shown via preclinical work to be important for the disposition of the compound to maximize likelihood of success in conducting analyses in very small trial datasets. However, preclinical in vitro studies of the major and minor pathways of metabolism are often not completed before the initiation of phase II or even pivotal studies. For this reason, it is often important to pool as many early phase clinical studies with pharmacokinetic (PK) data as possible to boost statistical power to assess a broader set of ADME genes. In addition, larger phase II/III studies can also be used where estimates of PK parameters can be derived using population PK modeling to assess potential impact of variants in ADME genes (Guo et al; Kobie et al.). Even so, the statistical power to detect genetic associations in these data sets may not be sufficient. In particular, power to detect rare variants that could impact safety exposure is almost always limited, especially for patients who may have more than one functional mutation in a set of metabolizing enzymes. Rational drug design over the past several decades has mostly eliminated drugs that are predominantly metabolized by highly polymorphic Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) such as CYP2D6, in favor of spreading the fraction metabolized across several CYPs or other enzyme families where possible. That does not fully eliminate the chance of a patient having a poor metabolizer phenotype in two of those enzymes which may lead to variability in exposure that could be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, other metabolic clearance routes such as glucuronidation and the role of membrane transporters have emerged as being potentially relevant for PGx studies (Desai et al; Guillemette; Yee et al.). While there is generally less strong prior clinical evidence to support the functional impact of genetic variants in these other classes of metabolic enzymes or in membrane transporters, PGx analyses will likely be required to understand their potential impact on PK and pharmacodynamics.

### Drug interaction with UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes is a predictor of drug-induced liver injury [^5f6077a4]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to CYP enzymes, studies have indicated other metabolism enzymes, including those facilitating phase II reactions such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), N-acetyltransferases, and sulfotransferases, may contribute to induce DILI through the formation of toxic reactive metabolites. While the majority of drugs undergo metabolism by CYP enzymes, the involvement of noncytochrome P450 (non-CYP) metabolism enzymes remains a significant pathway for drug metabolic clearance. In the realm of drug development, there is a growing trend toward optimizing pharmacokinetic properties of drug candidates by reducing their lipophilicity. This trend may lead to decreased metabolism by CYP enzymes, thus opening avenues for non-CYP enzymes to assume an increasingly crucial role in drug disposition and metabolism. However, there is still a knowledge gap in terms of systematically characterizing non-CYP enzymes to provide insights into their contribution to DILI development. In this study, we conducted comprehensive analyses to explore the associations between in vitro drug interactions with non-CYP enzymes and their corresponding DILI concern.

### Urinary ethyl glucuronide as measure of alcohol consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease: a population-based cohort study [^63344f51]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, self‐reported alcohol consumption shows a similar association between alcohol consumption and CVD when compared with an objective measure of alcohol consumption. Moreover, these findings are consistent when the measures are combined to minimize misclassification. This argues for the validity of self‐report; however, objective biomarkers can serve as effective supportive tools to complement self‐report in the assessment of habitual alcohol consumption.

### Assessing the respective contributions of dietary flavanol monomers and procyanidins in mediating cardiovascular effects in humans: randomized, controlled, double-masked intervention trial [^003de450]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

In contrast, there is no evidence that procyanidins, especially those with a DP of > 2, are absorbed in the GIT as intact procyanidin molecules, and they are not present in the systemic circulation in humans. Nor do procyanidins break down in the GIT in ways that contribute to the circulating pool of SREMs. However, novel advances demonstrate that the human microbiome may play a crucial role in understanding the bioactivity of CFs. Approximately 70% of the ingested (−)-epicatechin is absorbed via the colon after catabolism by the microbiota, giving rise in the systemic circulation to sulfated and glucuronidated metabolites of 5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone (γVL) and 5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, corresponding to 42% ± 5% of (−)-epicatechin intake. Procyanidins are also subject to microbiome-mediated catabolism, which contributes significantly to the concentrations of γVL metabolites in humans. Overall, we estimated that 43% and 54% of the γVL metabolites present in human plasma after the intake of CFs originate from the flavanol monomers and procyanidins, respectively. Taken together, the role of the gut microbiome in flavanol and procyanidin absorption and metabolism is important, because gut microbiome–derived CF metabolites represent a major part of the CF metabolome present in the human circulation. Thus, γVL metabolites represent principal candidates for CF-derived metabolites causal in mediating the cardiovascular effects observed after dietary CF intake. Consequently, with the use of CF as a model, the main goal of this investigation was to undertake a dietary intervention study to establish the respective relative contributions of flavanol monomers and DP2–10 procyanidins in mediating the cardiovascular effects observed after cocoa intake in humans and to assess the roles of SREMs and γVL metabolites in these processes.

### Extensive metabolic consequences of human glycosyltransferase gene knockouts in prostate cancer [^5d8029e7]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Carbohydrates, energy and nucleotide pathways

Glycosyltransferases use UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) as a sugar donor in the conjugation reaction. We thus examined metabolites linked to the uronic and hexosamine pathways, which are synthesised from glycolytic intermediates. In UGT2B17 KO cases, none of the measured glycolytic intermediates and metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid pathway were perturbed (Supplementary Table S3A and Supplementary Fig. S2B). UGT2B28 KO displayed significantly higher levels of the glycolytic metabolite pyruvate by 53% and of N-acetylglucosamine/galactosamine of the hexosamine pathway by 29% (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Circulating nucleotide levels were globally unchanged between UGT KO and gene-proficient individuals (Supplementary Table S3A).

### Circulating conjugated and unconjugated vitamin D metabolite measurements by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry [^e7d88b70]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The biological role of vitamin D glucuronide conjugates is not well understood although glucuronylation is generally considered to be a physiologically irreversible inactivation step, occurring predominantly in the liver to increase hydrophilicity and facilitate renal excretion. However, there is also some limited presence of beta-glucuronidase within gut bacteria that could have a role in the hydrolysis of glucuronide conjugates excreted in bile for reabsorption via enterohepatic circulation. The present study indicates that circulating 25OHD3, 25OHD2, and 24,25(OH) 2 D3 glucuronide conjugates are present but at much smaller fractions than the sulfated forms. While our study has confirmed E. coli beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis activity for vitamin D, the process of glucuronylation is more likely to be an irreversible step for analyte excretion because beta-glucuronidase activity within most human tissues do not reach significant levels.

Compared with the other vitamin D metabolites, the proportion of 3-epi-25OHD3 circulating as conjugated metabolites was much lower in our samples. This is in broad agreement with a previous study by Yoshimura et al. that reported 3-epi-25OHD3-S in cord blood at lower levels than 3-epi-25OHD3 and also determined that in vitro SULT2A1 sulfation activity for 3-epi-25OHD3 was approximately one-tenth of that for 25OHD3. A possible explanation for reduced SULT2A1 activity for 3-epi-25OHD3 is that sulfation of 25OHD3 predominantly occurs at the C-3 position and the stereochemistry is altered to the beta configuration following C-3 epimerization by 3-epimerase, altering enzyme substrate interactions. As 3-epi-25OHD3 and its dihydroxy metabolites are less biologically active than 25OHD3, it remains unclear whether 3-epi-25OHD3-S could be utilized as a storage form or if conjugation of this metabolite is primarily to facilitate excretion as proposed for the other vitamin D sulfate moieties. While the arylsulfatase used in this study appears to show similar levels of activity toward sulfated 3-epi-25OHD3-S and 25OHD3-S, it remains to be determined whether there is a similar level of activity for human steroid sulfatase toward the hydrolysis of these analytes relevant to the proposed the biological significance of the sulfate forms.

### Direct supplementation with urolithin A overcomes limitations of dietary exposure and gut microbiome variability in healthy adults to achieve consistent levels across the population [^38d32886]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

This report details the results from a clinical study in American adults (aged 20–80 years) that estimates the relative prevalence of UA producers and non-producers following a standardized dietary challenge with PJ. Metagenomic profiles of the fecal samples of volunteers distinguish the gut microbiome of UA producers from non-producers. The primary objective of the study was to compare the levels of UA and its conjugates (UA glucuronide being the main metabolite) in the circulation over time during a randomized, crossover study in which participants were orally administered either 100% PJ containing a natural profile of UA precursor compounds to a nutritional product containing a calibrated dose of 500 mg of UA. The rationale of doing such a comparison was to document the variability and low levels of UA observed via natural exposure to diet rich in precursors vs. the uniform and consistent exposure obtained via direct supplementation with UA.

### How should we assess the effects of exposure to dietary polyphenols in vitro? [^d6513b86]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Human intervention studies have provided clear evidence that dietary polyphenols (eg, flavonoids — eg, flavonols — and isoflavones) are at least partly absorbed and that they have the potential to exert biological effects. Biological activity of polyphenols is often assessed by using cultured cells as tissue models; in almost all such studies, cells are treated with aglycones or polyphenol-rich extracts (derived from plants and foods), and data are reported at concentrations that elicited a response. There are 2 inherent flaws in such an approach. First, plasma and tissues are not exposed in vivo to polyphenols in these forms. Several human studies have identified the nature of polyphenol conjugates in vivo and have shown that dietary polyphenols undergo extensive modification during first-pass metabolism so that the forms reaching the blood and tissues are, in general, neither aglycones (except for green tea catechins) nor the same as the dietary source. Polyphenols are present as conjugates of glucuronate or sulfate, with or without methylation of the catechol functional group. As a consequence, the polyphenol conjugates are likely to possess different biological properties and distribution patterns within tissues and cells than do polyphenol aglycones. Although deconjugation can potentially occur in vivo to produce aglycone, it occurs only at certain sites. Second, the polyphenol concentrations tested should be of the same order as the maximum plasma concentrations attained after a polyphenol-rich meal, which are in the range of 0.1–10 micromol/L. For correct interpretation of results, future efforts to define biological activities of polyphenols must make use of the available data concerning bioavailability and metabolism in humans.

### Pharmacogenomics of human uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases and clinical implications [^c0ca8106]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Glucuronidation by uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs) is a major phase II biotransformation pathway and, complementary to phase I metabolism and membrane transport, one of the most important cellular defense mechanisms responsible for the inactivation of therapeutic drugs, other xenobiotics, and endogenous molecules. Interindividual variability in UGT pathways is significant and may have profound pharmacological and toxicological implications. Several genetic and genomic processes underlie this variability and are discussed in relation to drug metabolism and diseases such as cancer.

### Alternative promoters control UGT2B17-dependent androgen catabolism in prostate cancer and its influence on progression [^ab6c3582]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in North American men. The prostate is an androgen-dependent organ, and steroid hormones contribute to PCa cell proliferation and overall survival via activation of the androgen receptor (AR). Even when a PCa patient is castrated, which leads to declined circulating testosterone levels, AR amplification, AR splice variants and proficient intratumoural steroid biotransformation pathways compensate and sustain progression. – Indeed, survival improves upon administration of AR axis-targeting agents in castration-resistant metastatic disease, – supporting intracrine biotransformation processes. Uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs) are responsible for the inactivation of various endogenous signalling molecules, including androgens and oestrogens.UGT enzymes are located in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and glycosylate their steroid substrates with glucuronic acid, an enzymatic reaction referred to as glucuronidation. This results in glucuronide (–G) derivatives that are more hydrophilic than the parent molecules, and can be more easily excreted into bile or urine. Glucuronidation is an essential pathway for steroid inactivation and elimination in cancer cells, and is very active in the prostate. Thus, the UGT pathway participates in the regulation of the local exposure of prostate cells to steroid hormones, and this pathway has been shown to influence the risk, and progression of PCa. –

### Polocaine (mepivacaine hcl) [^6779a8f2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Mepivacaine, because of its amide structure, is not detoxified by the circulating plasma esterases. It is rapidly metabolized, with only a small percentage of the anesthetic (5 percent to 10 percent) being excreted unchanged in the urine. The liver is the principal site of metabolism, with over 50% of the administered dose being excreted into the bile as metabolites. Most of the metabolized mepivacaine is probably resorbed in the intestine and then excreted into the urine since only a small percentage is found in the feces. The principal route of excretion is via the kidney. Most of the anesthetic and its metabolites are eliminated within 30 hours. It has been shown that hydroxylation and N-demethylation, which are detoxification reactions, play important roles in the metabolism of the anesthetic. Three metabolites of mepivacaine have been identified from human adults: two phenols, which are excreted almost exclusively as their glucuronide conjugates, and the N-demethylated compound (2', 6'-pipecoloxylidide).

### Pharmacogenomics of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes [^333445ba]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2003). Low credibility.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes comprise a superfamily of key proteins that catalyze the glucuronidation reaction on a wide range of structurally diverse endogenous and exogenous chemicals. Glucuronidation is one of the major phase II drug-metabolizing reactions that contributes to drug biotransformation. This biochemical process is also involved in the protection against environmental toxicants, carcinogens, dietary toxins and participates in the homeostasis of numerous endogenous molecules, including bilirubin, steroid hormones and biliary acids. Over the years, significant progress was made in the field of glucuronidation, especially with regard to the identification of human UGTs, study of their tissue distribution and substrate specificities. More recently, the degree of allelic diversity has also been revealed for several human UGT genes. Some polymorphic UGTs have demonstrated a significant pharmacological impact in addition to being relevant to drug-induced adverse reactions and cancer susceptibility. This review focuses on human UGTs, the description of the nature of polymorphic variations and their functional impact. The pharmacogenomic implication of polymorphic UGTs is presented, more specifically the role of UGT polymorphisms in modifying cancer risk and their impact on individual risk to drug-induced toxicities.

### Can bile salt export pump inhibition testing in drug discovery and development reduce liver injury risk? An international transporter consortium perspective [^29b4c77f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Proposed role of bile salt export pump inhibition in drug‐induced liver injury. *Adaptation may arise via upregulation ofexpression and upregulation or downregulation of other hepatic plasma membrane efflux or uptake transporters, respectively, plus intracellular mechanisms that include farnesoid X receptor (FXR)‐mediated downregulation of bile acid synthesis (see text for details).

Interspecies differences in BSEP inhibition

For several drugs, markedly (up to 10‐fold) more potent inhibition of human BSEP, when compared with inhibition of Bsep from preclinical species, has been reported (e.g. troglitazone). 16, 17 However, for most drugs the experimentally determined half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values for human and rat BSEP/Bsep inhibition have been found to be very similar. This suggests that species variability in inhibition of BSEP/Bsep is not a plausible explanation for why drugs that inhibit BSEP and cause human DILI do not cause liver injury when evaluated in animal safety studies. Humans have a significantly more hydrophobic bile acid pool than rats and dogs, as evidenced by higher levels of lithocholic acid and other monohydroxylated bile acids. 30 Furthermore, bile acid feeding experiments undertaken in rats revealed a good correlation between increased bile acid hydrophobicity and hepatotoxicity. 31, 32, 33 This raises the possibility that interspecies differences in bile acid pools might contribute to the poor predictive power of rodent safety studies for detection of human DILI caused by BSEP inhibition. Interestingly, rodents detoxify monohydroxylated bile acids through extensive hydroxylation, 1 and experiments performed using Cyp null mice revealed that the key enzymatic pathway that further oxidizes bile acids to more hydrophilic alpha‐muricholic or beta‐muricholic acid species is catalyzed by members of the rodent Cyp2c family, which are not expressed in humans and other higher animal species. 34 QST modeling has provided additional evidence that the less toxic profile of bile acids in rats is a plausible hypothesis for why troglitazone did not exhibit liver toxicity when tested in animals, yet caused iDILI in humans. 35

Much less is known about traditional large animal toxicity species, such as dogs and cynomolgus monkeys, in relation to their value for detection of liver injury caused by Bsep inhibition. However, notable differences in bile acid amidation and conjugation are known, which could lead to species differences in hepatotoxicity. 36

### Diet-derived urolithin A is produced by a dehydroxylase encoded by human gut enterocloster species [^9f5a3351]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

While uroA is the most common terminal metabolite following ellagitannin consumption in humans, its production varies widely. In our hands, the ability of a fecal sample to produce uroA from uroC ex vivo did not correlate with the presence nor abundance of widespread uroC-metabolizing Enterocloster spp. or a ucd operon homolog. This observation could be explained by poor viability, metabolic inactivity, abundance, or transcriptional repression of Enterocloster spp. in fecal samples. However, active transcription of the ucd operon correlated perfectly with metabotypes. These findings further emphasize the importance of functional assays such as transcriptomics and ex vivo metabolism to understand the metabolism of xenobiotics by the gut microbiota.

In conclusion, our studies reveal the genetic and chemical basis for urolithin A production by gut bacteria and broaden our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying urolithin metabotypes in human populations. Since diet can modulate gut microbiota function and host health, elucidating the xenobiotic metabolism genes encoded by gut bacteria will be key to developing dietary interventions targeting the gut microbiota.

### The structural basis of fungal glucuronoyl esterase activity on natural substrates [^c50ec086]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In the following, our results from extensive structural and functional studies of Cu GE are presented. This includes structural investigations by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of the full-length enzyme, crystal structures of the apo form of the catalytic domain, as well as four relevant complexes with aldouronic acids, and binding affinity measurements on natural insoluble lignin substrate, containing LCCs and soluble substrate analogs. Collectively, these results give us important structural and functional knowledge clarifying the interactions between Cu GE and the α-1,2-linked 4- O -methyl — glucuronoyl moieties on xylo-oligomers and explaining how the enzyme accomodates large complex substrates. Furthermore, a comparative study with other members of the CE15 family reveals two distinct groups of enzymes, A and B of which Cu GE belongs to group B. The two groups differ in the position of their catalytic acid and topology, which indicate differences in substrate binding. This overall knowledge on the CE15 enzymes will pave the ground for the understanding of how lignin can be selectively separated from the lignocellulosic cell wall via enzymatic cleavage of ester-linked LCCs.

### Fenofibric acid (Fenofibric acid delayed-release) [^73365808]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolism

Fenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine. A small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine.

In vivo metabolism data after fenofibrate administration indicate that fenofibric acid does not undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent.

Elimination

After absorption, fenofibric acid is primarily excreted in the urine in the form of fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide.

Fenofibric acid is eliminated with a half-life of approximately 20 hours, allowing once daily administration of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules.

Specific Populations

Geriatrics

In five elderly volunteers 77 to 87 years of age, the oral clearance of fenofibric acid following a single oral dose of fenofibrate was 1.2 L/h, which compares to 1.1 L/h in young adults. This indicates that an equivalent dose of fenofibric acid can be used in elderly subjects with normal renal function, without increasing accumulation of the drug or metabolites [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Colonic metabolism of polyphenols from coffee, green tea, and hazelnut skins [^67b38f71]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Dietary polyphenolic compounds are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. The absorbed fraction follows the common metabolic pathway of drugs, undergoing phase II enzymatic detoxification with the conjugation of glucuronic acid, sulfate, and methyl groups. However, the unabsorbed fraction can reach the colon, becoming available for the wide array of enzymes produced by the local commensal microbiota. Gut bacteria can hydrolyze glycosides, glucuronides, sulfates, amides, esters, and lactones and are able to break down the polyphenolic skeleton and perform reactions of reduction, decarboxylation, demethylation, and dehydroxylation. These complex modifications generate several low-molecular-weight metabolites that can be efficiently absorbed in situ, subsequently undergoing further phase II metabolism, locally and/or at the liver level, before entering the systemic blood circulation and finally being excreted in urine in substantial quantities that exceed the excretion of phenolic metabolites formed in the upper gastrointestinal tract. This brief work focuses on the phenolic composition and colonic microbial transformation of 2 of the most polyphenol-rich dietary sources, namely, green tea and coffee, and a new interesting and innovative ingredient, hazelnut skin, recently evaluated as one of the richest edible sources of polyphenolic compounds.

### The role of metabolism (and the microbiome) in defining the clinical efficacy of dietary flavonoids [^33529c2f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Postabsorptive metabolism

After absorption, flavonoids may undergo phase I metabolism in the liver (oxidation or O- demethylated) by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. In humans, there are 57 cytochrome genes that are divided in 18 families with isoforms such as cytochrome 1A1, cytochrome 1A2, cytochrome 1B1, cytochrome 3A4 (the predominant human intestinal and hepatic cytochrome 450s), and cytochrome 2C9 that are involved in flavonoid metabolism. However, phase I metabolism–derived oxidation products tend to be minor metabolites of most flavonoids, which is probably due to the rapid glucuronidation, sulphation, or methylation of potential phase I substrates in the intestine and the liver by phase II conjugating enzymes including urine-5′-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulphotransferases, and catechol- O -methyltransferases (COMTs). The glucuronide sulfate and methyl conjugates are more-polar metabolites and may be excreted via the kidneys in urine or via bile or transported by ABC-mediated efflux back into the intestinal lumen. In general, the majority of conjugates in the plasma and urine are glucuronides. The conjugation mechanisms are highly efficient, and aglycones are generally either absent in the circulation or present in low concentrations after physiologic intakes.

UGTs catalyze the transfer of a glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid to polyphenols (including flavonoids) and other xenobiotics. The UGT gene superfamily gives rise to > 22 UGT isoforms that belong to the UGT1A, UGT2A, UGT2B, UGT3, or UGT8 families. The glucuronidation of flavonoids is regiospecific and isoform dependent. Sulphotransferases add a sulfate moiety to the flavonoids. They also belong to a gene superfamily with > 10 different sulphotransferase isoforms in humans. Sulphotransferases 1A1–4 and 1E1 have been specifically shown to be involved in the metabolism of flavonoids (,–). COMTs are involved in the O -methylation of catecholic polyphenols including catechins, epicatechins, and epigallocatechins from the flavan-3-ol subclass. Methylation decreases the hydrophilicity of compounds, and after methylation, subsequent glucuronidation and sulphation are often needed for the effective elimination from the body.

### Androgen glucuronidation: an unexpected target for androgen deprivation therapy, with prognosis and diagnostic implications [^3ef5fb90]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADTh) remains a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment, but its efficacy is bypassed by mechanisms that are not fully understood. In human prostate cancer cells, androgen glucuronidation, catalyzed by the two UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, is the major androgen inactivation pathway. In this study, we investigated the effect of ADTh on androgen glucuronidation to evaluate its potential clinical utility for prostate cancer prognosis or therapy. UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression was evaluated in prostate cancer specimens from untreated or treated patients and in cell models of prostate cancer exposed to clinically relevant antiandrogens. UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 protein levels in prostate were increased after 5 months of ADTh when compared with specimens from untreated patients. UGT2B15 expression remained elevated for up to 12 months, but UGT2B17 returned to initial levels as soon as after 6 months. Several androgen receptor (AR) antagonists tested caused a dose- and time-dependent stimulation of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression and androgen glucuronidation in prostate cancer cell lines. The role of AR in these regulatory events was confirmed using AR-deficient LNCaP cells, in which UGT2B attenuation reduced the antiproliferative effects of AR pharmacologic antagonists. Through this combination of clinical and functional investigations, our work revealed that ADTh stimulates a local androgen metabolism in prostate cells, establishing a foundation to evaluate the potential of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 as drug targets and/or molecular markers for ADTh responsiveness and maintenance in prostate cancer.

### Fenofibric acid (trilipix) [^a629323e]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Metabolism

Fenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine. A small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine.

In vivo metabolism data after fenofibrate administration indicate that fenofibric acid does not undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent.

Excretion

After absorption, Trilipix is primarily excreted in the urine in the form of fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide.

Fenofibric acid is eliminated with a half-life of approximately 20 hours, allowing once daily administration of Trilipix.

Specific Populations

 Geriatrics

In five elderly volunteers 77 to 87 years of age, the oral clearance of fenofibric acid following a single oral dose of fenofibrate was 1.2 L/h, which compares to 1.1 L/h in young adults. This indicates that an equivalent dose of Trilipix can be used in elderly subjects with normal renal function, without increasing accumulation of the drug or metabolites [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)].

Pediatrics

Trilipix has not been investigated in adequate and well-controlled trials in pediatric patients.

### Circulating enterolactone and risk of breast cancer: a prospective study in New York [^1f485013]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The association between circulating levels of the main lignan enterolactone and breast cancer risk was assessed in a case–control study nested within the New York University (NYU) Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study of cancer, hormones, and environmental factors. The study focused exclusively on enterolactone based on the results of a preliminary study that examined the distribution and long-term reliability of serum measurements of the two main lignans, enterolactone and enterodiol, and of a number of isoflavonoid phyto-oestrogens. With the exception of enterolactone, phyto-oestrogen concentrations were below the detection limits for a large proportion of subjects, and the temporal reliability coefficients were low, indicating that our cohort was not well suited to study the effect of these compounds on disease risk. As some of the mechanisms of action suggested for a protective effect of lignans are related to oestrogen synthesis and bioavailability, we also examined the correlation of serum enterolactone with circulating sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the group of postmenopausal women for whom these measurements were available.

### Fenofibric acid [^84538f22]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolism

Fenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine. A small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine.

In vivo metabolism data after fenofibrate administration indicate that fenofibric acid does not undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent.

Elimination

After absorption, fenofibric acid delayed release capsules are primarily excreted in the urine in the form of fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide.

Fenofibric acid is eliminated with a half-life of approximately 20 hours, allowing once daily administration of fenofibric acid delayed release capsules.

Specific Populations

 Geriatrics

In five elderly volunteers 77 to 87 years of age, the oral clearance of fenofibric acid following a single oral dose of fenofibrate was 1.2 L/h, which compares to 1.1 L/h in young adults. This indicates that an equivalent dose of fenofibric acid delayed release capsules can be used in elderly subjects with normal renal function, without increasing accumulation of the drug or metabolites [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Heightened innate immunity may trigger chronic inflammation, fatigue and post-exertional malaise in ME / CFS [^cd4c7aa2]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysregulated xenobiotic metabolism

Glucuronidation in the liver can contribute to detoxification by removing toxins, xenobiotics, and endogenous compounds. This process may be confounded by gut β-glucuronidases produced by Bacteroidetes that cleave glucuronide conjugates, releasing free xenobiotic compounds and glucuronic acid that are utilized as energy sources. Fecal levels of Bacteroidetes are reported to be elevated in ME/CFS. Concordant with increased β-glucuronidase activity, we observed higher levels of glucuronic acid both before and after exercise (Fig. 2A, B). We used fasting plasma samples; thus, glucuronic acid accumulation is more likely to reflect dysbiosis and dysregulated xenobiotic metabolism than differences in diet.

Proteomic correlates of cellular stress

Before exercise, levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (EIF1) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D3 (UBE2D3) were higher in ME/CFS (Fig. 2E). EIF1 facilitates translational initiation during protein synthesis through interactions with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Elevated plasma levels may result from cellular leakage of EIF1 into circulation, indicating errors in translational initiation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) maintains protein quality control and cellular homeostasis by tagging damaged and misfolded proteins for degradation. These findings are consistent with a hypometabolic state in ME/CFS at rest proposed by Naviaux et al.

After exercise, levels of retina-specific copper amine oxidase (AOC2) and copper homeostasis protein cutC homolog (CUTC) were higher in ME/CFS (Fig. 2F). AOC2 is a copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes oxidation of primary amines, including neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, into aldehydes, H 2 O 2, and ammonia. CUTC facilitates intracellular copper transport and regulates copper homeostasis. Copper is a cofactor for the oxidant defense system, which includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (Supplementary Text 1.3.10 and 1.3.11 for peroxisomal dysfunction and amino acid abnormalities). Elevated post-exercise levels of AOC2 and CUTC indicate increased oxidative stress due to the elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Post-exercise levels of MAPK6 were also elevated (Fig. 2F). MAPK6, an atypical member of MAPK subfamily, is induced upon oxidative stress, leading to the production of IL-8 and the secretion of epithelial-derived factors in chemotaxis. In concert, these findings suggest a prolonged oxidative state in ME/CFS and an increase in oxidative stress levels following exercise.

### Direct supplementation with urolithin A overcomes limitations of dietary exposure and gut microbiome variability in healthy adults to achieve consistent levels across the population [^f8905718]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of the study population failed to produce UA following dietary exposure to PJ

Only 12% of adults in the studied population had detectable levels of UA glucuronide at baseline, i.e. real-life free-living state (Fig. 2A). Subjects were categorized into three producer groups based on circulating UA glucuronide levels: non-producers (no detectable levels), low producers (< 100 ng/mL), or high producers (≥ 100 ng/mL). Six hours after drinking the PJ, plasma levels showed most subjects still did not display gut-mediated production of UA: 24% of subjects had detectable, but low levels of UA glucuronide in circulation and only 4% subjects were above the 100 ng/mL threshold (Fig. 2B). The conversion of pomegranate precursors into UA was markedly increased 24-h after drinking PJ; however, still only ~40% of subjects displayed UA glucuronide plasma levels > 100 ng/mL. The remaining 60% were still either unable to convert (33%) or were poor converters of UA (27%) (Fig. 2C).

Fig. 2
Prevalence of UA producer status in the studied American population.

Subjects were categorized into three producer groups based on circulating UA glucuronide levels: non-producers (no detectable levels), low producers (< 100 ng/mL UA glucuronide), or high producers (≥ 100 ng/mL UA glucuronide). A At baseline only 12% subjects had detectable levels of UA glucuronide in circulation with only 2% subjects classified as high producers. B Six hours following dietary challenge with PJ approx. 28% subjects had detectable levels of UA glucuronide, with only 4% subjects high producers. C One day (T24 hours) after the PJ intake, approx. 40% of subjects had become high converters, whereas 60% still converted poorly or failed to convert the dietary precursors to UA.

### Polyphenols: food sources and bioavailability [^55f0882a]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Polyphenols are abundant micronutrients in our diet, and evidence for their role in the prevention of degenerative diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases is emerging. The health effects of polyphenols depend on the amount consumed and on their bioavailability. In this article, the nature and contents of the various polyphenols present in food sources and the influence of agricultural practices and industrial processes are reviewed. Estimates of dietary intakes are given for each class of polyphenols. The bioavailability of polyphenols is also reviewed, with particular focus on intestinal absorption and the influence of chemical structure (eg, glycosylation, esterification, and polymerization), food matrix, and excretion back into the intestinal lumen. Information on the role of microflora in the catabolism of polyphenols and the production of some active metabolites is presented. Mechanisms of intestinal and hepatic conjugation (methylation, glucuronidation, sulfation), plasma transport, and elimination in bile and urine are also described. Pharmacokinetic data for the various polyphenols are compared. Studies on the identification of circulating metabolites, cellular uptake, intracellular metabolism with possible deconjugation, biological properties of the conjugated metabolites, and specific accumulation in some target tissues are discussed. Finally, bioavailability appears to differ greatly between the various polyphenols, and the most abundant polyphenols in our diet are not necessarily those that have the best bioavailability profile. A thorough knowledge of the bioavailability of the hundreds of dietary polyphenols will help us to identify those that are most likely to exert protective health effects.

### The polyhydroxy acid gluconolactone protects against ultraviolet radiation in an in vitro model of cutaneous photoaging [^b1c7db57]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation damages skin through a variety of mechanisms, including the generation of free radicals. Gluconolactone is a polyhydroxy acid (PHA) that is capable of chelating metals and may also function by scavenging free radicals, thereby protecting skin from some of the damaging effects of UV radiation.

Objective

This study measured the ability of gluconolactone to protect against UV radiation-induced damage.

Methods

The ability of gluconolactone to prevent UV radiation-induced elastin promoter activation was determined in vitro using a transgenic model of cutaneous photoaging. Gluconolactone was also evaluated to determine its ability to promote the formation of sunburn cells in human skin after exposure to UV radiation.

Results

Gluconolactone provided up to 50% protection against UV radiation, as measured in our in vitro system, and did not significantly increase sunburn cells in human skin.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate the ability of the PHA gluconolactone to protect against UV radiation-induced elastin promoter activation. In addition, in vivo studies demonstrated that gluconolactone treatment does not result in a significant increase in sunburn cells. Further investigation of this and other PHAs is necessary to identify their potential role in preventing and repairing cutaneous photodamage.

### The role of metabolism (and the microbiome) in defining the clinical efficacy of dietary flavonoids [^12112f88]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Impacts of age and sex on xenobiotic and flavonoid ADME

The aging process is associated with reduced hepatic perfusion and morphology including reduced hepatocyte density, which has been suggested to reduce the phase I and phase II metabolism of xenobiotics and therefore potentially flavonoid metabolism. However, the impact of aging on the activity of oxidation and conjugation enzymes per se is controversial. In isolated perfused livers from 3- to 6- or 22- to 24-mo-old rats exposed to p -nitrophenol, there was evidence of reduced oxidation and glucuronidation with aging, which was speculated to be partly attributed to reduced cofactor availability. In contrast, no obvious effect of aging was reported in human or rat microsomal UGT activities in response to commonly prescribed medications. In more-recent publications, the individual or interactive effects of aging and sex on a wider range on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes were examined. Fu et al. included a gene-expression analysis of 101 xenobiotic-processing genes including cell transporters, phase I and II enzymes, efflux transporters, and transcription factors that were quantified at 10 time points in the livers of male and female mice across the life span. Complex impacts of both age and sex emerged, whereby the messenger RNA concentrations for 44% of the genes changed in male mice, and 63% of the genes changed in female mice, according to age. Significant upregulation and downregulation were evident, but overall, 40% of the xenobiotic-processing genes were lower in aged male mice and 43% in aged female mice. Kawase et al. noted higher breast cancer–resistance protein, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a1, and UGT1A1 and lower cytochrome 3A1 and cytochrome 32 in young female rats than in male rats, with an age-related downregulation of gene expression that was evident only in female rats. Two recent publications have specifically focused on flavonoids as model compounds. The glucuronidation characteristics of the flavonoid glucoside tilianin and its aglycone acacetin (flavones) were characterized with the use of human UGT isoforms, liver microsomes, and intestinal microsomes that were obtained from different animal species. Overall, and consistent with Kawase et al. higher glucuronidation rates attributed to higher UGT1A1 activities were evident in females across several species. The impact of aging on the glucuronidation of quercetin and genistein in male rat hepatic microsomes was also studied. Overall, although some age-related changes were evident, they were modest in their magnitudes. The glucuronidation of genistein decreased with age. The quercetin total glucuronidation capacity was constant with age, but young and old rats had different metabolite profiles.

### Uridine as a hub in cancer metabolism and RNA biology [^bf65b4bd]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Uridine metabolism may also be linked to chemoresistance by virtue of its role in UDP–GA production. UDP–GA is the substrate used in a process called 'glucuronidation', which is carried out by UDP–glucuronyltransferases (UGTs), a family of 22 enzymes that constitute a phase II detoxification mechanism. The enzymes have differing substrate specificities and can glucuronidate some normal metabolites in addition to xenobiotics (for example, bilirubin). In contrast to phase I detoxification (modification), which occurs primarily in the liver, phase II detoxification activity is spread across multiple organs and in cancer cells themselves. In this reaction, glucuronic acid is conjugated by UGTs to xenobiotic metabolites, which are selectively recognized by the different UGTs. This conjugation has the effects of neutralizing reactive electrophiles and thus detoxifying the compound, as well as rendering them polar and conducive to transport outside of the cell. As such, phase II detoxification represents a mechanism that can increase the chemoresistance of cancer cells. Indeed, various chemotherapeutics have been shown to be glucuronidated and various individual UGTs have been shown to be upregulated in specific tumors. For example, UGT1 and UGT2 isoforms, such as UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and UGT2B17, have been shown to be overexpressed or induced by chemotherapeutics in tumors and can reduce the activity/levels of various chemotherapeutic agents, including irinotecan, sorafenib, raloxifene and tamoxifen. Additionally, targeting individual UGTs has been shown to induce chemosensitivity in cancer cells.

Uridine has long been indicated as a 'rescue agent' against nucleoside chemotherapeutics because of its competitive effect on incorporation into RNA. The link between uridine metabolism and the sugar nucleotide UDP–GA opens a new line of thinking and direction for future research into how uridine metabolism may regulate the chemoresistance of cancer cells via UDP–GA and glucuronidation; thus, targeting uridine or the various enzymatic steps between uridine and UDP–GA formation could be explored as chemosensitization approaches (Fig. 8).

### Alcohol and the liver [^de19ba02]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to acquaint the reader with advances in 2006 in the epidemiology, genetics, detection, pathogenesis and treatment of alcoholic liver disease.

Recent Findings

Important discoveries have been made in pathogenesis and mechanism of disease, with great emphasis on the many pathways leading to oxidative stress, and the novel mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress that is proving to be important in the pathogenesis of many liver diseases. The reliability of ethyl glucuronide and other biomarkers for the detection of alcohol abuse is being better established. There have been no treatment advances for alcoholic liver disease but, on balance, steroids are still favored for carefully selected patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Many compounds tested in rodents may now be available for consideration for clinical trials. Criteria for patient selection and refusal for liver transplantation are being established but the 6 months abstinence rule still holds.

Summary

Insights are being made into the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease but safe and effective therapies for both alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis have yet to be discovered.

### Urolithin C alleviates pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in type 1 diabetes by activating nrf2 signaling [^f02ab18c]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we first demonstrated that UC alleviated pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in T1D, partially dependent on activating Nrf2 signaling to maintain glucose homeostasis, thus preventing the onset of T1D and slowing down its progression. Our findings deepen the understanding of the regulation of pancreatic β-cells in T1D and identify novel agents and targets for T1D treatment. However, the evidence is limited and the translation of these findings to humans is unclear. There are many confounders, such as baseline urolithin levels, other triggers of autoimmunity, age, gender, dietary habit, etc. We consider adopting these steps to promote the translation of our findings to humans. First, the detailed mechanisms by which UC activates the Nrf2 signaling need to be further investigated. Second, the roles of UC and the mechanisms should be explored in human cells. Third, clinical samples should be involved in further studies.

### Drug interaction with UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes is a predictor of drug-induced liver injury [^6377ab55]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

DILI can have profound impacts on human health and finances. It stands as a primary cause of acute liver failure, increasing the risk of hospitalization and death. – Moreover, it has also led to significant financial setbacks within the realm of drug development, manifesting through the failure of drug candidates in clinical trials or market withdrawal of approved drugs due to detected hepatotoxicity during postmarketing surveillance. Consequently, there is a burgeoning interest in comprehending the mechanisms underlying DILI development and in identifying factors predisposing individuals to DILI. Numerous studies have endeavored to formulate predictive models that establish correlations between diverse physicochemical and pharmacological properties of drugs and their associated DILI risks. Among the physicochemical attributes linked to the potential for causing DILI concern are carbon bond saturation and acid/base characteristics, lipophilicity, oral dose, and the rule-of-two (RO2) criteria, which stipulates an oral dose ≥ 100 mg and log P ≥ 3. –

While these physicochemical properties may be predictive of certain pharmacokinetic attributes of drugs, additional pharmacological attributes directly associated with DILI concern are pivotal in decision-making concerning patient care and drug development. Some pharmacological features of drugs linked to higher DILI concern include, but are not limited to, dual inhibition of liver mitochondrial function and the bile salt export pump, formation of reactive metabolites, and certain interactions with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. –

Hepatic metabolism serves as a pathway through which certain drugs may acquire the pharmacological features that predispose them to higher DILI concerns. CYP enzymes are a large class of liver enzymes that catalyze redox reactions in phase I hepatic metabolism. In a previous study investigating correlations between CYP metabolism and DILI risk, it was found that drugs inhibiting CYP enzymes exhibited a dose-dependent association with increased DILI risks, whereas substrates of CYP enzymes were associated with dose-independent higher DILI risks. Notably, there was no observed association between CYP enzyme inducers and DILI risks.

### Hepatocellular shuttling and recirculation of sorafenib-glucuronide is dependent on abcc2, abcc3, and oatp1a / 1b [^10c62c47]. Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, an efficient liver detoxification process dubbed "hepatocyte hopping" was proposed on the basis of findings with the endogenous compound, bilirubin glucuronide. According to this model, hepatocytic bilirubin glucuronide can follow a liver-to-blood shuttling loop via Abcc3 transporter-mediated efflux and subsequent Oatp1a/1b-mediated liver uptake. We hypothesized that glucuronide conjugates of xenobiotics, such as the anticancer drug sorafenib, can also undergo hepatocyte hopping. Using transporter-deficient mouse models, we show here that sorafenib-glucuronide can be extruded from hepatocytes into the bile by Abcc2 or back into the systemic circulation by Abcc3, and that it can be taken up efficiently again into neighboring hepatocytes by Oatp1a/1b. We further demonstrate that sorafenib-glucuronide excreted into the gut lumen can be cleaved by microbial enzymes to sorafenib, which is then reabsorbed, supporting its persistence in the systemic circulation. Our results suggest broad relevance of a hepatocyte shuttling process known as "hepatocyte hopping"-a novel concept in clinical pharmacology-for detoxification of targeted cancer drugs that undergo hepatic glucuronidation, such as sorafenib.

### Codeine: time to say "No" [^1fe09ccb]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Genetic variability in codeine metabolism — prodrug status and CYP2D6 dependence — emphasizes that codeine lacks intrinsic analgesia and requires metabolic activation: Codeine is a prodrug with limited affinity for the μ-opioid receptor and no analgesic effects, and after an oral dose the majority undergoes hepatic glucuronidation or n-demethylation to inactive metabolites; analgesic properties derive from conversion of codeine to morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide, with conversion regulated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme system.

### Carbohydrate-aromatic interface and molecular architecture of lignocellulose [^20a9354a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

With solar energy and carbon dioxide transformed into carbohydrate-rich cell walls, terrestrial plants constitute 80% of the biomass distributed in the biosphere. The secondary cell wall is a lignocellulosic composite deposited once the cellular expansion has ceased, which has evolved into a major source of biopolymers and biofuels. Lignification mechanically strengthens secondary walls; however, the presence of these intractable polyphenols and their association with carbohydrate components contributes to the biomass recalcitrance that renders the feedstock resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis during its conversion to liquid transportation fuel. To cost-effectively access structural polysaccharides for ethanol fermentation, vast efforts have been dedicated to tailoring plants to produce more digestible walls and optimizing deconstruction procedures in biorefineries –. These efforts have not yet reached the full potential due to our limited understanding of cell wall architecture.

The secondary cell wall is assembled by carbohydrate and aromatic constituents, with remarkable complexity and variability. Each elementary cellulose microfibril contains eighteen 1,4-β-glucan chains, which are held together by a hydrogen-bonding network. The exact organization of these glucan chains is unresolved, but recent density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a six-layered organization, likely with 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, and 2 chains in each layer (Fig. 1a). Elementary microfibrils frequently coalesce, forming large fibrils that often span across tens of nanometers. Hemicelluloses, such as xylan, glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, and glucomannan, are highly variable in their monosaccharide composition and linkage pattern. Xylan is among the most found hemicelluloses, and its backbone comprises β-1,4-xylose units in a wide range of conformations, with substitutions by arabinose (Ara) or glucuronic acid (GlcA), and modifications by acetyl (Ac) groups. Lignin contains guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S), and p -hydroxyphenyl (H) phenolic residues, which are interconnected by different types of covalent linkers such as β-O-4 ether-O-aryl, β-β' resinol, and β-5′ phenylcoumaran.

### Androgen-stimulated UDP-glucose dehydrogenase expression limits prostate androgen availability without impacting hyaluronan levels [^4f50c7f0]. Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) oxidizes UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronate, an essential precursor for production of hyaluronan (HA), proteoglycans, and xenobiotic glucuronides. High levels of HA turnover in prostate cancer are correlated with aggressive progression. UGDH expression is high in the normal prostate, although HA accumulation is virtually undetectable. Thus, its normal role in the prostate may be to provide precursors for glucuronosyltransferase enzymes, which inactivate and solubilize androgens by glucuronidation. In this report, we quantified androgen dependence of UGDH, glucuronosyltransferase, and HA synthase expression. Androgen-dependent and androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines were used to test the effects of UGDH manipulation on tumor cell growth, HA production, and androgen glucuronidation. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increased UGDH expression approximately 2.5-fold in androgen-dependent cells. However, up-regulation of UGDH did not affect HA synthase expression or enhance HA production. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that DHT was converted to a glucuronide, DHT-G, at a 6-fold higher level in androgen-dependent cells relative to androgen-independent cells. The increased solubilization and elimination of DHT corresponded to slower cellular growth kinetics, which could be reversed in androgen-dependent cells by treatment with a UDP-glucuronate scavenger. Collectively, these results suggest that dysregulated expression of UGDH could promote the development of androgen-independent tumor cell growth by increasing available levels of intracellular androgen.

### The role of metabolism (and the microbiome) in defining the clinical efficacy of dietary flavonoids [^e9a3d27d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Because ≤ 10% of flavonoids are sulfated, variants in sulphotransferase genes may also affect flavonoid plasma and urinary profiles. Genetic variants in sulphotransferases with associated functional consequences have been identified with SNPs in sulphotransferases 1A1 and 2A1, which are associated with altered drugs responses and sex-steroid concentrations. Cytochrome 3A4 is the most abundant isoform of cytochrome P450 in the adult human liver, with common CYTOCHROME-3A4 variants that have been shown to influence testosterone metabolism. However, as with UGTs, the effects of SULPHOTRANSFERASES and CYTOCHROME and cytochrome genotypes on flavonoid metabolism remain to be tested.

Overall, there is a dearth of information on the genetic determinants of flavonoid metabolism. The previously discussed literature on variants of phase I and II genes that influence the metabolism of an array of endogenous and exogenous compounds may help inform future research in the flavonoid field. However, a justification for the selected gene-variant targets has been rarely provided with the functional consequences of genotype often unknown. Future studies should adopt a more genome-wide approach or targeted genotyping that is focused on the key enzymes specific to flavonoid (rather than drug) metabolism. The selection of which individual variants to assess is a challenge with an intuitive focus on exon variants and, in particular, nonsynonymous SNPs or those in gene-promoter regions that have the potential to exclude potentially highly functional variants in intron regions. Although relatively expensive, genome-wide association studies or whole-gene or -genome sequencings represent a more efficient approach to identifying genotypes that are important in flavonoid ADME and, therefore, potentially bioefficacy. Once a potentially functional genotype has been identified by untargeted approaches, its role should be subsequently confirmed with the use of a prospective recruitment according to the genotype approach in human volunteers along with the use of rodent or cell models in which the native gene has been replaced by human variants to establish the effects of the genotype on enzyme activity and flavonoid ADME.

### Xenobiotic and endobiotic handling by the mucosal immune system [^83d82999]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Mucosal immune cells in the intestinal tract are continuously exposed to a barrage of both foreign and endogenously generated metabolites, termed xenobiotics, and endobiotics, respectively. This review summarizes recent insights into the mechanisms by which xenobiotics and endobiotics regulate intestinal immunity and inflammation.

Recent Findings

The community of enteric microbes (i.e., microbiota) has profound impacts on the development and function of the mucosal immune system. The composition and function of gut microbiota is dynamically regulated by diet, and this interplay dictates which and how many immunomodulatory xenobiotics are present in the intestine. Microbiota also regulate the concentration and composition of circulating bile acids, an abundant class of liver-derived endobiotics with pleotropic immunoregulatory activities. A growing body of literature is emerging that sheds new light on the mechanisms by which xenobiotics and endobiotics interact with germline-encoded receptors and transporters to shape mucosal immune function.

Summary

The complex and dynamic interplay among xenobiotics, endobiotics, and the mucosal immune system is a new frontier in mucosal immunology that is proving fruitful for the discovery of novel and pharmacologically accessible mechanisms with relevance to human inflammatory diseases.

Guidance statements — clinician-facing points specify that clinicians should be familiar with the three main types of hepatotoxicity when evaluating patients with suspected DILI; direct hepatotoxins such as APAP can cause liver injury in nearly all exposed individuals once a threshold dose or duration of use is exceeded; idiosyncratic DILI is largely independent of the dose and duration of medication use and characterized by a low incidence and variable drug latency and clinical and histological features; and idiosyncratic DILI is believed to arise from an aberrant adaptive host immune response to the drug and/or its metabolite(s).

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^2c883516]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Gemfibrozil pharmacology and interaction mechanisms — absorption is rapid after oral administration with nearly 100% bioavailability and peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 2 hours; it is highly protein bound, has an elimination t1/2 of ≈1.5 hours, and is dosed twice daily. Gemfibrozil and particularly its glucuronide metabolite are potent irreversible inhibitors and inactivators of CYP2C8, and both are substrates but not inhibitors of CYP3A4. Gemfibrozil 1-O-β glucuronide and, to a lesser extent, the parent compound also potently inhibit OATP1B1/3-mediated hepatic uptake of statin acids, OATP2B1, Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, the renal transporter OAT3, and statin glucuronidation or lactonization; thus, drug–drug interactions in statin–gemfibrozil therapy may vary with susceptibility to intestinal, hepatic, and renal transporter inhibition and CYP450 metabolism.

### Testosterone undecanoate (undecatrex) [^8733e178]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolism

The androgenic activity of testosterone undecanoate occurs after the ester bond linking the testosterone to the undecanoic acid is cleaved by endogenous non-specific esterases. Undecanoic acid is metabolized like all fatty acids via the beta-oxidation pathway. Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. The major active metabolites of testosterone are dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol.

Excretion

About 90% of a dose of testosterone given intramuscularly is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites. About 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver.

primary objective of selecting the recommended phase II dosage) for oncology drugs have historically been designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose. This paradigm was developed for cytotoxic chemotherapies based on their observed steep dose-response relationships, their limited drug target specificity, and the willingness of patients and providers to. accept substantial toxicity due to the lack of effective alternatives for this serious, life- threatening disease. The MTD was identified by evaluating stepwise, increasing doses in a small number of patients at each dose level for short periods of time until a prespecified rate of severe or life-threatening dose-limiting toxicities.

### Fenofibrate (lipofen) [^c5314427]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elimination

Fenofibric acid is eliminated with a half-life of approximately 20 hours allowing once daily dosing of LIPOFEN.

Metabolism

Following oral administration, fenofibrate is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to the active metabolite, fenofibric acid; unchanged fenofibrate is detected at low concentrations in plasma compared to fenofibric acid over most of the single dose and multiple dosing periods.

Fenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine. A small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine.

In vitro and in vivo metabolism data indicate that neither fenofibrate nor fenofibric acid undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent.

Excretion

After absorption, fenofibrate is mainly excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites, primarily fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide. After oral administration of a single dose of radiolabeled fenofibrate in healthy volunteers, approximately 60% of the dose appeared in the urine, primarily as fenofibric acid and its glucuronide conjugate, and 25% was excreted in feces.

### Risk-benefit assessment of ethinylestradiol using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling approach [^a7ddc0b3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

First‐pass metabolism of EE in the gut and liver

Although EE is well absorbed from the gut, its oral bioavailability is less than 50% due to extensive metabolism in the gut and/or liver during first pass. 14, 15 In vitro incubation of EE in intestinal mucosal cells identified only conjugated metabolites, which constituted 38% of the incubated material. Approximately 90% of the metabolites were sulfo‐conjugates, while the rest were identified as glucuronides. 16 Results of an in vivo mass balance study showed that 30% of the drug was recovered in the feces 2 weeks after oral administration, of which ∼80% was identified as unconjugated EE. 8 The recovery of a high proportion of unconjugated EE in the feces does not necessarily contradict the in vitro study, given that deconjugation of previously conjugated drug by enterocytic microbes and shed enterocytes can also occur in the gut, especially when considering the duration of fecal collection.

A follow‐up in vivo study was performed to assess the extent of EE metabolism in the intestine vs. the liver during first pass by simultaneous sampling from the portal vein and the systemic circulation after oral administration. The results of the study confirmed that conjugation of EE in the gut wall plays a major role in its presystemic metabolism with a gut extraction ratio (E G) of 0.44, while that in the liver (E H) was 0.25. 15 Although this study only measured conjugated metabolites, it was preferentially considered for estimating the fraction escaping gut metabolism (F G) given that the afore‐mentioned in vitro study identified conjugated metabolites as the main product of intestinal metabolism. Based on these data, an F G of 0.56 was assumed for EE with the estimated unbound intrinsic clearance for the gut back‐calculated using the "Q Gut " model 17; of which ∼70% was assigned to sulfation, ∼20% to hydroxylation, and the rest to glucuronidation (see details in the Methods).

### Glucoheptonate [^f4194b72]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

When injected intravenously, Technetium Tc 99m Glucoheptonate is rapidly cleared from the blood. In patients with normal renal function, less than 15% of the initial activity remains in the blood after one hour. About 40% of the injected dose is excreted in the urine in one hour, while about 70% is excreted in 24 hours. In patients with renal disease, the blood clearance and urinary excretion of the radiopharmaceutical are delayed.

Up to 15% of the injected dose is retained in the kidneys. The renal retention is greater in the cortex than in the medulla. The radiopharmaceutical may be bound to the proximal convoluted tubules, which are located primarily in the renal cortex.

Technetium Tc 99m Glucoheptonate tends to accumulate in intracranial lesions that are associated with excessive neovascularity or an altered blood-brain barrier. The drug does not accumulate in the choroid plexus or salivary glands.

### UDP-glucose accelerates SNAI1 mRNA decay and impairs lung cancer metastasis [^4690ca46]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Cancer metastasis is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality, and accounts for up to 95% of cancer-related deaths 1. Cancer cells often reprogram their metabolism to efficiently support cell proliferation and survival 2,3. However, whether and how those metabolic alterations contribute to the migration of tumour cells remain largely unknown. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH) is a key enzyme in the uronic acid pathway, and converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid 4. Here we show that, after activation of EGFR, UGDH is phosphorylated at tyrosine 473 in human lung cancer cells. Phosphorylated UGDH interacts with Hu antigen R (HuR) and converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, which attenuates the UDP-glucose-mediated inhibition of the association of HuR with SNAI1 mRNA and therefore enhances the stability of SNAI1 mRNA. Increased production of SNAIL initiates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thus promoting the migration of tumour cells and lung cancer metastasis. In addition, phosphorylation of UGDH at tyrosine 473 correlates with metastatic recurrence and poor prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Our findings reveal a tumour-suppressive role of UDP-glucose in lung cancer metastasis and uncover a mechanism by which UGDH promotes tumour metastasis by increasing the stability of SNAI1 mRNA.

### The nuclear receptor seven up regulates genes involved in immunity and xenobiotic response in the adultFemale fat body [^ceae0e36]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

The breakdown of toxic molecules involves an elaborate three-phase system to metabolize xenobiotics into innocuous molecules and facilitate their excretion. During phase I, xenobiotics are oxidized by cytochrome P450 (Cyp450) monooxygenases to introduce reactive and polar groups to substrates. These proteins are membrane-bound monooxygenases that are involved in a wide array of physiological processes including detoxification, steroid metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism. Xenobiotic metabolites generated during phase I are further converted by phase II enzymes [glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), and carboxylases] through conjugation reactions that add functional side groups (such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and epoxide) to increase hydrophobicity. Phase III transporters [ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and Organic anion transport proteins (Oatps)] act in the final phase of detoxification to export converted organic products out of the cell.

### UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase regulates hyaluronic acid production and promotes breast cancer progression [^f1b8b94b]. Oncogene (2020). Medium credibility.

An improved understanding of the biochemical alterations that accompany tumor progression and metastasis is necessary to inform the next generation of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies. Metabolic reprogramming is known to occur during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that promotes metastasis. Here, we identify metabolic enzymes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling that are upregulated during EMT and are highly expressed in patients with aggressive mesenchymal-like breast cancer. Activation of EMT significantly increases production of hyaluronic acid, which is enabled by the reprogramming of glucose metabolism. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that depletion of the hyaluronic acid precursor UDP-glucuronic acid is sufficient to inhibit several mesenchymal-like properties including cellular invasion and colony formation in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. We found that depletion of UDP-glucuronic acid altered the expression of PPAR-gamma target genes and increased PPAR-gamma DNA-binding activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that the disruption of EMT-induced metabolic reprogramming affects hyaluronic acid production, as well as associated extracellular matrix remodeling and represents pharmacologically actionable target for the inhibition of aggressive mesenchymal-like breast cancer progression.

### Recommendations for standardizing nomenclature for dietary (poly) phenol catabolites [^8cdac0bc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Phenyl-γ-valerolactones, the main microbiota-derived metabolites of flavan-3-ols, are chemically related to 4-hydroxy-5-(phenyl)pentanoic acids. The most common species include 5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone, 5-(3′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone, and 5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone (Figure 4). They have traditionally been abbreviated as M6, M6′, and M4, respectively, but this is now not recommended because it complicates accurate structural assignment. More details about standardized nomenclature for phenyl-γ-valerolactones can be found in a recent review article by Mena et al.

FIGURE 4
Structure of 5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone.

Urolithins, microbiota-mediated products derived from catabolism of ellagitannins, possess a 6H-dibenzo-[b, d]pyran-6-one structure (Figure 5), making them particularly difficult to assign appropriate structural nomenclature. They represent a special case because they possess 2 phenyl rings and lack a side chain, and therefore a slightly different numbering convention is required. The accepted system for numbering is presented in Figure 5. The adoption of this system avoids issues associated with an oversimplified nomenclature often adopted in the literature, based on assigning "A", "B", or "C" to a structure, such as urolithin-A (3,8-dihydroxy-urolithin), -B (3-hydroxy-urolithin), and -C (3,8,9-trihydroxy-urolithin). The use of the A, B, C nomenclature is not recommended (Table 1) because it easily leads to inaccurate assignments, particularly when describing the positions of human phase II methyl, glucuronide, or sulfate conjugates.

### Recommendations for standardizing nomenclature for dietary (poly) phenol catabolites [^92b15dd2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

It is common when describing conjugated molecules to define the nature of the atom to which the conjugating moiety is attached — for example, O -glucuronide, O -sulfate, and O -methyl. This is necessary in any situation in which alternative points of attachment might be encountered, but as far as the authors are aware, there are no reported human glucuronide or sulfate metabolites of dietary (poly)phenols that are conjugated to a carbon atom. Accordingly, the use of " O " is redundant, albeit not incorrect, but use of the lowercase " o " is incorrect. We also recommend that methyl conjugates be referred to as "methoxy-" rather than " O -methyl" derivatives — for example, 3-(3′-hydroxy-4′-methoxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

The issue of conjugation is often further complicated by commercial vendors describing synthetic reference standards using inaccurate nomenclature. For example, many companies and online databases present the phase II metabolite of 3-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid as 3-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid-3′-glucuronide. As noted previously, a bond position for (poly)phenols and phenolic metabolites should not be assigned twice in structural nomenclature. The accurate representation for the structure under the proposed nomenclature is 3-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid-3′-glucuronide. As another example, phenyl-γ-valerolactone conjugates are often inaccurately annotated as 5-(3 ′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone-4′-glucuronide, although the correct nomenclature is 5-(3′-hydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone-4′-glucuronide. The same applies to the naming of sulfate and methoxy metabolites. In addition, Greek symbols such as "α", "β", and "γ" may be presented as their textual equivalents "alpha", "beta", and "gamma" in some databases in which symbols may not be compatible with certain software or programs.

### Uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase pharmacogenetics and cancer [^a8ffebba]. Oncogene (2006). Low credibility.

The uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) belong to a superfamily of enzymes that catalyse the glucuronidation of numerous endobiotics and xenobiotics. Several human hepatic and extrahepatic UGT isozymes have been characterized with respect to their substrate specificity, tissue expression and gene structure. Genetic polymorphisms have been identified for almost all the UGT family members. A wide variety of anticancer drugs, dietary chemopreventives and carcinogens are known to be conjugated by members of both UGT1A and UGT2B subfamilies. This review examines in detail each UGT isozyme known to be associated with cancer and carcinogenesis. The cancer-related substrates for several UGTs are summarized, and the functionally relevant genetic polymorphisms of UGTs are reviewed. A number of genotype-phenotype association studies have been carried out to characterize the role of UGT pharmacogenetics in several types of cancer, and these examples are discussed here. In summary, this review focuses on the role of the human UGT genetic polymorphisms in carcinogenesis, chemoprevention and cancer risk.

### Circulating conjugated and unconjugated vitamin D metabolite measurements by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry [^03192229]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Phase II metabolism of vitamin D is less well characterized and comprises largely hepatic conjugation reactions adding a sulfate ester by sulfotransferase (SULT) enzymes or a glucuronide moiety by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. These conjugation reactions inactivate the vitamin D metabolite and render it more hydrophilic, facilitating renal excretion. Circulating levels of conjugated vitamin D metabolites have not been well described, although a sulfated form of 25OHD3 (25OHD3-S) in levels that exceed circulating 25OHD3 has been reported. This pattern has been confirmed by more recent liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods that have also reported a 25OHD3 glucuronide form (25OHD3-G) in circulation at low ng/mL levels.

Both sulfate and glucuronide conjugates can undergo deconjugation back to their unconjugated forms by sulfatase and beta-glucuronidase enzymes, respectively. Both deconjugation enzymes have biological roles in local regulation of steroid action within tissues and are also used in analytical measurements for steroid profiling in sports antidoping tests. Although direct measurements of conjugates have become feasible in recent years, analytical procedures including an effective deconjugation step are preferred as this enables a single-step analytical procedure for combined measurements of both unconjugated and conjugated forms. However, the biological role and application of hydrolysis enzymes in the analysis of circulating vitamin D is not known and to our knowledge there are no reported methods for measuring circulating phase II vitamin D metabolites by enzyme hydrolysis. As a result, it is not known whether combined unconjugated and conjugated serum measurements could be a more reliable approach for assessing vitamin D status instead of current methods. To address this, we developed enzyme hydrolysis methods in this study to evaluate the proportions of both conjugated and unconjugated forms of circulating vitamin D metabolites. While circulating phase I metabolites generally increase following supplementation with vitamin D, it is currently unclear what impact supplementation has on conjugation and the concentrations of phase II metabolites. In this study we therefore employed a composite hydrolysis assay using arylsulfatase enzyme variants and beta-glucuronidase prior to LC-MS/MS analysis to provide a comprehensive simultaneous measurement of circulating levels of conjugated and unconjugated forms of vitamin D, notably 25OHD3, 25OHD2, 3-epi-25OHD3, and 24,25(OH) 2 D3, in human serum samples and according to vitamin D supplementation status.

### Ursosiol (ursodiol) [^3866b21d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

About 90% of a therapeutic dose of ursodiol capsules is absorbed in the small bowel after oral administration. After absorption, ursodiol enters the portal vein and undergoes efficient extraction from portal blood by the liver (i.e., there is a large "first-pass" effect) where it is conjugated with either glycine or taurine and is then secreted into the hepatic bile ducts. Ursodiol in bile is concentrated in the gallbladder and expelled into the duodenum in gallbladder bile via the cystic and common ducts by gallbladder contractions provoked by physiologic responses to eating. Only small quantities of ursodiol appear in the systemic circulation and very small amounts are excreted into urine. The sites of the drug's therapeutic actions are in the liver, bile, and gut lumen.

Beyond conjugation, ursodiol is not altered or catabolized appreciably by the liver or intestinal mucosa. A small proportion of orally administered drug undergoes bacterial degradation with each cycle of enterohepatic circulation. Ursodiol can be both oxidized and reduced at the 7-carbon, yielding either 7-keto-lithocholic acid or lithocholic acid, respectively. Further, there is some bacterially catalyzed deconjugation of glyco- and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid in the small bowel. Free ursodiol, 7-keto-lithocholic acid, and lithocholic acid are relatively insoluble in aqueous media and larger proportions of these compounds are lost from the distal gut into the feces. Reabsorbed free ursodiol is reconjugated by the liver. Eighty percent of lithocholic acid formed in the small bowel is excreted in the feces, but the 20% that is absorbed is sulfated at the 3-hydroxyl group in the liver to relatively insoluble lithocholyl conjugates which are excreted into bile and lost in feces. Absorbed 7-keto-lithocholic acid is stereospecifically reduced in the liver to chenodiol.

### Baicalin inhibits influenza A (H1N1)-induced pyroptosis of lung alveolar epithelial cells via caspase-3 / GSDME pathway [^cb2a0b8c]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Baicalin (7-d-glucuronic acid-5, 6-dihydroxyflavone) derived from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis used as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been revealed to exert potential antiviral activity via various pathways, while the molecular mechanisms have not been fully understood. Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death (PCD), is reported to play a crucial role in host cell fate during viral infection. In this study, transcriptome analysis of mice lung tissue reveals that baicalin reverses the alterations of the mRNA levels of PCD-associated genes upon H1N1 challenge, with a concomitant decrease in the population of H1N1-induced propidium iodide (PI) + and Annexin Ⅴ + cells. Intriguingly, we find that baicalin contributes to the survival of infected lung alveolar epithelial cells partly through its inhibition of H1N1-induced cell pyroptosis, which is manifested by reduced bubble-like protrusion cells and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Moreover, the antipyroptosis effect of baicalin in response to H1N1 infection is found to be mediated by its repression on caspase-3/Gasdermin E (GSDME) pathway. Cleaved caspase-3 and N-terminal fragment of GSDME (GSDME-N) are detected in H1N1-infected cell lines and mice lung tissues, which are markedly reversed by baicalin treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-3/GSDME pathway by caspase-3 inhibitor or siRNA exerts an antipyroptosis effect equal to that of baicalin treatment in infected A549 and BEAS-2B cells, indicating a pivotal role of caspase-3 in the antiviral activities of baicalin. Conclusively, for the first time, we demonstrate that baicalin could effectively suppress H1N1-induced pyroptosis of lung alveolar epithelial cells via caspase-3/GSDME pathway both in vitro and in vivo.

### The regulation of steroid action by sulfation and desulfation [^cd1af7d5]. Endocrine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

A. OATP-regulated influx

There are numerous OATPs expressed in almost all epithelia throughout the human body. In addition to conjugated steroids, they are involved in the cellular uptake of a large range of substrates, including bile acids and xenobiotics. The mechanism of OATP-mediated transport remains controversial, although all agree that transport is ATP- and sodium-independent. However, what drives uptake is still ill-defined. OATPs can transport bidirectionally, and evidence suggests that they may act as electroneutral exchangers. For example, some OATPs exchange substrates for intracellular bicarbonate, glutathione, or glutathione conjugates. However, transport mechanisms may differ with different OATPs because glutathione does not mediate OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 uptake. Furthermore, although acidic pH levels (pH 5.5–6.5) generally elevate OATP2B1-mediated transport, this is not the case with regard to E 1 S transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Recent evidence suggests that these two transporters are altered in different ways by both cell membrane potential and local pH conditions.

### Loss-of-function mutations in UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase cause recessive developmental epileptic encephalopathy [^22b95c08]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

As UDP-GlcA is the major product of the UGDH enzyme, it is possible that reduced levels of UDP-GlcA may trigger a cascade of secondary pathogenic events resulting in neurodevelopmental delay and encephalopathy. In support of this, is the recent demonstration that a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the upstream enzyme UGP2 is also responsible for a severe form of developmental epileptic encephalopathy in humans. UDP-GlcA is not only needed for detoxification via glucuronidation, but is also a key component of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). UGDH deficiency might parralel other neurological diseases with defects in GAG synthesis, modification, and degradation. For example, EXTL3 and CHSY1 mutations, which affect heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate synthesis, respectively, cause developmental delay and intellectual disabilities. Defects in heparan sulfate modification caused by NDST1 mutations are responsible for intellectual disability associated with epilepsy. Moreover, mucopolysaccaridoses, diseases caused by defects in GAG degradation, affect cognitive development. In addition, proteoglycans containing GlcA derived from UDP-GlcA are major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and key players in neuronal development and plasticity, particularly in areas important for neuronal migration. In human, various psychiatric and intellectual disorders are caused by mutations in genes involved in ECM homeostasis and may be driven by neuronal migration defects. The central role of UDP-GlcA may open a window for early therapeutic interventions. In plants and lower animals, including zebrafish, UDP-GlcA can be synthesized by two alternative pathways. Apart from UGDH, UDP-GlcA can be generated via the myo-inositol oxygenation pathway from glucuronic acid by glucuronokinase and UDP-glucuronic acid pyrophosphorylase. If a similar route exists in humans, supplementation of glucuronate may help to enhance this alternative pathway and increase levels of UDP-GlcA levels and its essential metabolites. To this date, however, the existence of human homologs of glucuronokinase and UDP-glucuronic acid pyrophosphorylase remains to be proven.

Conservative estimates of disease frequency resulting from germline UGDH mutations projects a prevalence of 1:14,000,000 to 1:2,000,000 (Suppl. Note 1). Considering that developmental epileptic encephalopathies are most commonly caused by de novo dominant mutations, this estimated prevalence seems relatively frequent.

### Ursodiol [^1078e367]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Ursodiol (UDCA) is normally present as a minor fraction of the total bile acids in humans (about 5%). Following oral administration, the majority of ursodiol is absorbed by passive diffusion and its absorption is incomplete. Once absorbed, ursodiol undergoes hepatic extraction to the extent of about 50% in the absence of liver disease. As the severity of liver disease increases, the extent of extraction decreases. In the liver, ursodiol is conjugated with glycine or taurine, then secreted into bile. These conjugates of ursodiol are absorbed in the small intestine by passive and active mechanisms. The conjugates can also be deconjugated in the ileum by intestinal enzymes, leading to the formation of free ursodiol that can be reabsorbed and reconjugated in the liver. Nonabsorbed ursodiol passes into the colon where it is mostly 7-dehydroxylated to lithocholic acid. Some ursodiol is epimerized to chenodiol (CDCA) via a 7-oxo intermediate. Chenodiol also undergoes 7-dehydroxylation to form lithocholic acid. These metabolites are poorly soluble and excreted in the feces. A small portion of lithocholic acid is reabsorbed, conjugated in the liver with glycine, or taurine and sulfated at the 3 position. The resulting sulfated lithocholic acid conjugates are excreted in bile and then lost in feces.

In healthy subjects, at least 70% of ursodiol (unconjugated) is bound to plasma protein. No information is available on the binding of conjugated ursodiol to plasma protein in healthy subjects or PBC patients. Its volume of distribution has not been determined, but is expected to be small since the drug is mostly distributed in the bile and small intestine. Ursodiol is excreted primarily in the feces. With treatment, urinary excretion increases, but remains less than 1% except in severe cholestatic liver disease.

During chronic administration of ursodiol, it becomes a major biliary and plasma bile acid. At a chronic dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day, ursodiol constitutes 30% to 50% of biliary and plasma bile acids.

### Shear stress regulation of endothelial glycocalyx structure is determined by glucobiosynthesis [^4aceacaa]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Endothelial cells exposed to laminar shear stress express a thick glycocalyx on their surface that plays an important role in reducing vascular permeability and endothelial anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and antiangiogenic properties. Production and maintenance of this glycocalyx layer is dependent on cellular carbohydrate synthesis, but its regulation is still unknown. Approach and Results: Here, we show that biosynthesis of the major structural component of the endothelial glycocalyx, hyaluronan, is regulated by shear. Both in vitro as well as in in vivo, hyaluronan expression on the endothelial surface is increased on laminar shear and reduced when exposed to oscillatory flow, which is regulated by KLF2 (Krüppel-like Factor 2). Using a CRISPR-CAS9 edited small tetracysteine tag to endogenous HAS2 (hyaluronan synthase 2), we demonstrated increased translocation of HAS2 to the endothelial cell membrane during laminar shear. Hyaluronan production by HAS2 was shown to be further driven by availability of the hyaluronan substrates UDP-glucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid. KLF2 inhibits endothelial glycolysis and allows for glucose intermediates to shuttle into the hexosamine- and glucuronic acid biosynthesis pathways, as measured using nuclear magnetic resonance analysis in combination with 13 C-labeled glucose.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate how endothelial glycocalyx function and functional adaptation to shear is coupled to KLF2-mediated regulation of endothelial glycolysis.

### Role of S-equol, indoxyl sulfate, and trimethylamine N-oxide on vascular function [^355dda91]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

A comprehensive understanding of the direct effects of TMAO on vascular function and their molecular mechanisms could provide a potentially novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vascular diseases.

Evidence from experimental and clinical investigations has confirmed the role of the gut microbiota in TMAO metabolism, with recent seminal reviews focusing on the relationship between gut microbiota and TMAO in cardiovascular diseases. For example, the association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased circulating TMAO levels had been observed in several pathophysiological states, such as atherosclerosis, preeclampsia, and CKD. Given that microbiota-derived TMA is an important precursor of TMAO generation, the regulation of TMA production, including gut microbiota remodeling (e.g. antibiotics, synbiotics, probiotic functional products, and some natural molecules), and blocking of microbiota TMA lyases (e.g. 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol) can be strategies in the regulation of circulating TMAO. In addition, inhibiting hepatic flavin-monooxygenase 3 activity (e.g. trigonelline, a compound from Trigonella foenum-graecum and guggulsterone, a nuclear factor farnesoid X receptor antagonist) to inhibit the conversion from TMA to TMAO can also be a beneficial strategy. Thus, a theoretical basis for controlling the gut microbiota to regulate TMAO levels will be beneficial for preventing and/or treating cardiovascular diseases. However, one should note that reducing TMAO may also have adverse effects. Therefore, we believe that a new TMAO-targeting therapeutic approach against cardiovascular diseases will be established in the near future.

The number of publications on gut-derived substances and host homeostasis has been growing rapidly. This review mainly focused on the effects of S -equol, indoxyl sulfate, and TMAO on vascular functions. Notably, other substances, such as bile acids and short-chain fatty acids, also play a role in the regulation of vascular functions. Alterations in vascular tone regulation, including the generation of several endogenous vasoactive substances and responsiveness thereto, and their signaling pathways by gut-derived substances may depend on vessel type, exposure duration (e.g. acute or chronic), and host status (sex, age, or disease). Despite the ongoing questions as mentioned previously, we believe that further knowledge on the manipulation of gut-derived substances will lead to new approaches in the prevention and treatment of vascular diseases.
