## Question

can yu take b complex with liver disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to take a B-complex vitamin supplement in the setting of liver disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the composition of B-complex and whether these are water-soluble vitamins. Then, I should verify what major liver society guidelines say about B-vitamin supplementation in chronic liver disease. Next, I will examine disease-specific contexts such as alcohol-associated liver disease, cirrhosis, and cholestatic disease. After that, I need to check for any safety caveats, dosing considerations, or contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I distinguish B-complex from fat-soluble vitamins that carry different risks.

> Let me first confirm the basics: B-complex typically includes thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pyridoxine (B6), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12), all of which are water-soluble and generally excreted in urine when intake exceeds needs, which already suggests a favorable safety profile in liver disease compared with fat-soluble vitamins that accumulate in the liver [^d4f44b0a].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The ACG 2024 alcohol-associated liver disease guideline explicitly recommends offering thiamine, vitamin B12, and zinc if deficiencies exist, which supports targeted B-vitamin repletion in this population. The AASLD 2021 cirrhosis guidance recommends routine assessment and repletion of micronutrient deficiencies, including B vitamins, and supports a pragmatic empiric oral multivitamin in patients with frailty or sarcopenia. The EASL 2022 bleeding and thrombosis guidance advises optimizing hemoglobin by treating iron, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 deficiencies in cirrhosis, especially when invasive procedures are anticipated [^fe83cf4b] [^deb4f54d] [^f17d3af8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify whether any of these recommendations carry cautions about excess dosing. The AASLD cirrhosis guidance notes that excess dosing of some micronutrients can be hepatotoxic, but this pertains to both fat- and water-soluble vitamins and is not a blanket prohibition of B-complex. Importantly, there is no specific warning against standard-dose B-complex in liver disease, and the emphasis remains on correcting documented deficiencies and using reasonable doses [^9efaa525].

> I will now examine disease-specific contexts. In alcohol-associated liver disease, thiamine deficiency is common and clinically consequential due to risks like Wernicke encephalopathy, so thiamine is routinely supplemented. B12 and folate deficiencies are also prevalent and should be repleted. In cirrhosis, malnutrition and micronutrient deficits are frequent, and guidelines endorse assessment and replacement of B vitamins as indicated. In cholestatic diseases like PBC, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are the priority, but water-soluble B vitamins are still supplemented if deficient, often using water-soluble preparations when malabsorption is present [^d9d518f4] [^deb4f54d] [^1f073a23].

> Wait, let me verify safety nuances. While B-complex is generally safe, I should confirm exceptions. Very high-dose niacin used as a pharmacologic agent can be hepatotoxic and is contraindicated in active liver disease, but this is not the modest dose found in typical B-complex multivitamins. Likewise, excess pyridoxine can cause neurotoxicity at high chronic doses, which is a general caution rather than a liver-specific issue. These points argue for using standard, RDA-level B-complex products rather than megadoses or single-nutrient pharmacologic formulations [^0790f984] [^d4f44b0a].

> Let me consider dosing and formulation. I should double-check that routine B-complex products align with physiologic needs. Standard over-the-counter B-complex formulations generally provide roughly 100–300% of the RDA for most B vitamins, which is appropriate for repletion in deficiency states and unlikely to cause toxicity. If malabsorption is suspected, oral crystalline B12 or parenteral B12 can be used for B12 deficiency, and thiamine can be given orally or parenterally depending on severity and context, including Wernicke risk [^7691b9e8] [^d9d518f4].

> But wait, what if the patient has advanced cirrhosis or is decompensated? Does that change the calculus? The same principles apply: assess for deficiencies, replete as indicated, and avoid excess. In hospitalized or severely malnourished patients, early nutrition support with attention to micronutrients is recommended, and B vitamins are part of that support. There is no recommendation to withhold B-complex in decompensated disease; rather, the emphasis is on careful monitoring and correction of deficits within a comprehensive nutrition plan [^ba82eadc] [^deb4f54d].

> I should confirm whether any of the provided sources directly contraindicate B-complex in liver disease. I do not find guideline statements advising against B-complex; instead, multiple high-credibility sources endorse identifying and treating B-vitamin deficiencies in chronic liver disease, including alcohol-related disease and cirrhosis, which supports the safety and appropriateness of B-complex when used at standard doses and guided by clinical assessment [^fe83cf4b] [^deb4f54d] [^f17d3af8].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is practical. Yes, patients with liver disease can generally take a standard-dose B-complex supplement, ideally after screening for deficiencies and in coordination with a clinician. Prioritize repletion of specific deficits such as thiamine, B12, and folate, choose reputable products with RDA-level dosing, avoid high-dose single-nutrient pharmacologic formulations like high-dose niacin, and reassess periodically as liver disease and nutrition status evolve [^fe83cf4b] [^deb4f54d] [^0790f984].

---

In general, **B-complex vitamins are safe** for patients with liver disease when used at standard doses, as they are water-soluble and excess is excreted [^d4f44b0a]. Deficiencies are common in liver disease, especially with alcohol use or cholestasis, so **targeted repletion is often beneficial** [^deb4f54d] [^fe83cf4b]. High-dose niacin (≥ 1 g/day) should be avoided in active liver disease due to hepatotoxicity risk [^0790f984]. Always coordinate with a clinician, monitor liver enzymes if high-dose or prolonged use is planned, and prioritize treating specific deficiencies rather than routine high-dose supplementation.

---

## Safety of B-complex vitamins in liver disease

- **Water-soluble nature**: B vitamins are water-soluble; excess is excreted, so toxicity is uncommon at standard doses [^d4f44b0a].

- **General safety**: B-complex is generally safe in liver disease, but high-dose niacin (≥ 1 g/day) can cause hepatotoxicity and should be avoided in active liver disease [^0790f984].

- **Standard doses**: Typical OTC B-complex products contain safe, RDA-level amounts and are unlikely to cause harm in liver disease.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Deficiency prevalence**: Deficiencies in thiamine, B12, and folate are common in liver disease, especially with alcohol use or cholestasis [^d9d518f4] [^fe83cf4b].

- **Guideline support**: ACG recommends thiamine, B12, and folate supplementation when deficiencies exist, particularly in alcohol-associated liver disease [^fe83cf4b] [^1483e81c].

- **Routine use**: Routine B-complex is not universally recommended; supplementation should be tailored to documented deficiencies and clinical context [^deb4f54d].

---

## Potential benefits of B-complex supplementation

B-complex can **improve nutritional status** by correcting deficiencies and supporting metabolism, growth, and immune function [^a614c630]. Thiamine repletion reduces the risk of Wernicke encephalopathy in alcohol-associated liver disease [^d9d518f4]. B12 and folate support hematopoiesis and may reduce anemia and neuropathy risk [^a614c630].

---

## Risks and considerations

- **Niacin hepatotoxicity**: High-dose niacin can cause liver injury; avoid in active liver disease [^0790f984].

- **Folate masking**: Folate can mask B12 deficiency; ensure B12 status is assessed before folate supplementation [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Some B vitamins may interact with medications (e.g. pyridoxine with levodopa); review all drugs with a clinician.

---

## Clinical recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Alcohol-associated liver disease | Thiamine, B12, and folate supplementation if deficient [^fe83cf4b] [^1483e81c] |
| Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease | B-complex not routine; treat deficiencies if detected [^notfound] |
| Advanced cirrhosis | Assess and replete deficiencies; consider multivitamin if malnourished [^deb4f54d] |
| Active liver disease | Avoid high-dose niacin; use standard-dose B-complex cautiously [^0790f984] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include periodic assessment of **liver enzymes** if high-dose or prolonged B-complex is used. Deficiencies should be reassessed after repletion to ensure correction and prevent excess [^deb4f54d]. Patients should be educated to report new symptoms or supplement changes promptly.

---

## Conclusion and practical advice

B-complex vitamins are **generally safe at standard doses** in liver disease and are often beneficial when deficiencies exist. Avoid high-dose niacin, tailor supplementation to documented needs, and coordinate with a clinician. For most patients, a standard-dose B-complex is acceptable; prioritize treating specific deficiencies and monitor liver enzymes if using higher doses or prolonged courses.

### Antioxidant supplements for liver diseases [^1f7b2365]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Several liver diseases have been associated with oxidative stress. Accordingly, antioxidants have been suggested as potential therapeutics for various liver diseases. The evidence supporting these suggestions is equivocal.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antioxidant supplements for patients with liver diseases.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science to January 2011. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered for inclusion randomised trials that compared antioxidant supplements (beta-carotene, vitamin A, C, E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention for autoimmune liver diseases, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cirrhosis (any aetiology).

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcome measures were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, liver-related morbidity, biochemical indices at maximum follow-up in the individual trials as well as adverse events, quality-of-life measures, and cost-effectiveness. For patients with hepatitis B or C we also considered end of treatment and sustained virological response. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twenty randomised trials with 1225 participants were included. The trials assessed beta-carotene (3 trials), vitamin A (2 trials), vitamin C (9 trials), vitamin E (15 trials), and selenium (8 trials). The majority of the trials had high risk of bias and showed heterogeneity. Overall, the assessed antioxidant supplements had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 1.19, I(2) = 0%), or liver-related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.05, I(2) = 37%). Stratification according to the type of liver disease did not affect noticeably the results. Antioxidant supplements significantly increased activity of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (MD 24.21 IU/l, 95% CI 6.67 to 41.75, I(2) = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to support or refute antioxidant supplements in patients with liver disease. Antioxidant supplements may increase liver enzyme activity.

### Vitamin D for your patients with chronic hepatitis C? [^2c4daf9a]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is increasingly becoming recognized as an important physiological regulator with pleiotropic functions outside of its classical role in skeletal homeostasis. A growing body of clinical evidence highlights the prevalence and risks of vitamin D deficiency in patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C infection, and vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as an adjunct to current standards of care. This review considers the experimental evidence for the anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antiviral effects of vitamin D, and discusses the therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation to protect against liver disease progression and improve responses to treatment.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^a1e7d00b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rationale

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting an estimated 3 in 10 people. The available treatment is far from optimal. Diet and lifestyle changes to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance are the basic management of NAFLD, but these are difficult to achieve and maintain. Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects on oxidative stress, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, there is uncertainty about the effects of vitamin E for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin E alone, or vitamin E in combination with other vitamins or minerals, versus placebo or no intervention in people with NAFLD.

Search methods

We used recommended Cochrane search methods. The latest search was performed on 2 February 2024.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin E alone, or in combination with other vitamins or minerals, at any dose, duration, and route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention, in people with NAFLD of any age, sex, or ethnic origin. We included participants with imaging techniques or histology‐proven NAFLD and minimal alcohol intake, and participants with steatohepatitis who had liver biopsies.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were liver‐related morbidity, health‐related quality of life, non‐serious adverse events, biochemical response, and imaging assessment of the degree of fatty liver.

Risk of bias

We used Cochrane's RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias for each of the predefined outcomes.

Synthesis methods

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included studies

We included 16 randomised clinical trials involving 1066 paediatric and adult participants with NAFLD. Experimental groups received vitamin E alone (14 trials) or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C (2 trials). Control groups received placebo in 13 trials and no intervention in three trials. Daily dosages of oral vitamin E ranged from 298 international units (IU) to 1000 IU. Co‐interventions were lifestyle and low‐calorie diet interventions in 13 trials, ursodeoxycholic acid in one trial, unchanged diet and physical activity in one trial, and baseline treatments for type 2 diabetes in one trial. Nine trials had more than two intervention groups, but we used only the groups in which vitamin E alone or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C were compared with placebo or no intervention. In total, 7.9% (84/1066) of participants dropped out. Follow‐up ranged from 2 months to 24 months.

Synthesis of results

Vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention

The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 20.86; 3 trials, 351 participants; very low certainty evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 12.01; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. There were no data on liver‐related mortality or liver‐related morbidity. The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on physical health‐related quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.74, 95% CI −0.52 to 2.01; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); psychosocial health‐related quality of life (MD −0.57, 95% CI −4.11 to 2.97; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); and non‐serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are also very uncertain. There were no data on proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (MD −9.29, 95% CI −13.69 to −4.89; 11 trials, 708 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (MD −4.90, 95% CI −7.24 to −2.57; 11 trials, 695 participants; moderate certainty evidence) levels compared with placebo or no intervention. Vitamin E may slightly reduce serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (MD −5.21, 95% CI −9.88 to −0.54; 5 trials, 416 participants; very low certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain.

Vitamin E plus vitamin C versus placebo

There were no data on all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, serious adverse events, liver‐related morbidity, health‐related quality of life, and non‐serious adverse events. The effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on reducing serum ALT (MD −0.50, 95% CI −4.58 to 3.58; 2 trials, 133 participants; very low certainty evidence), AST (MD 0.09, 95% CI −3.39 to 3.57; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence), and gamma‐glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (MD 1.58, 95% CI −3.22 to 6.38; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain.

We identified three ongoing trials, and six trials are awaiting classification.

Authors' conclusions

Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know if long‐term treatment (18 months to 24 months) with vitamin E administered alone affects all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, quality of life, or non‐serious adverse events in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo or no intervention. We found no data on liver‐related mortality, liver‐related morbidity, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely reduces ALT and AST slightly when compared with placebo, but whether this has any impact on the clinical course in people with NAFLD is unknown.

The trials on vitamin E plus vitamin C did not report on all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, serious adverse events, liver‐related morbidity, health‐related quality of life, or non‐serious adverse events. Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know the effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on liver enzymes in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo.

Funding

Three trials disclosed no external funding. Five trials were industry funded. Five trials were funded by organisations with no vested interests. Three trials did not provide any information on clinical trial support or sponsorship.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^0b5f80bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and dilutional hyponatremia) should be monitored and corrected. A high index of suspicion for malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies (folate, vitamins A, D, E, K, and complex B) needs to be maintained. Early supplementation of these nutrients is also recommended, particularly in alcoholic liver disease. Hypoglycemia, from impaired gluconeogenesis, should also be expected and promptly corrected. Blood lactate level, a specific marker of tissue ischemia, can be significantly elevated in the context of chronic liver disease due to impaired hepatic clearance. Nevertheless, the trend in serial measurements in serum lactate in response to resuscitation may be a useful adjunct in hemodynamic assessment. Mild increases in aminotransferases (AST and ALT) are commonly noted in chronic liver disease, reflecting active hepatic injury. Marked elevation (greater than 1000 IU/l), however, suggests acute viral, alcoholic, or ischemic hepatitis. In asymptomatic patients with three or more fold increases in ALT/AST levels or any elevation in bilirubin, the incidence of undiagnosed cirrhosis ranges from 6 to 34%.

The precise etiology of the underlying hepatic disease mandates specific treatment measures. Thiamine replacement with glucose infusion is indicated to prevent progression of Wernicke encephalopathy. The risk of symptoms from alcohol withdrawal also mandates supportive measures, as well as multivitamins. Patients on chronic steroids for autoimmune hepatitis should receive a stress-dose adjustment in the perioperative period. Finally, delays in restarting anti-viral therapy for hepatitis should be avoided.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^4a8cdc9a]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Vitamin E — therapeutic effects, key trials, and safety in NASH/NAFLD: The text summarizes that "(1) the use of vitamin E is associated with a decrease in aminotransferases in subjects with NASH, (2) studies in which histological endpoints were evaluated indicate that vitamin E results in improvement in steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning and resolution of SH in a proportion of nondiabetic adults with NASH, and (3) vitamin E did not have an effect on HF." In PIVENS, the pure form of rr-?-tocopherol "800 IU/day" was used "for 96 weeks," and the primary endpoint was more frequent with vitamin E than placebo "(42% vs. 19%; P < 0.001, number needed to treat = 4.4)." In TONIC (children), vitamin E "(800 IU/day)" versus metformin "(500 mg twice-daily)" and placebo showed that "resolution of NASH was significantly greater" with vitamin E "(58% vs. 28%; P = 0.006)." Safety concerns include that "doses of > 800 IU/day were associated with increased all-cause mortality," while critiques and subsequent analyses indicated exclusions and that "the differences were driven by imbalance in males in the trials in question."

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, more specifically with respect to patients with herbal and dietary supplement-induced liver injury, ACG 2021 guidelines recommend to elicit a careful history and obtain appropriate laboratory testing and hepatobiliary imaging to exclude other forms of liver injury in patients with suspected herbal or dietary supplement-induced hepatotoxicity.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^2c21dd84]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Potential participants at both centers were screened for eligibility using a short questionnaire to exclude those likely to have high B‐vitamin biomarkers owing to dietary supplements and fortified foods. Participants were included if they were aged ≥ 50 years and reported that they were not currently taking a supplement containing folic acid or related B‐vitamins, or consuming > 4 portions of B‐vitamin‐fortified food per week consumption levels previously shown to contribute to high B‐vitamin concentrations. Participants were also excluded if they were receiving vitamin B12 injections, had a diagnosis of celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or were taking any medications known to interfere with folate and/or B‐vitamin metabolism.

Our a priori study protocol included an additional step that was implemented after completion of the trial to retrospectively confirm participant eligibility, given that self‐reported dietary supplement usage is prone to error. Rather than relying on self‐reported dietary supplement usage only, we applied biomarker evidence at the time of analysis to identify participants who had been taking a B‐vitamin supplement on the basis of having a biomarker value in the range that could not be achieved through dietary sources only. Using this approach, we identified a small number of additional participants considered to have underreported supplement use at the time of screening and sampling, who were retrospectively deemed ineligible for participation in this trial (Fig. 1).

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^d9d518f4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Thiamine (vitamin B1) in liver disease — deficiency risks and manifestations: Decreased dietary micronutrient intake or absorption and increased excretion can lead to suboptimal nutritional status and cause a variety of complications in liver disease. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin that participates in the initiation of nerve propagation and is an important cofactor for enzymes in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Patients with chronic alcohol misuse or cirrhosis have been found to be thiamine deficient, and thiamine deficiency is especially prevalent in patients with alcohol-related chronic disease due to inadequate dietary intake and through the direct effect of ethanol on thiamine uptake from the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical consequences include peripheral neuropathy or cardiac disease (beriberi) and neurologic impairment characterized by nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion (Wernicke encephalopathy), and Korsakoff syndrome can also develop and is characterized by impaired short-term memory.

Vitamin E in adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) — evidence overview: Vitamin E is an anti-oxidant and has been investigated to treat NASH, and the page summarizes that vitamin E use is associated with a decrease in aminotransferases, causes improvement in steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning with resolution of steatohepatitis in adults with NASH, and has no effect on hepatic fibrosis, although two meta-analyses failed to observe significant histological benefits before PIVENS and TONIC. In the largest clinical trial (PIVENS), the pure form of rr α-tocopherol was administered at 800 IU/day for 96 weeks, and the primary endpoint was achieved more often with vitamin E than placebo (42% vs. 19%, P < 0.001, number needed to treat = 4.4). The page also notes a concern about the controversial issue of whether vitamin E increases all-cause mortality.

### FDA warns about rare occurrence of serious liver injury with use of… [^35b531c1]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition, some cases had other significant pre-existing risk factors such as liver cancer, alcohol abuse, or serious medical illnesses associated with serious liver problems. These factors may have contributed to clinical worsening of liver function or liver failure during treatment with these hepatitis C medicines. In most cases, liver failure or decompensation typically occurred within the first 4 weeks of starting treatment. We will continue to monitor this safety concern and will communicate any new information to the public if it becomes available. We identified 63* cases of worsening liver function called liver decompensation with regimens Mavyret, Zepatier, and Vosevi to treat hepatitis C. Some of these cases led to liver failure and death. Most of these patients had moderate to severe liver impairment and should not have been prescribed these medicines. It is a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir.

Vitamin A in cirrhosis — The liver is the major storage site for vitamin A (> 90%), and most studies indicate that more than 60% of patients with cirrhosis have low serum vitamin A levels with 40% in one study having impaired dark adaptation. A single intramedullary injection of aqueous retinyl palmitate improved night vision at retesting 1 month later, and because retinol binding protein is made in the liver and is frequently low in liver disease — potentially increasing the risk for vitamin A toxicity — supplementation in patients with liver disease/injury must be undertaken with care.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language, publication status, trial design, or date of publication. We excluded studies labelled as 'quasi‐randomised' (i.e. pseudo‐randomised) because the method of allocation of participants is not truly random.

Types of participants

We included randomised clinical trials involving participants of any age, sex, or ethnic origin with NAFLD. Participants had imaging techniques or histology (evidence of histological damage on liver biopsy, including simple steatosis, fatty infiltration plus non‐specific inflammation, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis) showing hepatic steatosis or steatofibrosis (steatosis accompanied by fibrosis), with minimal alcohol intake: preferably a daily alcohol intake less than 20 g in women and less than 30 g in men. According to the new definition, minimal alcohol intake is a weekly intake of 140 g to 350 g for women and 210 g to 420 g for men (average daily 20 g to 50 g for women, 30 g to 60 g for men).

We excluded trials that included people with other causes of hepatic steatosis or steatofibrosis, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis, and genetic liver diseases such as Wilson's disease and haemochromatosis. We excluded trials considering people with one or more causes commonly associated with secondary NAFLD (drugs, surgical procedures, and miscellaneous disorders such as abetalipoproteinaemia or hypobetalipoproteinaemia, partial lipodystrophy, environmental toxins, or total parenteral nutrition). We excluded studies including people with NASH diagnosed by imaging only.

Types of interventions

Experimental intervention

Vitamin E alone.
Vitamin E in combination with other vitamins or minerals.

Vitamin E may have been administered at any dose, duration, route of administration, formulation, frequency, setting, and time of administration, regardless of who provided vitamin E.

Control intervention

Placebo or no treatment.

Co‐interventions were allowed if used equally in the experimental and control groups (e.g. regimens including reduced calorie intake, increased physical activity, or behaviour modification).

Risk of bias assessment in included studies

Two review authors (PYZ and GJ) independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool (available at Risk of bias tools ‐ Current version of RoB 2) and according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed the effect of assignment to the intervention. We used the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) principle to assess the risk of bias domains whenever possible.

We assessed the following risk of bias domains.

Bias arising from the randomisation process
Bias due to deviations from intended interventions
Bias due to missing outcome data
Bias in measurement of an outcome
Bias in selection of the reported result

The signalling questions for these domains are shown in Supplementary material 9. The response options for the signalling questions are as follows.

Yes
Probably yes
Probably no
No
No information

We judged overall risk of bias as follows.

Low risk of bias: the trial is judged at low risk of bias for all domains for this result.
Some concerns: the trial is judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain for this result, but is not at high risk of bias for any of the remaining domains.
High risk of bias: the trial is judged at high risk of bias in at least one domain for this result, or the trial is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains such that our confidence in the result is substantially lowered.

The risk of bias assessment informs the GRADE approach for assessing the certainty of a body of evidence.

Our summary of findings tables (see Certainty of the evidence assessment) contain seven outcomes (i.e. all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, serious adverse events, liver‐related morbidity, health‐related quality of life, non‐serious adverse events, and biochemical response) for which we assessed the risk of bias at the longest follow‐up time point.

Measures of treatment effect

We used Cochrane RevMan software.

Dichotomous/binary data

For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated and presented risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For binary data presented in the summary of findings tables, we calculated illustrative comparative risks where possible.

Until further data supporting its effectiveness become available, vitamin E is not recommended to treat NASH in diabetic patients, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) without liver biopsy, NASH cirrhosis, or cryptogenic cirrhosis. Safety considerations include a large randomized controlled trial in which vitamin E at 400 IU/day was associated with a modest increase in prostate cancer risk with an absolute increase of 1.6 per 1,000 person-years of vitamin E use.

### Decreased liver B vitamin-related enzymes as a metabolic hallmark of cancer cachexia [^205b0ba0]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Cancer cachexia is a complex metabolic disorder accounting for ~20% of cancer-related deaths, yet its metabolic landscape remains unexplored. Here, we report a decrease in B vitamin-related liver enzymes as a hallmark of systemic metabolic changes occurring in cancer cachexia. Metabolomics of multiple mouse models highlights cachexia-associated reductions of niacin, vitamin B6, and a glycine-related subset of one-carbon (C1) metabolites in the liver. Integration of proteomics and metabolomics reveals that liver enzymes related to niacin, vitamin B6, and glycine-related C1 enzymes dependent on B vitamins decrease linearly with their associated metabolites, likely reflecting stoichiometric cofactor-enzyme interactions. The decrease of B vitamin-related enzymes is also found to depend on protein abundance and cofactor subtype. These metabolic/proteomic changes and decreased protein malonylation, another cachexia feature identified by protein post-translational modification analysis, are reflected in blood samples from mouse models and gastric cancer patients with cachexia, underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings.

### Suppressed serological vitamin A in patients with liver cirrhosis is associated with impaired liver function and clinical detoriation [^5df6de19]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The liver plays a profound role in the body and organ homeostasis and is critical to regulate different cellular processes, including metabolisms, synthesis and immune defense, circulation as well as portal hemodynamics. Among the different functions, the storage of essential components, including vitamins is one of the most important ones. In this context, the fat-soluble vitamin A is of vital importance not only for the visual process but also for several other processes, including immune cell function with especially the humoral and cellular immune response. Vitamin A can only be taken orally to the body, and as a fat-soluble vitamin, requires bile acids for absorption. Notably, vitamin A is stored up to 95% in the liver, and vitamin A storage is significantly impaired in chronic liver diseases. Fibrogenesis results from increased production of extracellular matrix by activated hepatic stellate cells. In the context of HSC activation, these cells lose their vitamin A stores which explains the association between vitamin A and chronic liver disease. Consistently, it is well known that chronic liver damage and impaired liver function are inversely correlated with the vitamin A status. Furthermore, progressive malnutrition present in the majority of patients with impaired liver function, that is, liver cirrhosis, further aggravates the vitamin A deficiency. In addition to malnutrition, alcohol consumption has also been identified as an independent risk factor for vitamin A deficiency. As mentioned above Vitamin A is of critical relevance for the immune response due to a limited humoral and cell-mediated immunity and altered phagocytes as well as T cells function has been described in patients with vitamin A deficiency. Given that patients with liver cirrhosis frequently suffer from infectious complications that commonly result in acute decompensation, acute - on - chronic liver failure and even death, vitamin A deficiency is of particular relevance for these patients. This prospective study aims to evaluate the association between liver insufficiency and vitamin A status, investigate the frequency and severity of clinical complications and identify Vitamin A supplementation as a potential therapeutical target.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^a1b1f6a2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding risk of bias, we used the overall risk of bias judgement to inform the GRADE assessment: 'low risk of bias' indicates 'no limitation' (no downgrading); 'some concerns' indicates either 'no limitation' or 'serious limitation' (certainty of evidence is downgraded one level); and 'high risk of bias' indicates either 'serious limitation' or 'very serious limitation' (certainty of evidence is downgraded two levels).

We used the methods and recommendations described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the updated guidance on rating imprecision. We calculated the optimal information size which helped us assess imprecision. We justified all decisions to downgrade the certainty of the evidence using footnotes, and made comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.

We defined the levels of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low following the GRADE Working Group grades of evidence.

High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

We conducted the review according to our published protocol and have reported any deviations from it in the beginning of the Methods section.

Consumer involvement

### Vitamin D supplementation for chronic liver diseases in adults [^a88bf9bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is often reported in people with chronic liver diseases. Therefore, improving vitamin D status could have a beneficial effect on people with chronic liver diseases.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation in people with chronic liver diseases.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. We also searched databases of ongoing trials and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials. All searches were up to January 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults with chronic liver diseases. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol)), or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We contacted authors of the trials to ask for missing information. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs), and for continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and Trial Sequential Analyses-adjusted CIs. We calculated Peto odds ratio (OR) for rare events. We considered risk of bias in domains to assess the risk of systematic errors. We conducted Trial Sequential Analyses to control the risk of random errors. We assessed the quality of the evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 15 randomised clinical trials with 1034 participants randomised. All trials had a parallel group design. Nine trials were conducted in high-income countries and six trials in middle-income countries. All trials were at high risk of bias. Six trials included participants with chronic hepatitis C, four trials included participants with liver cirrhosis, four trials included participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and one trial included liver transplant recipients. All included trials reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants. Participants in six trials had baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at or above vitamin D adequacy (20 ng/mL), while participants in the remaining nine trials were vitamin D insufficient (less than 20 ng/mL). All trials administered vitamin D orally. Mean duration of vitamin D supplementation was 0.5 years and follow-up was 0.6 years. Eleven trials (831 participants; 40% women; mean age 52 years) tested vitamin D 3, one trial (18 men; mean age 61 years) with three intervention groups tested vitamin D 2 and 25-dihydroxyvitamin D in separate groups, and three trials (185 participants; 55% women; mean age 55 years) tested 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Seven trials used placebo, and eight trials used no intervention in the control group. The effect of vitamin D on all-cause mortality at the end of follow-up is uncertain because the results were imprecise (Peto OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.38; I² = 32%; 15 trials; 1034 participants; very low quality evidence). Trial Sequential Analysis on all-cause mortality was performed based on a mortality rate in the control group of 10%, a relative risk reduction of 28% in the experimental intervention group, a type I error of 2.5%, and type II error of 10% (90% power). There was no diversity. The required information size was 6396 participants. The cumulative Z-curve did not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit or harm after the 15th trial, and the Trial Sequential Analyses-adjusted CI was 0.00 to 2534. The effect of vitamin D on liver-related mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.08 to 34.66; 1 trial; 18 participants) and on serious adverse events such as hypercalcaemia (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 100.8; 1 trial; 76 participants), myocardial infarction (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.08 to 6.81; 2 trials; 86 participants), and thyroiditis (RR 0.33 95% CI 0.01 to 7.91; 1 trial; 68 participants) is uncertain because the results were imprecise. The evidence on all these outcomes is of very low quality. The effect of vitamin D 3 on non-serious adverse events such as glossitis (RR 3.70, 95% CI 0.16 to 87.6; 1 trial; 65 participants; very low quality of evidence) is uncertain because the result was imprecise. Due to few data, we did not conduct Trial Sequential Analysis on liver-related mortality, and serious and non-serious adverse events. We found no data on liver-related morbidity and health-related quality of life in the randomised trials included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain as to whether vitamin D supplements in the form of vitamin D 3, vitamin D 2, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or 25-dihydroxyvitamin D have important effect on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, or on serious or non-serious adverse events because the results were imprecise. There is no evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on liver-related morbidity and health-related quality of life. Our conclusions are based on few trials with an insufficient number of participants and on lack of data on clinically important outcomes. In addition, the analysed trials are at high risk of bias with significant intertrial heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence is very low.

### Vitamin B [^7691b9e8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

### Macro-bmasking B deficiency [^6e948c37]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin, abbreviated B 12) deficiency is common. Symptoms develop insidiously, sometimes over the course of several years, and overlap with many other common disorders. The measurement of serum B 12 concentration as a diagnostic test for cellular B 12 deficiency is unreliable, as many people with clinical signs of B 12 deficiency have serum concentrations above the lower population reference limit (140 pmol/L, depending on the assay). In such situations the measurement of the biomarkers methylmalonic acid and homocysteine has been used, but their sensitivity and specificity for demonstrating B 12 deficiency is also limited. This may cause individuals with relevant and readily reversible deficiency to be missed.

Elevated serum B 12 concentrations most commonly reflect recent supplementation with high dose oral vitamin-B 12 -containing preparations or injections. Serum B 12 may also be elevated as a consequence of an underlying disorder such as liver diseases or a (haematologic) malignancy. It has also been demonstrated that immune complexes between serum immunoglobulins and B 12 -vitamin binding protein (macro-B 12) may develop in some individuals, leading to highly elevated serum B 12 concentrations.

We describe a young woman aged 18, who developed macro-B 12, leading to difficulties and delay in making a correct diagnosis of B 12 deficiency.

### Nutrition and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: current perspectives [^dd5d333a]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are diseases in their own right as well as modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. With expanding knowledge on NAFLD pathogenesis, insights have been gleaned into molecular targets for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Lifestyle modifications constitute a cornerstone of NAFLD management. This article reviews roles of key dietary macronutrients and micronutrients in NAFLD pathogenesis and their effects on molecular targets shared with established or emerging pharmacotherapies. Based on current evidence, a recommendation for a dietary framework as part of the comprehensive management strategy for NAFLD is provided.

NAFLD/NASH guideline — vitamin E therapy: Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) administered at a daily dose of 800 IU/day improves liver histology in non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH and therefore it should be considered as a first line pharmacotherapy for this patient population (Strength − 1, Quality − B). Until further data supporting its effectiveness become available, vitamin E is not recommended to treat NASH in diabetic patients, NAFLD without liver biopsy, NASH cirrhosis, or cryptogenic cirrhosis (Strength − 1, Quality − C).

### Vitamin D supplementation for chronic liver diseases in adults [^66eb30cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is often reported in people with chronic liver diseases. Improving vitamin D status could therefore be beneficial for people with chronic liver diseases.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation in adults with chronic liver diseases.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and enquired experts and pharmaceutical companies as to additional trials. All searches were up to November 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults with chronic liver diseases. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol)), or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 27 randomised clinical trials with 1979 adult participants. This review update added 12 trials with 945 participants. We assessed all trials as at high risk of bias. All trials had a parallel-group design. Eleven trials were conducted in high-income countries and 16 trials in middle-income countries. Ten trials included participants with chronic hepatitis C, five trials participants with liver cirrhosis, 11 trials participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and one trial liver transplant recipients. All of the included trials reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants. Participants in nine trials had baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at or above vitamin D adequacy (20 ng/mL), whilst participants in the remaining 18 trials were vitamin D insufficient (less than 20 ng/mL). Twenty-four trials administered vitamin D orally, two trials intramuscularly, and one trial intramuscularly and orally. In all 27 trials, the mean duration of vitamin D supplementation was 6 months, and the mean follow-up of participants from randomisation was 7 months. Twenty trials (1592 participants; 44% women; mean age 48 years) tested vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol); three trials (156 participants; 28% women; mean age 54 years) tested vitamin D 2; four trials (291 participants; 60% women; mean age 52 years) tested 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; and one trial (18 participants; 0% women; mean age 52 years) tested 25-hydroxyvitamin D. One trial did not report the form of vitamin D. Twelve trials used a placebo, whilst the other 15 trials used no intervention in the control group. Fourteen trials appeared to be free of vested interest. Eleven trials did not provide any information on clinical trial support or sponsorship. Two trials were funded by industry. We are very uncertain regarding the effect of vitamin D versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.45; 27 trials; 1979 participants). The mean follow-up was 7 months (range 1 to 18 months). We are very uncertain regarding the effect of vitamin D versus placebo or no intervention on liver-related mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.08 to 34.66; 1 trial; 18 participants) (follow-up: 12 months); serious adverse events such as hypercalcaemia (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 100.8; 1 trial; 76 participants); myocardial infarction (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.08 to 6.81; 2 trials; 86 participants); thyroiditis (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.91; 1 trial; 68 participants); circular haemorrhoidal prolapse (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 65.9; 1 trial; 20 participants); bronchopneumonia (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.32; 1 trial 20 participants); and non-serious adverse events. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes is very low. We found no data on liver-related morbidity such as gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, ascites, or liver cancer. There were also no data on health-related quality of life. The evidence is also very uncertain regarding the effect of vitamin D versus placebo or no intervention on rapid, early, and sustained virological response in people with chronic hepatitis C.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the high risk of bias and insufficient power of the included trials and the very low certainty of the available evidence, vitamin D supplementation versus placebo or no intervention may increase or reduce all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, or non-serious adverse events in adults with chronic liver diseases. There is a lack of data on liver-related morbidity and health-related quality of life. Further evidence on clinically important outcomes analysed in this review is needed.

Sensitivity analysis

Fixed‐effect meta‐analysis showed similar results to the random‐effects model (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.10; I² = 40%; 2 trials, 283 participants).
Best‐worst‐case scenario analysis. When we assumed that none of the participants lost to follow‐up in the experimental intervention group had adverse events, and all those with missing outcomes in the control group had adverse events, we found a similar result (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05; I² = 77%; 2 trials, 283 participants; Analysis 1.12).
Worst‐best‐case scenario analysis. When we assumed that all participants lost to follow‐up in the experimental intervention group had adverse events, and none of those with missing outcomes in the control group had adverse events, we found a similar result (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.26; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 283 participants; Analysis 1.13).
Risk of bias. We judged the overall risk of bias in all trials reporting on this outcome to be some concerns, thereby precluding a sensitivity analysis excluding trials at high risk of bias.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^21d883fb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The findings of this review were limited because the numbers of trials and participants were small; data on some outcomes in subgroup analyses were based on one trial only; and there were no data on liver‐related mortality, liver‐related morbidity, and proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes.

The certainty of the evidence for the clinically relevant outcomes was mainly very low, indicating that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect.

Limitations of the review processes

Certain limitations of this review warrant consideration. As with all systematic reviews, our findings and interpretations are limited by the certainty and quantity of the available evidence on the effects of vitamin E alone or in combination with other vitamins or minerals on NAFLD. The duration of the intervention and follow‐up were short in some trials, making it difficult to establish the certainty of the effects of vitamin E. It should be noted that liver‐related complications due to NAFLD are expected to develop over 8 to 28 years. None of the included trials assessed the effect of vitamin E on the different types of NAFLD, given that NAFL is a more benign condition, and people with NASH are at risk of progression from fibrosis to cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

There are currently no validated surrogate outcome measures in hepatology, and the usage of non‐validated surrogate outcomes may lead to misleading conclusions. Most of the included trials examined normal levels or decrease of biochemical indices and liver steatosis as surrogate outcomes for successful treatment. However, these outcomes do not definitively mean significant improvement in clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the included trials mainly used sonography to evaluate liver steatosis, but this technique is qualitative, and sonographic criteria for different degrees of steatosis are lacking. Most trials did not clearly state how liver steatosis was measured, which could have influenced our results.

The overall risk of bias for the outcomes investigated and reported in the included trials was some concerns.

Insufficient information precluded some of our preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses (which were underpowered).

Another limitation is that it was not possible to investigate whether reduction in the biochemical and ultrasound indices was a consequence of controlled adherence to diet and lifestyle modifications, as only one trial reported the relationship between biochemical and ultrasound changes and low‐calorie diet adherence.

### The role of nutrients in the development, progression, and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^926c7c4b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease in adults and children and is currently the third most common indication for liver transplantation in North America. Its pathogenesis is thought to be secondary to multiple "hits" derived from the dietary components, adipose tissue, immune system, and intestinal microbiota. Lack of physical activity may contribute as well. Nutrients may exert their effect directly or through alteration of the intestinal microbiota. Research focusing on specific dietary components predisposing to NAFLD has shown conflicting results. Total energy intake, and macronutrients, has been linked to the development of NAFLD. Fructose not only contributes to hepatic steatosis but may trigger inflammatory signals as well. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects. The role of vitamins as well as minerals in this field is actively being investigated. In this review, we discuss the evidence-linking macronutrients (such as carbohydrates and fat in general and fructose, fiber, short chain fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty, and choline specifically) and micronutrients (such as vitamin E and C and minerals) with the development and treatment of NAFLD. We also discuss the literature on physical activity and NAFLD.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^80fd3177]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

The evidence for the effect of vitamin E alone or vitamin E combined with vitamin C on all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, HRQoL, non‐serious adverse events, and ultrasound changes is very uncertain. There were no data on liver‐related mortality or liver‐related morbidity. Regarding the effect of vitamin E on biochemical response, there were no data on the proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum ALT and AST levels. The evidence for the effect of vitamin E alone or combined with vitamin C on reducing serum ALP and GGT levels is very uncertain.

The results of our systematic review should be interpreted cautiously because the overall risk of bias for the outcomes investigated and reported in the included trials was some concerns, and we found significant heterogeneity in the analyses of biochemical indices. Furthermore, the numbers of participants and trials that provided the data for our critical outcomes were low, which adds to the risk of both type I and type II errors.

Authors' conclusions

Implications for practice

The evidence for the effects of vitamin E, administered alone, in people with non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)) on clinical outcomes such as all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and non‐serious adverse events is very uncertain. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels. It also may slightly reduce alkaline phosphatases (ALP) levels, although the evidence is very uncertain. Vitamin E may or may not affect gamma‐glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels, and steatosis diagnosed on ultrasound. None of the trials reported on liver‐related mortality, liver‐related morbidity, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes.

The evidence for the effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C in people with NAFLD (MASLD) on liver enzyme levels and steatosis diagnosed on ultrasound is very uncertain. None of the trials reported on all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, serious adverse events, liver‐related morbidity, health‐related quality of life, non‐serious adverse events, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes.

The decision for a person with NAFLD (MASLD) to start vitamin E therapy, in the absence of diet and lifestyle change, should balance the benefits and disadvantages, and integrate the person's values and preferences. Lifestyle modifications were a co‐intervention in 12 out of the 16 trials.

Implications for research

More evidence is needed before any conclusions can be drawn on the safety and effect of vitamin E alone or in combination with vitamin C in people with NAFLD (MASLD), as the certainty of the evidence was generally very low, and there was significant heterogeneity in some analyses. More randomised clinical trials assessing any relationship between vitamin E effect and adherence to lifestyle modification would seem appropriate. The effect of vitamin E on health‐related quality of life also deserves further investigation. Future trials should be designed according to the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement (www.spirit‐statement.org) and reported according to the CONSORT statement (www.consortstatement.org).

Methods

The Methods section of the review has been updated since publication of the protocol.

For rare events such as the critical outcomes of all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events, we presented the risk ratio, and used the Peto odds ratio in sensitivity analysis.

For the important outcome of biochemical response, we found no data on the proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Fifteen out of the 16 included trials reported data on changes in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatases (ALP), and gamma‐glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels; as these results were within the scope of biochemical response, we reported them in our review.

### The epidemiology, impact, and diagnosis of micronutrient nutritional dermatoses part 1: zinc, selenium, copper, vitamin A, and vitamin C [^f03db5df]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Dermatologists play a critical role in diagnosing and managing nutritional deficiencies as they often present with cutaneous findings. Traditionally, nutritional dermatoses are taught in the context of developing countries, famine, population displacement, and poor health care access; however, in the United States, common risk factors include chronic liver disease, alcoholism, psychiatric disease, bariatric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, and hemodialysis. Additionally, nutritional dermatoses may be underdiagnosed in the United States and result in increased morbidity and utilization of hospital resources. There is a need for providers in developed nations to identify these deficiencies, and this review aims to meet that practice gap and provide relevant context to these diseases for dermatologists. This 2-part review series will focus on the epidemiology, impact, appearance, and diagnostic modalities for micronutrient deficiencies, including zinc, selenium, copper, and vitamins A and C in part 1. The companion review will focus on the B-complex vitamins.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: new treatments [^14fbf5d8]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The results of these studies with vitamin E need to be balanced against the emerging body of data that vitamin E may increase all-cause mortality: an additional 39 deaths per 10 000 people for those on high-dose (400 IU/day) vitamin E in a dose-dependent manner starting at 150 IU/day, much less than the doses trialled in NASH. Furthermore, vitamin E therapy may be associated with an increase in prostate cancer in men above 50 years old according to a large study of 35 000 patients, and a 20% increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. In light of these risks, the current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines recommend that use of vitamin E may be considered in nondiabetic adults with NASH, but not diabetic patients or children.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^522c2a76]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is a water soluble vitamin that plays a very fundamental role in DNA synthesis, optimal haemopoesis and neurological function. The clinical picture of vitamin B12 deficiency hence, is predominantly of features of haematological and neuro-cognitive dysfunction.

This review will mainly discuss the physiological roles of vitamin B12, the varied pathophysiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and perspectives on screening for vitamin B12 deficiency and supplementation of vitamin B12 among diabetic patients.

Absorption of vitamin B12

The principal source of vitamin B12 is animal proteins. The preliminary step in the metabolism of vitamin B12 involves its release from animal sources, a process mediated by the action of pepsin and gastric acid. After the release, dietary vitamin B12 binds to the R-protein secreted by the salivary glands. In the duodenum, in the presence of an alkaline medium and pancreatic proteases, the R- protein is hydrolysed to release vitamin B12 which later binds with the intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by the gastric parietal cells.

The vitamin B12 –IF complex is highly resistant to proteolytic degradation. The complex attaches at its specific receptors on the mucosa of the terminal ileum, a site where its absorption occurs. This stage of vitamin B12 absorption is calcium mediated.

The intracellular vitamin B12 is released following IF degradation. This free vitamin B12 attaches to another protein carrier, transcobalamin –II (TC-II) and is later released into the circulation. This vitamin B12 – TC-II complex, also referred to as holo TC-II is then actively taken up by the liver, bone marrow and other vital body cells. The liver serves as the principal storage site of up to 90% of the body's total vitamin B12.

A disruption in any of the described steps above will result into clinical or biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency. This includes insufficient dietary intake especially among alcoholics and vegetarians and malabsorption due to several conditions like chronic atrophic gastritis mainly in the elderly, pernicious anemia, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis and drugs like metformin and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Micronutrients and the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)

The micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are required for optimal expression of life, but are found in relatively small quantities in the body. Excessive ingestion of micronutrients can be stored or excreted from the body. Fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins A and D, are stored in the liver and can produce harm in excessive amounts. Water-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin C and the B vitamins are generally harmless, even when ingested in large quantities, as the excess is excreted in the urine. However, these water-soluble vitamins, especially pyridoxine, can occasionally be detrimental, particularly when used chronically in high amounts or when associated with kidney failure. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, chloride, and sodium are macronutrient minerals, as they are abundant in the body. Obvious examples of harmful, mineral micronutrients include iron, copper, and manganese when ingested excessively.

A daunting task has been the development of RDAs for micronutrients. This is the amount that prevents a deficiency disease for each nutrient. The difficulties in making the determination can be illustrated by the example of scurvy. British sailors in the 17th and 18th centuries developed bleeding gums and skin lesions, ascribed to diminished intake of vitamin C. They were eventually called limeys as the provision of limes, which have an abundance of vitamin C, prevented the development of scurvy when supplied on the ocean-going ships. One can see the difficulties involved in determining the amount of vitamin C needed to prevent or treat the disease, and translate this into the amount of limes to ingest daily. Ideally, those affected with scurvy could enter a trial involving various daily amounts of vitamin C, and find out the least amount to rectify the problem. Of course, a suitable measurement, such as a bleeding time or a measurement of blood vitamin C, would be necessary to make the judgment objective. Finally, the amount of vitamin C contained in each lime would allow calculation of how much of the RDA is contained in each lime. This calculation would have to take into account the freshness of the limes, as the amount of vitamin C would probably be higher in the fresher limes. From an ethical standpoint, the trial could not be done, as it would be inappropriate to give the scorbutic individuals the low doses of vitamin C.

Selection of studies

Two review authors (LLY and HZW) independently inspected citations from the searches and identified relevant records. One review author (HYD) independently re‐inspected a random 20% sample of these records to ensure reliability. Where disputes arose, we acquired the full‐text report for more detailed scrutiny. Three review authors (LLY, HZW, and MB) obtained and inspected full‐text reports of the records meeting the review criteria. One review author (HYD) re‐inspected a random 20% sample of the full‐text reports to ensure reliable selection. We contacted the study authors for clarification to resolve discrepancies. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA 2020 flow diagram.

For the reasons for exclusion of excluded studies, see Supplementary material 3 table. For characteristics of studies awaiting classification, see Supplementary material 4 table. For characteristics of ongoing studies, see Supplementary material 5 table.

We identified and collated multiple reports of the same trial under a single reference ID so that each trial, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review.

### Vitamin A toxicity: when one a day doesn' T keep the doctor away [^a50afa6d]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Vitamin A toxicity has been reported to cause severe liver disease and, occasionally, liver failure. Herein we present the case of a 60-year-old male with symptoms of muscle soreness, alopecia, nail dystrophy, and ascites. He continued to deteriorate with the development of refractory ascites, renal insufficiency, encephalopathy, and failure to thrive. A liver biopsy demonstrated presence of Ito cells and vacuolated Kupffer cells without the presence of cirrhosis. His clinical history revealed ingestion of large doses of vitamin A. His worsening clinical situation ruled out the possibility of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation with resolution of symptoms. Vitamin A toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of noncirrhotic portal hypertension. In conclusion, liver transplantation is a valid option if no improvement occurs in spite of cessation of the medication.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^40581eaa]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Statin use and monitoring in liver disease are delineated with specific recommendations. "Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease." Furthermore, "Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated," while in decompensated cirrhosis, "use of statins… should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit."

### The impact of dietary patterns and nutrition in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^3f5a6524]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. The prevalence of NAFLD has grown proportionally with the rise in obesity, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy dietary patterns, and metabolic syndrome. Currently, in the absence of approved pharmacologic treatment, the keystone of treatment is lifestyle modification focused on achieving a weight loss of 7%-10%, cardiovascular exercise, and improving insulin sensitivity. The primary aim of this review is to outline the effect of different dietetic approaches against NAFLD and highlight the important micronutrient components in the management of NAFLD.

### COVID-19 severity and mortality among chronic liver disease patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis… [^7ec7c2b1]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

The presence of CLD is significantly related to adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients in terms of severity and mortality. Clinicians should develop a comprehensive intervention plan to manage these high-risk patients and reduce COVID-19–related deaths. The mechanism behind this is probably through the release of various proinflammatory hepatokines, which might contribute mechanistically to developing a severe form of COVID-19 infection. Several studies have found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CLD had an acute rise in liver enzymes, which results in a severe condition requiring mechanical ventilation and even leading to death. Discussion We found that the risk of COVID-19 severity and death was twice as high among CLD patients than among non-CLD patients.

Similar results were observed in a review conducted by Wu and Yang in which COVID-19 patients with CLD had more than 4 times the chance of developing severe disease and almost twice the chance of dying compared with non-CLD COVID-19 patients. Reviews conducted by Sharma et al and Yadav et al also found higher chances of developing severe disease and death among COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pre-existing liver diseases. Patients with elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were also reported to have higher chances of severe illness and death. The possible reason for the higher risk of severity among NAFLD patients could be the complex interplay of chronic active inflammatory pathways between the COVID-19–associated cytokine storm and NAFLD. Injury caused by the accumulation of fat in the liver could exacerbate the cytokine storm and worsen the prognosis of patients.

In addition, liver fibrosis has been linked with a higher risk of severity among COVID-19 patients. Hence, liver fat accumulation and subsequent fibrosis may be the reasons for NAFLD patients' more deficient outcomes. A similar mechanism was also observed for MAFLD because it was found to exacerbate the virus-induced inflammatory cytokine storm by increased reactive oxygen production and hepatic release of the proinflammatory cytokines in the COVID-19 patients. Our findings have implications for clinical management. Although patients with any liver pathology have some adverse outcomes, the magnitude almost doubles if the patients have CLD. Results of our meta-analysis should encourage clinicians worldwide to provide extra attention and intensive care for patients with CLD, who should be provided with advanced management to prevent adverse clinical outcomes.

### Vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with acute or chronic liver diseases [^e6d7fd3e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in the course of liver cirrhosis. Several treatments are used for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with liver diseases. One of them is vitamin K administration, but it is not known whether it benefits or harms people with acute or chronic liver disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This is an update of this Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin K for people with acute or chronic liver disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Controlled Trials Register (February 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2 of 12, 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1946 to February 2015), EMBASE (Ovid SP) (1974 to February 2015), Science Citation Index EXPANDED (1900 to February 2015), and LILACS (1982 to 25 February 2015). We sought additional randomised trials from two registries of clinical trials: the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. We looked through the reference lists of the retrieved publications and review articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status for assessment of benefits and harms. We considered observational studies for assessment of harms only.

Data Collection and Analysis

\We aimed to summarise data from randomised clinical trials using Standard Cochrane methodology and assess them according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We found no randomised trials on vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with liver diseases assessing benefits and harms of the intervention. We identified no quasi-randomised studies, historically controlled studies, or observational studies assessing harms.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review found no randomised clinical trials of vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with liver diseases. The benefits and harms of vitamin K need to be tested in randomised clinical trials. Until randomised clinical trials are conducted to assess the trade-off between benefits and harms, we cannot recommend or refute the use of vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with liver diseases.

### Vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases [^7c1b9c45]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in the course of liver cirrhosis. Several treatments are used for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases. One of them is vitamin K administration, but it is unknown whether it benefits or harms patients with liver disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin K for patients with liver disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (September 2007), which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2007), EMBASE (1980 to September 2007), Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to September 2007), and LILACS (1982 to November 2007). Additional randomised trials were sought from two registries of clinical trials, ClinicalTrials.gov and Sistema de Información Esencial en Terapéutica y Salud, the reference lists of the trials found, and reviews identified by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from randomised clinical trials were to be summarised by standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies.

Main Results

We could not find any randomised trials on vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review found no randomised clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases. The effects of vitamin K need to be tested in randomised clinical trials. Unless randomised clinical trials provide evidence of a treatment effect and the trade off between potential benefits and harms are established, policy-makers, clinicians, and academics should not use vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^04116d88]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Vitamin E for NASH — in the multicenter randomized controlled trial PIVENS, treatment with vitamin E 800 IU daily for 96 weeks improved histology (≥ 2-point reduction in NAS) compared with placebo, and a reduction in serum ALT to < 40 U/L and by ≥ 30% of baseline value after initiation of vitamin E is associated with improvement in histological parameters; although no study has demonstrated that vitamin E meaningfully reduces fibrosis, a retrospective study of 236 patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis showed lower hepatic decompensation (37% vs. 62%, p = 0.04) and higher transplant free survival (78% vs. 49%, p < 0.01) with vitamin E use; potential risks — including bleeding and specifically hemorrhagic stroke and conflicting data on prostate cancer — should be discussed before long-term high-dose (eg, 800 IU daily) therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^ba82eadc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline nutritional recommendations in liver disease include the following with on-page strength and quality labels: We suggest early administration of oral or enteral nutrition supplementation therapy in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis or alcohol-associated hepatitis, we suggest implementation of nutritional supplementation therapy (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) without cirrhosis, we suggest treatment with natural vitamin E 800 IU daily (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest coffee consumption, preferably ≥ 2 cups per day, in patients with chronic liver disease to reduce risk of hepatic fibrosis progression or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are managed with diuretic therapies, we cannot recommend for or against strict sodium restricted diets (insufficient evidence, no recommendation). We suggest not restricting dietary protein in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We suggest a diet enriched in vegetarian sources of protein in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy who require nutritional supplementation. We recommend the use of branched chain amino acids (when available) in addition to standard-of-care treatment in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend incorporating late evening snacks in patients with cirrhosis to improve body mass index, lean muscle tissue, and reduce the risk of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

### Chronic liver diseases and the potential use of S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a hepatoprotector [^6470a2ff]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic liver diseases result in overall deterioration of health status and changes in metabolism. The search for strategies to control and combat these hepatic diseases has witnessed a great boom in the last decades. Nutritional therapy for controlling and managing liver diseases may be a positive influence as it improves the function of the liver. In this review, we focus mainly on describing liver conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and intrahepatic cholestasis as well as using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a dietary supplement and its potential alternative therapeutic effect to correct the hepatic dysfunction associated with these conditions.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^82a22457]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — guidance on pharmacologic therapy and supplements states that metformin at 500 mg twice-daily offers no benefit to children with NAFLD and thus should not be prescribed to specifically treat NAFLD or NASH, and the effect of higher doses is not known. Vitamin E 800 IU/day offers benefit to children with biopsy-proven NASH; long-term safety of high-dose vitamin E in children is unknown, and Vitamin E may be used to treat NASH in children, but risks and benefits should be discussed with each patient. Evidence for omega-3 fatty acids is mixed in children, with a combination of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid failing to show significant therapeutic benefit in one study, whereas docosahexaenoic acid administered at 250 mg/day for 6 months showed significant improvement in hepatic fat as well as cardiometabolic risk factors in another study.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^ee8d5d79]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy nutrition — Malnutrition is often underdiagnosed, and approximately 75% of patients with HE suffer from moderate-to-severe protein-calorie malnutrition with loss of muscle mass and energy depots; sarcopenia has been proven to be an important negative prognostic indicator in patients with cirrhosis. All HE patients should undergo an assessment of nutritional status by taking a detailed dietary history, with anthropometric data and muscle strength measurement as practical, useful measures of nutritional status, and the patient should undergo a structured dietary assessment, preferably by a dietician, or other specially trained staff. Small meals evenly distributed throughout the day and a late-night snack should be encouraged, with avoidance of fasting; glucose may be the most readily available caloric source, but should not be utilized as the only nutrition. Hyperalimentation should be given only to patients that cannot cooperate, by gastric tube to patients who cannot take the required amount, and parenterally to other patients. There is no firm data on the benefits of vitamin and mineral supplementation; specific micronutrient replacement is given if there are confirmed measured losses, and zinc supplementation is considered when treating HE, and if Wernicke's is suspected, large doses of thiamine should be given parenterally and before any glucose administration.

### Folate and retinal vascular diseases [^33b2fab5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemistry of folic acid

Folate is a collective name for a family of water-soluble vitamins (vitamin B9) that have similar properties and share a similar structure with pteroylglutamic acid. It includes natural folate and folic acid. In nature, folate exists in leafy green vegetables, fresh fruits, beans, nuts, liver, and kidneys, mainly as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and formyltetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is an oxidized and stable synthetic form of folate that can only be obtained from fortified food, supplements, and pharmaceuticals. Its chemical structure is illustrated in Fig. 1. Both natural folates and folic acid are converted into 5-mTHF, the final product of the folate cycle, which is the principal active metabolite of folate. Its stable calcium salt is widely used for pharmaceutical use.

Fig. 1
Chemical structure of folic acid

Food folates (polyglutamate derivatives) are hydrolyzed at the mucosal epithelial cell brush border by folyl-poly-glutamate carboxypeptidase to the monoglutamate form. Then, both food folates and folic acid are absorbed in the proximal small intestine (jejunum) via the proton-coupled folate transporter. In mucosal cells, folic acid is reduced to tetrahydrofolate (THF) by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). (Fig. 2) Then, THF is metabolized to 5-mTHF with the aid of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). 5-mTHF is both an active and final product of folate in the body, which accounts for approximately 98% of folates in human plasma. After absorption, it is released into the portal circulation, most of it is taken up by the liver, and the rest of it is secreted into the gut by the bile duct and recirculated by the enterohepatic cycle. Endogenous folate exists in free and combined forms in plasma.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Cholestatic or end-stage liver disease — focused physical examination findings map to likely deficiencies as follows: General edema suggests protein deficiency; head, ears, eyes, nose, throat (HEENT) findings include angular cheilitis (iron), glossitis (vitamin B complex), dry eyes or decreased tears (vitamin A), and gingival hyperplasia (vitamin C); respiratory tachypnea indicates thiamine (acidosis); cardio-vascular tachycardia due to heart failure corresponds to protein, thiamine, selenium, carnitine, whereas tachycardia due to anemia corresponds to iron and vitamin B12; musculoskeletal signs include widened wrists or rachitic rosary (vitamin D), fractures (vitamin D, vitamin K, Ca, Mg, P), bone pain (vitamin D), and muscle aches or cramps (carnitine, Ca, Mg); neurologic findings include loss of DTR with truncal and limb ataxia (vitamin E), ophthalmoplegia or peripheral neuropathy (vitamin E, thiamine), and numbness or paresthesias (essential fatty acid deficiency [EFAD]); skin findings include perifollicular keratosis (vitamin A), alopecia or periorificial rashes (zinc), dry or rough skin (essential fatty acid deficiency), petechiae or purpura (vitamins K/C), Beau's lines in nails (protein), poor wound healing (vitamins A/C, copper, zinc), and hair discoloration (protein); gastrointestinal diarrhea suggests zinc deficiency. EFAD is defined as essential fatty acid deficiency and HEENT as head, ears, eyes, nose, throat.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^bf3e1f17]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Critical outcomes

All‐cause mortality

No trials reported data on all‐cause mortality.

Liver‐related mortality

No trials reported data on liver‐related mortality.

Serious adverse events

No trials reported data on serious adverse events.

Important outcomes

Liver‐related morbidity

No trials reported data on liver‐related morbidity.

Health‐related quality of life (HRQoL)

No trials reported data on HRQoL.

Non‐serious adverse events

One trial reported "no significant side effects" (Harrison 2003), and the other trial reported no side effects or adverse events (Nobili 2006).

Biochemical response

No trials reported the proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes, such as ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT.

Two trials (139 participants) reported final scores of ALT, AST, and GGT (Harrison 2003; Nobili 2006), for a follow‐up of six months (Harrison 2003) and 12 months (Nobili 2006).

The effect of vitamin E plus vitamin C versus placebo on reducing ALT levels (MD −0.50, 95% CI −4.58 to 3.58; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 133 participants; very low certainty evidence; Analysis 2.7), AST levels (MD 0.09, 95% CI −3.39 to 3.57; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence; Analysis 2.8), and GGT levels (MD 1.58, 95% CI −3.22 to 6.38; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence; Analysis 2.9) is very uncertain.

An insufficient number of trials precluded subgroup analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

Fixed‐effect meta‐analysis showed the same results as random‐effects meta‐analysis for ALT levels (MD −0.50, 95% CI −4.58 to 3.58; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 133 participants), AST levels (MD 0.09, 95% CI −3.39 to 3.57; 1 trial, 88 participants), and GGT levels (MD 1.58, 95% CI −3.22 to 6.38; 1 trial, 88 participants).
Risk of bias. We judged the overall risk of bias in all trials reporting on this outcome to be some concerns, thereby precluding a sensitivity analysis excluding trials at high risk of bias.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of the cobalamin-related remethylation disorders cblC, cblD, cblE, cblF, cblG, cblJ and MTHFR deficiency [^9b4b9572]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

The following main questions and outcomes of interest in males and females with any type of onset (early or late) of one of the diseases of interest were addressed (outcomes in parentheses).
Which clinical signs are characteristic and allow timely diagnosis (Outcome: timely clinical diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)
Which biochemical parameters allow timely and valid diagnosis? (Outcome: valid, timely laboratory diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)
How can we prevent death and avoid/treat severe organ damage (Outcome: survival, severe organ complications; this outcome is considered critical)
How can we prevent or treat eye disease and neurocognitive impairment? (Outcome: visual and neurocognitive function; this outcome is considered critical)

In a first step, all reports made available to the panelists were graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria by the authors who had assigned themselves according to their expertise to five major working groups focusing on the topics "clinical signs and symptoms"; "differential diagnosis"; "laboratory/biochemical parameters"; "disease course and outcome"; "treatment". Due to the rarity of the diseases, studies and reports of all types of designs (from case reports and case series to metaanalyses) were included; randomised controlled trials were not available.

The working groups prepared drafts on their topics, which were carefully evaluated in moderated discussion groups. Elaboration and grading of recommendations was accomplished by moderated, consensus-oriented discussions according to the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group" approach (Guyatt et al,); a patient representative was present at these meetings. Finally, for each outcome the quality of the evidence was rated in one of three categories (low, moderate, high) as defined by the GRADE working group. The strength of a recommendation (strong recommendation, recommendation and suggestion; for more information see Supplementary material) was summarised from written assessments from the panelist using the following set of questions:
Are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms/burden or vice versa?
Is there high, moderate or low quality evidence? Please consider: Risk of bias Study design Directness and consistency of results Magnitude of effect Dose–response gradient Publication bias
Are you confident that the recommendation meets typical values and preferences of the target population (e.g. patients, parents)?
Are the resources worth the expected net benefit following the recommendation?
Overall strength of recommendation: weak or strong?

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^944d1c36]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

A 2015 review by Sato and colleagues assessed the efficacy of vitamin E on liver function and histology in people with NAFLD/NASH and included five randomised trials involving 401 participants. We included all five of these trials in our review.

A 2021 review by Vadarlis and colleagues assessed the effects of vitamin E on biochemical and histological parameters in adults with NAFLD and included eight randomised trials involving 923 participants. We included seven of these trials in our review; the remaining one trial diagnosed the NASH participants by ultrasound and therefore did not fulfil our inclusion criteria.

A 2023 review by Vogli and colleagues assessed the effects of vitamin E on biochemical parameters in people with NAFLD and included 12 studies involving 794 participants. We included nine of these studies; the remaining three studies did not fulfil our inclusion criteria as one study was not a randomised trial; lifestyle interventions differed between groups in one trial; and NASH was diagnosed by ultrasound in one trial.

Our results are consistent with the six reviews that found that vitamin E reduced levels of ALT and AST. Regarding ALP, the Sato and colleagues' review found a reduction based on two trials, and our review found similar results based on very low certainty evidence. The Lin and colleagues' review found that vitamin E had no effect on ALT, AST, and GGT. One Cochrane review reported that vitamin E might increase enzyme levels, while our review found a different result. None of the seven reviews reported results on all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, serious adverse events, liver‐related morbidity, HRQoL, non‐serious adverse events, or imaging response.

### Best practice in primary care pathology: review 1 [^ca869c7c]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

This first best practice review examines four series of common primary care questions in laboratory medicine, namely: (i) measurement and monitoring of cholesterol and of liver and muscle enzymes in patients in the context of lipid lowering drugs, (ii) diagnosis and monitoring of vitamin B12/folate deficiency, (iii) investigation and monitoring of paraprotein bands in blood, and (iv) management of Helicobacter pylori infection. The review is presented in a question-answer format, referenced for each question series. The recommendations represent a précis of guidance found using a standardised literature search of national and international guidance notes, consensus statements, health policy documents, and evidence based medicine reviews, supplemented by MEDLINE EMBASE searches to identify relevant primary research documents. They are not standards but form a guide to be set in the clinical context. Most are consensus rather than evidence based. They will be updated periodically to take account of new information.

### Association between serum vitamin B12 and risk of all-cause mortality in elderly adults: a prospective cohort study [^afd4bd29]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The precise underlying mechanisms of the association between elevated serum vitamin B12 and mortality have not been fully established, some explanations however have been proposed. Firstly, increased liver cell renewal and damage (caused by liver diseases) may disrupt its reabsorption by the liver (the biggest reservoir of vitamin B12 in the body), which alternatively increases its leakage from the liver. Second, upregulation of haptocorrin and transcobalamin synthesis or shifted binding affinity of transport proteins for vitamin B12, as consequences of chronic renal failure, hematological disorders or genetic polymorphism for encoding transcobalamin, can cause a high serum vitamin B12 status as well. Third, infectious diseases and cancers can also lead to the increase of serum vitamin B12 concentrations. Typically, the majority of the aforementioned diseases are more prevalent among older adults than younger ones. Therefore, increased concentration of serum vitamin B12 might be a proxy for an unhealthy status in elderly adults, which could be used as a predictor of mortality.

### Thiamine treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection [^fbdf6dc4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic hepatitis B is an international health concern that causes cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure, and death. Current treatment options are expensive and associated with side effects; however, indirect evidence suggests a relationship between relative thiamine deficiency and chronic hepatitis B infection.

Methods

The authors present three case studies wherein multiple crossovers of daily thiamine administration were used to evaluate a hypothesized association between thiamine treatment and aminotransferase levels.

Results

In each case study, thiamine administration was associated with reduction in aminotransferase levels and the fall of HBV DNA to undetectable levels. Analyses by t test demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in aminotransferase levels in all three cases.

Conclusions

The relationship between thiamine administration and chronic hepatitis B infection warrants further study. If proven effective in reducing liver damage or inducing remission of the hepatitis B virus in larger trials, thiamine will offer obvious advantages over the current treatments for chronic viral hepatitis B infection.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to nutritional support, EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of nutraceuticals for reducing liver damage/fibrosis and improving liver-related outcomes in adult patients with MASLD.

Reporting bias assessment

Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of the results. These are described in Chapter 13 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small‐study effects. We used funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or more trials. We did not use funnel plots where all trials were of similar sizes. We sought statistical advice on the interpretation of funnel plots when used.

We planned to perform adjusted rank correlation and a regression asymmetry test for detection of bias, and considered a P value less than 0.10 significant in these analyses.

Synthesis methods

Our primary analysis included all eligible trials where outcome data were provided. We used the random‐effects model meta‐analysis as our main analysis, according to Chapter 10 of Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We presented all results with 95% CIs using RevMan software.

We planned to conduct meta‐analysis only where it was meaningful to do so, as described in Chapter 12 (Table 12.1.a) of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. If meta‐analysis was not possible, we would summarise the main findings and results of the included trials in a narrative format.

We investigated heterogeneity between trials by considering the I² statistic alongside the Chi² P value. We used a P value of 0.10 to determine statistical significance.

We interpreted the I² statistic as follows.

0% to 40%: might not be important.
30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity.
50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity.
75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.

Where we found considerable inconsistency, we attempted to determine the reasons for it by examining whether data had been entered correctly. We also attempted to inspect the graph visually and remove outlying trials to see if homogeneity was restored.

Where unanticipated clinical or methodological heterogeneity was obvious, we simply stated hypotheses regarding this for future reviews or versions of this review. We did not anticipate undertaking analyses relating to this.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: new treatments [^8709711c]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin E

Apart from targeting aspects of the metabolic syndrome that may have beneficial liver effects, liver-specific therapies have also been investigated in NASH. The role of oxidative stress in disease pathogenesis, in particular, has initiated several studies of antioxidants, primarily vitamin E. Vitamin E consists of eight tocopherols; α-tocopherol is the most active. Its presence in the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes allows prevention of the nonenzymatic oxidation of cell constituents by free radicals. Vitamin E may also inhibit profibrotic activity and downregulates nuclear factor (NF)-κB-mediated inflammatory pathways in the liver. Preclinical in-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that in two fibrosis models, vitamin E can ameliorate liver injury blocking both apoptotic pathways and mitochondrial toxicity.

The Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial, described earlier, is the largest and most recent study comparing pioglitazone and vitamin E at 800 IU/day to placebo in nondiabetic, noncirrhotic patients; it reported that vitamin E improved all histological lesions in NAFLD except for fibrosis, and patients taking vitamin E had a greater than two-point improvement on NAS score significantly more often compared with placebo. A pilot study suggested that pioglitazone and vitamin E are superior to pioglitazone alone but the study was not appropriately powered. The positive and encouraging results seen in adult NAFLD may not extrapolate to paediatric NAFLD. The largest trial of vitamin E in paediatric NAFLD, the Treatment of NAFLD in Children (TONIC) trial, randomly assigned children and adolescents to receive vitamin E (800 IU/day) vs. metformin (1 g/day) or placebo for 2 years. Vitamin E significantly improved hepatocyte ballooning but not lobular inflammation, steatosis nor fibrosis. The primary endpoint of reduction in ALT levels, more often than placebo, was not met.

### Management of obesity across women's life course: FIGO best practice advice [^40c7bcb1]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

4 LIFELONG HEALTH IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN LIVING WITH OBESITY

As shown in Figure 1, obesity can affect many aspects of a woman's health beyond pregnancy. This section highlights key areas for providers of women's health care. Cardiovascular health, diabetes mellitus, COVID‐19 and pandemic considerations, and fertility are covered elsewhere.

4.1 Gastrointestinal and liver diseases

Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

The prevalence of NAFLD increases with increasing BMI. A higher incidence of gestational diabetes and early pregnancy miscarriages exists among women with NAFLD.NAFLD can develop into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis over 5–7 years, leading to fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is the second most common cause of liver transplantation and hepatocellular carcinoma. Women with NAFLD could benefit from assessment 6–12 weeks after giving birth to avoid long‐term liver complications.

Cholelithiasis

Obesity, female sex, and multiparity are associated with increased risk of cholelithiasis. Women choosing to manage obesity with rapid weight loss interventions and/or surgery have a paradoxical increased risk of cholelithiasis., Therefore, screening women with class III obesity for cholelithiasis and complications of cholelithiasis, such as cholecystitis and pancreatitis secondary to choledocholithiasis, following weight loss interventions is recommended.

4.2 Micronutrient deficiency without weight loss surgery

Obesity, particularly class III obesity, is associated with several micronutrient deficiencies. This is likely due to aberrations in absorptive, metabolic, and hormonal functions in these individuals. The most common deficiencies among this group include folate, vitamins B1, B12, A, and C, and iron. Such deficiencies may be exacerbated by pregnancy. Thus, dietary and blood screening of micronutrient levels with appropriate supplementation may be necessary.
