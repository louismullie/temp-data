## Question

Flomax when to take it better at night or daytime

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether tamsulosin (Flomax) is better taken at night or during the day, and how to determine the best time to take it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA prescribing information actually says about administration timing. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics and whether steady-state coverage is truly 24 hours. Next, I will examine safety considerations, especially orthostatic hypotension and the "first-dose phenomenon", and whether evening dosing mitigates risk. After that, I should review evidence on nocturia and whether nighttime dosing improves outcomes. Finally, I will integrate these into practical, patient-centered recommendations and a concise bottom line, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the labeled administration instructions, because I need to ensure I'm not overinterpreting timing. The FDA labeling directs tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily, taken approximately 30 minutes after the same meal each day, with dose escalation to 0.8 mg if there is inadequate response after 2–4 weeks; critically, there is no mandated morning or evening requirement, so timing is flexible as long as it is consistent and taken with food [^112AHe5N] [^111yzPmx] [^113VBEDP].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic rationale before I jump to conclusions about timing. Tamsulosin reaches peak plasma concentration about 4–5 hours after dosing under fasting conditions and 6–7 hours with food, and steady state is achieved by day 5 with once-daily dosing; importantly, food reduces peak exposure by roughly 30–40%, which is why the label recommends taking it after a meal to blunt Cmax and potentially reduce adverse effects, and this 24-hour coverage supports flexibility in choosing morning or evening dosing [^1172hkBX] [^112AHe5N].

> I should confirm the safety signal around orthostatic hypotension, especially during initiation and restarts, because that could influence timing. Clinical trials show orthostatic symptoms are more frequent 4–8 hours after dosing, and large pharmacoepidemiologic studies demonstrate a transient increase in severe hypotension requiring hospitalization during the first 4–8 weeks after starting or restarting tamsulosin, with the highest risk in weeks 1–4; this "first-dose phenomenon" is less pronounced than with nonselective alpha-1 blockers, but it is real and clinically meaningful [^111dzyNB] [^111RJL4i] [^111WrShC] [^1116VR6W].

> Hold on, I should verify whether evening dosing meaningfully reduces hypotension-related harms. Observational analyses and clinical practice recommendations suggest that taking alpha-1 blockers in the evening, with food, and avoiding hazardous activities during initiation can mitigate syncope and fall risk; this aligns with the labeled advice to take tamsulosin after a meal and to change positions slowly, and it is consistent with first-dose precautions used for other alpha blockers like terazosin, which are traditionally dosed at bedtime to blunt hypotensive effects [^111sGi3E] [^113VBEDP] [^112CuCfm] [^115r9bG1].

> Next, I should review whether nighttime dosing improves nocturia outcomes, since that could tip the balance for some patients. Let me consider the evidence: a randomized study of tamsulosin reduced nocturnal frequency and increased hours of undisturbed sleep, and a small study adding ramelteon to ongoing alpha-blocker therapy further reduced nocturia episodes. While these data are supportive, they are not definitive for timing per se, so I should be cautious not to overstate causality [^1158feXU] [^112k8K8T].

> But wait, what if the patient's main concern is daytime urinary symptoms rather than nocturia? I need to ensure the recommendation remains individualized. Because tamsulosin provides 24-hour coverage, symptom control should be similar regardless of morning versus evening dosing; therefore, aligning the dose with the time of day that minimizes adverse effects and maximizes adherence is reasonable, and there is no evidence that morning dosing is superior for daytime symptom control [^1172hkBX] [^112AHe5N].

> I should double-check drug–drug interaction considerations that might influence timing. Concomitant PDE5 inhibitors can potentiate hypotension with alpha blockers; however, studies with tadalafil and vardenafil show that when tamsulosin is dosed consistently and separated by a few hours, clinically significant hypotension is uncommon, though caution is still warranted, particularly during initiation or dose changes [^113pSWq2] [^116UC3t1] [^114QotZL].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and make sure it aligns with the evidence. For most patients, taking tamsulosin in the evening, about 30 minutes after the same meal each day, is a sensible default because it leverages the labeled food effect to blunt Cmax, reduces exposure to orthostatic symptoms during daytime activities, and may modestly aid nocturia-related sleep quality. If evening dosing is inconvenient or causes next-day grogginess, consistent morning dosing after breakfast is acceptable, with the key being consistency and post-meal administration [^112AHe5N] [^1172hkBX] [^111sGi3E].

> I should confirm initiation precautions so I don't understate risk. During the first week and after any dose increase or restart, patients should rise slowly from supine or seated positions, avoid driving or hazardous tasks if they feel lightheaded, and consider taking the dose when they can remain seated or lying down for several hours; this is especially important in older adults or those on multiple antihypertensives, where fall risk is higher [^113VBEDP] [^111RJL4i] [^111sGi3E].

> Bottom line, after reviewing the label, pharmacokinetics, safety, and limited timing-specific data, I should conclude that tamsulosin can be taken either in the morning or at night, but evening dosing after a meal is a reasonable first choice to mitigate orthostatic effects and may help with nocturia, whereas morning dosing is acceptable if it better fits the patient's routine. In all cases, take it consistently 30 minutes after the same meal and titrate to 0.8 mg if needed after 2–4 weeks [^112AHe5N] [^111yzPmx] [^1172hkBX].

Flomax (tamsulosin) should be taken **once daily, about 30 minutes after the same meal each day** [^112AHe5N] [^113VBEDP] to optimize absorption and reduce GI upset [^notfound]. There is **no evidence that morning or evening dosing is superior**; choose the time that best fits your routine and stick to it [^111yzPmx]. Evening dosing may help if dizziness occurs, as you can rest afterward [^111sGi3E]. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember the same day; if you miss the whole day, skip it and resume the next day — do not double the dose [^113VBEDP]. Consistency in timing and administration with food are the key factors for efficacy and tolerability [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

- **Absorption**: Tamsulosin is well absorbed (> 90%) [^1172hkBX] under fasting conditions, with peak plasma concentration (Cmax) at 4–5 hours and area under the curve (AUC) increasing by ~30% with food.

- **Effect of food**: Taking tamsulosin with food delays Tmax to 6–7 hours and reduces Cmax by ~30%, which may reduce peak-related side effects (e.g. dizziness) [^1172hkBX].

- **Steady-state**: Achieved by day 5 of once-daily dosing, supporting consistent timing for stable exposure [^1172hkBX].

---

## Clinical evidence on timing of administration

There is **no direct evidence** that morning is superior to evening dosing for efficacy or safety [^notfound]; both schedules provide comparable symptom control and side-effect profiles. The main clinical considerations are **consistency and patient preference** [^113VBEDP].

---

## Practical considerations for morning dosing

Morning dosing may be preferred when:

- **Daily routine**: Your routine naturally includes a consistent morning meal and activity schedule [^113VBEDP].

- **Daytime symptoms**: Daytime urinary symptoms predominate and you prefer daytime coverage [^notfound].

- **Side-effect management**: You experience drowsiness or fatigue with evening dosing.

---

## Practical considerations for evening dosing

Evening dosing may be preferred when:

- **Nighttime symptoms**: Nocturia or nighttime urinary frequency predominates [^notfound].

- **Dizziness mitigation**: You experience dizziness or orthostatic hypotension; evening dosing allows rest afterward [^111sGi3E].

- **Daily routine**: Your routine naturally includes a consistent evening meal and bedtime schedule [^113VBEDP].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing timing

- **Age**: Older adults may be more prone to orthostatic hypotension; evening dosing with caution may be beneficial [^111sGi3E].

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease or concurrent antihypertensives may increase hypotension risk; evening dosing with caution is reasonable [^113VBEDP].

- **Lifestyle**: Shift work or irregular schedules may favor timing aligned with consistent meals and rest [^113VBEDP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **consistent once-daily dosing** about 30 minutes after the same meal, with timing individualized to patient preference and tolerance [^112AHe5N] [^111yzPmx]. No major guideline **prefers morning over evening dosing** for tamsulosin [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Factor** | **Morning dosing** | **Evening dosing** |
|-|-|-|
| Patient preference | Suitable if daytime symptoms predominate or morning routine is consistent | Suitable if nighttime symptoms predominate or evening routine is consistent |
| Side-effect management | Preferred if dizziness or orthostatic hypotension is minimal | Preferred if dizziness or orthostatic hypotension occurs; allows rest afterward |
| Clinical evidence | No evidence of superiority | No evidence of superiority |
| Guideline recommendation | Acceptable | Acceptable |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

There is **no evidence that morning dosing is superior to evening dosing** for Flomax; the optimal time is the one that best fits your routine and enhances adherence [^notfound]. Take it consistently **30 minutes after the same meal each day** [^112AHe5N], and consider evening dosing if you experience dizziness or have prominent nighttime symptoms [^111sGi3E].

The dose of a medicine prescribed is so much a part of everyday practice and prescribing guidance that it might appear a surprising subject for a symposium. In reality, however, many questions about choosing doses are unresolved. Here we summarise the talks given at our March 2004 symposium — Deciding the dose to prescribe — incorporating views raised in discussion.

### Tadalafil (Cialis) [^113pSWq2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tamsulosin — In the first tamsulosin study, a single oral dose of tadalafil 10, 20 mg, or placebo was administered in a 3 period, crossover design to healthy subjects taking 0.4 mg once per day tamsulosin, a selective alpha[1A]-adrenergic blocker (N = 18 subjects). Tadalafil or placebo was administered 2 hours after tamsulosin following a minimum of seven days of tamsulosin dosing.

Blood pressure was measured manually at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after tadalafil or placebo dosing. There were 2, 2, and 1 outliers (subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of > 30 mm Hg at one or more time points) following administration of tadalafil 10 mg, 20 mg, and placebo, respectively. There were no subjects with a standing systolic blood pressure < 85 mm Hg. No severe adverse events potentially related to blood-pressure effects were reported. No syncope was reported.

In the second tamsulosin study, healthy subjects (N = 39 treated; and 35 completed) received 14 days of once per day dosing of tadalafil 5 mg or placebo in a two-period crossover design. Daily dosing of tamsulosin 0.4 mg was added for the last seven days of each period.

Blood pressure was measured manually pre-dose at two time points (-30 and -15 minutes) and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours post dose on the first, sixth and seventh days of tamsulosin administration. There were no outliers (subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of > 30 mm Hg at one or more time points). One subject on placebo plus tamsulosin (Day 7) and one subject on tadalafil plus tamsulosin (Day 6) had standing systolic blood pressure < 85 mm Hg. No severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure were reported. No syncope was reported.

### Ramelteon combined with an α ₁-blocker decreases nocturia in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112k8K8T]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows patient data including the type of α 1 -blocker taken and other baseline characteristics including age, prostate volume, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, and data of uroflowmetry. The data were distributed normally. In this study, no differences were noted in age, past history or medication use between the patients who were likely to respond and those who were not. There was also no significant difference in nocturia at baseline between patients taking tamsulosin silodosin and naftopidil. Five patients had hypertension with anti-hypertension drugs, three had diabetes mellitus with anti diabetes mellitus drugs, and three had a medication of a diuretic. None of the patients who were medicated with antidiabetes mellitus drugs had neurogenic conditions.

Table 1
Patient characteristics

After 1 month of taking ramelteon, mean score on IPSS question 7 (nocturia) showed improvement, decreasing significantly from 2.88 ± 0.70 to 2.41 ± 1.00 (P = 0.03). However, total IPSS and QoL score did not change significantly (Table 2). Mean total OABSS also improved, decreasing significantly from 6.31 ± 2.15 to 5.38 ± 2.16 (P = 0.03), and likewise mean OABSS for question 2 (nighttime frequency of nocturia) decreased significantly from 2.63 ± 0.50 to 2.13 ± 0.62 (P = 0.01; Table 3). The mean total N-QOL score did not change significantly. However, N-QOL scores for questions 2 (Low in energy the next day) and 6 (Careful about drinking water) showed improvement, decreasing significantly from 1.60 ± 1.30 to 1.13 ± 0.99 (P = 0.048) and 2.20 ± 1.52 to 1.73 ± 1.28 (P = 0.0480), respectively (Table 4). There were no differences between the types of alpha-blockers in terms of the effectiveness against nocturia. A total of 13 patients (63.2%) exhibited a decrease in the number of nocturia episodes by more than one time. Nine (47.3%) patients exhibited nocturia one or fewer times per night. (p < 0.01). A total of 16 patients (84.2%) wished to continue taking ramelteon because they felt that their urinary pattern was more convenient than before. On the other hand, three patients (15.8%) did not want to continue taking ramelteon because they felt that there had been no changes after adding ramelteon to their medications. Because of the small sample size in this study, we could not predict the patients who were likely to respond to ramelteon.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^11655Gjd]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Patients were considered exposed to study drugs from the dispensing date until the end of day supply. We used time varying definitions for drug exposure for all analyses, allowing patients to fluctuate between exposure classifications or contribute time to multiple exposure categories simultaneously depending on prescribing patterns. As conducted by a previous study, we formed a discrete time dataset for computational efficiency, where follow-up time was segmented into seven day increments. For each increment, one of seven exposure classifications was assigned for tamsulosin based on the majority of exposed days during the week. Mutually exclusive classifications for exposure were as follows: weeks 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12 after drug initiation; weeks 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12 after restarting treatment (after a four week treatment gap); and maintenance drug use (that is, exposed person time not categorized as another exposure covariate). This methodology for exposure categorization allowed us to explicitly model risk for the study outcome within set risk windows during the course of drug treatment, and it has been used in a previous pharmacoepidemiological study. Figure 2shows person time allocation among exposure covariates.

Fig 2 Person time allocation for drug exposure covariates. Schematic shows an example characterization of person time into exposure covariates for a given patient. Included person time starts at initiation of drug treatment and ends when healthcare eligibility finishes. The patient in this schematic contributes person time to three new use covariates, maintenance use, and two restarting exposure covariates. Dotted regions = actual exposed person time; diagonal line regions = attribution of person time to exposure covariates; vertical black lines = enrolment eligibility; vertical grey lines = exposure assessment; horizontal black lines = differentiates between depiction of exposure covariates along longitudinal patient time

Outcome ascertainment

Our outcome was severe hypotension requiring hospital admission. The outcome was ascertained as a primary hospital discharge diagnosis of hypotension (ICD-9-CM codes 458.0, 458.1, or 458.9). This algorithm has been used in a previous study, the event was considered to occur on the first day of admission to hospital, and the ascertainment can be considered validated as a falsification endpoint.

### WITHDRAWN: tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111cSsTZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate which can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. The treatment goal for men with BPH is to relieve these bothersome symptoms.

Objectives

This systematic review assessed the effects of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compatible with BPH.

Search Strategy

Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Trials were eligible if they (1) randomized men with BPH to receive tamsulosin in comparison with placebo, other BPH medications or surgical interventions and (2) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements, and (3) had a treatment duration of 30 days or longer. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of tamsulosin with placebo, medical or surgical interventions was the change in urologic symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary flow measures (peak urine flow rate). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 4122 subjects met inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4 to 26 weeks, and no placebo-controlled study lasted longer than 13 weeks. The mean age of subjects was 64 years. Baseline symptom scores and urine flow rates demonstrated that men had moderate LUTS. Tamsulosin improved symptoms and peak urine flow relative to placebo. The weighted mean differences (WMD) for mean change from baseline for the Boyarsky symptom score for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg doses of tamsulosin relative to placebo were -1.1 points (95% CI = -1.49 to -0.72; 12% improvement) and -1.6 points (95% CI = -2.3 to -1.0; 16% improvement), respectively. The WMD for mean change from baseline in peak urine flow were 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.59 to 1.51) and 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.65 to 1.48) for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg, respectively. Tamsulosin (0.2 mg to 0.4 mg) was as effective as other alpha antagonists and the phytotherapeutic agent Permixon® in improving symptoms and flow rates though the doses of all alpha-antagonists studied may not have been optimal. Discontinuations from treatment for any reason and discontinuations "due to adverse events" were similar in the low dose tamsulosin (0.2 mg) and placebo groups but increased to 16% in trials utilizing a 0.8 mg dose of tamsulosin. Low dose tamsulosin was generally well tolerated although not all the trials reported specific adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events that were significantly greater than placebo included dizziness, rhinitis and abnormal ejaculation. Adverse effects increased markedly as tamsulosin dosing increased, and were reported in 75% of men receiving the 0.8 mg dose. Men receiving a 0.2 mg dose tamsulosin were less likely to discontinue treatment compared to men receiving terazosin.

Authors' Conclusions

Tamsulosin provided a small to moderate improvement in urinary symptoms and flow compared to men receiving placebo in men with BPH. Effectiveness was similar to other alpha antagonists and increased only slightly with higher doses. Long term effectiveness and ability to reduce complications due to BPH progression could not be determined. Adverse effects were generally mild but their frequency, including withdrawals, increased substantially with the higher doses that are generally available for treatment.

### Cost-effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination of solifenacin and oral controlled adsorption system formulation of tamsulosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115trNa1]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

This de novo model may have some limitations. First, due to lack of published data, some assumptions were made using expert opinion only, including resource use and the proportion of patients going on to have surgery. Other key assumptions were required, for example due to the absence of persistence data on FDCs or free combinations in LUTS, and due to there being no head-to-head studies for the combinations assessed in the present study. Additionally, the primary trials for the combination therapies evaluated in our analysis had some notable differences in the patient populations and outcome measures that prohibit an indirect treatment comparison. Patients in these trials had IPSS ≥ 12 or 13, ≥ 2 or 3 urgency episodes/24 hours and ≥ 8 micturitions/24 hours. In contrast to NEPTUNE, TIMES had an inclusion criterion for overactive bladder symptoms but not one for voiding symptoms. In addition, the primary efficacy endpoint in TIMES was the Perception of Treatment benefit question and the secondary endpoints included bladder diary variables, and change in episodes/24 hours of urgency urinary incontinence, urgency, total micturitions and night-time micturitions. In NEPTUNE, the co-primary endpoints were total IPSS and TUFS.

Second, although the model included tamsulosin, solifenacin and tolterodine, which are commonly prescribed for men with LUTS, other common α-blockers (e.g. alfuzosin) and antimuscarinics (e.g. oxybutynin) were not considered in our model. Additionally, although men with LUTS may receive α-blocker or antimuscarinic monotherapy, our model was restricted to evaluation of combination treatment only. Therefore, future models will be required to compare the cost-effectiveness of monotherapy versus combination therapy and to compare other feasible combination therapies.

Third, the model allowed treatment to be discontinued at any cycle (i.e. every 4 weeks), but switching of treatment was not allowed until 12 weeks; this cut-off is consistent with the assessment point of several recent large randomised clinical trials in LUTS. However, it is feasible that switching could occur before Week 12 in clinical practice for tolerability, efficacy or other reasons.

### Combination therapy… [^114jfc7f]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Tamsulosin, sold under the brand name Flomax among others, is a medication used to treat symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and chronic prostatitis in men. It is also used to help with the passage of kidney stones. The evidence for benefit with a kidney stone is better when the stone is larger. Tamsulosin is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, blurry vision, and sexual problems. Other side effects may include feeling lightheaded with standing due to changes in blood pressure, and angioedema. Tamsulosin is an alpha blocker and works by relaxing muscles in the prostate. Specifically it is an α~1~-adrenergic receptor blocker. Tamsulosin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 24th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 22 million prescriptions.

Medical uses Tamsulosin is used for benign prostatic hyperplasia and to help with the passage of kidney stones. Tamsulosin, however, appears to be effective only for stones over 4 mm and less than 10 mm in size. Tamsulosin is also used as an add-on treatment for acute urinary retention. Men may void more successfully after catheter removal if they are taking tamsulosin, and are less likely to need repeat catheterization. Tamsulosin does not decrease the overall size of the prostate in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and is not recommended for the prevention of prostate cancer. Combination therapy The results of the CombAT and tamsulosin) trial in 2008 demonstrated that treatment with the combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin provides greater symptom benefits compared to monotherapy with either agent alone for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The combination medication dutasteride/tamsulosin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in June 2010. Adverse effects
- Eyes: People taking tamsulosin are prone to a complication known as floppy iris syndrome during cataract surgery. Adverse outcomes of the surgery are greatly reduced by the surgeon's prior knowledge of the person's history with this drug, and thus having the option of alternative techniques.
- Severe hypotension.
- Alpha-blockers, including prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or tamsulosin, do not appear to affect all-cause mortality in heart failure rehospitalization in those also receiving β-blockers.
- Tamsulosin can also cause retrograde ejaculation, which occurs when semen is redirected to the urinary bladder instead of being ejaculated normally. This is because tamsulosin relaxes the muscles of the urethral sphincters, which are normally closed during ejaculation.

Mechanism Tamsulosin is a selective α~1~ receptor antagonist that has preferential selectivity for the α~1A~ receptor in the prostate versus the α~1B~ receptor in the blood vessels. When alpha 1 receptors in the bladder neck, prostate, ureter, and urethra are blocked, a relaxation in smooth muscle tissue results. This mechanism decreases resistance to urinary flow, reduces discomfort associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and facilitates passage of kidney stones. Brand names Tamsulosin was first sold in 1997 under the brand name Flomax. The US patent expired in October 2009. The US Food and Drug Administration approved generic versions in March
2010. It is sold by various companies, including Boehringer Ingelheim and CSL. Tamsulosin hydrochloride extended-release capsules are sold under the brand names Urimax 0. 4, Tamlocept 0.

### Tamsulosin for urolithiasis: a review of the recent literature and current controversies [^111BVbyE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In the United States, urolithiasis affects approximately 1 in 11 people, and there is evidence that the prevalence is increasing. A relatively recent treatment strategy for urolithiasis involves using medical expulsive therapy (MET) to increase the likelihood of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones. The 2 leading drug classes for MET are alpha-1-andrenergic receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers. Tamsulosin, an alpha-1-adrenocepter blocking agent, is thought to induce spontaneous stone passage by relaxing ureteral smooth muscle tone. However, tamsulosin has not been proven effective for increasing ureteral stone passage and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication. There is a relative paucity of data on the efficacy of tamsulosin for urolithiasis, and of the published results, there are conflicting conclusions from the data. Because of the acute and often severe nature of symptoms from urolithiasis, emergency medicine physicians are frequently the first to diagnose and treat this condition. This has led to tamsulosin being frequently prescribed from the emergency department (ED) for off-label use without the support of high-quality evidence. If tamsulosin is proven effective, its use in the treatment of urolithiasis could offer several important advantages. The number of procedures, length of hospital stay, and health care costs after the initial ED visit could potentially be reduced. Tamsulosin may also increase patient satisfaction by reducing the invasive treatment and decreasing the time to stone passage. This review focuses on the efficacy of tamsulosin based on stone location, after shock wave lithotripsy, compared with other MET drugs and in the acute setting of the ED.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^114vbHc6]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Efficacy variables

Twenty-four hour ABPM devices (Spacelabs, Redmond, Washington, USA) were set to take readings every 15 min during the day and every 30 min at night. Office BP was recorded three times at each visit, and an average of the three readings was recorded for analysis. The primary efficacy analyses were BP control rate, defined as the percentage of patients at Week 26 with a 24-h maBP 130/80 mmHg or less and change from baseline to Week 12 in mean ambulatory SBP (maSBP). The secondary efficacy variables at Weeks 12 and 26 were office mean sitting BP (msBP), daytime (> 8 a.m. to ≤ 10 p.m.) BP, night-time (> 12 a.m. to ≤ 6 a.m.) BP, daytime/night-time BP ratio, early morning BP (6 a.m. to 8 a.m.), morning BP surge (defined as the last 2 h of the morning BP period minus the lowest night-time BP), overall BP variability (average of the individual 24-h standard deviation), maSBP in responders and poor responders [defined as those whose Week 12 BP was uncontrolled (msBP ≥ 140/90 mmHg and/or maBP ≥ 130/80 mmHg) and required add-on HCTZ (12.5 mg) therapy], and nondipper (percentage of patients with < 10% decline in night-time maSBP compared with daytime maSBP) and dipper patients night-time maSBP.

Safety assessments

Safety assessments included regular monitoring and recording of all adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs) and prespecified adverse events of particular attention.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^113xGYcx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Forming recommendations — wording and strength uses explicit phrasing tied to benefit, harm, and legal or economic context: recommendations stating that an intervention "must" are reserved for circumstances with a legal obligation or very serious consequences, exemplified by the prohibition "Ultra-rapid detoxification under general anesthesia or heavy sedation (where the airway needs to be supported) must not be used. This is because of the risk of serious adverse events, including death". A "strong" recommendation is made when benefit and cost-effectiveness are clear, illustrated by "Offer an alpha blocker (alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin or terazosin) to men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms". If an intervention does more harm than good or is less cost-effective than alternatives, the guideline may recommend it "should not be used", as in "Do not offer a tilt test to people who have a diagnosis of vasovagal syncope". When a strong recommendation is not appropriate — such as when similarly cost-effective options exist or patients may prefer a cheaper, less effective option — the guidance may be to "consider" an intervention, for example, "Consider a serum natriuretic peptide test (if not already performed) when heart failure is suspected after transthoracic Doppler 2D echocardiography has shown a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction".

### Tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111wi7wJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate which can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. The treatment goal for men with BPH is to relieve these bothersome symptoms.

Objectives

This systematic review assessed the effects of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compatible with BPH.

Search Strategy

Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Trials were eligible if they (1) randomized men with BPH to receive tamsulosin in comparison with placebo, other BPH medications or surgical interventions and (2) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements, and (3) had a treatment duration of 30 days or longer. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of tamsulosin with placebo, medical or surgical interventions was the change in urologic symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary flow measures (peak urine flow rate). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 4,122 subjects met inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4–26 weeks, and no placebo-controlled study lasted longer than 13 weeks. The mean age of subjects was 64 years. Baseline symptom scores and urine flow rates demonstrated that men had moderate LUTS. Tamsulosin improved symptoms and peak urine flow relative to placebo. The weighted mean differences (WMD) for mean change from baseline for the Boyarsky symptom score for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg doses of tamsulosin relative to placebo were -1.1 points (95% CI = -1.49, -0.72; 12% improvement) and -1.6 points (95% CI = -2.3, -1.0; 16% improvement), respectively. The WMD for mean change from baseline in peak urine flow were 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.59, 1.51) and 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.65, 1.48) for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg, respectively. Tamsulosin (0.2 mg-0.4 mg) was as effective as other alpha antagonists and the phytotherapeutic agent Permixon in improving symptoms and flow rates though the doses of all alpha-antagonists studied may not have been optimal. Discontinuations from treatment for any reason and discontinuations "due to adverse events" were similar in the low dose tamsulosin (0.2 mg) and placebo groups but increased to 16% in trials utilizing a 0.8 mg dose of tamsulosin. Low dose tamsulosin was generally well tolerated although not all the trials reported specific adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events that were significantly greater than placebo included dizziness, rhinitis and abnormal ejaculation. Adverse effects increased markedly as tamsulosin dosing increased, and were reported in 75% of men receiving the 0.8 mg dose. Men receiving a 0.2 mg dose tamsulosin were less likely to discontinue treatment compared to men receiving terazosin.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Tamsulosin provided a small to moderate improvement in urinary symptoms and flow compared to men receiving placebo in men with BPH. Effectiveness was similar to other alpha antagonists and increased only slightly with higher doses. Long term effectiveness and ability to reduce complications due to BPH progression could not be determined. Adverse effects were generally mild but their frequency, including withdrawals, increased substantially with the higher doses that are generally available for treatment.

### Dosage and duration of medication for men with lower urinary tract symptoms: two questions without definitive answers [^114zKk6Z]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review, the dosage and duration of medication in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia are discussed. There is no official guideline, however, and even no professional agreement on these points.

Recent Findings

Considering the dosage, dose-titration is probably not a drawback as there is a high risk of undertreatment or overtreatment when using a single dosage for every patient. Duration of treatment is a matter of concern. A quarter of patients discontinue their treatment early. For the others, a long period of treatment may be mandatory for those patients who are at risk of progression. After a course of medication (6 months to 1 year), a trial without treatment may help to decide whether treatment must be continued if symptoms relapse.

Summary

For men with lower urinary tract symptoms, there seems to be no definitive answer about the appropriate dosage and duration of medicine.

### Effect of tamsulosin on passage of symptomatic ureteral stones: a randomized clinical trial [^113Vu4gg]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Urinary stone disease is a common presentation in the emergency department, and α-adrenergic receptor blockers, such as tamsulosin, are commonly used to facilitate stone passage.

Objective

To determine if tamsulosin promotes the passage of urinary stones within 28 days among emergency department patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial from 2008 to 2009 (first phase) and then from 2012 to 2016 (second phase). Participants were followed for 90 days. The first phase was conducted at a single US emergency department; the second phase was conducted at 6 US emergency departments. Adult patients were eligible to participate if they presented with a symptomatic urinary stone in the ureter less than 9 mm in diameter, as demonstrated on computed tomography.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to treatment with either tamsulosin, 0.4 mg, or matching placebo daily for 28 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was stone passage based on visualization or capture by the study participant by day 28. Secondary outcomes included crossover to open-label tamsulosin, time to stone passage, return to work, use of analgesic medication, hospitalization, surgical intervention, and repeated emergency department visit for urinary stones.

Results

The mean age of 512 participants randomized to tamsulosin or placebo was 40.6 years (range, 18–74 years), 139 (27.1%) were female, and 110 (22.8%) were nonwhite. The mean (SD) diameter of the urinary stones was 3.8 (1.4) mm. Four hundred ninety-seven patients were evaluated for the primary outcome. Stone passage rates were 50% in the tamsulosin group and 47% in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.05; 95.8% CI, 0.87–1.27; p = 0.60), a nonsignificant difference. None of the secondary outcomes were significantly different. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, although patients lost to follow-up before stone passage were excluded from the analysis of final outcome.

Conclusions and Relevance

Tamsulosin did not significantly increase the stone passage rate compared with placebo. Our findings do not support the use of tamsulosin for symptomatic urinary stones smaller than 9 mm. Guidelines for medical expulsive therapy for urinary stones may need to be revised.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (Jalyn) [^113bA8b3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Orthostatic Hypotension

Inform patients about the possible occurrence of symptoms related to orthostatic hypotension, such as dizziness and vertigo, and the potential risk of syncope when taking JALYN. Caution patients starting treatment with JALYN to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (e.g., driving, operating machinery, performing hazardous tasks). Advise patients to sit or lie down at the first signs of orthostatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Drug Interactions

Advise patients that JALYN should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

PSA Monitoring

Inform patients that JALYN reduces serum PSA levels by approximately 50% within 3 to 6 months of therapy, although it may vary for each individual. For patients undergoing PSA screening, increases in PSA levels while on treatment with JALYN may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated by a healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer

Inform patients that there was an increase in high-grade prostate cancer in men treated with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (which are indicated for BPH treatment), including dutasteride, which is a component of JALYN, compared with those treated with placebo in trials looking at the use of these drugs to reduce the risk of prostate cancer [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Transdermal Exposure of JALYN in Pregnant or Potentially Pregnant Females — Risk to Male Fetus

Inform patients that JALYN capsules should not be handled by females who are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the potential for absorption of dutasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a developing male fetus. Dutasteride can be absorbed through the skin and could result in unintended fetal exposure. If a pregnant or potentially pregnant female comes in contact with leaking JALYN capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Tadalafil (N / a) [^116UC3t1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tamsulosin — In the first tamsulosin study, a single oral dose of tadalafil 10 mg, 20 mg, or placebo was administered in a 3 period, crossover design to healthy subjects taking 0.4 mg once per day tamsulosin, a selective alpha[1A]-adrenergic blocker (N = 18 subjects). Tadalafil or placebo was administered 2 hours after tamsulosin following a minimum of seven days of tamsulosin dosing.

Blood pressure was measured manually at 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after tadalafil or placebo dosing. There were 2, 2, and 1 outliers (subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of > 30 mm Hg at one or more time points) following administration of tadalafil 10 mg, 20 mg, and placebo, respectively. There were no subjects with a standing systolic blood pressure < 85 mm Hg. No severe adverse events potentially related to blood-pressure effects were reported. No syncope was reported.

In the second tamsulosin study, healthy subjects (N = 39 treated; and 35 completed) received 14 days of once per day dosing of tadalafil 5 mg or placebo in a two-period crossover design. Daily dosing of tamsulosin 0.4 mg was added for the last seven days of each period.

Blood pressure was measured manually pre-dose at two time points (-30 minutes and -15 minutes) and then at 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours post dose on the first, sixth and seventh days of tamsulosin administration. There were no outliers (subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of > 30 mm Hg at one or more time points). One subject on placebo plus tamsulosin (Day 7) and one subject on tadalafil plus tamsulosin (Day 6) had standing systolic blood pressure < 85 mm Hg. No severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure were reported. No syncope was reported.

### Tamsulosin: current clinical experience [^113DT35C]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

During the past decade, our understanding of the epidemiology and natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has improved considerably. Population-based studies confirm that lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are very common among aging men. These studies have confirmed that men with moderate-to-severe symptoms have 4 to 6 times more trouble and interference with activities of daily living and twice the level of worry as those with mild symptoms. The realization by patients and their physicians that most men > 50 years of age will develop LUTS, has resulted in increased awareness of pharmacologic agents, principally alpha-adrenergic antagonists, as a first line of therapy for this condition. Alpha blockers were introduced > 30 years ago to treat LUTS and today are the mainstay in pharmacologic therapy. Among the alpha blockers, tamsulosin more selectively targets the alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor subtype and is as effective as conventional alpha(1) blockers in treating LUTS caused by BPH. Its subselectivity and pharmacodynamic properties may provide advantages in safety, tolerability, and administration compared with other alpha blockers, such as terazosin and doxazosin. Unlike other alpha blockers, tamsulosin does not require titration to be efficacious. Because of its rapid onset of action and lack of clinically significant effect on blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive patients, a therapeutic dose is delivered at the onset of treatment. Studies have documented that tamsulosin produces rapid improvements in LUTS and peak urinary flow rates, and these responses have been found to be durable.

### Does this treatment work for me? The patient's role in assessing medical care [^112qp2nw]. BMJ Innovations (2017). Medium credibility.

Package insert

The clinical evidence in support of this drug is of very high quality. Two studies are described and the statistical analysis is commendable. Controlling for the placebo effect, the evidence for efficacy is strong. That said, there is some missing information that could help the patient to answer the question: Does this treatment work for me? Two outcome measures are used in the two reported trials: urine flow and the American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score. A literature reference to this score is not given. There are no literature references in the package insert. This individual patient would like to see a distribution of the outcome scores. More people benefit from the drug more than from the placebo effect. In how many patients is there no or minimal benefit? These people could avoid the costs and risks by not taking a pill that does not benefit them.

Measurement issues

The dependent variable is driven by patient preferences and may be unique to a specific person. Measurement can change over time. In this example, getting up at night turns out not to be so easy to measure. No daytime measures were made because the symptoms were not bothersome during the day. Eventually, this person's dependent variable was measured, for example, as follows: sleep/up/sleep/up/sleep/up for the day. For an 'up' to count, it had to be bracketed by 'sleep' before and after. This example yields a score of 2. It took several months to decide that this is the appropriate measure for this man. Changes in measuring the variables over time make comparisons possible but risky.

Placebo effect

Blinding is used to control for the placebo effect when the question is: Does this treatment provide benefit by itself independently of the placebo effect? In our example, the placebo effect is part of the benefit of treatment and it is purposely not controlled for.

### Dutasteride [^112EEGj3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Combination with Alpha-blocker Therapy (CombAT)

The efficacy of combination therapy (dutasteride 0.5 mg/day plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day, n = 1,610) was compared with dutasteride alone (n = 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (n = 1,611) in a 4-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial. Trial entry criteria were similar to the double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy efficacy trials described in section 14.1. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5 alpha-reductase-inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic-antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the combination group, 67% in the group receiving dutasteride, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double-blind treatment.

Effect on Symptom Score

Symptoms were quantified using the first 7 questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (identical to the AUA-SI). The baseline score was approximately 16.4 units for each treatment group. Combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24 the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.2 (± 7.14) for combination, -4.9 (± 6.81) for dutasteride, and -4.3 (± 7.01) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and dutasteride of -1.3 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.69, -0.86]), and between combination and tamsulosin of -1.8 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.23, -1.40]). A significant difference was seen by Month 9 and continued through Month 48. At Month 48 the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.3 (± 7.40) for combination, -5.3 (± 7.14) for dutasteride, and -3.8 (± 7.74) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and dutasteride of -0.96 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.40, -0.52]), and between combination and tamsulosin of -2.5 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.96, -2.07]). See Figure 6.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) alpha-1 blockers — Given the similar efficacy of the approved alpha-1-adrenergic antagonists, the choice of specific agent should consider the differing adverse events profiles of each. The quinazolin derivatives, terazosin and doxazosin, are non-specific alpha-1 receptor blockers that are both approved for the treatment of hypertension, as well as BPH, while tamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin have lower potential to cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope than either terazosin or doxazosin; tamsulosin may further have slightly less effect on blood pressure than alfuzosin, and the only two alpha blockers with selectivity for the alpha 1a versus the alpha 1b receptor are tamsulosin (10:1) and silodosin (161:1).

### Effectiveness of tamsulosin hydrochloride and its mechanism in improving nocturia associated with lower urinary tract symptoms / benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1158feXU]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the action mechanism of α(1)-receptor blockers in improving nocturia, we have studied effectiveness of tamsulosin hydrochloride (TAM) in the patients with nocturia associated with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH).

Methods

LUTS/BPH patients with nocturia (nocturnal frequency ≥ 2 times per day) were administered TAM (0.2mg/day) for 8 weeks. A frequency volume chart (FVC), the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), quality of life (QOL) index, post-void residual, and uroflowmetry were recorded before and after TAM administration for the patients. The parameters affected by TAM were examined.

Results

The FVC and I-PSS of the 160 patients analyzed revealed significant clinical improvements in the nocturnal frequency. On the basis of the FVC, the patients were divided into two groups: the responder group comprising 97 patients with significantly improved nocturnal frequency and the non-responder group comprising 63 patients with less improvement in the nocturnal frequency. Significant differences between groups were observed in the following parameters: the hours of undisturbed sleep (HUS), the interval between the time of sleeping and the first instance of nocturnal voiding, the volume of urine in the first nocturnal voiding episode, nocturnal urine volume, nocturnal polyuria index, daytime urine volume, maximum and average flow rates, and post-void residual.

Conclusions

TAM improved the QOL of LUTS/BPH patients by significantly reducing the nocturnal frequency and increasing HUS; moreover, it improved nocturia by decreasing the nocturnal urine volume.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) combination therapy — In an Asian cohort using a 0.2 mg tamsulosin dose, men with characteristics of disease progression had better symptomatic benefit from combination therapy than tamsulosin monotherapy, with a 24-month study reporting more prominent improvements in maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and prostate volume reduction and reductions in the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and BPH related surgery; another study found that initial combination dutasteride and tamsulosin improved quality of life compared to later initiation of tamsulosin after disease progression; Providers may start combination therapy with the intention of later discontinuing the alpha blocker (sometimes called "Withdrawal Therapy"). While this is a reasonable strategy, the concept has not been studied rigorously, and there are insufficient data to gauge the utility of this approach or the duration at which combination therapy should be continued before cessation of the alpha blocker. As stated previously, providers do not need to obtain a PSA solely for determination of 5-ARI efficacy as part combination therapy, although knowledge of a pre-existing value may help guide treatment options.

### Tamsulosin hydrochloride [^111dzyNB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of ≥ 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure ≥ 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of ≥ 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate ≥ 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test.

Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1).

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules (dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride) [^112SXLGx]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with dutasteride.

Reproductive and Breast Disorders

In the 3 pivotal placebo-controlled BPH trials with dutasteride, each 4 years in duration, there was no evidence of increased sexual adverse reactions (impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder) or breast disorders with increased duration of treatment. Among these 3 trials, there was 1 case of breast cancer in the dutasteride group and 1 case in the placebo group. No cases of breast cancer were reported in any treatment group in the 4-year CombAT trial or the 4-year REDUCE trial.

The relationship between long-term use of dutasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown.

Tamsulosin

According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in two 13-week treatment trials with tamsulosin monotherapy, adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride and at an incidence higher than in subjects receiving placebo were: infection, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, somnolence, insomnia, rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough increased, sinusitis, and diarrhea.

Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis: According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in clinical trials with tamsulosin monotherapy, a positive orthostatic test result was observed in 16% (81/502) of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride versus 11% (54/493) of subjects receiving placebo. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in the tamsulosin-treated subjects than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate when Vardenafil Hydrochloride Tablets are Combined with Nitrates

A study was conducted in which the blood pressure and heart rate response to 0.4 mg nitroglycerin (NTG) sublingually was evaluated in 18 healthy subjects following pretreatment with vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 20 mg at various times before NTG administration. Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 20 mg caused an additional time-related reduction in blood pressure and increase in heart rate in association with NTG administration. The blood pressure effects were observed when vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 20 mg were dosed 1 or 4 hours before NTG and the heart rate effects were observed when 20 mg was dosed 1, 4, or 8 hours before NTG. Additional blood pressure and heart rate changes were not detected when vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 20 mg were dosed 24 hours before NTG. (See Figure 1)

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of dutasteride and tamsulosin from dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are comparable to the pharmacokinetics of dutasteride and tamsulosin when administered separately.

Absorption

The pharmacokinetic parameters of dutasteride and tamsulosin observed after administration of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules in a single-dose, randomized, 3-period, partial cross-over trial are summarized in Table 2 below.

aMedian (range).

bN = 91.

Dutasteride: Following administration of a single 0.5 mg dose of a soft gelatin capsule, time to peak absolute bioavailability in 5 healthy subjects is approximately 60% (range: 40% to 94%).

Tamsulosin: Absorption of tamsulosin is essentially complete (> 90%) following oral administration of 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules under fasting conditions. Tamsulosin exhibits linear kinetics following single and multiple dosing, with achievement of steady-state concentrations by the fifth day of once-daily dosing.

Effect of Food

Food does not affect the pharmacokinetics of dutasteride following administration of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. However, a mean 30% decrease in tamsulosin Cmaxwas observed when dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules was administered with food, similar to that seen when tamsulosin monotherapy was administered under fed versus fasting conditions.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^111RJL4i]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We observed an increased rate ratio for severe hypotension requiring admission to hospital with tamsulosin treatment. The greatest increase in risk — varying in magnitude from 151% to 256% — was observed during the first eight weeks of new drug use and the first eight weeks after restarting drug treatment. A smaller increase in risk for hypotension, varying from 19% to 36%, persisted during maintenance tamsulosin treatment.

Antagonism of α1 adrenoreceptors by tamsulosin relaxes the smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to improve urine flow rate and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although hypertension is not an approved indication for tamsulosin, α blockers are also known to decrease systemic vascular resistance and reduce blood pressure. Clinical trials observed a 12% incidence for orthostatic hypotension among patients taking 0.4 mg tamsulosin, and a 6% incidence among patients taking placebo between four to eight hours after dosing; however, no treatment emergent hypotensive events were observed. In these trials, patients were retained at the treating site for eight hours after the first dose and received counseling on the effects of orthostatic hypotension. This environment may not apply to treatment practice in the real world. Three currently approved selective α1 adrenergicantagonists (doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) have black boxed warnings for severe hypotension and syncope, particularly at the first dose. Tamsulosin has a warning for hypotension, but without a black box or information on a potential first dose phenomenon. Our data add to the current literature to better define and quantify the first dose phenomenon of tamsulosin on risk for hypotension.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have been evaluated in adult healthy volunteers and patients with BPH after single and/or multiple administration with doses ranging from 0.1 mg to 1 mg. Absorption Absorption of tamsulosin hydrochloride from tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is essentially complete (> 90%) following oral administration under fasting conditions. Tamsulosin hydrochloride exhibits linear kinetics following single and multiple dosing, with achievement of steady-state concentrations by the fifth day of once-a-day dosing. Effect of Food The time to maximum concentration (Tmax) is reached by 4 to 5 hours under fasting conditions and by 6 to 7 hours when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered with food. Taking tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules under fasted conditions results in a 30% increase in bioavailability (AUC) and 40% to 70% increase in peak concentrations (Cmax) compared to fed conditions (Figure 1).

The effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride are consistent regardless of whether a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is taken with a light breakfast or a high-fat breakfast (Table 2).

Distribution

The mean steady-state apparent volume of distribution of tamsulosin hydrochloride after intravenous administration to 10 healthy male adults was 16 L, which is suggestive of distribution into extracellular fluids in the body.

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: bedtime dosing or daytime dosing? [^1145xVDZ]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension management strategies have evolved from solely controlling office blood pressure (BP) to comprehensive 24-h BP regulation. This review synthesizes current evidence on the timing of antihypertensive medication, with a focus on circadian BP rhythms and patients with specific BP patterns or comorbidities. Bedtime dosing may benefit individuals with nocturnal hypertension and nondipper BP patterns, but large trials, such as the TIME study, have shown no significant cardiovascular outcome differences between morning and bedtime dosing. However, the optimal timing of antihypertensive medication for patients with distinct BP rhythms or comorbidities remains uncertain. Future research should investigate the potential benefits of personalized medication timing tailored to BP patterns and clinical conditions. Additionally, treatment strategies should consider BP rhythms, comorbidities, and adherence to optimize outcomes, paving the way for more effective management of hypertensive patients with complex clinical profiles.

### The risk of fall and fracture with the initiation of a prostate-selective α antagonist: a population based cohort study [^111sGi3E]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Comparisons with other studies

Some previous studies in this area have shown similar results. A population based cohort study demonstrated an increased risk of hypotension requiring hospital admission among men treated initially with tamsulosin compared with 5-α reductase inhibitors, particularly in the first four weeks of treatment. Similarly, a post-marketing observational study of tamsulosin identified a 0.7% risk of hypotension, with both dizziness and hypotension commonly reported as reasons for discontinuing therapy. A case-control study examining the effect of 5-α reductase inhibitors demonstrated the odds of a hip fracture were two times higher with a recent α antagonist prescription. Two smaller studies also support our conclusions, but they included a mix of non-specific and prostate-specific α antagonists, which limits their generalizability.

Studies that have failed to show an effect of α antagonists on falls or fractures include a small case-control study of patients using modified release doxazosin, and a case-control study which defined α antagonist exposure based on the presence of any prior prescription (not current use). Although placebo controlled, randomized trials of tamsulosin have suggested there are no clinically relevant changes to blood pressure, dizziness as an adverse event was generally higher among tamsulosin patients than placebo patients.

Practice implications

Product monographs for most α antagonists have warnings about severe hypotension and syncope, but research has suggested that prostate-specific α antagonists have a lower risk of hypotension related events than non-selective α antagonists. Our study supports the continued need to counsel men about the risk of hypotension even with prostate-specific α antagonists such as tamsulosin, which have several-fold higher affinity for α 1A receptors in the prostate than for α 1B receptors in the vascular system. Measures to reduce the risk of hypotension related events include taking α antagonists in the evening, with food, and avoiding driving or potentially hazardous activities during the initiation of therapy.

Future directions

The impact of 5-α reductase inhibitors on fractures, and their potential role in modulating the risk of falls among men using dual therapy (with an α antagonist) deserves further analysis. Future studies with larger samples of men using the newest prostate-specific antagonists (such as silodosin) should be undertaken to see if increased prostate selectivity mitigates the risk of fall and fracture.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^112FgYDX]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Blood pressure (BP) follows a circadian rhythm, with BP levels falling during sleep and increasing in the early morning hours in most individuals. In patients with hypertension, a lack of fall in night-time BP (i.e. nondipping) and/or marked rise or surge in BP during the early morning hours is associated with a higher incidence of stroke and an increased risk for other cardiovascular complications, especially among the elderly. This had led some researchers to recommend the dosing of antihypertensive agents in the evening or bedtime hours in patients with hypertension in order to preserve the normal circadian pattern of BP. An ideal antihypertensive agent would be one that retains its efficacy throughout the 24-h period while also effectively restoring the normal circadian BP pattern (e.g. reduction in BP at night).

Several studies with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, both agents that reduce the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activity, have reported improvements in night-time BP and a reduction in the early morning rise in BP with bedtime dosing compared with traditional dosing upon awakening. The benefit of night-time dosing might be related to the incomplete 24-h action of a once-daily antihypertensive when given in the morning even though the agent is approved for single daily use. Better BP lowering with night-time dosing, however, has been reported for both short and longer acting ACE-inhibitors and ARBs, and hence it is not a pharmacokinetic effect.

The proposed mechanism for the benefit of night-time dosing of the ACE-inhibitor or ARB is ascribed to more effective RAAS blockade during the sleep and early morning periods. It is also possible that the use of lower doses of the ARB/ACE-inhibitor account for the better effect, and, when a higher dose or its use in combination with a non-RAAS agent (e.g. diuretic, calcium channel blocker) is employed, this benefit of night-time dosing is minimized.

Blood Pressure Effects in Patients on Stable Alpha-Blocker Treatment

Two clinical pharmacology studies were conducted in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on stable-dose alpha-blocker treatment for at least four weeks.

Study 1: This study was designed to evaluate the effect of 5 mg vardenafil film-coated tablets compared to placebo when administered to BPH patients on chronic alpha-blocker therapy in two separate cohorts: tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily (cohort 1, n = 21) and terazosin 5 or 10 mg daily (cohort 2, n = 21). The design was a randomized, double blind, cross-over study with four treatments: vardenafil 5 mg or placebo administered simultaneously with the alpha-blocker and vardenafil 5 mg or placebo administered 6 hours after the alpha-blocker. Blood pressure and pulse were evaluated over the 6-hour interval after vardenafil dosing. For blood pressure (BP) results, see Table 2. One patient, after simultaneous treatment with 5 mg vardenafil and 10 mg terazosin, exhibited symptomatic hypotension with standing blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg occurring one hour after administration and subsequent mild dizziness and moderate lightheadedness lasting for 6 hours. For vardenafil and placebo, five and two patients, respectively, experienced a decrease in standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) of > 30 mmHg following simultaneous administration of terazosin. Hypotension was not observed when vardenafil 5 mg and terazosin were administered 6 hours apart. Following simultaneous administration of vardenafil 5 mg and tamsulosin, two patients had a standing SBP of < 85 mmHg; two and one patient (vardenafil and placebo, respectively) had a decrease in standing SBP of > 30 mmHg. When tamsulosin and vardenafil 5 mg were separated by 6 hours, two patients had a standing SBP < 85 mmHg and one patient had a decrease in SBP of > 30 mmHg. There were no severe adverse events related to hypotension reported during the study. There were no cases of syncope.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^114vMZ5Q]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

A study in the US Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system used data mining strategies of spontaneous reports to assess potential safety signals with α adrenergic antagonists. Concern for dizziness or vertigo and orthostatic hypotension were raised for tamsulosin in addition to alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin. A recent Cochrane review also found higher rates of dizziness with larger tamsulosin dosages (0.8 mg, 17% dizziness; 0.4 mg, 9%; 0.2 mg, 3%), suggesting a dose dependent effect.

In a prospective cohort study of 5872 participants, Parsons and colleagues found a significantly increased risk of falls at one year in community dwelling men aged 65 years and older with moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms, based on the validated American Urological Association symptom index. But they did not find any difference when stratifying patients on the basis of use of urological drug treatments. However, all urological drugs were grouped together in the analysis (α blockers, 5ARIs, anticholinergics), and more importantly, drug use was only collected at baseline — therefore, a first dose phenomenon could not be assessed. The population based case-control study by Jacobsen and colleagues found an increased risk of hip fractures among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia taking α blockers but not 5ARIs. Notably, this risk was only observed in men initiating treatment with an α blocker within 30 days (odds ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.49). Our study suggests that this increased risk of hip fractures with α blockers use could be secondary to falls as a result of severe hypotensive events at initiation.

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: bedtime dosing or daytime dosing? [^116swb4o]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive patients with dipper pattern

In light of the ongoing debate surrounding the bedtime administration of antihypertensive medications and concerns regarding nocturnal BP dips, the World Hypertension League and the European Society of Hypertension suggested in their 2022 consensus statement that routine bedtime dosing should not be advocated, advocating instead for monotherapy with long-acting agents or morning-dosed combinations. However, the TIME study later contradicted this by reporting no increased fracture risk in the bedtime dosing group. In fact, participants in the bedtime group displayed a slightly lower fall risk (P = 0.048) and fewer symptomatic adverse events compared to the morning group. Similar findings emerged from MAPEC and the Hygia Chronotherapy trial, indicating no heightened side effects from bedtime dosing compared to morning dosing. Liu et al. and Serinel et al. further indicated that when employing long-acting antihypertensives, nocturnal BP reductions were comparable between morning and bedtime dosing. Therefore, for hypertensive patients using long-acting medications, there seems to be no discernible difference in either safety or efficacy between morning and bedtime dosing. The decision on the optimal timing should be personalized, considering each patient's preference for the most compliant time of day, as enhancing adherence to treatment appears to be the key to effective therapy.

Beyond the complex interplay of intrinsic neuroendocrine systems, research has elucidated that individual behavioral traits, particularly activity level and wakefulness, significantly contribute to BP patterns. A study demonstrated that restricting physical activity led to reduced daily BP fluctuations. Surprisingly, shift workers' BP rhythms can invert when they work nights and rest during the day, linking their increased cardiovascular risks to disrupted circadian rhythms from shift work. Animal studies provide preliminary evidence for this mechanism. However, research on the optimal medication timing for night-shift hypertensive patients, specifically whether morning or evening dosing is best, is limited due to excluding these workers in some studies. Considering behavioral shifts in BP patterns and antihypertensive drug characteristics, evening dosing might be more advantageous for night-shift workers with dipper BP patterns, especially those using medications with short half-lives and potent effects. Theoretically, this approach aligns better with the potential evening peak in BP for these individuals.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Dutasteride: Males: The effects of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day on semen characteristics were evaluated in normal volunteers aged 18 to 52 years (n = 27 dutasteride, n = 23 placebo) throughout 52 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. At 52 weeks, the mean percent reductions from baseline in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility were 23%, 26%, and 18%, respectively, in the dutasteride group when adjusted for changes from baseline in the placebo group. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected. After 24 weeks of follow-up, the mean percent change in total sperm count in the dutasteride group remained 23% lower than baseline. While mean values for all semen parameters at all timepoints remained within the normal ranges and did not meet predefined criteria for a clinically significant change (30%), 2 subjects in the dutasteride group had decreases in sperm count of greater than 90% from baseline at 52 weeks, with partial recovery at the 24-week follow-up. The clinical significance of these effects on semen characteristics for an individual patient's fertility is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Tamsulosin: Males: Abnormal ejaculation including ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and decreased ejaculation has been associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride. Studies in rats revealed significantly reduced fertility in males, considered to be due to impairment of ejaculation, which was reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^1155h7Y6]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Results

We identified 297 596 new users of tamsulosin and 85 971 new users of 5ARIs with a mean age of 62 and 64 years, respectively. During follow-up, 26 659 patients switched to or initiated new adjunct treatment with tamsulosin, while 47 628 patients switched to or initiated new adjunct treatment with 5ARIs. Mean duration of tamsulosin treatment was 39 weeks (standard deviation 54 weeks) while median duration was 14 weeks (interquartile range 5–50 weeks); mean duration of 5ARI treatment was 56 weeks (61 weeks) while median duration was 34 weeks (13–78 weeks). Table 1shows patient characteristics.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^112JCzBy]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

A comparison of hypotension risk with tamsulosin to other α blockers would be of clinical interest, but low use of other α blockers for benign prostatic hyperplasia and confounding by a coindication for hypertension would decrease interpretability of this comparison. In our study, we used two analytical techniques to increase robustness of our study results. The magnitude of the point estimates were not completely synonymous using the cohort and self controlled case series approaches, particularly with regards to weeks 9–12 of new tamsulosin use. These differences are probably attributable to differences in the underlying number of person years in each risk window of exposure among all patients (cohort analysis) versus only those who experienced outcomes (self controlled case series analysis), and to differences in the reference comparator for these techniques. However, both analyses agreed on time varying risks of larger magnitude at new use and restarting tamsulosin treatment than observed with maintenance treatment. Future work is needed to determine whether genetic characteristics or other non-measured risk factors may modify susceptibility to hypotension with tamsulosin.

Strengths and limitations of this study

In our analysis, exposure risk windows demonstrated utility for identifying time varying risk for hypotension at drug initiation and restart. Resultant rate ratios must be interpreted within the context of prescribing practice: rate ratios for hypotension in later study risk windows (for example, weeks 5–8, 9–12) represent hypotension risk among patients who probably tolerated earlier risk windows of exposure (for example, weeks 1–4) without having a hypotension event that led to hospital admission. Patients compliant with tamsulosin treatment may also achieve better control of lower urinary tract symptoms, which could result in a lower risk of falls, supporting the importance of optimizing drug adherence.

We did not have access to information on ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or lifestyle factors in our data. Residual confounding is always possible in observational studies. However, the close temporality of hypotension risk to initiation of drug treatment and a secondary self controlled analysis that implicitly controlled for time invariant confounders suggested that the bias due to measurement error in the confounders could be minimal or absent. Because our data captured men with private healthcare insurance (including Medicare Advantage), generalisability to men older than 65 years with traditional Medicare and part D services is unknown. Our outcome was a severe hypotension episode, probably resulting from syncope, and requiring admission to hospital. Although many patients will have a clinically relevant drop in blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension), our outcome was not intended to capture these changes in blood pressure, but rather only treatment emergent events. Further, although larger tamsulosin doses could have shown a greater hypotension risk, infrequent use of doses other than 0.4 mg once daily in our data prevented analysis of this potential effect.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules (dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride) [^113KPMWX]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The trial supporting the efficacy of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules was a 4-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (CombAT trial) investigating the efficacy of the coadministration of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg/day (n = 1,610) compared with dutasteride alone (n = 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (n = 1,611). Subjects were aged at least 50 years with a serum PSA ≥ 1.5 ng/mL and < 10 ng/mL and BPH diagnosed by medical history and physical examination, including enlarged prostate (≥ 30 cc) and BPH symptoms that were moderate to severe according to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the coadministration group, 67% in the dutasteride group, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double-blind treatment.

Effect on Symptom Score

Symptoms were quantified using the first 7 questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The baseline score was approximately 16.4 units for each treatment group. Coadministration therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24, the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.2 (± 7.14) for the coadministration group, -4.9 (± 6.81) for dutasteride, and -4.3 (± 7.01) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between coadministration and dutasteride of -1.3 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.69, -0.86]), and between coadministration and tamsulosin of -1.8 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.23, -1.40]). A significant difference was seen by Month 9 and continued through Month 48. At Month 48 the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.3 (± 7.40) for coadministration, -5.3 (± 7.14) for dutasteride, and -3.8 (± 7.74) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between coadministration and dutasteride of -0.96 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.40, -0.52]), and between coadministration and tamsulosin of -2.5 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.96, -2.07]). See Figure 1.

Self controlled case series analysis

A secondary analysis was conducted for all patients included in the study cohort who had a hospital admission for hypotension, using a self controlled case series analysis. Because it is a within patient design, the self controlled case series is not confounded by covariates that do not change over time (that is, covariates that are time invariant). Such covariates include demographics and measured or unmeasured long term disease states such as benign prostatic hyperplasia or hypertension and their multiplicative interactions. This modeling approach uses conditional Poisson regression to assess the association between a time varying exposure and an acute outcome using data from only the cases. An incidence rate ratio is calculated, comparing the incidence of study outcomes during time exposed with time unexposed to drug exposure covariates within each patient. It is ideal with an acute outcome (for example, admission to hospital) and transient drug exposure covariates (that is, a short ratio of risk window length to total enrolment length).

The self controlled case series has three main implied assumptions. Firstly, if a study outcome perturbs future drug exposure, this could impose immortal time bias whereby the incidence for the outcome may be lower before initiating drug treatment. Potential bias from a violation of this assumption was circumvented by starting longitudinal follow-up at the initiation of a study drug exposure. Censoring occurred at the end of enrolment or the end of the study period, but not at a study outcome because this can impose bias. Secondly, the self controlled case series design assumes an underlying Poisson distribution of events, where a study outcome does not influence a future outcome. This was dealt with through a sensitivity analysis that modeled only the first event, assuming subsequent outcomes are a continuation of the first outcome occurrence. Thirdly, the self controlled case series design assumes that a study outcome does not censor patient follow-up. Although methods have been derived to analyze event dependent censoring, our study outcome is not likely fatal and will rarely censor follow-up.

All time varying exposure covariates from the cohort analysis were included in this modeling approach. Exposure covariates were defined in seven day increments to maintain uniform exposure classification to the cohort analysis, and age and calendar year were adjusted for as continuous parametric variables defined during each seven day window. We did a sensitivity analysis, adjusting for age in five year brackets to allow the underlying incidence for hypotension to vary by age; we similarly adjusted for calendar year in one year increments throughout follow-up. All analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis Software 9.3.

### Avanafil (Stendra) [^115y2DHN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Cohort B (N = 24): Subjects received 0.4 mg daily oral doses of tamsulosin in the morning for 11 consecutive days (Days 1–11). On Days 8 and 11, the subjects also received a single oral dose of either 200 mg STENDRA or placebo, according to the treatment randomization code. The STENDRA or placebo doses were administered 3.3 hours after the tamsulosin administration on Days 8 and 11. The co-administration was designed so that tamsulosin (Tmax~4 hours) and STENDRA (Tmax~0.7 hours) would reach their peak plasma concentrations at the same time.

Supine and sitting BP and pulse rate measurements were recorded before and after STENDRA or placebo dosing.

A total of seven subjects in Cohort A (doxazosin) experienced potentially clinically important absolute values or changes from baseline in standing SBP or DBP. Three subjects experienced standing SBP values less than 85 mmHg. One subject experienced a decrease from baseline in standing SBP greater than 30 mmHg following STENDRA. Two subjects experienced standing DBP values less than 45 mmHg following STENDRA. Four subjects experienced decreases from baseline in standing DBP greater than 20 mmHg following STENDRA. One subject experienced such decreases following placebo. There were no severe adverse events related to hypotension reported during the trial. There were no cases of syncope.

*Incidence of hypotension for the cohort represents absolute incidence in the study population, while incidence in the self controlled case series represents relative incidence in the cases.

The self controlled case series confirmed the finding for increased hypotension risk during weeks 1–4 of new use (rate ratio 2.56, 95% confidence interval 2.15 to 3.05; table 2). Weeks 5–8 (1.66, 1.30 to 2.11) and 9–12 (1.54, 1.19 to 2.01) after starting new drug treatment also showed an increase in hypotension risk. After restarting treatment, weeks 1–4 (1.58, 1.24 to 2.01) and 5–8 (1.60, 1.25 to 2.05) observed increased risk for hypotension, as did maintenance drug treatment (1.38, 1.21 to 1.57). Sensitivity analyses, with the self controlled case series limiting the analysis to only one event and semi-parametrically adjusting for age and calendar time, found similar results (web appendix).

### Long-term, open-label, phase III multicenter study of tamsulosin in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111bhGYX]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of tamsulosin in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and to monitor the increases and decreases in therapeutic response over time. Tamsulosin, a uroselective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, targets alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptors of prostatic smooth muscle with greater affinity than the vascular alpha(1B) receptors. Since the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor subtype mediates prostatic smooth muscle tension, alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonists may diminish toxicity, with few unwanted effects on blood pressure, while still providing efficacious treatment.

Methods

This study extended two 13-week trials and one 40-week extension trial for an additional 64 weeks. On study entry, all patients (n = 949) received 0.4 mg/day tamsulosin. Baseline values were taken from either those of the previous trials for patients who had been treated with tamsulosin or the first visit of this study for patients not previously exposed to the drug. The primary efficacy parameters were the changes in the total American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score, mean peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), and percentage of patients having 25% or greater improvement in the total AUA symptom score and 30% or more improvement in the Qmax. Safety was assessed primarily on the incidence and severity of adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events.

Results

Improvements from baseline were seen in all primary efficacy parameters and were maintained throughout the study. The changes from baseline for the total AUA symptom score and Qmax were statistically significant (P < 0.001) at all 3-month intervals. Tamsulosin was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events did not increase over time. The mean sitting vital signs did not vary from baseline or relative to the treatment duration.

Conclusions

Tamsulosin was safe and effective in long-term treatment (longer than 1 year) of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of tamsulosin for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111SKnvg]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the long-term (up to 6 years) safety and efficacy of the selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

A total of 609 patients were enrolled in a 4-year multicenter open label extension study. Subjects entered the study after completion of a 1-year open label trial that included patients who previously completed up to 57 weeks of double-blind, placebo controlled studies. Maintenance doses (0.4 or 2 x 0.4 mg daily) established in the 1-year study were continued. Efficacy and safety were assessed every 3 months. Primary efficacy evaluations were changes from baseline maximum urine flow rate and total American Urological Association symptom index, and the responder rates for those 2 end points. Secondary end points were changes in American Urological Association subset scores, Boyarsky symptom scores, average urine flow rate, post-void residual urine volume, quality of life index and investigator global assessment.

Results

Of the 609 patients who entered the 4-year extension study 159 had a 2-year or greater prior experience with tamsulosin, yielding a potential 6-year experience on the medication. Of this 159 patient subset 109 completed the whole 6 years. Initial rapid improvements from baseline in primary and secondary end points were maintained each year throughout the duration of the study. Tamsulosin was well tolerated, confirming the safety profile demonstrated in earlier studies. Orthostatic hypotension was observed in 1.3% of the patients.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates the sustained efficacy, safety and excellent long-term tolerability of tamsulosin for up to 6 years in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Nocturia: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^114GoypE]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

Voiding at night, or nocturia, is a common reason for interrupted sleep in the adult population. The condition affects both men and women, with an incidence that increases dramatically with age. Nocturia has a negative impact on quality of life, affecting both morbidity and mortality. Effective diagnosis of the condition is dependent on a clear understanding of its underlying etiology. In general, the causes of nocturia fall into three categories: diurnal polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, and low bladder capacity. In some individuals, however, nocturnal polyuria and low bladder capacity may both contribute to the overall symptomatology of nocturia. Addressing any underlying conditions that contribute to nocturia is the first step in treating the condition. Lifestyle and behavioral changes may provide benefit in some individuals, but for many, the only option is pharmacotherapy. Antimuscarinic agents are first-line therapies for overactive bladder and are often used in the management of nocturia. Pharmacological and physicochemical differences between available antimuscarinic agents, however, translate into different safety and tolerability profiles, which may make some agents more suitable for use in certain populations, including the elderly. Careful selection of the most appropriate antimuscarinic medication is therefore central in optimizing treatment outcomes.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116JgBwq]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

BP exhibits considerable variation during the day and follows a circadian rhythm, with SBP and DBP falling during sleep and rising rapidly with the start of morning activity. If a once-daily antihypertensive agent is given in the morning, it is important that it maintains BP control throughout the day-time and night-time periods, particularly towards the end of the dosing interval, to cover the critical early morning hours. To better ensure coverage during the night-time and early morning periods, dosing of antihypertensive agents, particularly ARBs, at bedtime has been recommended, with a number of studies providing support. Despite the clinical evidence, the pharmacologic rationale for this recommendation with an antihypertensive that has previously demonstrated effective 24-h BP lowering is not clear. We conducted a randomized, multicentre clinical trial in over 1000 patients with hypertension to test this hypothesis. We demonstrated that it did not matter whether valsartan was given in the morning or night-time period, as it resulted in similar BP control and BP lowering in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension with additional cardiovascular risks, even when compared with the long-acting ACE-inhibitor lisinopril.

Over the 24-h period, valsartan demonstrated effective BP reductions, comparable to that produced by lisinopril 40 mg, regardless of whether valsartan was dosed in the morning or at night. This was also true for night-time BP lowering and for limiting the early morning BP rise. Other ABPM measures, including day/night BP ratio, morning BP surge and short-term BP variability, were also not improved by night-time dosing. Antihypertensive agents that maintain BP-lowering efficacy at the end of the dosing period and preserve the normal fall in night-time BP while limiting the early morning rise in BP meet the requirements of an ideal agent for reducing the risk associated with hypertension-related cardiovascular disease. On the basis of the findings of our study, valsartan fulfils the requirements of an ideal BP-lowering agent, irrespective of whether it is given in the morning or at night. Furthermore, the BP-lowering efficacy comparing valsartan and lisinopril was similar throughout the 24-h period, suggesting that regardless of the type of RAAS blockade, via ACE inhibition or ARB, a similar 24-h BP-lowering profile is seen that is not differentially affected by circadian effects or time of day administration.

### Patient's adherence on pharmacological therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is different: is combination therapy better than monotherapy? [^114LGJzL]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

BPH represents a major public health issue because of its increasing prevalence, progressive nature and treatment costs. Current guidelines recommend the use of ABs and 5ARIs as monotherapy or in combination for the treatment of BPH-associated LUTS. However, a gap exists between guidelines and actual clinical practice. In "real life" the low adherence to prescribed medications is a recognized problem for chronic diseases. Some studies deeply evaluated the problems of drug prescription and adherence for BPH as well as its impact on the clinical outcomes. All showed concordant results: 1) the reported adherence in clinical trials is higher than that observed in real life; 2) the duration of treatment for BPH-associated LUTS is extremely short; 3) the adherence to treatment is generally low and 4) this might negatively influence BPH-related hospitalization rates.

By and large, patient adherence, or compliance, to a prescribed drug treatment is defined as the extent to which a person's attitude in terms of taking medication coincides with the medical or health advice he receives.

Adherence or compliance to a drug regimen is divided to primary non-compliance, for example when one receives a prescription, but does not have it made up at a pharmacy. Forms of secondary non-compliance include taking incorrect doses of the prescribed medication, taking the medication at wrong times, forgetting one or more doses of the medication, or altogether stopping the medication, either by ceasing to take the medication sooner than the doctor recommended or failing to obtain a repeat prescription. Poor adherence to a therapeutic regimen has been identified as a major public health problem that may have a major impact on clinical outcomes.

### Does combination therapy with tamsulosin and tolterodine improve ureteral stent discomfort compared with tamsulosin alone? A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [^1125fPcM]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ureteral stent discomfort is a significant postoperative problem for many patients. Despite the use of narcotics and α-blockers patients often experience bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms and pain, which impair daily activities. We compared combination therapy with an α-blocker and an anticholinergic to monotherapy with an α-blocker.

Materials and Methods

A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was performed from December 2012 to April 2014. A total of 80 patients were randomized, including 44 to the combination group (tamsulosin 0.4 mg and tolterodine early release 4 mg) and 36 to the monotherapy group (tamsulosin 0.4 mg and placebo). Patients with preexisting ureteral stent placement or current anticholinergic therapy were excluded from study. Patients completed USSQ (Urinary Stent Symptom Questionnaire) before stent placement on the day of surgery, the day after stent placement, the morning of stent removal and the day after stent removal. The questionnaire included questions regarding urinary symptoms, general health, body pain, and work and sexual history.

Results

A total of 80 patients (40 males and 40 females) were studied. Mean age was 51.5 vs 51.3 years (p = 0.95) and mean body mass index was 33.6 vs 31.9 kg/m(2) (p = 0.44) in monotherapy group 1 vs combination therapy group 2. Between the 2 groups there was no significant difference in urinary symptoms, body pain and activities of daily living from baseline to just before stent removal (p = 0.95, 0.40 and 0.95, respectively). Although there was no difference between the groups, both showed improvement in urinary symptoms from the time of initial stent insertion to just prior to stent removal (difference -0.50 for combination therapy and -0.40 for monotherapy). The mean stent indwelling time of 9.6 and 8.7 days in the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively, did not differ (p = 0.67). On ANOVA it had no significant impact on results (p = 0.64).

Conclusions

Combination therapy with tamsulosin and tolterodine does not appear to improve urinary symptoms, bodily pain or quality of life in patients after ureteral stent placement for nephrolithiasis compared to tamsulosin alone. Both groups experienced worse urinary symptoms, pain and quality of life with a stent, suggesting that further research is necessary to improve stent discomfort.

One study found that for every 255 men receiving tamsulosin in the immediate preoperative cataract surgical period, one serious complication would result, and discontinuation of tamsulosin 4 to 7 days prior to cataract surgery is routine practice but does not completely eliminate IFIS risk. Urologists initiating alpha blocker therapy should inquire about the presence of cataracts or plans for future cataract surgery, and urologists should inform identified patients with planned cataract surgery of IFIS risk and delay initiation of alpha blocker therapy until after the procedure; other associated drugs include benzodiazepines, donepezil and duloxetine.

### Morning vs bedtime dosing and nocturnal blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension: the Oman randomized clinical trial [^111GDTTb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can bedtime dosing of antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension provide better control of nocturnal blood pressure and improve the circadian rhythm compared with morning dosing?

Findings

In this multicenter randomized clinical trial comprising 720 patients with hypertension, those in the bedtime dosing group achieved better blood pressure control and circadian rhythm than the morning dosing group.

Meaning

Findings of this study provide valuable insights into the application of antihypertensive chronotherapy for the population with hypertension, especially in the context of enhancing the management of nocturnal blood pressure.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^116nE6c9]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) combination therapy — In the CombAT trial, 4,844 men were randomized to tamsulosin 0.4 mg, dutasteride 0.5 mg, or their combination for four years; inclusion required prostate volume > 30 mL and PSA of > 1.5 ng/mL, and combination therapy produced significantly greater symptom improvements versus dutasteride from month 3 and tamsulosin from month 9, better BPH-related health status from months 3 and 12, and greater Qmax improvement from month 6, but with a significant increase in drug related adverse events versus monotherapies; four-year data indicated similar improvements for men with baseline prostate volume ≥ 60mL and PSA ≥ 4ng/mL for dutasteride and combination therapy, but superiority of combination when prostate volume and PSA were lower than these thresholds (while still above the study inclusion criteria of prostate volume > 30mL and PSA > 1.5ng/mL), and Qmax improvements were more profound with increasing prostate volume and PSA levels in combination therapy subjects.

### Simultaneous administration of vardenafil and tamsulosin does not induce clinically significant hypotension in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^113jzLj7]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of coadministered vardenafil and tamsulosin in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) undergoing stable tamsulosin therapy.

Methods

In this Phase 1, placebo-controlled, two-stage, two-way, crossover study, 22 patients undergoing stable (longer than 4 weeks) tamsulosin therapy for BPH (18 using 0.4 mg and 4 using 0.8 mg tamsulosin daily) received vardenafil 10 mg (or placebo), followed by vardenafil 20 mg (or placebo), simultaneously with tamsulosin. The mean maximal change from baseline with vardenafil use versus placebo was evaluated for supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate for up to 6 hours after dosing.

Results

In patients receiving vardenafil 10 mg, the mean maximal change from baseline versus placebo in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate was -4.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI] -8.2 to -0.8), -2.3 mm Hg (95% CI -4.9 to 0.4), and 3.7 beats per minute (95% CI 1.1 to 6.3), respectively. In patients receiving vardenafil 20 mg, the mean maximal change from baseline versus placebo in supine SBP, DBP, and heart rate was -4.0 mm Hg (95% CI -6.3 to -1.8), -2.9 mm Hg (95% CI -5.6 to -0.2), and 0.8 beats per minute (95% CI -1.2 to 2.9), respectively. These hemodynamic changes were similar to those obtained in the standing position. Two placebo patients and 1 vardenafil 10-mg patient had a drop of 20 mm Hg or more in standing DBP; 1 vardenafil 10-mg patient had a standing SBP drop of 30 mm Hg or more. No patient exhibited symptomatic hypotension (SBP less than 85 mm Hg with dizziness). Three patients receiving vardenafil 20 mg/tamsulosin 0.4 mg reported dizziness, but never had an SBP of less than 95 mm Hg. No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

In this study, no evidence was found that coadministered vardenafil and tamsulosin induced clinically significant hypotension in patients with BPH.

### Dutasteride plus tamsulosin fixed-dose combination first-line therapy versus tamsulosin monotherapy in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a budget impact analysis in the Greek healthcare setting [^115NE9fp]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Model inputs

Patient population

A cohort of Greek male patients aged ≥ 50 years, diagnosed with moderate to severe BPH, as defined by an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) populated the model in order to resemble the population characteristics of the CombAT study. Due to lack of national epidemiological data on BPH, the internationally accepted prevalence of BPH in the aforementioned age group was used and set at 30%, while the proportion of patients diagnosed with moderate to severe BPH was 63%, as documented in international and European studies. Based on the 2001 Greek population census, the men population aged over 50 was 1,724,867 and consequently, the estimated number of men entering the model was set at 326,000 (= 1,724,867*0,3*0,63).

The initial distribution of patients in each of the BPH symptom health states that have entered the model was defined by the baseline IPSS of the CombAT trial. Specifically, 7% of patients had improved to mild symptoms (IPSS < 12) before starting treatment and the remaining 93% of patients would be considered as moderate to severe condition (63% and 30% moderate and severe, respectively). The IPSS range for mild symptoms is 0–7, moderate 8–19 and severe 20–35. The model allowed new patients to enter based on BPH incidence in accordance with the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines.

Clinical data

The CombAT trial was a 4-year randomized double-blind parallel group study in 4,844 men ≥ 50 yrs. of age with clinically diagnosed moderate to severe BPH, IPSS ≥ 12, prostate volume ≥ 30 ml, and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) 1.5–10 ng/ml.

The most common aetiology of male LUTS is BPH, thus the incidence of BPH was estimated from the incident of recorded male LUTS in the Netherlands, according to the Verhamme et al. study. Based on this study, the calculated incidence in men aged older than 50 years (2,090) was divided by the number of man-years (110,321) equalling 18.94 per 1,000 man-years.

For the overall mortality weighing, the mortality rates were calculated from the World Health Organization (WHO) health statistics and health information system interim life tables. The annual risk of death in 2009 was extracted for Greek men aged > 50 years.

### Effect of tolterodine extended release with or without tamsulosin on measures of urgency and patient reported outcomes in men with lower urinary tract symptoms [^114CNdhw]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the efficacy of tolterodine extended release and/or tamsulosin on micturition related urgency episodes, urgency severity and patient reported outcomes in men who met entry criteria for prostatic enlargement and overactive bladder trials.

Materials and Methods

Men 40 years old or older with an International Prostate Symptom Score of 12 or greater, frequency (8 or more voids per 24 hours) and urgency (3 or more episodes per 24 hours) with or without urgency urinary incontinence were randomized to placebo, 4 mg tolterodine extended release, 0.4 mg tamsulosin or tolterodine extended release plus tamsulosin for 12 weeks. Subjects completed 5-day diaries; the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition and Urgency Perception Scale at baseline, and weeks 1, 6 and 12; Overactive Bladder Questionnaire at baseline, and weeks 6 and 12; Perception of Treatment Satisfaction question at weeks 1, 6 and 12; and Willingness to Continue question at week 12. Subjects rated the urgency associated with each micturition on a 5-point scale and micturition related urgency episodes were those rated 3 or greater. Urgency severity was measured using frequency-urgency sum, defined as the sum of urgency ratings for all micturitions.

Results

Compared with placebo, tolterodine extended release plus tamsulosin significantly reduced daytime and nocturnal micturition related urgency episodes as well as frequency-urgency sum at weeks 1, 6 and 12. It also improved Patient Perception of Bladder Condition scores at weeks 1, 6 and 12; improved Urgency Perception Scale and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire, Symptom Bother and Health Related Quality of Life scores at weeks 6 and 12; and increased the percentage of subjects who reported treatment satisfaction at weeks 6 and 12, and willingness to continue at week 12.

Conclusions

Treatment with tolterodine extended release plus tamsulosin significantly improved urgency variables and patient reported outcomes in men meeting entry criteria for overactive bladder and prostatic enlargement trials.

### Does this treatment work for me? The patient's role in assessing medical care [^11646SNu]. BMJ Innovations (2017). Medium credibility.

Patient presentation

A 75-year-old man has enlargement of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH) which results in a frequent need to get up at night to urinate (nocturia). This is a common condition in elderly men. Getting up as many as five times a night is inconvenient but is not a life-threatening condition. The patient's primary care physician prescribed the drug tamsulosin hydrochloride (Brand name Flowmax) to be taken one pill (capsule 0.4 mg) a day.

The patient was taking no other medications. The local pharmacist gave him a standardised fact sheet for patients when the prescription is filled. According to this fact sheet, two expected benefits are to reduce the need to urinate often and a stronger urine stream. Two side effects were dizziness and a runny nose.

The patient experienced symptoms of dizziness which were apparent. With the primary care physician's permission, he started to take the pill every other day and to measure the end-results by the number of times he had to get up at night. Each day he kept data on the date, whether or not he took a pill, the number of times he got up at night, the level of exercise on the day before and notes on special cause variation. From 15 July to 11 September 2014 he had collected 55 days of data for his trial. For 28 of these days, after taking the pill he got up 2.22 times on average. Without the pill he got up 2.393 times in 27 days. The overall rate of 'ups' for these 55 days was 2.309.

Global health problem analysis

For this patient with BPH there are four outcomes of potential concern: two results and two side effects. This medication results in the need to trade off the benefits against the side effects. The two benefits and two side effects that are described here were given a utility score that probably differs from patient to patient. The medicine resulted in an improvement in this person's health. The usual and customary cost of this drug is US$119.99 for a 30-day supply. With insurance coverage this drug costs the patient US$12 for 30 pills. On request, the technical package insert from the pharmaceutical firm Sandozwas provided by the pharmacist.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^115jqWEm]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlargement of the transition zone of the prostate that can cause lower urinary tract symptoms and could lead to bladder outlet obstruction in men. Lower urinary tract symptoms can include urinary frequency, urgency, hesitancy, or nocturia, and can result in a marked decrease in quality of life. It has been estimated that 50% of men in the United States over the age of 50 have this condition.

First line medical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia consists of α1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (α blockers) and 5α reductase inhibitors (5ARI). α blockers relieve bladder outlet obstruction by relaxing the periurethral prostatic smooth muscle and allowing for improved urinary flow. 5ARIs have shown to reduce disease progression, prevent complications from benign prostatic hyperplasia (including acute urinary retention and prostate related surgery), and improve lower urinary tract symptoms starting after six months of treatment. Although effective, when initiated, α blockers can induce marked orthostatic hypotension and syncope. This effect was labeled the "first dose phenomenon" by Bendall and colleagues in men using prazosin in 1975, and subsequently has been reported in antagonists to the α1 adrenergic receptor, terazosin and doxazosin. This effect is a consequence of inadvertent vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. A recent study found an increased risk of hip fracture among men taking α blockers but not 5ARIs, suggesting that it may have resulted from an increased risk of hypotension induced falls. Tamsulosin is a uroselective α blocker owing to its selectivity as an α1a receptor antagonist, which is the predominant receptor that mediates prostate smooth muscle tension. Compared to non-selective α1 blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin, tamsulosin has a lower rate of asthenia, dizziness, and severe hypotension in clinical trials. As a result, it has a warning for hypotension and syncope, but not a black box warning similar to less selective α blockers in its class.

It is unknown whether tamsulosin treatment induces a first dose phenomenon in clinical practice and confers increased risk for hypotension, requiring admission to hospital immediately after initiating or restarting drug treatment. Our study aimed to characterize the risk of severe hypotension at time varying intervals during the course of tamsulosin treatment in middle aged and older men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Tamsulosin hydrochloride (Flomax) [^115PmgXi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

13.1	Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Rats administered doses up to 43 mg/kg/day in males and 52 mg/kg/day in females had no increases in tumor incidence, with the exception of a modest increase in the frequency of mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats receiving doses ≥ 5.4 mg/kg (P < 0.015). The highest doses of tamsulosin hydrochloride evaluated in the rat carcinogenicity study produced systemic exposures (AUC) in rats 3 times the exposures in men receiving the maximum therapeutic dose of 0.8 mg/day.

Mice were administered doses up to 127 mg/kg/day in males and 158 mg/kg/day in females. There were no significant tumor findings in male mice. Female mice treated for 2 years with the two highest doses of 45 and 158 mg/kg/day had statistically significant increases in the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas (P < 0.0001) and adenocarcinomas (P < 0.0075). The highest dose levels of tamsulosin hydrochloride evaluated in the mice carcinogenicity study produced systemic exposures (AUC) in mice 8 times the exposures in men receiving the maximum therapeutic dose of 0.8 mg/day.

The increased incidences of mammary gland neoplasms in female rats and mice were considered secondary to tamsulosin hydrochloride-induced hyperprolactinemia. It is not known if FLOMAX capsules elevate prolactin in humans. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is not known.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (Jalyn) [^114iXDMN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Orthostatic Hypotension

As with other alpha-adrenergic antagonists, orthostatic hypotension (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) may occur in patients treated with tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, and can result in syncope. Patients starting treatment with JALYN should be cautioned to avoid situations where syncope could result in an injury [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.2 Drug-Drug Interactions

Strong Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4

Tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, should not be coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) as this can significantly increase tamsulosin exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4, Inhibitors of CYP2D6, or a Combination of Both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, should be used with caution when coadministered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors, or in patients known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2D6, as there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Cimetidine

Caution is advised when tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, are coadministered with cimetidine [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Other Alpha-adrenergic Antagonists

Tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, should not be coadministered with other alpha-adrenergic antagonists because of the increased risk of symptomatic hypotension.

Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) Inhibitors

Caution is advised when alpha-adrenergic–antagonist-containing products, including JALYN, are coadministered with PDE-5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists and PDE-5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these 2 drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension.

Warfarin

Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Comparison of the cardiovascular effects of tamsulosin oral controlled absorption system (OCAS) and alfuzosin prolonged release (XL) [^111QABYE]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The cardiovascular (CV) effects of tamsulosin oral controlled absorption system (OCAS) 0.4 mg were compared with those of alfuzosin prolonged release (XL) 10 mg.

Methods

Two single-dose, crossover studies were performed. In study 1, CV alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonism was assessed by measuring the inhibition of phenylephrine (PE)-induced increases in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) before and after dosing with placebo, tamsulosin OCAS, and alfuzosin XL in 18 young subjects. In study 2, orthostatic stress tests (OTs) were performed before and after dosing with tamsulosin OCAS and alfuzosin XL in 40 elderly subjects. Pharmacokinetics were assessed in both studies.

Results

In study 1, tamsulosin OCAS induced statistically significantly less inhibition of PE-induced increases in DBP at 2 h after dosing and in TPR at 2 and 4 h after dosing than alfuzosin XL. In study 2, tamsulosin OCAS had a lower incidence of positive OTs than did alfuzosin XL, with the difference between both treatments being statistically significant at 6h after dosing and for all time points after dosing combined. This was in line with smaller changes in vital signs observed for tamsulosin OCAS. The t(max) values for both treatments were comparable.

Conclusions

Tamsulosin OCAS 0.4 mg produces smaller vascular effects than does alfuzosin XL 10 mg.

### Does this treatment work for me? The patient's role in assessing medical care [^113q6FPs]. BMJ Innovations (2017). Medium credibility.

The factorial design of experiments can address the following questions: "Does this pill and exercise improve my health?", "Does the combination do good more than one alone?"the usual randomised controlled trial (RCT) design compares two groups of patients. One group gets the drug and the other is the control group. Factorial design refers to the use of more variables at once. This can show both first-order and interaction effects between the individual variables. This approach was used in this person to analyse three variables and their interaction, thereby gaining more information than one would get from a one-variable trial. These variables were taking the pill, level of exercise and number of times up at night and the interaction effect of exercise and pill combined (see table 1).

Table 1
Clinical variables measured to assess the need for medication for nocturia at different levels of exercise (E)

Note that in table 1 there is an interaction effect between exercise and pill taking. Without exercise, taking the pill reduced the frequency of getting up at night from 3.00 times to 2.65 times. With low, medium and high exercise taking, the pill made his health status worse. This interaction effect was surprising and led to a new treatment strategy, to take the pill only when there has been no exercise E(0) and to try to increase the number of days with exercise. This was done for 12 days from 24 April to 5 May 2015. During this time period all but 2 days were exercise days, so two pills were taken in 12 days. The average 'up' score during this time was 1.67. If the two pill days were excluded, the average 'ups' would be 1.3 times per night. To summarise, pill use reduced from one a day to one in 6 days. This is a cost reduction of 83%. Health status as measured by the number of 'ups' went from 2.309 in 2014 to 1.67 in 2015. This is an improvement of 28% or 0.64 'ups' per night, which the patient decided was a clinically significant difference for him. The data on exercise suggest that there is room for more improvement by increasing the number of high exercise days.

### Terazosin hydrochloride (terazosin) [^115r9bG1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension

The dose of terazosin capsules and the dose interval (12 or 24 hours) should be adjusted according to the patient's individual blood pressure response. The following is a guide to its administration:

Initial Dose

1 mg at bedtime is the starting dose for all patients, and this dose should not be exceeded. This initial dosing regimen should be strictly observed to minimize the potential for severe hypotensive effects.

Subsequent Doses

The dose may be slowly increased to achieve the desired blood pressure response. The usual recommended dose range is 1 mg to 5 mg administered once a day; however, some patients may benefit from doses as high as 20 mg per day. Doses over 20 mg do not appear to provide further blood pressure effect and doses over 40 mg have not been studied. Blood pressure should be monitored at the end of the dosing interval to be sure control is maintained throughout the interval. It may also be helpful to measure blood pressure 2 to 3 hours after dosing to see if the maximum and minimum responses are similar, and to evaluate symptoms such as dizziness or palpitations which can result from excessive hypotensive response. If response is substantially diminished at 24 hours an increased dose or use of a twice daily regimen can be considered. If terazosin administration is discontinued for several days or longer, therapy should be reinstituted using the initial dosing regimen. In clinical trials, except for the initial dose, the dose was given in the morning.

### Tolterodine and tamsulosin for treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms and overactive bladder: a randomized controlled trial [^111UysJw]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Men with overactive bladder and other lower urinary tract symptoms may not respond to monotherapy with antimuscarinic agents or alpha-receptor antagonists.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tolterodine extended release (ER), tamsulosin, or both in men who met research criteria for both overactive bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 95 urology clinics in the United States involving men 40 years or older who had a total International Prostate Symptom Score of 12 or higher and, an International Prostate Symptom Score quality-of-life (QOL) item score of 3 or higher, a self-rated bladder condition of at least moderate bother, and a bladder diary documenting micturition frequency (≥ 8 micturitions per 24 hours) and urgency (≥ 3 episodes per 24 hours), with or without urgency urinary incontinence. Patients were recruited between November 2004 and February 2006, and the study was completed May 2006.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 222), 4 mg of tolterodine ER (n = 217), 0.4 mg of tamsulosin (n = 215), or both tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin (n = 225) for 12 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Patient perception of treatment benefit, bladder diary variables, International Prostate Symptom Scores, and safety and tolerability were assessed.

Results

A total of 172 men (80%) receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin reported treatment benefit by week 12 compared with 132 patients (62%) receiving placebo (P < .001), 146 (71%) receiving tamsulosin (P = .06 vs placebo), or 135 (65%) receiving tolterodine ER (P = .48 vs placebo). Patients receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin compared with placebo experienced significant reductions in urgency urinary incontinence (-0.88 vs -0.31, P = .005), urgency episodes without incontinence (-3.33 vs -2.54, P = .03), micturitions per 24 hours (-2.54 vs -1.41, P < .001), and micturitions per night (-0.59 vs -0.39, P.02). Patients receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin demonstrated significant improvements on the total International Prostate Symptom Score (-8.02 vs placebo, -6.19, P = .003) and QOL item (-1.61 vs -1.17, P = .003). All interventions were well tolerated. The incidence of acute urinary retention requiring catheterization was low (tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin, 0.4%; tolterodine ER, 0.5%; tamsulosin, 0%; and placebo, 0%).

Conclusions

These results suggest that treatment with tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin for 12 weeks provides benefit for men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms including overactive bladder. Clinical Trials Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00147654.

### Terazosin (Tezruly) [^112CuCfm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

Initial Dose: 1 mg orally once daily at bedtime. This dose should not be exceeded as an initial dose. Closely follow patients during initial administration in order to minimize the risk of severe hypotensive response, including syncope. For administration instructions, see Dosage and Administration (2.3).

Subsequent Doses: The dose should be increased in a stepwise fashion from 2 mg to 10 mg orally once daily to achieve the desired improvement of symptoms and/or flow rates. Doses of 10 mg once daily are generally required for a clinical response. Therefore, treatment with 10 mg for a minimum of 4 weeks to 6 weeks may be required to assess whether a beneficial response has been achieved. Although some patients responded to 20 mg per daily, data are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about this dose. There are insufficient data to support the use of doses higher than 20 mg daily. If TEZRULY is discontinued for more than a few days, therapy should be restarted using the initial dosing regimen. For administration instructions, see Dosage and Administration (2.3).

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^111WrShC]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

*Defined during the six month baseline period before new drug use.

†Adjusted for as time varying covariates in study models, updated in each seven day increment.

In the primary cohort analysis, 2562 hypotension events were observed during 880 770 total person years of follow-up (29.1 events per 10 000 person years). The incidence for hypotension in patients taking 5ARIs was similar to that of the overall cohort (451 events, 144 309 person years; 31.3 events per 10 000 person years). During 240 276 person years exposed to tamsulosin, 1018 events were observed, producing an empirically larger incidence (42.4 events per 10 000 person years).

The cohort approach observed a 2.12 times increased rate ratio for severe hypotension during weeks 1–4 after initiating tamsulosin treatment (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 3.04). Elevated risk was observed during weeks 5–8 after tamsulosin initiation (rate ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.18) but not during weeks 9–12 (1.16, 0.83 to 1.61). After restarting drug treatment, we observed a similar increase in risk during weeks 1–4 (1.84, 1.46 to 2.33) and weeks 5–8 (1.85, 1.45 to 2.36), although the risk increase during weeks 9–12 was not significant (1.34, 0.97 to 1.84). Maintenance treatment had a smaller but significantly increased risk for hypotension (1.19, 1.07 to 1.32). Table 2shows all results from the cohort analysis.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^115yvo6X]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The main limitation of this study was the inability to precisely determine when the patients went to bed and when they awoke, as patient diaries were not maintained. In order to correct for imprecise daytime and night-time periods, we used narrower windows for the daytime (8 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and night-time (12 a.m. to 6 a.m.) periods. Further, comparisons between morning and evening dosing of valsartan were limited to the maximum dose (320 mg), and comparisons of lower doses of valsartan may have shown a similar response provided the drugs are given in doses that have a complete 24-h duration of action.

In conclusion, in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension, treatment with valsartan can be given once a day, regardless of the dosing time, to effectively lower BP throughout the 24-h period, including the night-time and early morning periods.

Dutasteride: Following administration of a single 0.5-mg dose of a soft gelatin capsule, time to peak absolute bioavailability in 5 healthy subjects is approximately 60% (range: 40% to 94%).

Tamsulosin: Absorption of tamsulosin is essentially complete (> 90%) following oral administration of 0.4-mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules under fasting conditions. Tamsulosin exhibits linear kinetics following single and multiple dosing, with achievement of steady-state concentrations by the fifth day of once-daily dosing.

Effect of Food

Food does not affect the pharmacokinetics of dutasteride following administration of JALYN. However, a mean 30% decrease in tamsulosin Cmaxwas observed when JALYN was administered with food, similar to that seen when tamsulosin monotherapy was administered under fed versus fasting conditions.

### Effect of naftopidil on nocturia after failure of tamsulosin [^111Gg5f5]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The clinical usefulness of naftopidil was evaluated in 122 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia for urinary tract symptoms and signs, focused in particular on nocturia.

Methods

A total of 122 patients with BPH whose symptoms did not improve after 6 weeks of tamsulosin administration were enrolled. After the treatment was followed by a washout period with placebo, patients were prescribed 75 mg of naftopidil to be taken after dinner for 6 weeks, and the efficacy was re-evaluated. All the drugs used were unidentified, and attention was given to not have the patients recognize the change in the drug given. The primary purpose of this study was the improvement of nocturia in patients with a poor response to tamsulosin. The clinical efficacy of naftopidil was defined as significant improvement in International Prostate Symptom Score, quality-of-life index, and maximal urinary flow rate.

Results

After 6 weeks of naftopidil administration, significant improvements in daytime and nighttime frequency, International Prostate Symptom Score, quality-of-life index, maximal flow rate, average flow rate, and bladder compliance were examined. On the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire, improvement in the sensation of the bladder not emptying and a reduction in nighttime frequency stood out. Moreover, detrusor overactivity was observed in 40 patients before the start of treatment and was eliminated in 31. The effective rate of this study was 69.7% (85/122).

Conclusions

Naftopidil has novel effects in patients with BPH whose main complaints are storage and voiding symptoms, especially that of nocturia of ≥ 3 times, as well as in patients with a low compliance bladder and detrusor overactivity, who did not respond to tamsulosin.
