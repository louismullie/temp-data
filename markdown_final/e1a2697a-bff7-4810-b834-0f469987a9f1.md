## Question

Summerize supratherapeutic inr and aki?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between supratherapeutic INR and acute kidney injury, including definitions, mechanisms, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical implications, and management strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and diagnostic criteria for supratherapeutic INR and anticoagulation-related nephropathy. Then, I should verify the bidirectional relationship between supratherapeutic INR and AKI. Next, I will examine pathophysiological mechanisms, followed by epidemiology and risk factors. After that, I need to assess clinical consequences and outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and highlight controversies and evidence gaps, making sure I double-check key claims against guidelines and pivotal studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't anchor on a vague concept. Supratherapeutic INR is generally INR above the indication-specific target, with most data highlighting risk escalation when INR exceeds 3.0 and particularly when INR is 4.5 or higher, where bleeding risk rises substantially and anticoagulation-related nephropathy becomes more likely to be diagnosed [^112sjbvT] [^1174t4EA]. Anticoagulation-related nephropathy is defined as AKI without an obvious alternative etiology in the setting of INR greater than 3.0, typically with hematuria and biopsy features of glomerular hemorrhage and tubular obstruction by RBC casts, and it has been described with warfarin and, less commonly, with DOACs [^112sjbvT] [^111y2Jiv] [^111nFBVS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about directionality. I need to check whether supratherapeutic INR causes AKI or AKI precipitates supratherapeutic INR. The dominant clinical signal is bidirectional: excessive anticoagulation can cause ARN with intrarenal bleeding and tubular obstruction, while AKI itself can destabilize VKA control and drive INR overshooting via uremic toxin effects on protein binding and CYP metabolism, creating a vicious cycle that worsens both coagulopathy and renal injury [^112sjbvT] [^111eXdqm] [^113fBtLX].

> I will now examine mechanisms for ARN when INR is high. The primary mechanism is glomerular hemorrhage with RBC casts obstructing distal tubules and Bowman's space, causing acute tubular injury; biopsy series and translational models corroborate this, and animal data show that excessive anticoagulation in nephron-reduced models reproduces the phenotype, supporting a causal link in vulnerable kidneys [^112sjbvT] [^111dsPT8]. But wait, what if DOACs behave differently? Case reports and mechanistic hypotheses suggest DOACs can rarely produce a similar ARN phenotype, though the evidence is weaker and often in the setting of preexisting glomerular injury or reduced nephron mass, so I should be cautious in overgeneralizing to all DOACs [^111y2Jiv] [^1159AhyW].

> Next, I should review how AKI perturbs VKA pharmacology to elevate INR. Let me think about protein binding and metabolism: VKAs are 99% protein bound, and uremic acidosis or retained toxins may increase the free fraction. Uremia also downregulates CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, slowing VKA metabolism and further amplifying anticoagulant effect during AKI, which mechanistically explains INR overshoot observed clinically during AKI episodes [^111eXdqm] [^113fBtLX]. I should double-check that this is not just conjecture; the clinical series documents a median INR rise from 2.24 to 3.17 during AKI with frequent supratherapeutic values, supporting the plausibility of these mechanisms in real patients [^113fBtLX].

> Let me consider epidemiology and risk factors so I can quantify risk and identify who to watch closely. In a large warfarin cohort, presumptive ARN occurred in about 20.5% overall when INR exceeded 3.0, with higher incidence in CKD (33%) versus non-CKD (16.5%), and was associated with a 65% increase in 1‑year mortality, underscoring both frequency and prognostic impact [^1151xaMf]. In AKI cohorts on VKAs, overanticoagulation is common, with 54% having INR above target during AKI and 24% experiencing bleeding, and dose reduction or interruption was required in 55%, highlighting the frequency of clinically meaningful derailment during AKI [^111gH3Xo] [^113fBtLX]. Risk factors include CKD, older age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, low BMI, female sex, and intercurrent illness or drug interactions, all of which increase vulnerability to INR instability and ARN [^1151xaMf] [^111gH3Xo] [^116ML8tX].

> I need to ensure I capture the clinical consequences accurately. ARN is associated with accelerated CKD progression and substantially increased short- and long-term mortality, with 1‑year mortality approaching 31% in some series, and even when ARN resolves, residual renal impairment is common, especially in those with preexisting CKD or persistent glomerular bleeding [^112sjbvT] [^1151xaMf]. Beyond direct nephrotoxicity, supratherapeutic INR during AKI increases bleeding risk, complicates procedures, and may necessitate reversal or interruption of anticoagulation, which itself can expose patients to thrombotic risk depending on indication [^111gH3Xo] [^114rHUnb].

> Now, I should review management principles, and I need to be careful to align with guidelines. Immediate steps include confirming the diagnosis with urinalysis for hematuria, checking INR frequently, and holding or reducing VKA. For INR greater than 8 without bleeding, oral vitamin K 1–5 mg with repeat INR in 12–24 hours is recommended, and for major bleeding or life-threatening coagulopathy, rapid reversal with 4‑factor PCC plus vitamin K is indicated, with FFP as adjunct when needed [^1135Nc6p] [^1174t4EA] [^114rHUnb]. Supportive care for presumed ARN emphasizes strict blood pressure control, adequate intravascular volume to maintain urine flow, and close monitoring for bleeding. Case-based data suggest that early correction of coagulopathy and generous hydration may facilitate cast clearance and renal recovery, though high-quality trials are lacking [^1178MgXG] [^1159AhyW]. If anticoagulation must be continued, consider switching to a DOAC with renal dose adjustment and a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile, recognizing that DOACs are not risk-free and that evidence for lower ARN incidence with DOACs is suggestive but not definitive [^114rHUnb] [^111vRAHs] [^111Qj6J9].

> But wait, what about prevention and longitudinal risk mitigation? I should confirm that more frequent INR monitoring is advised in patients with compromised renal function or during intercurrent illness, and that dose adjustments, drug–drug interaction review, and patient education can reduce supratherapeutic excursions; maintaining time in therapeutic range above about 70% is associated with better outcomes even in CKD, though achieving this is harder as eGFR declines [^112suW8u] [^114Svpg5]. In patients at high risk for AKI or with fluctuating renal function, proactive planning for anticoagulation strategy, hydration protocols during acute illness, and early INR checks during intercurrent events are prudent to mitigate both ARN and bleeding risk [^112suW8u].

> Next, I should review special contexts so I don't miss important scenarios. In COVID-19, AKI is common and drug interactions can destabilize VKA control, with reports of very high INRs and bleeding; careful medication reconciliation and INR surveillance are essential, and some centers favor LMWH strategies when AKI is severe due to predictable clearance and anti-Xa monitoring options [^117JY5gb]. In cirrhosis and procedural settings, AKI and coagulopathy independently increase bleeding risk, and viscoelastic testing may outperform INR for assessing hemostasis; pre-procedural optimization of kidney function and antithrombotic management is recommended when feasible [^113EqzF1] [^1124zj3z].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations. Much of the ARN literature is observational and retrospective, with limited biopsy confirmation and no randomized trials of reversal strategies or anticoagulant switching; causality remains inferential, and under-recognition likely inflates incidence estimates, so clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when AKI and supratherapeutic INR coexist without another clear cause [^111y2Jiv] [^113bCd98]. The bidirectional relationship between AKI and supratherapeutic INR is biologically plausible and clinically observed, but prospective interventional studies are needed to define optimal reversal thresholds, the role of DOAC switching, and the impact of early hemodynamic optimization on renal recovery [^111eXdqm] [^1159AhyW].

> In summary, supratherapeutic INR and AKI are locked in a dangerous bidirectional interplay: excessive anticoagulation can precipitate ARN via glomerular hemorrhage and tubular obstruction, while AKI can amplify VKA effect and provoke INR overshooting, together worsening bleeding risk and renal outcomes. Prompt recognition, reversal of coagulopathy when indicated, supportive renal care, and risk-stratified anticoagulation adjustments are the cornerstones of management until stronger guideline-level evidence emerges [^112sjbvT] [^111gH3Xo] [^114rHUnb].

---

Supratherapeutic INR is strongly linked to **AKI via glomerular hemorrhage and tubular obstruction** [^111y2Jiv] from red cell casts, especially in CKD [^1151xaMf]. AKI risk rises with INR > 3.0 and is highest in those with pre-existing CKD, diabetes, or hypertension [^1151xaMf]. Management centers on **prompt INR correction** with vitamin K and 4-factor PCC [^114rHUnb], holding anticoagulation, and supportive care; prevention requires close INR monitoring and dose adjustment in CKD or AKI [^112suW8u]. DOACs may reduce AKI risk compared with warfarin, but evidence is limited and renal dosing is essential [^111Qj6J9] [^111vRAHs].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking supratherapeutic INR and AKI

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** explain how supratherapeutic INR precipitates AKI:

- **Glomerular hemorrhage and tubular obstruction**: Excessive anticoagulation causes glomerular bleeding, red cell casts, and tubular obstruction, leading to acute tubular injury [^1151xaMf] [^111dsPT8].

- **Thrombin depletion and endothelial injury**: Warfarin-induced thrombin depletion impairs endothelial integrity, promoting hemorrhage and microvascular injury [^112sjbvT].

- **Cholesterol microemboli**: Warfarin may dislodge atheromatous emboli, causing renal microemboli and ischemic injury [^112suW8u] [^114fBrgo].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and case series document the **association between supratherapeutic INR and AKI**:

- **Warfarin-related nephropathy (WRN)**: WRN is defined as AKI occurring within 1 week of INR > 3.0, with biopsy showing glomerular hemorrhage and red cell casts [^1151xaMf] [^114ZnBs1].

- **Incidence and risk factors**: WRN occurs in 16.5% of patients without CKD and 33% with CKD; risk increases with age, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [^1151xaMf].

- **Mortality**: WRN is associated with a 65% increase in 1-year mortality [^1151xaMf].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain populations are at **higher risk** of AKI from supratherapeutic INR:

| **Patient population** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Chronic kidney disease (CKD) | - Reduced renal reserve <br/> - Glomerular fragility <br/> - Frequent INR fluctuations [^1151xaMf] [^111nFBVS] |
| Diabetes mellitus | - Glomerular basement membrane thickening <br/> - Endothelial dysfunction [^1151xaMf] |
| Hypertension | - Glomerular hypertension <br/> - Endothelial injury [^1151xaMf] |
| Elderly patients | - Increased bleeding risk <br/> - INR instability [^1151xaMf] |
| Patients with acute illness or infection | - INR fluctuations <br/> - Drug interactions [^116HwxHZ] |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria

AKI from supratherapeutic INR typically presents with:

- **Rapid rise in serum creatinine**: ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 1 week of INR > 3.0 [^1151xaMf].

- **Hematuria**: Macroscopic or microscopic [^115h9PZc].

- **Red cell casts**: On urinalysis [^111dsPT8].

- **Kidney biopsy**: Glomerular hemorrhage, red cell casts, and acute tubular injury [^111dsPT8].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires **coordinated correction of coagulopathy and AKI care**:

- **Immediate INR correction**: Vitamin K and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) for rapid reversal [^114nGdyt].

- **Temporary anticoagulation cessation**: Hold warfarin until INR is therapeutic and renal function stabilizes [^1174t4EA].

- **Supportive AKI care**: Volume management, blood pressure control, and avoidance of nephrotoxins [^116xyTFD].

- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: Consider for severe AKI or life-threatening indications [^1112REET].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **close INR monitoring**, especially in CKD or during acute illness, with dose adjustments to avoid INR > 3.0 [^112suW8u]. Patient education on adherence, diet, and drug interactions helps reduce INR variability [^notfound]. DOACs may reduce AKI risk compared with warfarin, but evidence is limited and renal dosing is essential [^111Qj6J9] [^111vRAHs].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

AKI from supratherapeutic INR carries **significant morbidity and mortality**: 1-year mortality is ~31% and CKD progression is accelerated, especially with recurrent episodes [^1151xaMf]. Many patients require short- or long-term dialysis, and recurrence is common if anticoagulation is not carefully managed [^113m7jGq].

---

Supratherapeutic INR is a **preventable cause of AKI** via glomerular hemorrhage and tubular obstruction; prompt INR reversal, supportive care, and vigilant monitoring are key to improving outcomes.

KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI) — KDOQI US commentary conclusion states that the work group "recognizes the need for a consensus definition of AKI and commends KDIGO for harmonizing the prior definitions and staging criteria", but "do not believe that it is sufficiently validated for use in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with AKI", and that management "should be based on assessment of overall clinical status, including specific cause of AKI, trends in kidney function over time, comorbid conditions, assessment of volume status, and concomitant acid-base and electrolyte disturbances". For prevention and nondialytic management, they "generally agreed" yet "note the paucity of high-level evidence and the absence of highly effective therapies", and "can support the use of protocol-based management of perioperative patients and patients with sepsis" while stating such protocols "need to be further developed and validated" and that they "do not believe that there are sufficient data to benchmark care". Regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT), "we are in general agreement with the KDIGO recommendations", but "Given the lack of FDA-approved citrate solutions for regional anticoagulation during CRRT, we do not believe that this approach can be currently recommended; however, we believe that this will need to be reconsidered if appropriate citrate solutions become available". They also note that KDIGO provides "little discussion of the modalities of PIRRT" and "believe that these modalities are a reasonable alternative to CRRT in hemodynamically unstable patients".

### The safety of direct oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in patients hospitalized with acute kidney injury [^116KRJe8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin for many indications, though their safety has not been well established in patients with acute renal impairment.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of bleeding complications associated with DOACs compared with warfarin in patients admitted to the hospital with acute kidney injury (AKI).

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study evaluating patients admitted to the Penn Medicine Lancaster General Hospital with a diagnosis of AKI from October 2017 through September 2021 and receiving therapy with oral anticoagulants. Comparing DOACs with warfarin, the primary endpoint was the percent frequency of composite major and minor bleeding during the admission and within 30 days of discharge.

Results

There were 112 hospitalization encounters included in the study. Of these, 42 (37.5%) patients were receiving warfarin and 70 (62.5%) patients were receiving DOAC therapy before admission. There was a higher frequency of the primary endpoint of bleeding in patients receiving DOACs as compared with warfarin, though this was not statistically significant (18.5% vs. 11.9%, respectively, P = 0.432). There were no differences between groups in the frequency of major bleeding, minor bleeding, or transfusions. Patients receiving DOAC therapy were more likely to experience anticoagulation-related readmissions or emergency department visits compared with patients on warfarin therapy (11.4% vs. 0%, P = 0.024).

Conclusion and Relevance

Direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin were associated with statistically similar rates of bleeding in patients presenting with AKI. Further research is necessary to elucidate if DOACs are safer than warfarin in this patient population.

### The intensive care medicine agenda on acute kidney injury [^116xyTFD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in the critically ill. Current standard of care mainly relies on identification of patients at risk, haemodynamic optimization, avoidance of nephrotoxicity and the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in established AKI. The detection of early biomarkers of renal tissue damage is a recent development that allows amending the late and insensitive diagnosis with current AKI criteria. Increasing evidence suggests that the consequences of an episode of AKI extend long beyond the acute hospitalization. Citrate has been established as the anticoagulant of choice for continuous RRT. Conflicting results have been published on the optimal timing of RRT and on the renoprotective effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning. Recent research has contradicted that acute tubular necrosis is the common pathology in AKI, that septic AKI is due to global kidney hypoperfusion, that aggressive fluid therapy benefits the kidney, that vasopressor therapy harms the kidney and that high doses of RRT improve outcome. Remaining uncertainties include the impact of aetiology and clinical context on pathophysiology, therapy and prognosis, the clinical benefit of biomarker-driven interventions, the optimal mode of RRT to improve short- and long-term patient and kidney outcomes, the contribution of AKI to failure of other organs and the optimal approach for assessing and promoting renal recovery. Based on the established gaps in current knowledge the trials that must have priority in the coming 10 years are proposed together with the definition of appropriate clinical endpoints.

### Updates in the perioperative and emergency management of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^115vnKFk]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Perioperative management of patients treated with the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants is an ongoing challenge. Due to the lack of good clinical studies involving adequate monitoring and reversal therapies, management requires knowledge and understanding of pharmacokinetics, renal function, drug interactions, and evaluation of the surgical bleeding risk. Consideration of the benefit of reversal of anticoagulation is important and, for some low risk bleeding procedures, it may be in the patient's interest to continue anticoagulation. In case of major intra-operative bleeding in patients likely to have therapeutic or supra-therapeutic levels of anticoagulation, specific reversal agents/antidotes would be of value but are currently lacking. As a consequence, a multimodal approach should be taken which includes the administration of 25 to 50 U/kg 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or 30 to 50 U/kg activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA®) in some life-threatening situations. Finally, further studies are needed to clarify the ideal therapeutic intervention.

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^112V6rr1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are still in use for oral anticoagulation, but not all indications allow their replacement by direct oral anticoagulants. Although formal dose reduction is not required in patients with impaired kidney function, case reports indicate that acute kidney injury (AKI) might be associated with derailment of VKA therapy.

Methods

The study retrospectively collected patients from a tertiary nephrology care centre who experienced AKI while being treated with VKA. In these individuals, the international normalized ratio (INR) as a measure of anticoagulant effect during renal failure was compared with a reference time point with stable kidney function.

Results

A total of 100 patients with AKI and ongoing VKA therapy met the inclusion criteria. The majority (76%) of patients had AKI with CKD. Volume depletion (n = 43), septic renal failure (n = 22), decompensated heart failure (n = 18) and toxic renal damage (n = 11) were the most important causes of AKI. The average INR values at the time of AKI were higher than at the reference time point [median 3.17 (range 1.10–13.0) versus 2.24 (1.07–5.17); P < 0.0001]. Fifty-four patients had INR values above the recommended therapeutic range for their indication at the time point of AKI. Bleeding complications occurred in 24 patients during AKI and the VKA dose had to be reduced in 55. Women, patients with low body mass index and patients with diabetes were predisposed to overanticoagulation during AKI.

Conclusions

The effect of AKI on anticoagulation by VKA has not been systematically described. This risk should be considered in patients at high risk for AKI.

### Supratherapeutic vancomycin levels after trauma predict acute kidney injury and mortality [^112GTnrS]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

High-dose vancomycin is increasingly prescribed for critically ill trauma patients at risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Although trauma patients have multiple known risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI), a link between vancomycin and AKI or mortality has not been established. We hypothesize that high vancomycin trough concentration (VT) after trauma is associated with AKI and increased mortality.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis from a single institution Level I trauma center. Data were reviewed for all adult trauma patients who were admitted between 2006 and 2010. Patients were included if they received intravenous vancomycin, had serum creatinine levels before and after vancomycin administration, and had at least one recorded VT. Patients were stratified by VT into four groups: VT1 = 0–10 mg/L, VT2 = 10.1–15 mg/L, VT3 = 15.1–20 mg/L, VT4 > 20 mg/L. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the association between VT, AKI, and mortality.

Results

Of the 6781 trauma patients reviewed, 263 (3.9%) fit inclusion criteria. Ninety-seven (36.9%) patients developed AKI and 25 (9.5%) died. AKI and mortality increased progressively with VT. Ninety-one patients (34.6%) had troughs > 20 mg/L and VT4 was independently associated with AKI (AOR 4.7, P < 0.01) and mortality (AOR 4.8, P = 0.05).

Conclusion

AKI is common in trauma patients who receive intravenous vancomycin. A supratherapeutic trough level of > 20 mg/L is an independent predictor of AKI and mortality in trauma patients.

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^113CorUX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Formal dose reduction according to renal function is not required when prescribing vitamin K antagonists (VKAs).
Excretion of warfarin, acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon mainly depends on hepatic function.

What this study adds?

Acute impairment of renal function is associated with overanticoagulation in patients who are on long-term VKA therapy.
Women, patients with low body mass index and diabetic patients are at particular risk for overanticoagulation during AKI.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

Awareness of this particular risk may lead to avoidance of VKA in patients with high risk for AKI (if possible) and attention to coagulation parameters in patients with VKA who happen to have AKI.

Level 2 recommendations and anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) — The Work Group agreed that diuretics should not be used specifically for improving kidney function or reducing the need for RRT and believed there is no consensus on a first-choice anticoagulant for CRRT. Monitoring should include evaluation of anticoagulant effect, filter efficacy, and circuit life and complications. The commentary notes that citrate is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as an anticoagulant for CRRT; because citrate is not universally available in the United States it cannot be recommended over heparin, and citrate cannot be recommended for no anticoagulation during CRRT at present.

### Rare occurrence of anticoagulant-related nephropathy in a patient with mechanical mitral valve replacement [^115h9PZc]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Anticoagulant-related nephropathy (ARN) is a rare type of acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by excessive anticoagulation with warfarin or other anticoagulants, such as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). We describe a case of a woman in her 50s with a background history of mitral valve replacement who was on warfarin and admitted for AKI, haematuria and a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio (INR) level. A renal biopsy showed red cell casts in the renal tubules, and a diagnosis of ARN was made. Her treatment included the temporary withdrawal of warfarin. Her renal function improved, and warfarin was restarted before she was discharged. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high clinical suspicion when diagnosing ARN in patients who present with AKI and supratherapeutic INR levels.

Definitions

AKI creatinine was defined as the serum creatinine measured on the day of admission for AKI. The reference creatinine in most cases was a creatinine value that had been measured within a time window of 6 months prior to the admission. The value was determined from the patient's records from the hospital, the outpatient clinic or the patient's general physician. Such reference values could be obtained in 59 patients. In 41 patients, no such value could be found. In these individuals we used the best serum creatinine they achieved within 21 days of recovery after AKI as a reference. Patients who were suspected of having AKI and in whom we did not find a suitable reference value were excluded from the study. Pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) was assumed if the reference creatinine value translated into an estimated GFR (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² according to the Chronic Lidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula, following the KDIGO definition of CKD.

The INR values were taken from the day of either AKI creatinine or reference creatinine. If these values were unavailable, the next value within a maximum time window of 24 h was used. All other demographic and laboratory data were taken from the day of admission to the hospital. The recommended therapeutic range for the INR values was individually determined according to the indication for anticoagulation. Therefore a range of INR of –2.5–3.5 was considered adequate for patients with prosthetic heart valves and an INR of 2–3 for all other indications.

Statistics

Categorical variables are presented as the percentage of patients. Continuous data are expressed as median and range. They were compared by the Wilcoxon matched pair test. Frequencies were compared with Fisher's exact test. The influence of demographic and clinical variables on the occurrence of an INR increase during AKI was estimated by multivariable logistic regression. Data were computed with SPSS version 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The data underlying this article will be shared upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.

### Warfarin sodium (Jantoven) [^111ejkvq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Acute Kidney Injury

In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of kidney disease, acute kidney injury may occur with JANTOVEN, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is advised in patients with compromised renal function.

5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli

Anticoagulation therapy with JANTOVEN may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as "purple toes syndrome". Discontinue JANTOVEN therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

5.6 Limb Ischemia, Necrosis, and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS

Do not use JANTOVEN as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death. Treatment with JANTOVEN may be considered after the platelet count has normalized.

5.7 Use in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves

JANTOVEN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. While JANTOVEN is contraindicated during pregnancy, the potential benefits of using JANTOVEN may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the decision to initiate or continue JANTOVEN should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient's medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. JANTOVEN exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### A surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part one: warfarin and new direct oral anticoagulant medications [^116HwxHZ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Warfarin is often a contributor to bleeding events requiring hospitalization. Warfarin, alone or in combination with other mediations, was implicated in one-third of emergency hospitalizations for medication-related adverse events in the elderly between 2007 and 2009. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or retroperitoneal hemorrhage leading to hospitalization is as high as 16% per year, and the risk of fatal bleeding is as high as 3%. As warfarin use is relatively common, preinjury warfarin use in trauma victims is frequently encountered. In trauma patients aged 65 and older admitted to US trauma centers, roughly 1 in 10 can be expected to be on warfarin therapy at the time of injury, complicating management. Not surprisingly, patients on warfarin therapy at the time of traumatic injury are at higher risk of mortality.

The risk of warfarin-associated hemorrhage is correlated with the level of anticoagulation as measured by the international normalized ratio (INR), with the risk of bleeding increased by a factor of 1.43 for each 0.5 unit increase in INR. For warfarin to be effective and relatively safe, the therapeutic window for the medication is between an INR of 2 and 3 (or slightly higher for mechanical valves). However, INR levels outside of this therapeutic window over the course of warfarin therapy are commonplace, increasing thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk. Factors contributing to a supratherapeutic INR include interactions with other medications (particularly antibiotics), acute medical illness and traumatic brain injury or other trauma-related hemorrhage.

Significance of nontherapeutic INRs — causes and clinical risk — includes that fluctuations may result from inaccuracy in testing, vitamin K intake or absorption/metabolism changes, other drug effects, or noncompliance, and that adverse event rates rise sharply as INR moves outside target range; in a retrospective analysis of 3,000 atrial fibrillation patients, the poorest control group (48% of time in range) had twice the rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, and death compared with the best control group (83% of time in range); although excessively elevated INRs, particularly > 5.0, increase bleeding risk, registry data suggest short-term major bleeding risk is low for a single INR between 5.0 and 9.0, and in a matched cohort of 2,597 warfarin patients a single significant supratherapeutic INR had low 3 months thromboembolism risk (0.4%), with similar rates reported in 294 mechanical heart valve patients.

Acute liver failure (ALF)

Definition

Acute liver failure was first defined in 1970 to describe a rare and potentially reversible critical illness caused by "severe liver injury in the absence of prior liver disease with hepatic encephalopathy occurring within 8 weeks from the appearance of first symptoms". In general, the duration of the symptoms should not be longer than 26 weeks to be considered ALF.

Since the first definition of ALF, several authors have classified ALF according to the interval between the appearance of jaundice and the onset of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (Table 1), e.g. defining "fulminant" for appearance of hepatic encephalopathy in the first 2 weeks and "subfulminant" when occurring until week 12. O´Grady employed the terms "hyperacute", "acute" and "subacute" for an onset of hepatic encephalopathy within 1, 4 or between 5 and 12 weeks, respectively. The Japanese consensus classifies ALF into "acute liver failure without hepatic coma" (HE < Grade II) and "acute liver failure with hepatic coma" (HE ≥ Grade II). The latter distinguishes between the "acute type" and "subacute type", with hepatic encephalopathy developing within 10 days or between 11 and 56 days, respectively. If hepatic encephalopathy occurs later, the disease is known as late-onset hepatic failure (LOHF). All these classifications can even be further complicated if the etiology of ALF is taken into consideration, which can lead to lack of comparability of clinical trials.

Conclusion

In real‐life newly diagnosed AF patients on warfarin, those with eGFR < 30/dialysis have a significantly worse INR control. An optimal TTR (> 75%) is associated with lower risk of adverse events, independently of underlying renal function. Identifying the reasons behind, and applying more‐stringent efforts to improve, the TTR of these patients is necessary to ensure warfarin's net clinical benefit.

Heparin monitoring and bleeding risk — The risk of heparin-associated bleeding increases with heparin dose and with concomitant administration of fibrinolytic agents or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and it is also increased by recent surgery, trauma, invasive procedures, or concomitant hemostatic defects; in hospitalized patients, increasing number of comorbidities, age ≥ 60 y, supratherapeutic clotting times, and worsening hepatic dysfunction increase the risk of anticoagulant-associated bleeding. Because the anticoagulant response to heparin varies among patients, it is standard practice to monitor heparin and to adjust the dose based on the results of coagulation tests. The evidence for adjusting the dose of heparin to maintain a "therapeutic range" is weak, whereas the evidence for maintaining the international normalized ratio (INR) within a "therapeutic range" in vitamin K antagonist therapy is strong.

### Chronic anticoagulation is not associated with a reduced risk of acute kidney injury in hospitalised COVID-19 patients [^117JY5gb]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Stage 3 AKI was seen in 12% of all patients taking anticoagulation and this finding is important to highlight the need to review the suitability of the anticoagulant depending on the patient's condition. Russo et al. found that COVID-19 patients with AKI had a higher risk of death from bleeding compared to the rest of the study population and postulated this may have been related to an overdose of anticoagulants. In patients with COVID-19 and AKI stage 3, LMWH dosed as per local protocols for renal impairment with anti-Xa monitoring should be preferred due to the DOACs' reliance on renal excretion and the variability of INR seen with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Supratherapeutic INRs were seen in our patients at admission similar to a study from Kings College, London which also noted high INRs (INR > 8) mostly relating to the antimicrobial therapy used to treat COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients chronically anticoagulated have been recommended to switch to DOACs, if appropriate, during the pandemic with less monitoring required than VKAs and this was seen in a proportion of our patients at discharge. However a recent Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) alert has highlighted an increase in reported major bleeding episodes with DOACs. Due to potential interactions with the COVID-19 trial medication lopinavir/ritonavir or macrolide antimicrobial therapy used for pneumonia, along with high rates of AKI associated with COVID-19 extra vigilance is required when using these drugs to ensure the dose is appropriate and any additional therapies are suitable in combination.

We found that significantly fewer patients taking anticoagulant therapy were admitted to the ICU and they were less likely to receive mechanical ventilation than those not anticoagulated. Our findings could be explained by agreed limitations of care in the anticoagulated population due to pre-existing co-morbidities, including metastatic cancer, and advanced age. Both of these are also likely to impact on ICU survival. All of the anticoagulated patients who became critically ill and were admitted to ICU were switched to therapeutic LMWH. Additional benefits of LMWH in severe COVID-19 disease have been described with a systematic review concluding that heparin can decrease levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Numerous mechanisms of how heparins do this are described in the literature to include binding to and neutralisation of cytokines, interference with leukocyte trafficking, reducing viral cellular entry, and neutralisation of extracellular cytotoxic histones which can cause endothelial damage.

### Time in therapeutic range and outcomes after warfarin initiation in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation patients with renal dysfunction [^114Svpg5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows a clinically relevant association between renal dysfunction and poor TTR among new AF patients on warfarin. An adequate TTR was less frequently achieved in CKD patients, especially among those with severe CKD. This study also shows that fewer adverse events are observed in patients with adequate TTR, irrespective of underlying renal function.

TTR is a measure of long‐term INR control, which is frequently used in clinical trials and recommended by current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. 17 However, we acknowledge that it is probably still rarely used in clinical practice. TTR gives a percentage of time of the treatment period that the INR was therapeutic, but it does not tell whether values were sub‐ or supratherapeutic. Adverse events are closely related to achieved TTR, with an optimal threshold of TTR somewhere above 58% to 65%. 2, 17, 18, 19, 20 In our study, the observed TTR was exceptionally high, in accord with Sweden's renowned good INR control (with a mean over 75% in several randomized, controlled, clinical trials 18, 19). Yet, our study did observe that despite extensive adjustment for confounders, those with eGFR < 30/dialysis had a clinically worse TTR. The reasons behind the worse TTR in CKD patients cannot be inferred from our observational design, but may be attributed to renal function per se, as well as factors/conditions associated with CKD. It is notable that patients with severe CKD had more‐frequent INR measurements, possibly attributed to difficulties in achieving optimal INR, more‐frequent therapy discontinuations attributed to procedures/intervention, or by the more‐frequent use of drugs known to interact with warfarin. Our study expands to a real‐life North European setting the series of studies from Limdi et al, showing, in the US Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Cohort, that patients with CKD not requiring dialysis require lower warfarin doses, more often had supratherapeutic INRs (INR ≥ 4), and have a higher risk of hemorrhage, as compared to patients with normal kidney function. 7, 21, 22, 23 The difficulty of CKD patients in keeping optimal INR was also reported by Quinn et al 24 in 46 US dialysis patients with weekly INR measurements and an achieved mean TTR of 49.2%.

Table 3
Overview from published guidelines of interventions for patients anticoagulated with warfarin according to INR status, need for invasive procedures and bleeding risk or severity

In patients who require urgent invasive procedures, in asymptomatic patients presenting with excessively elevated INR values, and in bleeding patients, therapeutic options include interruption of VKA treatment as well as the administration of vitamin K (usually vitamin K 1, phytonadione) and blood derivatives such as fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and recombinant activated factor VII (table 3).

As the effects of the oral direct thrombin and FXa inhibitors on the coagulation pathway are independent of vitamin K, this traditional antidote is ineffective for reversing the effect of either class of NOACs. Antidotes for the new agents are in development. A recent study compared the effects of a four-factor PCC and a three-factor PCC lacking factor VII on PT and thrombin generation in healthy adult volunteers who had been treated with supratherapeutic doses of rivaroxaban for 4 days to achieve steady-state concentrations. Both the four-factor and three-factor PCCs, administered on day 5, 4 h after rivaroxaban administration, shortened the PT. As the four-factor PCC more effectively reduced the mean PT, whereas the three-factor PCC more effectively reversed rivaroxaban-induced changes in endogenous thrombin potential, the authors suggested that the discrepant results might have reflected the presence of heparin in the four-factor PCC and the absence of factor VII in the three-factor PCC. Administration of both agents in the presence of rivaroxaban was well tolerated, with no signs of prothrombotic response.

Although no reversal agent is yet available for dabigatran, emergent dialysis may be considered in circumstances such as renal failure or overdose; as approximately 50–60% of the drug is removed during 4 h of haemodialysis.

No rapid reversal agent is currently available for apixaban; therefore, drug levels may persist for approximately 24 h after the last dose (ie, two half-lives). Use of procoagulant reversal agents such as PCC, activated PCC or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered, but this approach has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Neither FXa inhibitor is dialysable.

### Warfarin related nephropathy: a case report and review of the literature [^113m7jGq]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The potential deleterious effect of warfarin in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was first observed in the 1970s. Warfarin, when given in anticoagulant dose as part of the "Melbourne cocktail" for the treatment of IgA nephropathy, was noted to result in an increase in urinary red blood cell counts. Subsequently in 2009, Brodsky et al. reported a case series of 9 CKD patients with biopsy proven acute kidney injury during warfarin therapy. The documented histological finding of acute tubular injury in the presence of glomerular hemorrhage became the hallmark feature of warfarin related nephropathy (WRN). An animal model validating WRN was subsequently reported and retrospective analysis of databases of patients receiving warfarin therapy revealed that WRN could occur in patients without CKD and was associated with accelerated progression of CKD when above therapeutic range.

Despite the well described clinical entity, the clinical course of WRN remains unclear. In the original case series reported by Brodsky, four patients remained dialysis dependent and many did not recover despite normalization of the international normalized ratio (INR). Moreover, the outcome of WRN in patients where anti-coagulation should not be stopped permanently, such as in patients with mechanical heart valve, is unclear. We report the clinical course of a patient with WRN where anti-coagulation could not be stopped permanently.

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^115FWrqT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Until the introduction of direct thrombin inhibitors for oral anticoagulation in 2008, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the mainstay of this treatment. Still today, quite a number of patients remain on warfarin or phenprocoumon and there are indications, such as prosthetic heart valves, for which there is no oral therapeutic alternative.

Due to their narrow therapeutic index, treatment with VKA should be monitored by periodic measurement of the international normalized ratio (INR) to ensure proper efficacy while avoiding excess risk of bleeding.

The commonly used VKAs, warfarin and phenprocoumon, are mainly metabolized by the liver. Dosing recommendations do not suggest adapting the dose to kidney function, however, their use is not encouraged in patients with severe renal failure. Limdi et al. described an increased frequency of supratherapeutic INR levels in patients with chronic renal failure treated with warfarin. Although their use is not recommended in dialysis patients, VKAs are frequently prescribed in these patients as well. However, end-stage renal disease is associated with reduced dosing requirements to achieve the target INR as well as the need for more intense INR monitoring to avoid dangerous overanticoagulation. The clinical effect of VKAs is highly dependent on liver function and interactions with drugs influencing liver metabolism. Further, heart failure and several food interactions are known to interfere with VKA activity.

Patients with chronic renal failure often have indications for long-term oral anticoagulation, mostly due to the high incidence of atrial fibrillation. Traditionally these patients were treated with VKAs; direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were introduced only reluctantly due to complex dose reduction rules. Further, DOACs should be used with caution at a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 mL/min and should not be used at a GFR < 15 mL/min. Several risks of VKA other than haemorrhage have been identified in patients with severe chronic renal failure and on dialysis, among them progressive vascular calcification or uremic calcifying arteriolopathy.

Until now, potential risks that incur with episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients chronically treated with VKAs have not been reported systematically. A case report from 2009 described a patient on stable warfarin treatment who experienced overshooting INR levels during an episode of AKI.

This series of patients with AKI and pre-existing phenprocoumon therapy was compiled to determine if there is a systematic interaction between AKI and complications of VKA therapy.

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^116ML8tX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Could other reasons rather than acutely diminished renal function play a role in the effect we observed in our patients? Therapy with VKA aims at a narrow therapeutic index and overanticoagulation occurs frequently. Froom et al. pointed out that older age is an important risk factor for too high INR values. Sixty-seven per cent of the patients from our series were at least 70 years old. Thus age may have accelerated the risk of VKA in this population, although we did not identify this parameter as a risk factor in the multivariate analysis.

In an analysis of prescription and health insurance data, Clark et al. pointed out that comedication of warfarin with antibiotics more than doubles the risk of overshooting anticoagulation. Such interaction may be particularly pertinent with cephalosporins. Although there were several patients in our series in whom infection contributed to the pathogenesis of AKI, only five patients received antibiotic treatment before blood sampling for the diagnosis of renal dysfunction and the measurement of INR. Further, the effect described by van Walraven et al. that hospitalization itself is a risk factor for derailment of VKA therapy due to altered comedication, nutrition and care is not relevant to our patients since AKI was diagnosed before admission to the hospital.

VKA and AKI are often linked via the observation of warfarin-induced nephropathy. Intrarenal microbleeding can lead to acute deterioration of kidney function that appears clinically as AKI. In this case, overanticoagulation would be the primary event, followed by AKI. In addition, a Spanish group recently described an association between VKA intake and the prevalence of immunoglobulin A nephropathy. In our patients, a distinct pathogenesis could be identified to explain AKI. None of the cases was suggestive of VKA-induced AKI and only very few patients were reported to have initiated VKA recently before AKI or to have changed their VKA dose. Nevertheless, we cannot completely rule out that VKA-related nephropathy might have played a role in our patient group.

### Evidence-based management of anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1174t4EA]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

3.1.1 The oral anticoagulants

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) used in CKD do not differ from those used in general practice and are represented by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct OACs. However, their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features require the adjustment of therapeutic regimens (Table 2). 13

Table 2
Pharmacokinetic properties of oral anticoagulants (adapted from Jain et al 13 and Lutz et al 14)

VKAs are still the most widely used, with the mention that is the warfarin for which the majority of clinical evidence was obtained. AF guidelines recommend warfarin differently in CKD. The American Guidelines American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS) recommend warfarin in all CKD stages (stages 2‐3 — Class 1, Level of Evidence (LOE) A, stage 4 — Class IIb, LOE C, stage 5 — Class IIa, LOE B). The Canadian Guidelines prefer warfarin in stage 4, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines do not provide specific information for a particular type of OAC in any CKD stage. 15 Although the guidelines for AF or VTE do not recommend drug dose adjustment in CKD (Table 3), clinical studies reveal an increased hemorrhagic risk, particularly high within the first 30 to 90 days after initiation of treatment. 9 Most major bleeding events are gastrointestinal, due to the high frequency of digestive lesions favored by uremia. The narrow therapeutic window and high interindividual variability often lead to supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) in CKD. Moreover, response to warfarin is influenced by dietary rules, volemic variations, changes in drug metabolism, and drug‐drug interactions, vitamin K deficiency, treatment compliance. 13 For this reason, to prevent the risk of hemorrhage requires an average reduction of warfarin doses by 10% in patients with eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m² and by 19% in those with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², in order to maintain INR ≤ 4. 11 A particular aspect is the risk of acute renal failure at an INR threshold of > 3, an entity known as warfarin‐induced nephropathy. It is defined as an unexplained increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 7 days of INR > 3.0 in a patient treated with warfarin. The substrate is the glomerular hemorrhage via thrombin depletion and tubular obstruction with hematic cylinders. It is more frequent in CKD, with a mortality rate of up to 31% at 1 year. 9, 16 Identifying at‐risk patients requires testing of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms in order to reduce the risk of overdose in case of warfarin sensitivity, method not introduced into current clinical practice. 17 Dose adjustment is also necessary because in the liver plasma half‐life (t½) is shortened, the renal clearance is enhanced, and the interaction with other drugs is changed. Warfarin administration is even more difficult in dialysis patients, being associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events and hemorrhage. 13, 16 Ultimately, a particular problem is the relationship between warfarin‐vascular calcifications‐renal function decline. The mechanism entails vitamin K inhibition that indirectly inhibits matrix G1a protein, thus promoting vascular calcification and calciphylaxis. Progression of renal vascular calcifications is associated with renal function decline and higher hemorrhagic and thromboembolic risk. 9, 16

### Anticoagulation-related nephropathy: the most common diagnosis you' ve never heard of… [^111y2Jiv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation-related nephropathy might just be the most common diagnosis you've never heard of. It was formerly known as warfarin-induced nephropathy, until it was observed with numerous other anticoagulants and broadened to anticoagulation-related nephropathy. It is a potentially devastating disorder with serious and life-changing consequences if not recognized and diagnosed swiftly. As the clinician is faced with new acute renal failure, it is important to appreciate those factors that place patients at greater risk of anticoagulation-related nephropathy: conditions such as underlying chronic kidney disease patients and supratherapeutic international normalized ratio. Through greater understanding of this common yet under-recognized condition, we become better equipped to diagnose and prognosticate potential patients. Currently, there are no specific guidelines to follow regarding anticoagulation-related nephropathy identification and management; however, it is an entity that is important to remember, especially given the number of patients requiring anticoagulation for numerous conditions.

### Influence of kidney function on risk of supratherapeutic international normalized ratio-related hemorrhage in warfarin users: a prospective cohort study [^111pek3G]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation management is difficult in chronic kidney disease, with frequent supratherapeutic international normalized ratios (INRs ≥ 4) increasing hemorrhagic risk. We evaluated whether the interaction of INR and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) increases hemorrhage risk and whether patients with lower eGFRs experience slower anticoagulation reversal.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

Warfarin pharmacogenetics cohort (1,273 long-term warfarin users); warfarin reversal cohort (74 warfarin users admitted with INRs ≥ 4).

Predictor

eGFR, INR as time-dependent covariate, and their interaction in the pharmacogenetics cohort; eGFR in the reversal cohort.

Outcomes & Measurements

In the pharmacogenetics cohort, hemorrhagic (serious, life-threatening, and fatal bleeding) risk was assessed using proportional hazards regression. In the reversal cohort, anticoagulation reversal was assessed from changes in INR, warfarin and metabolite concentrations, clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), and PIVKA-II (protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II) levels at presentation and after reversal, using linear regression and path analysis.

Results

In the pharmacogenetics cohort, 454 (35.7%) had eGFRs < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². There were 137 hemorrhages in 119 patients over 1,802 person-years of follow-up (incidence rate, 7.6 [95% CI, 6.4–8.9]/100 person-years). Patients with lower eGFRs had a higher frequency of INR ≥ 4 (P < 0.001). Risk of hemorrhage was affected significantly by eGFR-INR interaction. At INR < 4, there was no difference in hemorrhage risk by eGFR (all P ≥ 0.4). At INR ≥ 4, patients with eGFRs of 30 to 44 and < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² had 2.2-fold (95% CI, 0.8–6.1; P = 0.1) and 5.8-fold (95% CI, 2.9–11.4; P < 0.001) higher hemorrhage risks, respectively, versus those with eGFRs ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². In the reversal cohort, 35 (47%) had eGFRs < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Patients with eGFRs < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) experienced slower anticoagulation reversal as assessed by INR (P = 0.04) and PIVKA-II level (P = 0.008) than those with eGFRs ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m².

Limitations

Limited sample size in the reversal cohort, unavailability of antibiotic use and urine albumin data.

Conclusions

Patients with lower eGFRs have differentially higher hemorrhage risk at INR ≥ 4. Moreover, because the INR reversal rate is slower, hemorrhage risk is prolonged.

### Monitoring warfarin therapy… [^116uJFYd]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

to the editor: We appreciate the recent article by Drs. Horton and Bushwick on warfarin therapy. 1 We would like to add our comments based on a recent case we shared. We identified two major teaching points in this case. The first was that the reversal of anticoagulation with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K was overly aggressive, since the bleeding was controlled. Patients with prosthetic valves are at high risk for systemic embolism, necessitating higher INR values. In the case presented, the patient experienced epistaxis at an International Normalized Ratio of 4. 65 that required treatment with nasal packing. Recent literature suggests that if rapid reversal were necessary, the administration of intravenous vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrate would be indicated.

Rapid reversal with intravenous vitamin K via slow infusion is safe, effective and more rapid than reversal with subcutaneous vitamin K; a minimum of six to 12 hours is necessary to evaluate responsiveness. 1 The physician should also consider that maximal response to vitamin K may not be noted until 24 to 48 hours after administration. Administration of oral vitamin K would have been an appropriate choice in this case, as the patient was hemodynamically stable and did not require either complete reversal to an INR of 1. 0 or a rapid reduction to an INR of less than 1.
5. 1 Based on our experience, we believe administering 2. 5 mg of oral vitamin K and holding two doses of warfarin would have resulted in an INR of less than
2. 0 in this patient within 48 hours. Our experience suggests that this patient might have had an INR in the 2. 0 to
3.

0 range at 24 hours with this treatment approach and would not have been resistant to the effects of warfarin administration. INRs greater than 9. 0 require treatment with larger doses of oral vitamin K for adequate INR reduction by 24 to 48 hours. The second point in this case relates to dietary intake of vitamin K. This patient's daily warfarin dose was significantly higher than that used in a typical patient between 50 and 59 years of age. The normal warfarin dose in this age group is approximately 5 mg per day.

### Time in therapeutic range and outcomes after warfarin initiation in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation patients with renal dysfunction [^116ZMt4p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

There is strong evidence that the risk of ischemic stroke caused by AF can be substantially reduced with adequate warfarin therapy. Subtherapeutic INR (below 2.0) increases the risk of ischemic stroke, and supratherapeutic INR (above 3.0 and particularly above 4.0) sharply increases the risk of intracranial bleeding. 25 A recent study indicated that ICH risk associated with INR ≥ 4.0 increased by several fold in individuals with advanced CKD. 7 In most reports, as well as in our study, subtherapeutic INRs (19% of measurements) were more common than supratherapeutic ones (11%). We speculated that poor TTR may, in part, explain the worse outcome and higher bleeding rate described in observational studies of CKD patients on warfarin, particularly among those undergoing dialysis. 26, 27 We observed no interaction between TTR and eGFR and outcome in our study, suggesting that both factors affect outcome independently of each other, and that adequate TTR reduces the adverse event risk also in patients with advanced CKD/dialysis. Despite being the largest study of its kind, we could only identify 11 patients on dialysis satisfying inclusion criteria, and we are therefore underpowered to report TTR‐associated outcomes in this particular population. However, our findings accord with an earlier small, retrospective study indicating that no dialysis patient with adequate INR control had a stroke or a fatal bleeding event. 28 Further, Kooiman et al 29 observed that both less time spent within therapeutic range and high INR variability were factors associated with increased risk of stroke and bleeding in warfarin‐treated CKD patients. Within our study design, we were concerned that patients who were critically ill/moribund would be taken off warfarin and died shortly after warfarin discontinuation. For that reason, our sensitivity analysis estimated TTR on the first 3 months and analyzed outcome risk emulating an "intention to treat" design. The fact that results were comparable to our main analysis provides robustness to our conclusions.

### Risk stratification for supratherapeutic peak anti-Xa levels in adult patients on therapeutic enoxaparin [^114pm7wm]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Society of Hematology Guidelines for the management of venous thromboembolism recommend against the use of anti-Xa monitoring for assessing enoxaparin dosing based on a low level of evidence associating supratherapeutic levels with an increased risk of bleeding. However, institutions still utilize anti-Xa levels in select patient populations with altered volume of distribution and/or excretion to monitor and adjust therapy.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to identify risk factors associated with supratherapeutic peak anti-Xa levels (≥ 1.10 IU/mL) for patients receiving therapeutic enoxaparin.

Methods

This was a retrospective single-center study performed at an academic tertiary care hospital. Patients who received enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg twice daily and peak anti-Xa monitoring were separated into supratherapeutic and therapeutic/subtherapeutic cohorts.

Results

A total of 436 patients were screened, and 215 were included, with a mean age of 62 years. There were 108 in the therapeutic/subtherapeutic cohort and 107 in the supratherapeutic cohort. Acute kidney injury (AKI), body mass index (BMI), weight, female sex, intensive care unit (ICU) service, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 4, and creatinine clearance at the time of peak anti-Xa level collection were associated with supratherapeutic anti-Xa levels in univariate models. Adjusted logistic regression models were created and identified BMI in the 30 to 34.9 kg/m² (odds ratio [OR] 4.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70–11.13, P < 0.005) and ≥ 35 kg/m² (OR 6.75; 95% CI 3.05–14.94, P < 0.005) and AKI (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.04–6.62, P = 0.042) as significant risk factors for supratherapeutic anti-Xa levels.

Conclusion and Relevance

Our study identified BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2, AKI, female sex, ICU service, SOFA score ≥ 4, and creatinine clearance as risk factors for supratherapeutic anti-Xa levels in patients receiving 1 mg/kg twice daily dosing of enoxaparin. Further research should be done to provide evidence for the association between anti-Xa levels and bleeding risk.

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^111gH3Xo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Distribution of INR values at the time point of AKI and at the reference time point.

FIGURE 3
Percentage of patients with INR values below, within or above the respective recommended target range for their indication. The number of patients with INR values above therapeutic range was higher at the time of AKI (54%) than at the reference time point [14%; odds ratio 7.21 (95% confidence interval 3.62–14.35)].

Among the 100 individuals who were admitted with AKI, oral anticoagulation was acutely modified in 55 patients while this therapy remained unchanged in 45 patients. Among those 54 patients with INR above therapeutic range during AKI, the VKA was paused in 28. Five patients received vitamin K and one patient received prothrombin concentrate. In eight patients, oral anticoagulation was permanently stopped because the physicians concluded that the risk–benefit analysis was not in favour of such therapy.

Any bleeding complication was noted in 24 patients and nine of these episodes were classified as severe (requiring blood transfusion). Severe bleeding was bleeding from the upper (n = 5) or lower (n = 2) gastrointestinal tract, severe bleeding from an arterial cannulation and severe soft tissue haematoma. Among the patients with bleeding, 12 (50%) had INR levels above the target range and 9 had comedication with acetylsalicylic acid. Among these patients, three had both predisposing conditions, INR above target range and acetylsalicylic acid medication.

Overanticoagulation during AKI occurred more frequently in female compared with male patients (Figure 4). Several concurrent conditions of the patients were tested if they enhanced the risk of overanticoagulation associated with AKI (Table 2). Diarrhoea at presentation or antibiotic treatment before the diagnosis of AKI did not influence the association between AKI and overanticoagulation; however, the number of patients with these conditions was very low. Multivariate analysis confirmed that female gender, a low body mass index (BMI < 25) and diabetes mellitus predisposed the patients for enhanced effects of VKA during AKI. Other factors such as higher age, chronic heart or liver disease or pre-existing CKD did not have an effect on this risk.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111vRAHs]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

It was subsequently hypothesized that DOACs may be associated with a lower incidence of anticoagulant-related nephropathy, compared with VKAs, due to their more predictable anticoagulation profile. This would manifest as a lower incidence of acute kidney injury or CKD progression.

In the RE-LY trial, warfarin-treated patients had a greater decline in eGFR as compared to dabigatran-treated patients at 30 months of follow-up (−3.7 ± 0.2 mL/min/1.73 m² with warfarin vs. −2.6 ± 0.2 mL/min/1.73 m² with dabigatran 110 mg vs. −2.5 ± 0.2 mL/min/1.73 m² with dabigatran 150 mg; p < 0.001 for both comparisons). The decline was more pronounced in patients with diabetes, past VKA experience, and supratherapeutic anticoagulation. In contrast, in the ROCKET-AF trial, decline in CrCl while on treatment was slightly higher in patients randomized to rivaroxaban (−4.3 ± 14.6 mL/min), as compared to warfarin (−3.5 ± 15.1 mL/min; p < 0.001). However, the percentage of patients with a drop in CrCl of at least 20% from baseline while on treatment was similar in both groups (27% with rivaroxaban vs. 26% with warfarin). Finally, in the ARISTOTLE trial, worsening kidney function while on treatment occurred in 13.6% of patients. Patients at risk for worsening kidney function were elderly, had low hematocrit, diabetes, past VKA experience, congestive heart failure, and vascular disease. At 12 months, patients randomized to apixaban had a greater decline in eGFR, as compared to warfarin (−1.4 ± 10.1 vs. −0.9 ± 10.3 mL/min/1.73 m²). The results from the observational studies that addressed the same question are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3.
Kidney outcomes of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation on VKAs versus DOACs

In conclusion, the exact prevalence, mechanisms, and clinical significance of anticoagulant-related nephropathy remain unclear. In addition, there is no convincing evidence that DOACs are clearly associated with a lower incidence of kidney function decline compared with VKAs.

### Unexpected severe intra-abdominal injuries resulting from a ground-level fall in an elderly patient with a large staghorn calculus [^113VAqrW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 70-year-old woman on warfarin was transported to the emergency department after a ground-level fall, injuring her left backside. Criteria for geriatric trauma activation was not met. An episode of haematuria created suspicion for an intra-abdominal injury, prompting a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma scan, which was positive. Subsequent pan-scanning discovered a multitude of injuries, including low-grade left renal and splenic lacerations, multiple left rib fractures and a haemothorax. Patient also had a supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR), which was reversed with 4-factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (4F-PCC). She was admitted to the intensive care unit, underwent urgent thoracostomy and had a complicated hospital course. Moreover, an incidental large staghorn calculus in the left kidney might have contributed shearing forces. In summary, under triage of this patient emphasised the importance of performing detailed primary and secondary surveys, including POCUS, for all geriatric ground-level fall patients on anticoagulants to allow for rapid diagnosis and treatment of potential serious injuries.

### Anticoagulation-related nephropathy [^112sjbvT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation-related nephropathy (ARN) is a significant but underdiagnosed complication of anticoagulation that is associated with increased renal morbidity and all-cause mortality. Originally described in patients receiving supratherapeutic doses of warfarin who had a distinct pattern of glomerular hemorrhage on kidney biopsy, ARN is currently defined as acute kidney injury (AKI) without obvious etiology in the setting of an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of > 3.0. The underlying molecular mechanism is thought to be warfarin-induced thrombin depletion; however, newer studies have hinted at an alternative mechanism involving reductions in activated protein C and endothelial protein C receptor signaling. Prompt recognition of ARN is critical, as it is associated with accelerated progression of chronic kidney disease, and significant increases in short-term and long-term all-cause mortality. Prior investigations into ARN have almost universally focused on anticoagulation with warfarin; however, recent case reports and animal studies suggest that it can also occur in patients taking novel oral anticoagulants. Differences in the incidence and severity of ARN between patients taking warfarin and those taking novel oral anticoagulants are unknown; a post hoc analysis of routinely reported adverse renal outcomes in clinical trials comparing warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants found no significant difference in the rates of AKI, a prerequisite for ARN. Given the significant impact of ARN on renal function and all-cause mortality, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology, molecular mechanisms, clinical spectrum and therapeutic interventions for ARN is crucial to balance the risks and benefits of anticoagulation and optimize treatment.

### Warfarin-related nephropathy occurs in patients with and without chronic kidney disease and is associated with an increased mortality rate [^1151xaMf]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

An acute increase in the international normalized ratio (INR; a comparison of prothrombin time to monitor the effects of warfarin) over 3 in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often associated with an unexplained acute increase in serum creatinine (SC) and an accelerated progression of CKD. Kidney biopsy in a subset of these patients showed obstruction of the renal tubule by red blood cell casts, and this appears to be the dominant mechanism of the acute kidney injury. We termed this warfarin-related nephropathy (WRN), and previously reported cases of WRN only in patients with CKD. We now assess whether this occurs in patients without CKD, its risk factors, and consequences. In 15,258 patients who initiated warfarin therapy during a 5-year period, 4006 had an INR over 3 and SC measured at the same time; however, the large data set precluded individual patient clinical assessment. A presumptive diagnosis of WRN was made if the SC increased by over 0.3mg/dl within 1 week after the INR exceeded 3 with no record of hemorrhage. WRN occurred in 20.5% of the entire cohort, 33.0% of the CKD cohort, and 16.5% of the no-CKD cohort. Other risk factors included age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The 1-year mortality was 31.1% with compared with 18.9% without WRN, an increased risk of 65%. Thus, WRN may be a common complication of warfarin therapy in high-risk patients and CKD doubles this risk. The mechanisms of these risks are unclear.

Guidance statements — procedural bleeding risk management specify: "Determining procedural bleeding risk is complex; clinicians should determine the level of bleeding risk before procedures and aid in preprocedural hemostasis management". They also state, "Because of conflicting data in the literature, there is no data-driven specific INR or platelet cutoff in which procedural bleeding risk is reliably increased", and "Identification and correction of modifiable risk factors for bleeding before performing procedures, particularly high-risk elective procedures, is recommended. Such risk factors include the use of antithrombotic drugs, AKI, and infection".

### Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients on anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet agents [^114j8frs]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Early endoscopy is encouraged, especially if an upper GI bleeding source is likely, and correction of coagulopathy should not delay it, according to data from two observational studies suggesting that endoscopic therapy is safe and effective even in patients with moderately elevated INR (≤ 2.5). Conversely, there are no data concerning the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic therapy in bleeding patients whose supratherapeutic INR has not been corrected. Therefore, partial or complete reversal of coagulopathy before endoscopy is strongly advised in cases of serious or life-threatening bleeding. In patients at high thrombotic risk with no severe bleeding, delaying endoscopy may be a reasonable option, taking into account that the use of reversal agents carries a small but not negligible risk of thromboembolic complications and thus needs judicious use in these patients.

Acute GI bleeding in the setting of DOACs, in contrast to warfarin, requires a different approach, because of the drugs' distinct pharmacology. Given the relatively short half-lives of DOACs, their clearance and the consequent loss of anticoagulation after drug interruption are rapid and predictable, occurring gradually over 12–24 h in the absence of renal or hepatic failure. Thus, time is the most important antidote for DOACs, and the use of reversal agents is less important than in the case of warfarin. If the patient is hemodynamically stable and/or responds to resuscitation, it may be reasonable to simply observe the patient closely and defer endoscopy for 12–24 h, thus allowing the natural clearance of the drug and the resumption of normal hemostatic functions. Supportive measures with aggressive fluid replacement are important for enhancing renal excretion, which may deteriorate during an acute bleeding event. Conversely, if the patient is persistently or intermittently unstable, emergent endoscopy may be appropriate, and strategies to accelerate anticoagulation reversal should be considered whenever clinically significant DOAC levels are suspected. In this regard, it is important to underline that routine laboratory tests are not sensitive for the quantitative assessment of the anticoagulant intensity of DOACs, although a normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time usually exclude an anticoagulation effect due to rivaroxaban and dabigatran, respectively. Apixaban has little or no effect on these tests, which may be normal in the presence of clinically relevant drug concentrations. In the absence of more appropriate laboratory assays to determine the anticoagulant activity (diluted thrombin time for dabigatran or anti-Xa specific calibrators, not yet available in most centers), the presence of a clinically relevant DOAC concentration can be roughly estimated by taking into account the timing of the last dose intake, the drug's half-life, and creatinine clearance (CrCl).

Ongoing Trials

DANWARD is a Danish nationwide open label randomized controlled trial (NCT03862859) comparing warfarin with no anticoagulation in dialysis patients (N = 718). The SACK randomized trial (NCT05679024) is the first clinical trial comparing apixaban at the reduced dose of 2.5 mg twice daily with no anticoagulation and is currently recruiting participants. Results are expected in 2028 (N = 1,400). The SAFE-D study (NCT03987711) is a pilot, phase 2, open label randomized trial comparing warfarin, apixaban 5 mg twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients), and no anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation on dialysis (N = 150). The study has been completed and results are eagerly awaited.

Kidney Outcomes in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Treated with VKAS or DOACs

An unexpected acute rise in serum creatinine has been described in patients on VKAs with supratherapeutic INR levels. This condition has been labeled warfarin-related nephropathy or, most recently, anticoagulant-related nephropathy. In a retrospective analysis of 4,006 warfarin-treated patients with INR > 3 and serum creatinine measured within a week of INR measurement, presumed anticoagulant-related nephropathy occurred in 17% and 33% of patients with and without CKD, respectively, and was associated with increased 1-year mortality rates.

Mechanisms of warfarin-mediated kidney injury appear to be multifactorial. These include glomerular hemorrhage with filling up of distal tubules and Bowman's space with red blood cells and red cell casts, as shown in biopsy studies, kidney microvascular calcification, allergic interstitial nephritis, spontaneous atheroembolic kidney disease, and pelvis/ureteral hematoma.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants provide less adverse renal outcomes than warfarin in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and metaAnalysis [^111Qj6J9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

NOACs have several pharmacologic advantages over warfarin, including rapid onset, predictable pharmacokinetics, and lower bleeding complications. 44 At present, NOACs are the main medication used in non‐valvular AF. 4 Nonetheless, certain case reports revealed that NOACs were also associated with AKI by the same mechanism as warfarin‐related nephropathy. 45, 46, 47

On AKI in the present meta‐analysis, NOACs provided a lower incidence of AKI and a lesser hazard ratio of the risk of AKI when compared with warfarin (Table 2). Of note, the consistency of the results could also be observed with individual NOACs, apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, except for edoxaban (Table 3). The negative result of the lower risk of edoxaban might result from the fact that there was only 1 edoxaban‐related RCT in this meta‐analysis. This would result in the underpowered capability to demonstrate statistical efficiency.

Conclusions: Activated partial thromboplastin time on admission to the ICU is independently associated with mortality. Both APTT and PT-INR are independently associated with length of stay and the need of organ support.

### Warfarin, kidney dysfunction, and outcomes after acute MI… [^117RHfaA]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

The remaining 24 317 patients were included in the analysis and 21. 8% of these were prescribed warfarin at discharge. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize baseline characteristics of included patients stratified by warfarin treatment. Patients treated with warfarin did not differ from patients receiving no warfarin with regard to basic demographics. Regardless of CKD stage, the number of deaths was lower in patients treated with warfarin compared with patients receiving no warfarin. The rate of readmissions due to myocardial infarction and ischemic strokes were lower in the patients treated with warfarin across all renal function strata. In addition, we expand to a nationally representative sample of high-risk individuals that virtually all have an indication for warfarin therapy and have detailed information on concurrent anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy.

Our observations also accord with post hoc analyses from the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study III trial, 11 in which 516 participants with atrial fibrillation and CKD stage 3 were studied and the risk for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was reduced by 76% for adjusted-dose warfarin compared with aspirin plus low, subtherapeutic doses of warfarin. of warfarin dose adjustment and poor time in therapeutic international normalized ratio range, with a tendency to supratherapeutic INR values. 29, 30 In Scandinavian countries, the care and time in therapeutic range for INR is generally very good and above 75%. 28, 31 Warfarin-associated bleeding in patients with CKD may be more common when INR is not tightly controlled. This was observed by Chan and coauthors, 9 where the association with mortality in patients with hemodialysis was only observed for high warfarin-prescribed dosages.

Also, the study by Knoll and coauthors32 from a single-center study with weekly and tight INR control showed that no patient with hemodialysis under sufficient warfarin anticoagulation had a stroke or a fatal bleeding event. For instance, we could not control for the duration of atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or valvular replacement. Besides the lack of information on the patients' INRs, we acknowledge that the number of patients with CKD stage 5 included is low and merits caution in its interpretation, even more in subgroup analyses.

### The crosstalk between nephropathy and coagulation disorder: pathogenesis, treatment, and dilemmas [^1159AhyW]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

ARN

ARN is defined as AKI caused by oral anticoagulants such as warfarin and DOACs. It is mainly manifested by impairment of the glomeruli filtration barrier with Bowman's space and tubular hemorrhage, resulting in tubular obstruction and occlusion.

Pathogenesis of ARN

The pathogenesis of ARN has not been fully elucidated. It was found that dabigatran-treated CKD rats developed ARN phenotypes, which could be enhanced by protease-activated receptor (PAR)–1 inhibitor SCH79797. These findings suggested that DOACs may be the inhibitor of PARs by inhibiting thrombin production. Because PARs provide nutritional support for endothelial cells, the glomeruli destruction hemorrhage might be caused by the inhibitory effect of DOACs on PARs. However, it was also found that application of anticoagulant therapies alone cannot cause ARN, and knockout of PAR or application of PAR-1 inhibitor vorapaxar did not induce ARN in experimental models or human patients. Clinical data also suggested that DOACs induced ARN only when there was significant nephron reduction, hyperperfusion, and hypertensionor acute glomeruli injury. Therefore, the current views hold that ARN is the result of a second hit of anticoagulants on fragile glomeruli destroyed by the primary disease.

Treatment of ARN

The diagnosis of ARN is shown in Figure 8. However, treatment options for ARN are limited. One of the most effective methods is to closely monitor the patient's coagulation and renal function and adopt effective coping strategies during warfarin or DOAC treatment. For patients with ARN, treatment is supportive; control of BP and reduction of anticoagulation were commonly used. If the patient is anticoagulated with warfarin, the anticoagulation strategy should be switched to DOACs. If the patient is anticoagulated with DOACs, the dose should be reduced. In patients with primary or secondary glomerulopathy without ARN, anticoagulation should be combined with glomerular anti-inflammatory therapy to effectively prevent ARN.

Figure 8
Diagnosis of ARN. When AKI occurs in patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy with an INR > 3.0, ARN should be considered. The first diagnosis is to identify the cause of AKI by urinalysis, urine electrolytes, and kidney ultrasound. If the cause of AKI is clear, ARN could be excluded. If the cause of AKI is unclear, further diagnosis is needed to determine whether the patient develops hematuria. ARN is diagnosed if the patient develops hematuria. If the patient does not develop hematuria, the ARN is not fully determined, but the patient is always treated as ARN. ARN, anticoagulation-related nephropathy; INR, international normalized ratio.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111nvB7i]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Systemic factors — kidney dysfunction and periprocedural bleeding in cirrhosis are highlighted with observational data and recommendations. Among these, acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been most extensively studied as risk factors for bleeding, and one study examined patients with postparacentesis hemorrhage and found an association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and bleeding, independent of infection. In a large retrospective analysis of large-volume paracenteses, nine bleeding events out of 4,729 procedures were reported, and renal dysfunction was reported in 89% of patients (8 of 9 patients) with bleeding events. A study examining postbanding ulcer bleeding after endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) demonstrated that patients who developed bleeding (n = 6) compared to those who did not (n = 259) had significantly higher serum creatinine (2.2 mg/dL bleeders vs. 1.0 mg/dL nonbleeders; P = 0.001), and in this study, there was no significant difference in platelet level and INR between patients with bleeding and those without bleeding. Based on these data, addressing acute and/or chronic kidney dysfunction as much as possible before elective procedures is recommended, and medications, in particular antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation, alter the risk of bleeding during procedures and should be carefully considered in the periprocedural period.

LIMITATIONS

Our study has several limitations. As a retrospective series, we cannot derive causality from the association between AKI and overanticoagulation in VKA-treated patients. Further, although being the largest report on this issue, the series is quite small. In addition, due to the retrospective nature, we cannot provide pharmacokinetic measurements to confirm the suggested mechanisms. In spite of these limitations, our series may provide grounds for further research and highlight a relevant risk in everyday therapy that is worth being considered when caring for patients with AKI.

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^117UCtJo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

From January 2009 to December 2016 there were 100 first admissions with AKI of patients who had concurrent oral anticoagulation and met the study criteria. The patient selection process is described in Figure 1. The demographic data of the patients are listed in Table 1. The majority of patients (76%) already had underlying chronic renal failure with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² when the AKI episode occurred. The severity of AKI was classified as Stage 1 in 49 patients, Stage 2 in 18 patients and Stage 3 in 33 patients according to the KDIGO definition.

FIGURE 1
Patient selection for the study.

Table 1.
Demographic characteristics of the patients included in this study

The causes of AKI were pre-renal volume depletion (n = 43), septic renal failure (n = 22), decompensated heart failure (n = 18), toxic renal damage (n = 11), post-renal obstruction (n = 3) and primary renal disease (n = 3). Among the patients with pre-renal volume depletion, 12 (28%) had diarrhoea immediately before or at admission. None of the patients from the other etiologic groups had diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection. Five patients received antibiotic treatment at the time of AKI diagnosis and first INR measurement. All other patients either did not receive antibiotics or their treatment was initiated only after the relevant blood sample for diagnosing AKI was obtained.

The average INR values measured at the time of AKI were significantly higher than the INR values measured together with the reference creatinine [median 3.17 (range 1.10–13.0) versus 2.24 (1.07–5.17); P < 0.0001; Figure 2]. At the time of reference creatinine, 49 patients had an INR value within the boundaries of the therapeutic recommendation for their indication, in 37 patients the value was below and in 14 patients the value was above that range. The number of patients with INR levels above the recommended range for their indication increased with AKI (Figure 3). Across all stages of AKI, 54% of the patients had INR levels above the recommended range for their indication. In 57 patients the INR at the time of AKI was > 1 standard deviation higher than the INR at the reference time point.

### Warfarin sodium [^112suW8u]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Acute Kidney Injury

In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of kidney disease, acute kidney injury may occur with warfarin sodium, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is advised in patients with compromised renal function.

5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli

Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as "purple toes syndrome". Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

5.6 Limb Ischemia, Necrosis, and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS

Do not use warfarin sodium as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death. Treatment with warfarin sodium may be considered after the platelet count has normalized.

5.7 Use in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves

Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. While warfarin sodium is contraindicated during pregnancy, the potential benefits of using warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient's medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Intraoperative risk factors of acute kidney injury after liver transplantation [^117Hswye]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

A variety of donor factors have been shown to be associated with posttransplant AKI, including donation after cardiac death, ischemia time, high‐risk grafts, and older donor age. Our study failed to show any association between donor‐specific variables and posttransplant AKI. This may be the result of improved institutional effort in matching high‐risk donors with recipients at lower risk for complications such as AKI and lower risk donors with higher risk recipients.

Our study builds on prior work incorporating intraoperative variables into the prediction model. Prior studies have characterized the effect of major classes of intraoperative variables, including blood transfusion, hemodynamic variables (most notably, intraoperative hypotension), vasopressor/inotropic support, surgical technique, laboratory values, and hypovolemia. Our study failed to show an association between intraoperative MAP or intraoperative transfusion (packed red blood cells [pRBC], FFP, or cryoprecipitate) with the primary outcome. We did, however, find an association between higher lactate and potassium levels, but not norepinephrine doses and AKI. Further study is needed to determine if potassium and lactate levels may act as intermediate variables, mediating the effects of blood transfusions and blood pressure. Further study is also needed to determine if factors such as hypotension, which seems to fluctuate earlier, may be an earlier marker than potassium and lactate, which would be lagging indicators. The kidney excretes potassium and metabolizes lactate. Rises in potassium and lactate may be an early marker of renal dysfunction and ischemia. This might allow for an early intervention that reverses renal ischemia and prevents dysfunction from progressing to AKI. Further study is needed to better understand the possible protective association of INR with AKI. One potential explanation is that correction of INR leads to resuscitation with a high volume of FFP, which may lead to a better volume reserve that protects against the decreased organ perfusion associated with large hemorrhages.

### Warfarin related nephropathy: a case report and review of the literature [^116eTX5B]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, renal function should be monitored in patients on anticoagulation therapy and the diagnosis of WRN, especially in the presence of over anticoagulation, should be considered in patient with unexplained AKI. Temporary interruption of anticoagulation in combination with N-acetylcystine may result in stabilization of the renal function. Low dose corticosteroids may be added as it can potentially suppress the inflammatory response following glomerular hemorrhage and tubular obstruction in the kidney.

KDOQI US commentary — anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in acute kidney injury (AKI) notes that, in the United States, given the lack of FDA-approved citrate solutions for regional anticoagulation during CRRT, this approach cannot be recommended at present, and there is also a need for development and approval of commercially available citrate solutions before this approach can be routinely recommended. For alternative anticoagulation strategies, danaparoid, fondaparinux, and hirudin are all renally excreted with extended half-lives in AKI and have no specific antidote, therefore these agents must be used with caution in patients with AKI on CRRT, danaparoid is not available in the United States, and argatroban has been used at doses ranging between 0.7 and 1.7 μg/kg/min as anticoagulation for CRRT.

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^113fBtLX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are still in use for oral anticoagulation, but not all indications allow their replacement by direct oral anticoagulants. Although formal dose reduction is not required in patients with impaired kidney function, case reports indicate that acute kidney injury (AKI) might be associated with derailment of VKA therapy.

Methods

The study retrospectively collected patients from a tertiary nephrology care centre who experienced AKI while being treated with VKA. In these individuals, the international normalized ratio (INR) as a measure of anticoagulant effect during renal failure was compared with a reference time point with stable kidney function.

Results

A total of 100 patients with AKI and ongoing VKA therapy met the inclusion criteria. The majority (76%) of patients had AKI with CKD. Volume depletion (n = 43), septic renal failure (n = 22), decompensated heart failure (n = 18) and toxic renal damage (n = 11) were the most important causes of AKI. The average INR values at the time of AKI were higher than at the reference time point [median 3.17 (range 1.10–13.0) versus 2.24 (1.07–5.17); P < 0.0001]. Fifty-four patients had INR values above the recommended therapeutic range for their indication at the time point of AKI. Bleeding complications occurred in 24 patients during AKI and the VKA dose had to be reduced in 55. Women, patients with low body mass index and patients with diabetes were predisposed to overanticoagulation during AKI.

Conclusions

The effect of AKI on anticoagulation by VKA has not been systematically described. This risk should be considered in patients at high risk for AKI.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) and hepatorenal syndrome–AKI (HRS-AKI) in cirrhosis — definitions and diagnostic criteria: Baseline serum creatinine (SCr) uses a stable SCr ≤ 3 mo, the closest prior stable value if unavailable, or the admission SCr. AKI is defined by increase in SCr ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 μmol/L) ≤ 48 hr or 50% increase from baseline. Staging is as follows: Stage 1 — increase in SCr ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 μmol/L) in ≤ 48 hr or increase in SCr ≥ 1.5–2.0 times from baseline; Stage 2 — increase in SCr ≥ 2.0–3.0 times from baseline; Stage 3 — increase in SCr ≥ 3.0 times from baseline or SCr ≥ 4.0 mg/dL (≥ 352 μmol/L) with an acute increase of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 μmol/L), or initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). HRS-AKI requires: cirrhosis and ascites; Stage 2 or 3 AKI; no improvement of SCr (decrease of creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL of baseline) after at least 48 hr of diuretic withdrawal and volume expansion with albumin (1 g/kg body weight/day for 2 d); absence of hypovolemic shock; no current or recent treatment with nephrotoxic drugs; and proteinuria < 500 mg/d with no microhematuria (< 50 RBCs/mL).

KDIGO AKI anticoagulation during RRT — general decision and standard-risk patients: In a patient with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), base the decision to use anticoagulation on assessment of the patient's potential risks and benefits (Not Graded). We recommend using anticoagulation during RRT in AKI if a patient does not have an increased bleeding risk or severe coagulopathy and is not already receiving systemic anticoagulation (1B). For patients without an increased bleeding risk or impaired coagulation and not already receiving effective systemic anticoagulation, we suggest the following: for intermittent RRT, we recommend using either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, rather than other anticoagulants (1C); for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), we suggest using regional citrate anticoagulation rather than heparin in patients who do not have contraindications for citrate (2B); if citrate is contraindicated during CRRT, we suggest using either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, rather than other anticoagulants (2C).

### Acute kidney injury due to glomerular haematuria and obstructive erythrocyte casts associated with thrombocytopaenia and thin basement membrane disease: a case report [^116tjmg1]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury due to glomerular bleeding has been described with IgA nephropathy and supratherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation. There is usually demonstrable tubular obstruction by erythrocyte casts associated with acute tubular injury. Although severe thrombocytopaenia increases the risk of bleeding, most cases of haematuria have been ascribed to non-glomerular or urological bleeding without a direct link to acute kidney injury. We describe a patient with acute kidney injury due to glomerular bleeding and tubular injury related to severe thrombocytopaenia, who was subsequently found to have thin basement membrane disease.

Case presentation

A 56 year old man presented with macroscopic haematuria, acute kidney injury and a platelet count of 35 × 10⁹/L, in the absence of anticoagulation. Urinalysis demonstrated an active urinary sediment. His kidney biopsy demonstrated extensive intraluminal erythrocyte casts associated with acute tubular injury, along with haemosiderin deposition suggestive of recurrent glomerular bleeding. There was no histological evidence of glomerular pathology but electron microscopy analysis demonstrated thin basement membrane disease and effacement of podocyte foot processes. During long term follow-up, thrombocytopaenia and intermittent haematuria persisted. At 9 months, the patient progressed to Stage 5 chronic kidney disease with the development of gross renal atrophy.

Conclusion

Recurrent macroscopic haematuria may be a risk factor for progressive renal injury in patients with thin basement membrane. The mechanism may be due to recurrent acute kidney injury from glomerular bleeding leading to repeated tubular damage. In the absence of anticoagulation, severe thrombocytopaenia may be a risk factor for heavy glomerular bleeding and acute kidney injury in these patients.

KDIGO AKI anticoagulation during CRRT — high bleeding risk and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): For patients with increased bleeding risk who are not receiving anticoagulation, we suggest the following for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT): use regional citrate anticoagulation, rather than no anticoagulation, in a patient without contraindications for citrate (2C), and avoid regional heparinization during CRRT in a patient with increased risk of bleeding (2C). In a patient with HIT, all heparin must be stopped and we recommend using direct thrombin inhibitors (such as argatroban) or Factor Xa inhibitors (such as danaparoid or fondaparinux) rather than other or no anticoagulation during RRT (1A); in a patient with HIT who does not have severe liver failure, we suggest using argatroban rather than other thrombin inhibitors or Factor Xa inhibitors (2C).

He had multiple palpable purpuric lesions on his bilateral lower extremities. Laboratory findings supported acute anaemia with no obvious bleeding source, supratherapeutic international normalised ratio and acute on chronic kidney injury. Oesophogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy initially suggested ischaemic colitis. The patient's legs were treated symptomatically with topical steroids. He later developed acute large volume bloody diarrhoea that made him haemodynamically unstable. Punch biopsy of the skin was consistent with leucocytoclastic vasculitis and direct immunofluorescence demonstrated immunoglobulin A and C3 deposits consistent with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. The patient was treated with oral steroids. Bleeding stabilised and rash resolved. Steroids were successfully tapered. The patient was discharged on haemodialysis but ultimately this was able to be discontinued.

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^111eXdqm]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

With this study we describe for the first time that acute deterioration of kidney function in patients treated with VKA is associated with a high risk of overanticoagulation. This effect was suspected in a case report but had not yet been systematically analysed. Our data show that 73% of patients experience an increase in the INR value during AKI when compared with a reference time point with better renal function. Such overshooting anticoagulation is linked to a significant risk of haemorrhage. Women, diabetic patients and those with a BMI < 25 are particularly at risk. In the majority (55%) of patients on VKA, the dose of the anticoagulant had to be modified or the substance discontinued when AKI occurred. Bleeding complications were noted in 24% of patients.

All patients in this series from Germany were treated with phenprocoumon. In other parts of the world, acenocoumarol and particularly warfarin are used as VKAs. All these substances have high plasma protein binding (99%). They are metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system in the liver. Hepatic clearance is the main elimination pathway. Warfarin and acenocoumarol are mostly metabolized via the 2C9 isoenzyme, while both 2C9 and 3A4 isoenzymes are important for the metabolism of phenprocoumon. Although there is some renal excretion of phenprocoumon, but not acenocoumarol or warfarin, dosing recommendations do not consider renal function except for severe renal failure.

How could AKI lead to a strong increase in the phenprocoumon effect if renal excretion is not very relevant for its excretion? As mentioned, all VKAs are highly bound to plasma proteins, while only the unbound fraction is actively inhibiting hepatic synthesis of vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors. Animal studies on experimental AKI suggest that warfarin can be displaced from protein binding by acidosis and retained uremic toxins. This might lead to a higher active fraction of the VKA. Such effects have been described for other pharmaceuticals in renal failure as well (review in Dreisbach and Lertora).

Uremic toxicity may also influence the activity of the cytochrome P450 system. Dreisbach et al. showed that end-stage renal disease leads to reduced activity, particularly of the CyP 2C9 isoenzyme. More importantly in the case of phenprocoumon, Dowling et al. also demonstrated a lower activity of the 3A4 isoenzyme under uremic conditions.

### Warfarin-related nephropathy modeled by nephron reduction and excessive anticoagulation [^111dsPT8]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

An acute increase in international normalized ratio (INR) to > 3.0 in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can associate with an unexplained acute increase in serum creatinine and accelerated progression of CKD. A subset of these patients have renal tubular obstruction by casts of red blood cells, presumably the dominant mechanism of the acute kidney injury described as warfarin-related nephropathy. Here, we developed an animal model of this acute kidney injury that is based on the 5/6-nephrectomy model to aid future investigation of the pathogenesis of this condition. We found that acute excessive anticoagulation with brodifacoum ("superwarfarin") increased serum creatinine levels and hematuria in 5/6-nephrectomized rats but not in controls. In addition, morphologic findings in 5/6-nephrectomized rats included glomerular hemorrhage, occlusive red blood cell casts, and acute tubular injury, similar to the biopsy findings among affected patients. Furthermore, in the rat model, we observed an increase in apoptosis of glomerular endothelial cells. In summary, the 5/6-nephrectomy model combined with excessive anticoagulation may be a useful tool to study the pathogenesis of warfarin-related nephropathy.

5.4 Acute Kidney Injury

In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of kidney disease, acute kidney injury may occur with warfarin sodium, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is advised in patients with compromised renal function.

5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli

Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as "purple toes syndrome". Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

5.6 Limb Ischemia, Necrosis, and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS

Do not use warfarin sodium as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death. Treatment with warfarin sodium may be considered after the platelet count has normalized.

5.7 Use in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves

Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. While warfarin sodium is contraindicated during pregnancy, the potential benefits of using warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient's medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Previously documented cases of classic ARN have often demonstrated limited or negligible recovery of kidney function (Table 2). This discrepancy in outcomes might be attributed to the following two factors: First, a significant number of patients may have had pre-existing kidney diseases or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) prior to the onset of ARN. These underlying renal disorders may render the kidney more susceptible to ARN and restrict the kidney's inherent capacity for self-repair. The cornerstone of treatment for ARN is ensuring an adequate urine flow to expel the obstructive elements, such as red blood cells and damaged tubules. Most patients with ARN may have no enough urine flow from decreased GFR or additional fluid limited by heart function, which potentially contributing to the unfavorable prognosis. In contrast, this patient had adequate urine output and received unlimited fluid therapy that contributing rapid recovery of kidney function. Secondly, many patients requiring long-term anticoagulant therapy often have cardiovascular conditions such as atrial fibrillation, necessitating the use of medications like warfarin to prevent thrombosis. These drugs demand regular monitoring of clotting function to ensure that the INR falls within the therapeutic range. For example, the utilization of warfarin for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation mandates precise control of INR within the range of 2.0 to 3.0. Maintaining INR within this range may not completely arrest kidney bleeding and can consequently impede the recovery of renal function. In contrast, the rapid decrease of INR from above 10 to the normal range may effectively correct coagulation disorder and halter renal bleeding in this case.

### Reducing acute kidney injury due to vancomycin in trauma patients [^111pETFq]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Supratherapeutic vancomycin trough levels are common after trauma and associated with both increased acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality. We sought to limit the adverse effects of vancomycin in trauma patients through more frequent trough monitoring.

Methods

Beginning in January 2011, trauma patients treated with vancomycin had trough levels (VT) monitored daily until steady state was reached. Trauma patients admitted from January 2011 to May 2015 (POST) were compared with those admitted from January 2006 to December 2010 (PRE). Inclusion criteria required administration of intravenous vancomycin, admission serum creatinine (SCr), and SCr within 72 hours of highest VT. Acute kidney injury was defined as an increase in SCr of at least 0.3 mg/dL or 50% from admission to post-vancomycin administration. Those in the POST group were prospectively followed up until discharge or death.

Results

Two hundred sixty-three patients met inclusion criteria in the PRE-phase and 115 in the POST-phase. The two groups were similar in age, gender, race, body mass index, pre-existing comorbidities, admission systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale, and head Abbreviated Injury Scale. Injury Severity Score was higher in the POST cohort (18 PRE vs. 25 POST, p < 0.001). Compared with PRE, the POST cohort had lower rates of supratherapeutic VT (> 20 mg/L) (34.6% PRE vs. 22.6% POST, p = 0.02) and AKI (30.4% PRE vs. 19.1% POST, p = 0.026). After adjusting for confounders, the POST group had a significantly lower risk of AKI with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.457 (p = 0.027). There was a trend toward decreased mortality in the POST cohort, but this did not reach significance (10% PRE vs. 5.2% POST, p = 0.162).

Conclusions

A reduction in AKI was observed in trauma patients with daily vancomycin trough levels monitored until steady state. Increased awareness regarding closer surveillance of VT in trauma patients may limit the incidence of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity.

Supratherapeutic INR — Outpatient > 6 weeks postoperative (Table 4) is managed as follows. For INR 5–6.5 without bleeding, ambulatory/admit with Vitamin K 1 mg po and check in 24 hours; for minor or major bleeding, admit and follow inpatient protocol. For INR 6.6–7.9 without bleeding, admit with Vitamin K 2 mg po and check in 12 hours; for minor or major bleeding, admit and follow inpatient protocol. For INR > 8 without bleeding, admit with Vitamin K 2 mg IV and check in 12 hours; for minor or major bleeding, admit and follow inpatient protocol.

### Successful hemostasis and reversal of highly elevated PT / INR after dabigatran etexilate use in a patient with acute kidney injury [^114Cdn1t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Dabigatran etexilate is a novel oral anticoagulant indicated for anticoagulation in the management of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Before its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was one of few oral anticoagulant options. The burden of therapeutic drug monitoring, dietary restrictions, and various drug interactions associated with warfarin have countered its extensive history of efficacy. Although dabigatran etexilate may alleviate some concerns encountered with warfarin therapy, there remains a paucity of evidence surrounding emergent reversal strategies in severe hemorrhage. We report here a 71-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with gastrointestinal hemorrhage precipitated by acute kidney injury while on dabigatran etexilate, with laboratory derangements highly uncharacteristic of dabigatran therapy (international normalized ratio, > 10, and activated partial thromboplastin time, 93 seconds). After admission to the intensive care unit and 7 U of fresh frozen plasma, the patient remained hemodynamically unstable due to blood loss. Other observations were made that are poorly characterized in medical literature related to dabigatran: refractory hemorrhagic shock after 7 U of fresh frozen plasma, rapid correction of coagulation parameters (international normalized ratio, 1.7, and activated partial thromboplastin time, 44 seconds) achieved 4 hours after 26 U/kg of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (Kcentra; CSL Behring, King of Prussia, PA), and with subsequent achievement of hemostasis. The patient was discharged to home 7 days later without sequelae.

### Renal cholesterol crystal embolism in the setting of warfarin use [^114fBrgo]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 73-year-old man presented for evaluation of weakness and black tarry stools that occurred 1day prior to admission. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, stage 3 chronic kidney disease and deep vein thrombosis on warfarin. He was admitted to the hospital and was found to have acute kidney injury and gastrointestinal bleeding due to a supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratio. His hospital course was complicated by persistent decline in his renal function. He was given intravenous fluid resuscitation, fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells for his acute blood loss anaemia. Urinalysis was consistent with acute tubular necrosis. Given the persistent rise in creatinine, a kidney biopsy was obtained, and was significant for mild inflammatory changes, without evidence of vasculitis or allergic interstitial nephritis. Histopathological examination with tissue fixation revealed cholesterol embolisation. Given that he had no recent endovascular procedure or instrumentation, this atheroembolic event was attributed to his warfarin use.

### Chronic anticoagulation is not associated with a reduced risk of acute kidney injury in hospitalised COVID-19 patients [^115rm7Gs]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation. Severe disease typically presents with respiratory failure but Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and a hypercoagulable state can also occur. Early reports suggest that thrombosis may be linked with AKI. We studied the development of AKI and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 taking chronic anticoagulation therapy.

Methods

Electronic records were reviewed for all adult patients admitted to Manchester University Foundation Trust Hospitals between March 10 and April 302,020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with end-stage kidney disease were excluded. AKI was classified as per KDIGO criteria.

Results

Of the 1032 patients with COVID-19 studied,164 (15.9%) were taking anticoagulant therapy prior to admission. There were similar rates of AKI between those on anticoagulants and those not anticoagulated (23.8% versus 19.7%) with no difference in the severity of AKI or requirement of renal replacement therapy between groups (1.2% versus 3.5%). Risk factors for AKI included hypertension, pre-existing renal disease and male sex. There was a higher mortality in those taking anticoagulant therapy (40.2% versus 30%). Patients taking anticoagulants were less likely to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (8.5% versus 17.4%) and to receive mechanical ventilation (42.9% versus 78.1%).

Conclusion

Patients on chronic anticoagulant therapy did not have a reduced incidence or severity of AKI suggesting that AKI is unlikely to be thrombotic in nature. Therapeutic anticoagulation is currently still under investigation in randomised controlled studies to determine whether it has a potential role in COVID-19 treatment.
