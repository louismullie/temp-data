## Question

54 yo F with hx of chronic hepatitis C (mild transaminase elevation, no jaundice), intermittent migraines, and Raynaud's phenomenon presents with severe, sudden-onset headache. CT head is negative for bleed. She is neurologically intact, hypertensive to 168/97, and requesting her usual sumatriptan 100 mg PO now. Start sumatriptan for acute migraine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sumatriptan 100 mg PO should be given to a 54-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C, Raynaud's phenomenon, and a blood pressure of 168/97 mmHg who is presenting with a severe, sudden-onset headache and a negative head CT for bleed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding secondary causes of headache. Then, I should verify absolute and relative contraindications to sumatriptan, especially vasospastic disease and uncontrolled hypertension. Next, I will assess hepatic impairment and dosing considerations. After that, I should weigh efficacy against risks and consider safer alternatives. Finally, I will outline a monitoring and follow-up plan and state a clear recommendation with rationale.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame and exclude red flags. A sudden severe headache mandates exclusion of subarachnoid hemorrhage and other secondary causes; a negative noncontrast CT lowers but does not eliminate SAH risk, particularly if symptoms began within 6 hours, so I should maintain vigilance and consider LP if the pretest probability remains high or if the clinical course evolves, even though the CT is negative here. I should also confirm that this presentation is consistent with the patient's prior migraine pattern and that there are no new focal deficits, altered consciousness, or atypical features before labeling it a migraine attack and proceeding with triptan therapy.

> Now, I need to check absolute contraindications to sumatriptan. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension; it is also contraindicated with ergot alkaloids or MAO-A inhibitors, and should be avoided in hemiplegic or basilar migraine due to vasospasm risk [^117XfTov] [^112GZWZZ]. Wait, let me verify the hypertension threshold: while some labels emphasize uncontrolled hypertension, sumatriptan can acutely elevate blood pressure and has been associated with hypertensive crises, so a systolic BP of 168 mmHg with diastolic 97 mmHg in this context is a relative contraindication and warrants caution even if not an absolute label contraindication in all formulations [^113SN8T3] [^112GZWZZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the vasospastic risk profile. Raynaud's phenomenon reflects a predisposition to peripheral vasospasm, and triptans can precipitate non-coronary vasospastic reactions, including Raynaud's exacerbations and, rarely, ischemic complications; labels advise evaluating for vasospastic disorders and avoiding repeat dosing if vasospasm is suspected, which materially increases risk in this patient [^112GZWZZ] [^113SN8T3]. Let me consider the pathophysiology: triptans activate 5-HT1B/1D receptors and can constrict peripheral arteries, which is precisely the mechanism underlying Raynaud's attacks, so adding a vasoconstrictor in a vasospastic phenotype is mechanistically risky [^113LL1wN].

> Next, I should review hepatic impairment considerations. Chronic hepatitis C with mild transaminase elevation suggests mild hepatic impairment rather than severe disease; sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO-A and hepatic clearance may be reduced, so I need to ensure dosing caution and monitor for adverse effects, but this alone is not an absolute contraindication to a single dose in an acute setting [^113SN8T3]. I should double-check: labels advise caution in hepatic impairment and recommend using the lowest effective dose, which supports avoiding high-dose triptans if alternatives exist or if risk is elevated otherwise [^112y6QBM].

> I will now examine the risk–benefit balance. The benefit of sumatriptan 100 mg for acute migraine is supported by randomized trials and meta-analyses showing improved 2-hour pain freedom and sustained relief, with better outcomes when treated early; however, these benefits must be weighed against the patient's vasospastic predisposition and uncontrolled hypertension, which elevate the risk of serious adverse events including hypertensive crisis and peripheral ischemia [^114Y9d5y] [^117VP9yV] [^112GZWZZ]. But wait, what if I am overstating the hypertension risk? Even if some guidance frames severe or uncontrolled hypertension as the key concern, transient BP elevations and vasoconstriction can still be dangerous in a 54-year-old with vascular risk, so I should err on the side of caution here [^113SN8T3].

> Let me consider safer alternatives. NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen are reasonable first-line options for acute migraine in the absence of contraindications, and acetaminophen can be added; given the patient's hypertension and vasospastic risk, these non-vasoconstrictive options are preferable now while we address blood pressure and confirm the diagnosis [^112dd8qV]. I should confirm there is no NSAID allergy, GI bleeding risk, or renal impairment before choosing naproxen, and I will plan to reassess response and tolerability before escalating therapy.

> Next, I should review a monitoring and follow-up plan. I need to ensure close observation for at least 2–4 hours for neurologic changes, chest or limb ischemic symptoms, and blood pressure trends; if sumatriptan were ever considered in the future, it should be at a lower dose with cardiac risk stratification and, in higher-risk patients, first-dose observation with ECG, though I am not recommending that today given the current risk profile [^114Xet5b]. I should also counsel on medication-overuse headache and limit acute treatments to fewer than 10 days per month to prevent chronification, and I will arrange outpatient BP control and reassessment of migraine management once the acute episode resolves [^112GZWZZ] [^113LL1wN].

> Final recommendation: I should not administer sumatriptan 100 mg PO now. The combination of uncontrolled hypertension and Raynaud's phenomenon creates a meaningful risk of vasospastic complications, including hypertensive crisis and peripheral ischemia, which outweighs the anticipated benefit of triptan therapy in this acute setting. Instead, I will treat with NSAIDs and supportive care, control blood pressure, and reassess the diagnosis and migraine plan once the acute episode settles and vascular risk is optimized [^112GZWZZ] [^112dd8qV].

Do not give **sumatriptan** now. The patient's **uncontrolled hypertension** (168/97 mmHg) and **Raynaud's phenomenon** are relative contraindications to triptans due to vasoconstriction risk [^112GZWZZ] [^112y6QBM]. Sumatriptan can precipitate coronary or peripheral vasospasm, worsen hypertension, and exacerbate Raynaud's [^117XfTov] [^112GZWZZ]. Use NSAIDs (e.g. naproxen 500 mg) or acetaminophen 1,000 mg now, and consider a gepant (e.g. ubrogepant 100 mg) if available. Reserve sumatriptan only after BP is controlled and Raynaud's is stable, with close monitoring.

## Clinical guidelines and safety considerations

Current guidelines emphasize **cardiovascular risk assessment** before prescribing triptans, especially in patients with hypertension or vasospastic disorders [^1141dLwc]. The VA/DoD guideline recommends triptans for acute migraine but advises caution or avoidance in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or vasospastic disorders such as Raynaud's phenomenon [^1141dLwc]. The FDA warns that sumatriptan can cause coronary vasospasm, peripheral vasoconstriction, and hypertensive crises, particularly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or vasospastic disorders [^117XfTov] [^112GZWZZ].

---

## Risks associated with sumatriptan in this patient

### Hypertension

Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of **cardiovascular events**, including myocardial infarction and stroke, particularly when combined with vasoconstrictive medications like sumatriptan [^117XfTov]. Sumatriptan can cause transient increases in blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance, potentially precipitating hypertensive crises in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [^113SN8T3].

---

### Raynaud's phenomenon

Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by episodic vasospasm of peripheral arteries, causing ischemia and pain [^1128eUMB]. Triptans, including sumatriptan, can exacerbate **vasospastic reactions**, leading to severe ischemic complications, including digital ulcers and necrosis [^112GZWZZ] [^112y6QBM]. The FDA explicitly warns about the risk of peripheral vasoconstriction and Raynaud's syndrome exacerbation with sumatriptan use [^112GZWZZ].

---

### Hepatic impairment

Chronic hepatitis C with mild transaminase elevation indicates **hepatic impairment**, which can affect drug metabolism and increase the risk of adverse effects. Sumatriptan is metabolized in the liver, and hepatic impairment may prolong its half-life and increase plasma concentrations, potentially increasing toxicity [^112y6QBM].

---

## Alternative acute migraine treatments

Given the patient's clinical profile, **alternative acute migraine treatments** should be considered:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | Naproxen 500 mg, ibuprofen 800 mg | Effective for acute migraine relief; minimal cardiovascular risk compared to triptans [^notfound] |
| Acetaminophen | 1,000 mg | Safe alternative for acute migraine relief; minimal cardiovascular risk |
| Gepants | Ubrogepant 100 mg, rimegepant 75 mg | Non-vasoconstrictive; suitable for patients with cardiovascular risk factors or vasospastic disorders [^notfound] |
| Ditans | Lasmiditan 100 mg | Non-vasoconstrictive; suitable for patients with cardiovascular risk factors or vasospastic disorders [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical recommendation

Given the patient's uncontrolled hypertension, Raynaud's phenomenon, and hepatic impairment, **sumatriptan should not be administered** at this time. Alternative acute migraine treatments, such as NSAIDs or acetaminophen, should be considered. If available, gepants or ditans may be suitable alternatives given their non-vasoconstrictive properties. Sumatriptan may be reconsidered only once the patient's blood pressure is adequately controlled, Raynaud's phenomenon is stable, and hepatic function is reassessed.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Monitor blood pressure**: Ensure blood pressure is adequately controlled before considering triptans.
- **Monitor Raynaud's symptoms**: Assess for worsening vasospastic symptoms if triptans are considered in the future.
- **Monitor hepatic function**: Regularly assess liver function tests given chronic hepatitis C.
- **Patient education**: Educate the patient about the risks associated with sumatriptan and the importance of adhering to alternative treatments.

---

Sumatriptan is **contraindicated** in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and Raynaud's phenomenon due to the risk of cardiovascular and peripheral vasoconstrictive events. Alternative acute migraine treatments should be considered, and sumatriptan may only be reconsidered once these conditions are adequately controlled and monitored.

General

Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of IMITREX Tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of IMITREX®(sumatriptan) Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of IMITREX Injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS).

IMITREX should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function.

There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.

Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS).

For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose.

Overuse

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use.

5.4 Cerebrovascular Events

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs.

Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.

5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions

Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional injections of sumatriptan.

Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1agonists has not been clearly established.

5.6 Medication Overuse Headache

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.

### Sumatriptan for the treatment of undifferentiated primary headaches in the ED [^117E8KdU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

In this study, we determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of sumatriptan when used in the emergency department (ED) as a first-line treatment for benign undifferentiated headaches, and determine if the International Headache Society (IHS) classification of migraine, probable migraine, or tension-type headache has any effect on the effectiveness of the treatment. We hypothesize that there is no difference in the effectiveness of pain relief or frequency and severity of adverse effects between patients with migraine, probable migraine, or tension-type headaches when treated with sumatriptan.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study of adult ED patients undergoing treatment for primary headaches (ie, patients in whom head trauma, vascular disorders, infection, or disorders of facial or cranial structures have been clinically excluded). Other exclusions were renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and risk factors for coronary artery disease. Consenting patients then were asked to complete a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) representing their perceived pain, after which they were interviewed by a research assistant who completed a headache diagnosis worksheet, which differentiates the headache by IHS criteria. The patient repeated the VAS score at 30 and 60 minutes. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi squared tests.

Results

One hundred forty-seven patients were enrolled: 84 (57.1%) patients with migraine headache, 45 (30.7%) with a probable migraine headache, and 18 (12.2%) with a tension headache. A 50% reduction in VAS scores 60 minutes postdose was seen in 87 (59%) of 147 patients; 50 (60%) of 84 of migraine patients, 25 (56%) of 45 of probable migraine patients, and 12 (67%) of 18 tension patients (P = 0.72). There were no serious adverse events reported. Forty-seven patients (32%) received rescue medications after the 60-minute VAS score: 29 (34.5%) patients in the migraine group, 15 (33.3%) patients in the probable migraine group, and 3 (15.8%) patients in the tension-type headache group (P = 0.26).

Conclusions

Most of the patients presenting with primary headaches had migraine or probable migraine headaches. There was no difference in sumatriptan's effectiveness based on the classification of the headache using IHS criteria.

### Sumatriptan and naproxen sodium [^116LUgtG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets.

Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of cardiovascular events, even in the absence of previous cardiovascular symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.

### Raynaud's phenomenon [^1128eUMB]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is characterised by episodic vasospasm of the fingers and toes typically precipitated by exposure to cold. Mild Raynaud's is common and is not usually a harbinger of clinically important disability; its onset, however, can be startling and uncomfortable for patients, and the well recognised association in some cases with systemic rheumatic conditions often precipitates aggressive assessments for underlying diseases. Advances in vascular physiology have shed light on the role of the endothelium as well as endothelium-independent mechanisms in the altered vasoregulation of Raynaud's. We review clinical aspects of the disorder and new insights with respect to pathophysiology, and we discuss potential new therapeutics based on the disease mechanism, such as prostacyclin analogues, serotonin antagonists, and calcitonin gene-related peptides.

### Rizatriptan benzoate [^111bJxyy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Cerebrovascular Events

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if a cerebrovascular event occurs.

As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)].

5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions

5-HT1agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional rizatriptan benzoate doses.

Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1agonists have not been clearly established.

5.6 Medication Overuse Headache

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.

5.4	Cerebrovascular Events

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.

Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical of migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions need to be excluded. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (4)].

5.5	Other Vasospasm Reactions

RELPAX may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional RELPAX doses [see Contraindications (4)].

### Evaluation of the safety of calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment among adults with Raynaud phenomenon [^115CpCEx]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In patients with Raynaud phenomenon, what is the microvascular complication risk of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist use?

Findings

In this cohort study of 169 adults with Raynaud phenomenon, 9 patients had microvascular complications after CGRP antagonist use. Two of the 9 patients had severe adverse events, including digital autonecrosis that required distal amputation.

Meaning

This study suggests that microvascular complications are uncommon in patients with Raynaud phenomenon who are taking CGRP antagonists; however, the incidence of adverse microvascular events with high morbidity warrants caution in prescribing CGRP antagonists in these patients.

### Almotriptan [^114L1pyS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with other triptans and some events have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appeared possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the triptan having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attack) [see Contraindications (4.2)].

5.4 Other Vasospasm-Related Events, Including Peripheral Vascular Ischemia and Colonic Ischemia

Triptans, including almotriptan tablets, may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm, such as peripheral and gastrointestinal vascular ischemia with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Very rare reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of triptans. Visual disorders may also be part of a migraine attack. Patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow following the use of any triptan, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud's syndrome, are candidates for further evaluation [see Contraindications (4.3)].

2.1	Dosage in Adults

The recommended dosage for adults is 1 tablet of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg contains a dose of sumatriptan higher than the lowest effective dose. The choice of the dose of sumatriptan, and of the use of a fixed combination such as in Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg should be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose of sumatriptan with the potential for a greater risk of adverse reactions.

The maximum recommended dosage in a 24-hour period is 2 tablets, taken at least 2 hours apart.

The safety of treating an average of more than 5 migraine headaches in adults in a 30-day period has not been established.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.2	Dosage in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age

The recommended dosage for pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is 1 tablet of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 10/60 mg.

The maximum recommended dosage in a 24-hour period is 1 tablet of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg.

The safety of treating an average of more than 2 migraine headaches in pediatric patients in a 30-day period has not been established.

### The risks of sumatriptan administration in patients with unrecognized subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) [^115DGt2y]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Administration of sumatriptan in subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) patients, misdiagnosed as migraine patients, may induce symptomatic cerebral vasospasm with potentially dangerous consequences. Over a 5-year period, we observed three patients with a 3-15-year history of migraine, who received sumatriptan for acute headache. Two patients received 6 mg sumatriptan subcutaneously on days 4 and 6, and one patient 3 x 100 mg sumatriptan orally on day 1 after an acute headache episode. In all three cases, an alleviation of headache intensity from severe to moderate was observed. When headache recurred and meningeal signs appeared, SAH was diagnosed by computed tomography in all three cases. No neurological deficits occurred during the further course of the disease. In both patients with a SAH caused by an aneurysm, transcranial Doppler sonography demonstrated vasospasm of the basal cerebral arteries. An antinociceptive effect of sumatriptan can be observed in SAH patients in good clinical condition, which suggests a specific craniovascular antinociceptive action. This may lead to misdiagnosis as migraine and delayed appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^117YUryu]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Additional challenges hindering clinical trials for the acute treatment of aura include the low incidence and relatively short duration of aura, together with the high inter-individual variability of aura characteristics. The adoption of alternative trial designs may help to overcome these challenges and the consequent lack of specific treatments for migraine-associated aura. As a first step, the trial protocol should clearly state if the objective is to abort or reduce the length of the aura or to reduce or eliminate the headache, as these are distinct outcomes that most likely have different neurobiologies. It should also specify that participants have a history of at least one aura or attack of migraine with aura per month. In trials where the expected effect of treatment is to prevent the headache phase, the primary efficacy endpoint should be the number of headaches following the aura, with pain freedom after 2 hours a secondary efficacy measure. When the focus is on headache prevention in migraine with aura, a feasible compromise can be aura followed by headache in at least 80% of the attacks. In trials where aura is the event of interest, the primary efficacy measure should be the duration of the aura.

2.2. Early intervention

To facilitate migraine diagnosis and assess whether acute treatment will be effective when headache intensity is moderate or severe, subjects in clinical trials are often required to wait until headache pain is of at least moderate intensity before they treat an attack. This is not how migraine attacks are treated in clinical practice, where early intervention may be the most effective acute treatment strategy. With many oral triptans, for example, early intervention has been shown to lead to a higher percentage of pain-free responses at 2 hours after treatment than traditional administration (i.e. when headache intensity is moderate or severe): 57% versus 43% for zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, 68% versus 47% for eletriptan, 53% versus 38% for almotriptan 12.5 mg, 58% versus 32% for sumatriptan 100 mg, and 66% versus 44% for rizatriptan 10 mg). Early treatment while pain is mild has been associated with higher pain free rates for non-triptan acute treatments as well.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of treatments for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1114HovB]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Several pharmacological treatments are available for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, but there is uncertainty regarding the best options. We aimed to assess and compare the benefits and harms of treatments available for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Method

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological treatments. We searched for systematic reviews published in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to Jan 31, 2017, and for RCTs published from inception to Sept 24, 2019 in MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included double-blind RCTs (parallel or crossover) that compared two or more pharmacological treatments or placebo in patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Individual patient data were obtained for one unpublished RCT. Three researchers independently screened the texts and extracted the data. Efficacy outcomes included severity (on a ten-point scale), daily frequency, and mean duration of Raynaud's phenomenon attacks. We also examined tolerability and acceptability. Pairwise meta-analyses and Bayesian random-effects network meta-analyses were used to synthesise data. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017057518).

Findings

We included 58 RCTs in the analysis, comprising 3867 patients (3540 [91.5%] with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon) and 15 classes of drugs. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors were more effective than placebo for frequency (mean difference -0.36 [95% credibility interval -0.69 to -0.04]), severity (-0.34 [-0.66 to -0.03]), and duration (-3.42 [-6.62 to -0.29]) of attacks (low to moderate level of evidence). Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were superior to placebo for frequency (-0.35 [-0.67 to -0.02]) and severity (-0.84 [-1.25 to -0.45]) of attacks (low level of evidence). For severity of attacks, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (-1.54 [-2.68 to -0.41]; very low level of evidence) and oral prostacyclin receptor agonists (-0.48 [-0.80 to -0.16]; low level of evidence) were superior to placebo. No other drug classes were significantly superior to placebo with regard to efficacy outcomes. Compared with placebo, tolerability was lower for PDE5 inhibitors (incidence rate ratio for serious adverse events or early study exit due to adverse events 3.30 [95% CrI 1.49 to 7.55]) and CCBs (3.13 [1.33 to 7.04]). For all outcomes, global heterogeneity and between-study variance ranged from low (I² = 0% and τ² = 0.0 for attack severity and duration) to moderate (I² = 41% and τ² = 0.2 for tolerability). The overall risk of bias was judged to be low in 22 (38%), high in ten (17%), and unclear in 26 (45%) RCTs.

Interpretation

PDE5 inhibitors and CCBs are the most effective pharmacological options, albeit with moderate efficacy and a low level of evidence. Current evidence does not support the use of any other drug in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^112qe2ce]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Emergency department migraine interventions — meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with the objective to identify interventions for acute pain relief in adults presenting with migraine to emergency settings included only studies using the ICHD-II for migraine; studies were graded according to risk of bias per the Cochrane Handbook, with final ratings per the US Preventive Services Task Force; groups of 2 or more trials without significant clinical heterogeneity were combined in meta-analyses and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Sumatriptan vs placebo: pooled OR for pain relief 8.41 (95% CI 6.96 to 10.16); other findings are consensus recommendations based on heterogeneous literature of good, fair, and, poor quality, and limitations note that the section about opiate medications had poor-quality articles with significant heterogeneity and that recommendations mostly were without pooled estimates, aside from sumatriptan; article methods more aligned with consensus recommendations than a focused meta-analysis article.

### Evaluation of the safety of calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment among adults with Raynaud phenomenon [^111MTemm]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that microvascular complications of CGRP antagonist use in patients with underlying RP are uncommon. No statistically significant differences were found in demographic or clinical characteristics between the 2 patient cohorts (patients taking CGRP antagonists with complications vs those without complications). Specifically, no statistically significant differences were found in risk factors for RP, migraine history, or specific CGRP antagonist medication. Nonetheless, the rare incidence of serious adverse events, including infarction that requires amputation, warrants caution when considering the use of these agents in patients with RP. Future directions include conduction of a retrospective cohort study that examines the microvascular complication rates in patients with and without RP who are taking CGRP antagonists. A hazard ratio extracted from this data would inform the risk profile of CGRP antagonists in this subpopulation.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a condition where arterial spasm, usually in the fingers, causes episodes of reduced blood flow. The condition is either idiopathic (primary) or related to a connective tissue disorder or drug response (secondary). We present a case of severe RP where we performed a novel-sequenced CTA and MRA during a prolonged active episode of peripheral vasospasm. Real-time multidisciplinary consultation resulted in appropriate therapy with symptoms alleviation within hours of presentation.

### Sumatriptan (oral route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^114Y9d5y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using oral sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Sixty-one studies (37,250 participants) compared oral sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 50 mg and 100 mg doses. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 50 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 6.1, 7.5, and 4.0 for pain-free at two hours and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. NNTs for sustained pain-free and sustained headache relief during the 24 hours postdose were 9.5 and 6.0, respectively. For sumatriptan 100 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 4.7, 6.8, 3.5, 6.5, and 5.2, respectively, for the same outcomes. Results for the 25 mg dose were similar to the 50 mg dose, while sumatriptan 100 mg was significantly better than 50 mg for pain-free and headache relief at two hours, and for sustained pain-free during 24 hours. Treating early, during the mild pain phase, gave significantly better NNTs for pain-free at two hours and sustained pain-free during 24 hours than did treating established attacks with moderate or severe pain intensity. Relief of associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and use of rescue medication was lower with sumatriptan than with placebo. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with the sumatriptan than with placebo, with a clear dose response relationship (25 mg to 100 mg). Sumatriptan was compared directly with a number of active treatments, including other triptans, paracetamol (acetaminophen), acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and ergotamine combinations.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral sumatriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for migraine attacks, relieving pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, but is associated with increased adverse events.

### A case of myocardial infarction with sumatriptan use [^115dGQ16]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Sumatriptan is widely used in the treatment of acute attacks of cluster headache. It is a serotonin-1 (5HT-1) agonist. Several studies have reported an association between sumatriptan use and myocardial infarction, possibly due to the generalized vasoconstrictive nature of this agent. We report a 16-year-old male patient presenting with acute inferior myocardial infarction after sumatriptan use without any known risk factors of coronary artery disease.

### Oral sumatriptan for acute migraine [^1153Xs6w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of disabling headache, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and, in some patients, neurological aura symptoms. Sumatriptan is one of a class of selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1B/1D) agonists (triptans) thought to relieve migraine attacks by several mechanisms, including cranial vasoconstriction and peripheral and central neural inhibition.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan for the treatment of a single acute attack of migraine in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 through November 2001), and reference lists of articles and books.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind RCTs comparing oral sumatriptan (100 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg) with placebo, no intervention, other drug treatments, behavioral therapy, or physical therapy for the treatment of an acute attack of migraine in adults. Trials comparing different doses of sumatriptan or dosing regimens were also included. Outcomes considered were: 2-hour pain-free response, headache relief/headache intensity, and functional disability; headache recurrence; and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted by one reviewer and over-read by the other. The two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Information on adverse events was collected from trial reports.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials involving 16,200 participants were included. Methodological quality was generally good. Sixteen trials were placebo comparisons and showed that sumatriptan in doses of 100 mg (14 trials), 50 mg (five trials), and 25 mg (three trials) provided significantly better pain-free response (100 mg and 25 mg only), headache relief, and relief of disability at 2 hours. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) for pain-free response at 2 hours were 5.1 (3.9 to 7.1) for the 100-mg dose (n = 2221) and 7.5 (2.7 to 142) for the 25-mg dose (n = 131); there was no significant difference between the 50-mg dose and placebo for this outcome (n = 127). For headache relief at 2 hours, NNTs were 3.4 (3.0 to 4.0), 3.2 (2.4 to 5.1), and 3.4 (2.3 to 6.6) for sumatriptan 100 mg (n = 2940), 50 mg (n = 420), and 25 mg (n = 226), respectively. Precise estimates of the efficacy of the 50- and 25-mg doses relative to the 100-mg dose could not be obtained. Adverse events were more common with sumatriptan 100 mg than with placebo (risk difference [RD] = 0.14 [0.09 to 0.20]; number-needed-to-harm [NNH] = 7.1 [5.0 to 11.1]; n = 3172). RDs for the 50- and 25-mg vs. placebo comparisons were not statistically significant.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Oral sumatriptan has been shown to be an effective drug for the treatment of a single acute attack of migraine. It is well tolerated, though minor adverse events were not uncommon in the included trials. Other triptans were generally similar in efficacy and adverse events. Among non-triptan drugs, ergotamine + caffeine was significantly less effective than sumatriptan, and other drugs have been insufficiently studied to draw firm conclusions.

### Sumatriptan succinate and naproxen sodium (Treximet) [^111XqfxL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sumatriptan / naproxen PO (also known as Treximet):
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as naproxen may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **HF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, hospitalization for HF, and death.
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sumatriptan has been associated with an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs reduce inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Medication overuse headache**: use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of NSAIDs has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Seizure**: use caution in patients with a seizure disorder.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Vasospasm induced myocardial ischaemia secondary to sumatriptan use [^115BmsYV]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Certain medications have been implicated in causing acute myocardial infarctions (AMI). Sumatriptan, a medication usually prescribed for acute migraine and cluster headaches has been documented as potentially causing coronary vasospasm, thereby leading to MI. This is usually seen in patients with strong risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) or in those with established CAD. Most cases thus far have been reported in patients using the subcutaneous preparation of sumatriptan. Here, we present a case of a patient without prior risk factors for CAD and angiographically unremarkable coronary arteries who presented with evidence of an AMI after oral sumatriptan use for migraines.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypersensitivity Reactions: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue QULIPTA and initiate appropriate therapy. Severe hypersensitivity reactions have included anaphylaxis and dyspnea. These reactions can occur days after administration. (5.1)
Hypertension: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension may occur. (5.2)
Raynaud's phenomenon: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud's phenomenon may occur. (5.3)

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema, have been reported with use of QULIPTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur days after administration. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue QULIPTA and institute appropriate therapy [see Contraindications (4)].

5.000000000000000e+00 2 Hyper tension

Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA, in the postmarketing setting. Some of the patients who developed new-onset hypertension had risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment, but was most frequently reported within 7 days of therapy initiation. QULIPTA was discontinued in many of the reported cases.

Monitor patients treated with QULIPTA for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of QULIPTA is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology or blood pressure is inadequately controlled.

5.000000000000000e+00 3 Raynaud's Phenomenon

Development of Raynaud's phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud's phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA. In reported cases with small molecule CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 1.5 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms.

QULIPTA should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud's phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.

### Sumatriptan plus naproxen for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults [^115qdxf5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in October 2013 on 'Sumatriptan plus naproxen for acute migraine attacks in adults'. Migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. It affects two to three times more women than men, and is most common in the age range 30 to 50 years. Effective abortive treatments include the triptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory classes of drugs. These drugs have different mechanisms of action and combining them may provide better relief. Sumatriptan plus naproxen is now available in combination form for the acute treatment of migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan plus naproxen, administered together as separate tablets or taken as a fixed-dose combination tablet, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via The Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO) to 28 October 2015, MEDLINE (via Ovid) from 1946 to 28 October 2015, and EMBASE (via Ovid) from 1974 to 28 October 2015, and two online databases (www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using sumatriptan plus naproxen to treat a migraine headache episode.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or for an additional harmful outcome (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

For this update we identified one new study (43 participants), but it did not contribute any data for analysis. The review included 13 studies using sumatriptan 85 mg or 50 mg plus naproxen 500 mg to treat attacks of mild, moderate, or severe pain intensity. Twelve studies contributed data for analyses: 3663 participants received combination treatment, 3682 placebo, 964 sumatriptan, and 982 naproxen. We judged only one small study to be at high risk of bias for any of the criteria evaluated; it did not contribute to any analyses. Overall, the combination was better than placebo for the primary outcomes of pain-free and headache relief at two hours. The NNT for pain-free at two hours was 3.1 (95% confidence interval 2.9 to 3.5) when the baseline pain was mild (50% response with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 18% with placebo), and 4.9 (4.3 to 5.7) when baseline pain was moderate or severe (28% with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 8% with placebo) (high quality evidence). Using 50 mg of sumatriptan, rather than 85 mg, in the combination did not significantly change the result. Treating early, when pain was still mild, was significantly better than treating once pain was moderate or severe for pain-free responses at two hours and during the 24 hours post dose. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal; they were more common with the combination than with placebo (moderate quality evidence). Where the data allowed direct comparison, combination treatment was superior to either monotherapy, but adverse events were less frequent with naproxen than with sumatriptan (moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The conclusions of this review were not changed. Combination treatment was effective in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. The effect was greater than for the same dose of either sumatriptan or naproxen alone, but additional benefits over sumatriptan alone were not large. More participants achieved good relief when medication was taken early in the attack, when pain was still mild. Adverse events were more common with the combination and sumatriptan alone than with placebo or naproxen alone.

The triptans

We advise patients to use a triptan at the start of the headache phase of a migraine attack, since there is no evidence of efficacy if taken during preceding aura. Using a triptan at the start of the headache may reduce headache recurrence, prevent disability and possibly reduce central sensitisation. The difficulty arises in chronic migraineurs, since taking the triptan early can lead to a pattern of increasing use and medication-overuse headache. We try to help these people to identify early features that might indicate an ensuing severe migraine attack, as the triptan should be reserved for these headaches. It is important to explain that the triptan should be used, on average, on no more than 2 days per week (10 days per month) to reduce the risk of a triptan-overuse headache.

Our own practice is to try any particular triptan on at least three occasions before assessing its efficacy. Poor efficacy or tolerability with a single triptan does not reliably predict response to another, so it is definitely worthwhile working through different agents. However, choosing the right triptan for a given situation can be difficult, especially when considering second-line or third-line choices. Figure 1 and the following section may assist this decision.

Figure 1
Triptan selection in acute migraine. An approach to triptan selection based on the characteristic of acute attacks. BD, twice daily; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; TDS, three times a day.

Which triptan and how do they work?

The seven triptans — almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan — are 5HT 1B/1D receptor agonists with vasoconstrictive effects on blood vessels. The choice of triptan depends on efficacy, side effects, the duration of the headache, coexisting vomiting and cost (table 2).

Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including Sumatriptan, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Serotonin synd rome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperr eflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The on set of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Treatment with Sumatriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected.

Increase in Blood Pressure

Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Sumatriptan should be administered with caution to patients with controlled hypertension as transient increases in blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance have been observed in a small proportion of patients.

Concomitant Drug Use

In patients taking MAO-A inhibitors, sumatriptan plasma levels attained after treatment with recommended doses are 7-fold higher following oral administration than those obtained under other conditions. Accordingly, the coadministration of sumatriptan tablets and an MAO-A inhibitor is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid) reactions have occurred on rare occasions in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Advances in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112EX5ig]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Migraine phenotype and prior history of headache before a diagnosis of IIH needs to be recognised by clinicians to avoid misdiagnosis. There is an unmet need to treat headaches in IIH. Future studies should consider core outcome measures for headache, as used in migraine trials, which would optimise meta-analysis. Migraine abortive and preventive therapies can be used, but currently there is no high-class evidence to help guide treatment decisions.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age.

Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults.

Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents.

Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Sumatriptan [^117XfTov]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina

The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.

Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection.

5.2 Arrhythmias

Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders.

5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure

Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina.

Sumatriptan and naproxen combination — For freedom at 2 hours, the combination formulation was better than placebo for mild, moderate, and severe pain at baseline, with number needed to treat (NNT) values of 3.1 and 4.9 and pain-free rates of 50% and 28% for mild and moderate-to-severe baseline pain, respectively. The combination was better than the same dose of either drug given alone, with 52% responding favorably to sumatriptan alone and 44% responding favorably with naproxen alone. More adverse events (AEs) were reported with the combination product; however, the incidence of any single AE was low (< 4%), and the development of AEs did not appear to increase withdrawal rates in treated patients.

### Triptans and third nerve paresis: a case series of three patients [^113qNXq3]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

PurposeThe aim of this report is to increase awareness of a possible association between cranial nerve paresis and the use of sumatriptan in migraine sufferers, particularly in patients who have additional vascular risk factors. Patients and methodsWe describe a series of three cases where third nerve paresis developed in patients who were treated with the oral form of sumatriptan. All of the patients had a clear history of repetitive migraine headache and none of them had previous third nerve paresis. ConclusionAmong a variety of medications for the treatment of migraine, there are some drugs with vasoconstrictive effects, particularly triptans. These drugs may be a contributing factor for microvascular damage of the cranial nerves and other organs.

### Eletriptan vs sumatriptan: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple migraine attack study [^116VF1UG]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of oral eletriptan, 40 mg and 80 mg, and oral sumatriptan, 50 mg and 100 mg, in the acute treatment of migraine.

Methods

Patients with a history of migraine (n = 1,008) were randomly assigned to receive placebo, 40 mg of eletriptan, 80 mg of eletriptan, 50 mg of sumatriptan, or 100 mg of sumatriptan to treat up to three attacks. Early headache response (at 1 hour) was the primary endpoint, in addition to the standard endpoint, 2-hour headache response.

Results

Headache response rates were 12% at 1 hour and 31% at 2 hours for placebo; 24% at 1 hour and 50% at 2 hours for sumatriptan 50 mg; 27% at 1 hour and 53% at 2 hours for sumatriptan 100 mg; 30% at 1 hour and 64% at 2 hours for eletriptan 40 mg; and 37% at 1 hour and 67% at 2 hours for eletriptan 80 mg. More patients receiving eletriptan 80 mg achieved a 1-hour headache response than did patients receiving sumatriptan 50 mg (p < 0.05). All doses of eletriptan were superior to sumatriptan at 2 hours for headache response and complete pain relief (p < 0.05). Significantly more patients on eletriptan 80 mg achieved headache response in all attacks than did patients receiving either sumatriptan dose. Eletriptan 40 mg was superior to both sumatriptan doses in functional improvement (p < 0.005). The superior efficacy of both eletriptan doses was associated with higher rates of patient acceptability than sumatriptan 50 mg (p < 0.05). Eletriptan and sumatriptan were well tolerated.

Conclusion

Oral eletriptan (40 mg and 80 mg) is effective, safe, and tolerable in the acute treatment of migraine and yields a consistent response.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines on the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^1113cqaQ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

NSAIDs and triptans for acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children — implementation, dosing, and monitoring are as follows: The guideline panel determined that there is moderate certainty evidence for a net health benefit and noted that a family or patient history of migraine is sufficient to warrant therapy with anti-migraine agents administered as early as possible, ideally while symptoms are still mild, during the onset of a CVS attack; while migraine data support pain relief with NSAIDs in isolation, the strongest evidence favors NSAIDs in combination with triptans, and sumatriptan was noted to be effective alone or in combination with naproxen for relief of nausea and vomiting. The panel recommends early/immediate administration of anti-emetics to facilitate oral administration of NSAID (ibuprofen 10 mg/kg) as a first step, followed by as needed triptan treatment as early as possible at the onset of attack. Dosing considerations include: Sumatriptan + Naproxen sodium PO: 10/60 mg; 30/ 180 mg; 85/500 mg; Sumatriptan IN: 5/10/20 mg; Zolmitriptan IN: 2.5/5 mg; Rizatriptan PO: If < 40 kg: 5 mg; If ≥ 40 kg: 10 mg; Almotriptan PO: 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg. For approvals and safety, NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, and naproxen/sumatriptan combination) are FDA-approved for children with migraine; Rizatriptan is FDA-approved in children ≥ 6 years, while naproxen/sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, and almotriptan are approved in children ≥ 12 years; caution regarding use of any triptans applies in patients with underlying cardiac conduction defects such as Wolff–Parkinson–White, or history of uncontrolled hypertension, stroke, or ischemic vascular disease; if patients consistently need to use triptans on > 9 days/per month and/or NSAIDs on > 14 days per month, their preventive treatment plan may need adjustment.

Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Raynaud's Phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Acute Treatment of Migraine

The safety of NURTEC ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in adults has been evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 1) in 682 patients with migraine who received one 75 mg dose of NURTEC ODT [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Approximately 85% were female, 74% were White, 21% were Black, and 17% were Hispanic or Latino. The mean age at study entry was 40 years (range 18–75 years of age).

Long-term safety was assessed in an open-label extension study using a different oral dosage form of rimegepant. That study evaluated 1,798 patients, dosing intermittently for up to one year, including 1,131 patients who were exposed to rimegepant 75 mg for at least 6 months, and 863 who were exposed for at least one year, all of whom treated an average of at least two migraine attacks per month.

The most common adverse reaction in Study 1 was nausea (2% in patients who received NURTEC ODT compared to 0.4% of patients who received placebo).

Hypersensitivity, including dyspnea and severe rash, occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with NURTEC ODT [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon [^113KipiN]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic vasospasm of the peripheral arteries, causing pallor followed by cyanosis and redness with pain and sometimes paraesthesia, and, rarely, ulceration of the fingers and toes. Primary or idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's disease) occurs without an underlying disease. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's syndrome) occurs in association with an underlying disease. Initially conservative, non-pharmacologic approach is important for these patients, although pharmacologic therapy may ultimately be necessary. Advances in vascular physiology have showed the role of the endothelium as well as endothelium-independent mechanisms in the altered vasoregulation of Raynaud's phenomenon. This has opened promising therapeutic avenues, and it is likely that therapies targeted towards specific pathophysiologic steps become available in the near future.

### Sumatriptan (rectal route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^114eRJXv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Rectal administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of rectal sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using rectally administered sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Three studies (866 participants) compared rectally administered sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses. For the majority of efficacy outcomes, sumatriptan surpassed placebo. For sumatriptan 12.5 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 5.2 and 3.2 for headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. Results for the 25 mg dose were similar to the 12.5 mg dose, and there were no significant differences between the two doses for any of the outcomes analysed. The NNTs for sumatriptan 25 mg versus placebo were 4.2, 3.2, and 2.4 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at one hour, and headache relief at two hours, respectively. Relief of functional disability was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, with NNTs of 8.0 and 4.0 for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses, respectively. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with sumatriptan than with placebo, but there were insufficient data to perform any analyses. Direct comparison of sumatriptan with active treatments was limited to one study comparing sumatriptan 25 mg with ergotamine tartrate 2 mg + caffeine 100 mg.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on limited amounts of data, sumatriptan 25 mg, administered rectally, is an effective treatment for acute migraine attacks, with participants in these studies experiencing a significant reduction in headache pain and functional disability within two hours of treatment. The lack of data on relief of headache-associated symptoms or incidence of adverse events limits any conclusions that can be drawn.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^114Xet5b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Sumatriptan tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established.

Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse
Cardiac Events

Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient's medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of sumatriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received sumatriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following sumatriptan tablets, in these patients with risk factors.

It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use sumatriptan.

The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan.

A balanced understanding of these therapies' vascular risk is essential. Post-marketing surveillance and real-world data have signaled adverse events such as alopecia and Raynaud's phenomenon for both anti-CGRP mAbs and gepants. Rare cerebrovascular events have also been described, including thalamic infarction after a single dose of erenumab (with confounders such as concurrent estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and triptan use) and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome in patients on fremanezumab or erenumab.

In contrast, large randomized controlled trials enrolling over 10,000 migraine patients have not demonstrated a significant increase in cardiovascular risk with either mAbs or gepants. Concomitant use with vasoconstrictive agents, such as triptans or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, has been well tolerated in both trial and real-world settings, supporting an overall favorable safety profile. However, what remains to be clarified is whether certain patient subgroups possess heightened susceptibility to ischemic complications despite this reassuring population-level safety.

Considering this update and our observations, we remain at a critical reconsideration point where the safety profile of CGRP antagonists — particularly their vascular effects and potential to cause ischemia in vulnerable organs — is still being elucidated. Clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing these therapies to patients with BD and other vasculitic conditions. Further research is needed to better understand the safety and risks of these agents in populations with underlying vascular diseases.

2. Special issues

2.1. Migraine with aura

Many people who have migraine without aura also have attacks of migraine with aura. Both attack types have, in most cases, similar headache features and associated symptoms, and they may share the same basic pain mechanisms. So far, no treatment has been shown to be effective when administered in the aura phase, either for reducing the duration of the aura or preventing the subsequent headache; in separate assessments of acute treatment given during the aura phase, sumatriptan 6 mg SC and eletriptan 40 mg oral tablets had no effect on the aura or the headache.

The main challenge in clinical trials focused on subjects who have migraine with aura is diagnostic accuracy. The current ICHD classification recognizes the main type, migraine with typical aura (group 1.2.1), as well as variants for typical aura followed by migraine headache, typical aura followed by non-migraine headache, and aura not followed by headache. Since most acute treatment trials are carried out in mixed populations – subjects who have migraine with aura, subjects who have migraine without aura, and subjects who have attacks of both migraine types – investigators cannot determine whether both types of attacks occurring in the same subject have similar or different responses to treatment unless each attack is separately classified as migraine with aura or migraine without aura. Therefore, a detailed recording of each aura symptom and the total duration of the aura is mandatory, and these should be based on uniform requirements. To improve accuracy and ensure that response to migraine-associated aura is being evaluated, diagnostic and treatment diaries capable of recording specific aura symptoms and duration of aura should be used. With these specialized instruments, an observation of blurred vision or visual snow, which might be mistaken for aura with a standard diary, would not be enough to classify an attack as migraine with aura. Note that in trials designed to assess treatment of the aura phase, detailed instruction about the proper use of diaries is mandatory.

Oral sumatriptan and eletriptan — Cochrane review efficacy and comparative data show dose-related benefits and favorable numbers needed to treat. The review included 61 studies (n = 37,250), mostly of sumatriptan 50 mg and 100 mg. For sumatriptan 50 mg versus placebo, the NNTs were 6.1, 7.5, and 4.0 for pain freedom at 2 hours and headache relief at 1 and 2 hours. For sustained outcomes over 24 hours post-dose, NNTs were 9.5 and 6.0. For sumatriptan 100 mg versus placebo, the NNTs were 4.7, 6.8, 3.5, 6.5, and 5.2 for the same outcomes, and sumatriptan 100 mg was significantly better than 50 mg for pain-free and headache relief at 2 hours and for sustained pain-free relief for 24 hours. Treating early gave significantly better NNTs for pain-free relief at 2 hours and sustained pain-free relief for 24 hours, associated symptom relief was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and abortive medication use was lower with sumatriptan than with placebo. In active comparisons, sumatriptan 50 mg versus eletriptan (40 mg and 80 mg) demonstrated an NNT of 9.7 in favor of eletriptan; increasing the dose of sumatriptan to 100 mg resulted in NNTs of 11 (eletriptan 40 mg) and 6.4 (eletriptan 80 mg) in favor of eletriptan.

5.4 Cerebrovascular
Events

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.

As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)].

5.5 Other Vasospasm
Reactions

5-HT1agonists, including ZOMIG, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional ZOMIG doses [see Contraindications (4)].

Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1agonists have not been clearly established.

5.7 Serotonin
Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including ZOMIG, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue ZOMIG if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Limitations

This study has several limitations. The relatively short duration of follow-up may have limited detection of microvascular complications associated with CGRP antagonist exposure. The study is also limited by data availability. For example, patients with more minor RP exacerbations may not have presented to their physicians or may have presented to outside facilities, limiting the ability to accurately capture microvascular complication rates. To mitigate confounders, an extensive comparative analysis of patient demographic and clinical characteristics was performed, with a particular focus on RP risk factors. Nevertheless, the retrospective nature of the study confers no standardization of exposure, rendering the study vulnerable to confounders. Furthermore, this study was conducted shortly after the US Food and Drug Administration approval and release of CGRP antagonists; thus, a relatively small proportion of the Mayo Clinic's total patients with migraine were prescribed these medications. The small sample size therefore limits the power of the study. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the lack of statistically significant differences among demographic or clinical characteristics between the 2 cohorts is attributable to limitations arising from the small sample size. In addition, from our experience, patients with severe or medication-refractory migraine were more likely to be prescribed the novel CGRP antagonists, which may limit generalizability of the findings. In addition, RP is a commonly overdiagnosed condition, often deliberately so, to ensure timely identification of patients with early-stage rheumatologic disease. Potential erroneous inclusion of patients without RP in this analysis could underestimate the microvascular complication rate in patients with true RP who are taking CGRP antagonists. Finally, although temporal associations are drawn between CGRP exposure and RP exacerbations, the observational nature of the study cannot be used to determine causality.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

1.3.4.18. Treatment of relapse

Recommendation:

The efficacy of treatment for headache relapse should be measured by the percentage of subjects with pain freedom 2 hours after the administration of treatment for headache relapse.

Comments:

Relapse of headache pain of any intensity can be treated with active treatment or placebo in a randomised, double-blind clinical trial. Participants should be re-randomized to active treatment or placebo for the second dose. Measured by the pain relief endpoint, the efficacy of certain acute medications (e.g. oral triptans) is similar whether the primary or the relapsing headache is treated.

### Sumatriptan (Imitrex) [^115phNh2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. IMITREX tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age.

Two controlled clinical trials evaluated IMITREX nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of IMITREX nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults.

Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral IMITREX (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral IMITREX compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age‑dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents.

Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal IMITREX. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14‑year‑old male following the use of oral IMITREX; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal IMITREX are not presently available.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of IMITREX tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving IMITREX tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium in migraine: a review [^112sE1SB]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

PROBABLE MIGRAINE WITHOUT AURA

Probable migraine is defined by the International Headache Classification of Disorders, Third Edition (ICHD‐3) as a headache that meets all except one of the diagnostic criteria for migraine with or without aura. It has an estimated prevalence of 3%–10%; however, it is likely underrecognized, with a majority of patients being misdiagnosed as having sinus or tension‐type headache. Standard‐of‐care treatment approach for probable migraine resembles that of migraine based on the assumption that the pathophysiology and treatment response profiles are similar. Only one randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled trial has been performed investigating the use of sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium in those with probable migraine. In a population of 443 randomized adult participants (n = 222 sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium, n = 221 placebo) where the typical participant was female (72%–77%), White (81%) with a mean age of 35.1 ± 11.57 years in the study group and 35.8 ± 10.91 years in the placebo group, sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium demonstrated greater values for 2‐h pain freedom (sumatriptan‐naproxen 29% vs. 11% placebo, p < 0.001) and sustained pain‐free responses over 24 h (24% sumatriptan‐naproxen vs. 9% placebo, p < 0.001) compared with that of placebo (Table 4). It further improved "normal" functioning at both 2 h (p = 0.036) and 4 h post‐dose (p < 0.001) compared with placebo; however, no differences were seen in productivity between the two groups. A greater proportion of participants reported better effectiveness and overall treatment satisfaction compared with placebo or previous therapy, most of which was NSAID therapy (sumatriptan‐naproxen: 62%, placebo: 43%, previous therapy: 29%–31%: p < 0.001 vs. placebo and previous medications), whilst 6 of 10 participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the side effects of combination therapy compared with previous therapy (44%) but not compared with placebo (64%).

Safety and side effects

We find the triptans to be well tolerated overall. The reported incidence of minor adverse effects does not differ markedly between the triptans, but depends on speed of onset of action; people taking subcutaneous sumatriptan report more adverse effects than those taking oral sumatriptan. The triptans with a longer half-life and slower onset of action, such as naratriptan and frovatriptan, have fewer side effects. The adverse effects of the oral triptans are similar, although dizziness and sedation occur more with rizatriptan and zolmitriptan than with sumatriptan and naratriptan.

There are cardiovascular safety concerns associated with triptan use due to the presence of 5HT 1B receptors on vascular smooth muscle. We avoid triptans in people with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular disease. However, in clinical trials, cardiovascular complications were fewer than one per million exposed, and a recent systematic review of cardiovascular safety data identified no strong cardiovascular safety issues. Triptan sensations such as burning or tingling in the chest or limbs are relatively common (7%), but clinicians can reassure patients that this is not associated with cardiac ischaemia.

In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified the potential for developing a serotonin syndrome when taking triptans together with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, on further evaluation only 10 of the original 36 cases identified were actually serotonin syndrome and it was concluded that triptan use did not need to be restricted in patients on SSRIs or SNRIs. We use triptans in these patients where indicated but counsel patients to be aware of the features of serotonin syndrome (agitation, nausea, palpitation and sweating). Triptans should not be co-prescribed with ergotamine (within 24 h) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (within 2 weeks).

### Health technology assessment for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine: a position statement of the international headache society [^112qhfNp]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparators

The developers of new health technologies typically conduct randomized trials to demonstrate efficacy using placebo as a control. For HTAs in migraine, it is recommended that new technologies be compared with an established treatment in the specific patient population of interest. If head-to-head trials comparing relevant interventions are not available at the time of assessment, HTAs should employ indirect or mixed-treatment comparisons (e.g. network meta-analyses) to estimate relative effectiveness, provided that the trials being analysed have comparable treatment periods, endpoints, assessments, and populations. Whenever required, statistical adjustments for potential confounders of treatment effects should be included. The HTA process should be fully inclusive of relevant stakeholders, particularly patients and/or patient groups (including public hearings by the HTA authorities)

Acute treatment

Appropriate comparators for technologies intended for the acute treatment of migraine include the oral tablet formulations of sumatriptan 50 mg, sumatriptan 100 mg, rizatriptan 10 mg, or eletriptan 40 mg and 80 mg. For new technologies intended for patients who do not respond to triptans, do not tolerate them, or have cardiovascular contraindications that preclude their use, appropriate comparators include a different class of medications (e.g. NSAIDs), usual care, or placebo. With usual care as the comparator, real-world data on headache patterns and treatments are required, and patients who have a history of failure with currently available treatments should be analysed. The main challenge with using placebo as a control is that results may lack external validity; placebo is not given as a treatment for migraine in clinical practice.

Preventive treatment

Comparators that may be used for efficacy trials technologies intended for the preventive treatment of migraine include propranolol 80 mg to 160 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, topiramate 50 mg to 100 mg, flunarizine 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day, amitriptyline 25 mg to 50 mg, and mAbs against CGRP or the CGRP receptor (e.g. monthly erenumab 70 mg to 140 mg, fremanezumab 225 mg, or galcanezumab 120 mg and quarterly eptinezumab 100 mg). For populations that include patients with chronic migraine, appropriate comparators include onabotulinumtoxinA 155 IU to 195 IU; topiramate 50 mg to 100 mg; monthly erenumab 70 mg to 140 mg, fremanezumab 225 mg, or galcanezumab 120 mg; and quarterly eptinezumab 100 mg.

- **Serious gastrointestinal adverse events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, especially in elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitor for signs of bleeding.

### Sumatriptan succinate and naproxen sodium [^114FQx3k]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1	Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

The use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) and in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to increased risk of serious cardiovascular events with sumatriptan and NSAIDS [see Contraindications (4)].

Cardiovascular Events with Sumatriptan

There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events with Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
