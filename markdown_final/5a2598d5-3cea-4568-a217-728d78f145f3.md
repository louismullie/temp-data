## Question

Give me a case of otitis media with effusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a pediatric otitis media with effusion (OME) case, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial presentation and how to distinguish OME from acute otitis media. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry. Next, I will consider the natural history and the 3‑month watchful waiting window. After that, I need to check risk stratification and hearing assessment thresholds. Then, I will evaluate surgical candidacy and procedural choices by age. Finally, I should confirm counseling, follow-up, and documentation requirements, including special populations and complications to anticipate [^112nBRd5] [^113H9eQv] [^116dAKSh].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and definitions so I don't jump to conclusions: a 4‑year‑old with a 3‑month history of ear fullness, mild hearing difficulty, and no fever, otalgia, or irritability, which fits OME rather than AOM, since OME is middle ear fluid without acute inflammatory signs and AOM requires moderate‑to‑severe bulging or new otorrhea, which are absent here [^1165A9xp] [^113LJRNc].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before labeling this as OME: pneumatic otoscopy should demonstrate reduced tympanic membrane mobility consistent with effusion, and if the diagnosis remains uncertain, tympanometry can objectively support OME; a type B (flat) tympanogram supports effusion, though I should double-check ear canal volume to avoid misclassification from cerumen or a perforated TM, and I must remember that tympanometry is an adjunct, not a replacement for otoscopy [^114sCqHt] [^116ziDYg] [^112R9wD9].

> Hold on, I should verify the natural history to guide counseling: in otherwise healthy children, about 75–90% of OME following AOM resolves by 3 months, and even among newly diagnosed OME with type B tympanograms, roughly 56% improve by 3 months, 72% by 6 months, and 87% by 12 months; however, once OME persists to 3 months, the chance of spontaneous resolution drops substantially, to about 19% at 3 additional months, 25% at 6 months, and 31% at 12 months, so I need to ensure we don't overpromise rapid resolution at this point [^112uYFSv] [^111Hr4Wd] [^113PBfEg].

> I need to ensure I'm applying the right management window: for a child not at risk, watchful waiting for 3 months from diagnosis is recommended, but here the effusion has already persisted for 3 months, so I should obtain an age‑appropriate hearing evaluation now and avoid routine medical therapies like antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, or decongestants, which are not indicated for OME [^115UoGJR] [^113WF1cB] [^111V3q59].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and hearing thresholds to decide on intervention: if hearing is normal (< 15 dB HL), continued observation with reassessment in 3–6 months is reasonable; if there is mild bilateral conductive hearing loss (16–40 dB HL) with chronic bilateral OME, I should offer bilateral tympanostomy tubes; if there is moderate loss (> 40 dB HL), I should recommend tubes regardless of duration; I also need to check for at‑risk features (e.g. Down syndrome, cleft palate, baseline hearing loss, speech/language delay, neurodevelopmental disorders), where earlier tube consideration is appropriate even without classic hearing thresholds [^117LHq12] [^112CxHXC] [^114VUpMQ].

> Let me consider surgical options and age‑based nuances so I don't overgeneralize: for children under 4 years, tympanostomy tubes are the procedure of choice and adenoidectomy should not be performed solely for OME; for children 4 years and older, tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both may be considered, with adenoidectomy as an adjunct when there is adenoid disease or to potentially reduce recurrence, but I should confirm candidacy against hearing status and symptoms before proceeding [^113QGkvV] [^113ZRs1P] [^115gn8V7].

> I should double-check the expected benefits and risks to frame shared decision‑making: tympanostomy tubes reliably reduce effusion prevalence, improve conductive hearing, and can improve disease‑specific quality of life, while risks include tube otorrhea (about 16% within 4 weeks, 26% anytime while in place), blockage, granulation, premature extrusion, and a small risk of persistent perforation; most tubes extrude spontaneously in 8–18 months, and families should be counseled on water precautions and follow‑up needs [^116PfbT7] [^114dmYaq] [^113txtfu].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist without meeting classic hearing thresholds; I need to check whether non‑auditory symptoms can justify tubes: chronic OME with balance problems, delayed motor development, poor school performance, behavioral issues, or ear discomfort may warrant tympanostomy tubes even when hearing loss is mild, so I should screen for these and document their impact on function and quality of life [^115vMKxc] [^113KBbXm].

> Next, I should review special populations so I don't miss high‑risk nuances: children with cleft palate have near‑universal OME and warrant long‑term otologic monitoring with individualized timing of tubes; children with Down syndrome or stenotic canals need closer surveillance and may require microscope‑assisted exams; infants with failed newborn screens presumed secondary to OME need documented follow‑up to ensure resolution and exclude sensorineural hearing loss [^111sGtDw] [^111bQKu3] [^115yBPdZ].

> I will now examine follow‑up and surveillance if we do not proceed to surgery: for chronic OME without tubes, re‑evaluate every 3–6 months until effusion resolves, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities emerge; if tubes are placed, examine ears within 3 months and continue periodic checks until extrusion; throughout, I should document resolution, hearing improvement, and quality‑of‑life gains using structured tools like the OM‑6 when possible [^113H9eQv] [^113txtfu] [^111VaJjr].

> Hold on, I should verify that counseling and documentation are explicit: families need to understand the favorable but variable natural history, the rationale for hearing testing, red flags prompting earlier intervention, and the potential sequelae of persistent effusion; I should also document the presence of effusion with pneumatic otoscopy or tympanometry, hearing results, and the shared decision‑making discussion if surgery is or is not pursued [^112nBRd5] [^114sCqHt] [^116dAKSh].

> Let me reconsider the immediate next steps for this 4‑year‑old with 3‑month OME: I should obtain an age‑appropriate audiogram now, assess for at‑risk features and non‑auditory symptoms, and if bilateral mild hearing loss is documented, offer bilateral tympanostomy tubes; if hearing is normal, I can observe with reassessment in 3–6 months, but I need to ensure close follow‑up given the low likelihood of spontaneous resolution after 3 months and counsel the family accordingly [^113WF1cB] [^111Hr4Wd] [^117LHq12].

A typical OME case is a **3-year-old with persistent middle ear fluid** [^1165A9xp] confirmed by pneumatic otoscopy [^114sCqHt] and tympanometry [^116ziDYg], with a **flat (type B) tympanogram** [^112R9wD9] and mild conductive hearing loss (25–35 dB) [^113kxkYU]. The child has no acute infection signs, but shows **speech delay and school performance concerns** [^117LHq12]. Management is **watchful waiting for 3 months** [^115UoGJR] with hearing monitoring [^113WF1cB]; if effusion and hearing loss persist, tympanostomy tubes are offered [^112BNYjY] [^114VNq7z]. Antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, and decongestants are not recommended [^111V3q59].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Age**: 3-year-old child.
- **History**: Persistent ear fullness and mild hearing difficulty for several months; no acute infection signs (fever, ear pain, irritability) [^1165A9xp].
- **Symptoms**: Speech delay, difficulty following instructions, and school performance concerns [^112eFKac].
- **Physical examination**: Pneumatic otoscopy reveals retracted tympanic membrane with reduced mobility and visible air-fluid levels [^111fYrhn].
- **Tympanometry**: Flat (type B) tympanogram indicating middle ear effusion [^112R9wD9].
- **Audiometry**: Mild conductive hearing loss (25–35 dB HL) [^113kxkYU].

---

## Diagnosis

OME is diagnosed by documenting middle ear effusion with **pneumatic otoscopy** [^114sCqHt] and confirming with **tympanometry** when needed [^116ziDYg]. A **type B tympanogram** supports the diagnosis [^112R9wD9].

---

## Management

Initial management is **watchful waiting for 3 months** [^115UoGJR] from diagnosis, with periodic hearing monitoring [^117LHq12]. If effusion and hearing loss persist beyond 3 months, **tympanostomy tube insertion** is recommended [^112BNYjY] [^114VNq7z]. Medical therapies (antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants) are not recommended [^111V3q59].

---

## Prognosis

Most cases resolve spontaneously within 3 months [^116j5aXh]; persistent effusion beyond 3 months increases the risk of **speech and language delays** [^notfound] and **hearing loss** [^116j5aXh]. Tympanostomy tubes effectively restore hearing and reduce effusion recurrence [^116PfbT7].

---

This case illustrates the **typical presentation, diagnosis, and management** of otitis media with effusion in children, emphasizing the importance of **watchful waiting** and **timely intervention** if effusion persists.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surveillance — observation and tube consideration: Reevaluation with otoscopy, audiologic testing, or both at 3- to 6-month intervals facilitates ongoing counseling and education during surveillance, and otherwise healthy children without at-risk criteria can be safely observed for 6 to 12 months; however, for children at risk for developmental sequelae, prolonged surveillance is not advised and tympanostomy tubes may be performed when OME is not likely to resolve promptly, defined as a type B tympanogram or persistence for ≥ 3 months.

Otitis media with effusion — natural history supports observation: "OME occurring after an episode of AOM resolves in 75% to 90% of cases by the third month". Among newly diagnosed OME with a type B tympanogram, "56 will improve… by 3 months; 72 will have improved at 6 months; and 87 will no longer have a flat tracing at 12 months", whereas with chronic OME, "19 will resolve by 3 months, 25 by 6 months, 31 by 12 months, and 33… by 24 months". A type B tympanogram is "an imperfect measure of OME (81% to 94% sensitivity and 74% to 94% specificity vs myringotomy)". The guideline notes "The recommendation for a 3-month period of observation is based on a clear preponderance of benefit over harm".

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — type B tympanogram prognosis: Preschool children with OME and a type B tympanogram have low spontaneous resolution, with effusion resolution rates of only 20% after 3 months and 28% after 6 months; when resolution criteria are relaxed, rates are 28% after 3 months and 42% after 6 months. Although a type B tympanogram is not recommended as the primary diagnostic test for OME, it does have significant utility as a prognostic indicator, even when prior effusion duration is unknown.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — optional procedures: clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) AND symptoms that are likely attributable, all or in part, to OME that include, but are not limited to, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life; clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is likely to persist as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or a documented effusion for 3 months or longer; and clinicians may perform adenoidectomy as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion for children with symptoms directly related to the adenoids (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) OR in children aged 4 years or older to potentially reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112eFKac]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — evaluation and surveillance of at-risk children When OME is detected in an at-risk child, tympanostomy tubes should be offered when the likelihood of spontaneous resolution is low (eg, type B tympanogram or persistence for ≥ 3 months). For children who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, follow-up to monitor OME and hearing levels may be more frequent than the 3- to 6-month interval recommended later in the guideline, and children should be monitored until OME resolves in all affected ears. Minimum surveillance includes evaluation for OME when a child is first diagnosed as being at risk and again between 12 and 18 months, while ideal practice would entail surveillance every 3 to 6 months for the presence of OME or hearing loss. The guideline recommends assessing for OME at 12 to 18 months of age; by 18 months of age, language and speech delays are easily discerned, and delays beyond 2.5 years of age negatively affect performance in school.

Otitis media with effusion — observation period and exceptions are characterized as follows: Risks, harms, and costs include "Delays in therapy for OME that persists for > 3 months, prolongation of hearing loss", while the benefit-harm assessment is a "Preponderance of benefit over harm". Patient preference has a "Small" role. Exceptions specify that "At-risk children… may be offered tympanostomy tubes earlier than 3 months if there is a type B tympanogram in one or both ears". The policy level is "Strong recommendation", with "Intentional vagueness: None" and value judgments emphasizing "avoiding interventions in an often self-limited condition".

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116aLddA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surgery — shared decision making and age-based procedure selection emphasizes that there are 2 aspects of decision making (surgery vs additional observation, and procedure selection), candidacy depends on hearing status, associated symptoms, developmental risk, and anticipated chance of spontaneous resolution, and the poorest spontaneous resolution occurs when effusion is chronic (≥ 3 months) or associated with a type B (flat curve) tympanogram; once surgery is chosen, shared decision making is limited for children < 4 years old because tympanostomy tubes are recommended, whereas in children ≥ 4 years old options include tympanostomy tube placement alone (offers the most reliable short- and intermediate-term resolution of hearing loss and caregivers of at-risk children perceive large improvements after tube placement), adenoidectomy alone (offers comparable OME control to tubes at 6 and 12 months but may be less reliable in the short term, reduces the need for repeat surgery, has more potential anesthetic- and procedure-related complications, and some children may need additional surgery for tympanostomy tube insertion), adenoidectomy plus myringotomy without tubes (has outcomes comparable to tubes with less otorrhea and tympanic membrane sequelae, but tympanostomy tube insertion offers more reliable short-term effusion resolution and middle ear ventilation and is preferable when potential relapse must be minimized or when pronounced inflammation is present), and adenoidectomy plus tympanostomy tube placement (offers combined benefits, especially reducing repeat surgery in children with a history of tympanostomy tube placement, and may benefit children with nasal obstruction or recurrent sinonasal infections insufficient alone to justify adenoidectomy).

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — evidence-based recommendations for tympanostomy tube insertion specify that clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for ≥ 3 mo (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for ≥ 3 mo (chronic OME) and symptoms attributable to OME (e.g., vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life); clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion (or OME) at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; and clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is unlikely to resolve quickly as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of effusion for ≥ 3 mo (chronic OME). Recommendations against tube insertion are that clinicians should NOT perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of OME of < 3 mo of duration or in children with recurrent AOM who do not have middle ear effusion (or OME) in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) population-based screening — programs that screen all children with tympanometry or related methods are targeted by this statement and are discouraged because they offer little proven benefit and "is therefore not recommended"; instead, evaluation for OME is appropriate during routine well child visits or when ear-specific symptoms exist. Among screened children 3 to 7 years of age, a type B (flat) tympanogram has a sensitivity of 65% to 92% and a specificity of 43% to 80% for associated hearing loss, and the positive predictive value for pure tone hearing loss worse than 25 to 30 dB is only 33% to 49%. Because OME is found in 15% to 40% of healthy preschool children, a screening program could send up to 40% of children for additional assessment, creating strain without proven benefit; if asymptomatic OME is identified, then the initial management is watchful waiting, not early intervention.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^115U1GS1]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening — otitis media with effusion (OME) diagnosis and natural history are characterized by the statement that the diagnosis of OME is a medical rather than an audiological prerogative and that the asymptomatic nature of the disease contributes to diagnostic difficulty; in 40–60% of cases of OME neither children nor their parents report significant complaints, and parent report is highly inaccurate in identifying non-acute OME; OME often remits but approximately 30–40% of children have recurrent OME and 5–10% of episodes last one year or longer; in one study, 55% of children with OME improved by three months, one third relapsed within the subsequent three months; and if middle ear effusion is present longer than three months, there will be little chance of recovery without medical treatment.

Interpretation of tympanometry — type B results and ear canal volume. Proper interpretation of a type B result must consider the equivalent ear canal volume, which is displayed on the tympanogram printout and estimates the amount of air in front of the probe; a normal ear canal volume for children is between 0.3 and 0.9 cm^3 and usually indicates OME when combined with a type B result. A low equivalent ear canal volume can be caused by improper placement of the probe or by obstructing cerumen, whereas a high equivalent ear canal volume occurs when the tympanic membrane is not intact because of a perforation or tympanostomy tube. Static admittance is measured in mmho or mL, and peak tympanometric air pressure is expressed in decapascals (daPa) or mmH2O.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^1137fMBZ]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening and otitis media with effusion (OME) — AAP guidance and school monitoring timelines are described as follows: The 2004 AAP guidelines recommend "three months of watchful waiting" for otherwise healthy children diagnosed with OME and further state that antimicrobials should not be used for routine management. When the duration of OME is unknown, physicians must use whatever evidence is available and make a reasonable estimate, and hearing screening by school systems with rescreening or monitoring of hearing and tympanometry over a 2–3 month period can provide the medical community with important information on the duration of OME so that appropriate management options can be determined.

Tympanostomy tubes in children with frequent ear infections without persistent middle ear fluid — middle ear effusion after infection often resolves; within 3 months about 90% of children no longer have middle ear fluid. Children may still meet a recurrent infection definition (3 or more in the past 6 months, or 4 in the past 12 months) but, when no effusion is present at the specialty visit, research notes that nearly half will not have more ear infections and only about 1 in 3 children continue to have recurrent ear infections, and Other research shows that 2 out of every 3 children who see an otolaryngologist for repeated ear infections, but who have a normal examination (no middle ear fluid) in the office, do not require ear tubes in the future. The best research evidence we have suggests that inserting tubes will not reduce future ear infections when there is no persistent effusion, but the procedure does involve some minor risks related to the ear tube and general anesthesia. Waiting a bit more time to see how your child does on their own does not carry any risk or harm, since many children will not have any further ear infections at all and most will never need tubes. Exceptions are acknowledged; If any of the following apply to your child, you should discuss with your doctor whether ear tubes may still be of benefit, including weak immune system or other problems putting them at higher risk for infections; prior complications of ear infections; adverse antibiotic reactions, allergies, or inability to take oral antibiotics that make it difficult to treat ear infections when antibiotics are needed; and high risk of developmental problems including permanent hearing loss, delays in speech or language, delays in learning, autism-spectrum disorder, syndromes (e.g. Down) or structural problems with the face and head (e.g., cleft palate), or severe vision loss.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) surveillance — "Clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected". This is a "Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm", with "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies", "Level of confidence in the evidence: High", and "Policy level: Recommendation". Benefits include detection of structural tympanic membrane changes and new hearing difficulties that may prompt reassessment and discussion of listening-learning strategies with ongoing counseling, while risks/costs are limited to the "Cost of follow-up", and the "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm". Timing is intentionally flexible because "The surveillance interval is broadly defined at 3 to 6 months", and patient preference is acknowledged: "Role of patient preferences: Moderate; opportunity for shared decision making regarding the surveillance interval".

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — key term definitions specify that OME is the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, and chronic OME is OME persisting for ≥ 3 mo from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Acute otitis media (AOM) is the rapid onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation of the middle ear, and middle ear effusion is fluid in the middle ear from any cause that is present with both OME and AOM and may persist for weeks or months after AOM resolves. Hearing assessment gathers information about a child's hearing status via caregiver report or formal testing and does not include use of noisemakers or other nonstandardized methods. Pneumatic otoscopy examines middle ear mobility by changing ear canal pressure, with a normal eardrum moving briskly but becoming minimal or sluggish with fluid. A tympanogram objectively measures tympanic membrane vibration and pressure; with fluid the tracing is flat or nearly flat, and with air at abnormal pressure the peak shifts left if negative or right if positive. Conductive hearing loss reflects impaired sound transmission often associated with effusion, whereas sensorineural hearing loss results from abnormal transmission of sound from the sensory cells of the inner ear to the brain.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — epidemiology and natural history indicates that OME occurs most often between the ages of 6 months and 4 years, with high prevalence in early childhood and meaningful persistence and sequelae. In the first year of life, > 50% of children will experience OME, increasing to > 60% by age 2 years, and when children aged 5 to 6 years are screened, about 1 in 8 have fluid in one or both ears; in children with Down syndrome or cleft palate, prevalence ranges from 60% to 85%. Most episodes resolve within 3 months, but about 30% to 40% of children have repeated episodes and 5% to 10% of episodes last ≥ 1 year; at least 25% persist for ≥ 3 months and may be associated with hearing loss, balance problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), or reduced quality of life, and persistent fluid decreases tympanic membrane mobility and sound conduction with rare structural damage requiring surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113PBfEg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Natural history and rationale — Once OME has persisted in both ears for 3 months or longer, the chance of spontaneous resolution is low: approximately 20% within 3 months, 25% after 6 months, and only 30% after 1 year of additional observation. Therefore, most children diagnosed with chronic bilateral OME will fail to improve in a timely fashion, even with prolonged observation. This low probability of resolution creates a need to assess the impact of persistent effusion on a child's QOL and functional health status.

Clinical practice guideline — otitis media with effusion (OME) key action statements specify that clinicians should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old and state that adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116ziDYg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — tympanometry after pneumatic otoscopy is directed as follows: Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; this is a Strong recommendation based on extrapolation of systematic reviews of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is stated as Grade B with extrapolation from cross-sectional studies using a consistent reference standard for tympanometry as a primary diagnostic method, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for primary diagnosis and medium for use as an adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy. Benefits include improved diagnostic accuracy, confirmation of suspected OME, objective information regarding middle ear status, differentiation of OME versus tympanic membrane perforation by ear canal volume, and prognostic information, whereas risks, harms, and costs include cost, lack of access, equipment calibration and maintenance, and misinterpretation of findings; the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit.

Predictors of OME persistence — time thresholds and expected spontaneous resolution: "OME is unlikely to resolve quickly when present for 3 months or longer". In randomized observations of children with OME for 3 months, spontaneous resolution occurs in "only 19% of ears after an additional 3 months, 25% at 6 months, and 31% at 12 months". By contrast, OME after acute otitis media has "about 75%-90% resolution after 3 months". Persistence for "3 months or longer can be documented by review of medical records, by review of prior audiometry or tympanometry".

Hearing loss due to otitis media with effusion (OME) — definition and epidemiology in children: OME is defined as fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, whereas acute otitis media (AOM), usually lasting two to three weeks, is a middle ear infection of recent onset with symptoms and signs of infection such as fever, pain and irritability. OME may occur spontaneously due to Eustachian tube dysfunction or as an inflammatory response to AOM. Middle ear effusion may account for more than 90% of all middle ear pathology in children. Approximately 90% of children have OME at some time before entering school, most often between six months and four years of age. Fifty percent of children will experience OME in their first year of life, and more than 60% will have experienced the disease by two years of age.

Acute otitis media (AOM) follow-up and middle ear effusion (MEE): There is little scientific evidence for a routine 10- to 14-day reevaluation visit for all children with an episode of AOM. Persistent MEE is common and can be detected by pneumatic otoscopy (with or without verification by tympanometry) after resolution of acute symptoms, with 60% to 70% of children having MEE at two weeks after successful antibiotic treatment, decreasing to 40% at 1 month and 10% to 25% at 3 months. The presence of MEE without clinical symptoms is defined as otitis media with effusion (OME), which must be differentiated clinically from AOM and requires infrequent additional monitoring but not antibiotic therapy.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis media with effusion (OME) — strong recommendations state that the update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child and should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both. Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy and should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Clinicians should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME, should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME, and should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME.

Procedures

Children were identified through regular monthly audit procedures, and an invitation letter was sent to their guardians. Others were referred directly into the study by the general practitioner, nurse, or health visitor whenever a child presented with suspected otitis media with effusion. A total of 2185 children had full consent given and attended a practice appointment with the research nurse for otoscopy with tympanometric screening, to establish if bilateral otitis media with effusion was present (fig 1). A modified Jerger classification was used to confirm effusion (table 1); this has been used in a previous study of otitis media with effusion in primary care. Children in the first year of the study had a three month period of active monitoring (watchful waiting) if they failed the first screening (B/B or B/C2 types) (n = 281) and were invited to be entered into the main study at a second screening only if they failed a second time (n = 72). A protocol change agreed and authorised by the data monitoring and ethics committee resulted in the active three month monitoring period being dropped for the remaining study period, to allow children with histories and bilateral tympanometric failure the opportunity to be randomised (50:50) at the first failed screen. This allowed faster recruitment and also took account of the preferences of children's families and feedback from recruiting nurses.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children — research needs emphasize diagnostic prediction and testing strategies, including whether we can "identify clinical factors that predict persistence of MEE" and define "the ideal timing of audiologic testing for a child being considered for tubes — before surgery, after surgery, or both", and how "abnormal tympanometry at the initial clinical encounter" relates to persistence of otitis media with effusion (OME). Questions address evaluation and risk prediction in recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), such as the "best time to evaluate children referred for possible surgical treatment of recurrent AOM with relation to the last episode of AOM" and whether the "presence of middle ear fluid in one or both ears" predicts more AOM episodes in children with recurrent AOM. For at‑risk populations, the guideline asks about the "benefits of tympanostomy tube placement on frequency of AOM, prevalence of OME, and speech and language development", whether surgery presents "unique risks or greater complications", the "actual frequency of AOM and prevalence of OME", and the potential for "underdiagnosis of OME because of attention to other conditions or overdiagnosis of OME because of greater clinical exposure for some of the at-risk populations". Indicators for repeated intervention are prioritized, including "the clinical indicators that best predict the need for repeated tympanostomy tube placement" and the "role of allergy testing" and management for children with "recurrent tube otorrhea" or repeated placement. Device and adjunct decisions are highlighted by asking whether certain "types of long-term tubes" are more often linked to complications and "which subgroups of children should be considered for adenoidectomy at the time of the first set of tubes or when younger than age 4 years". Communication and postoperative care topics include how "face-to-face" counseling and educational resources "facilitate shared surgical decision making", indications to prescribe "postoperative ototopical antibiotics", whether limiting routine drop use changes "the incidence of postoperative otorrhea" and microbiology, predictors of failure of "ototopical therapy as initial treatment for TTO", identifying children at risk for otorrhea and criteria for "posttympanostomy water precautions", whether child water‑precaution recommendations can be "generalized to adults with tympanostomy tubes", and the "ideal follow-up schedule" for patients with tubes.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116HspNF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion implementation considerations — pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry were previously recommended for diagnosis, but pneumatic otoscopy in particular continues to be underused in primary care settings; the guideline provides expanded information on these modalities, yet enhanced efforts will still be needed in primary care and educational efforts would likely benefit specialists as well. OME is one of the most common reasons that infants fail a newborn hearing test, with challenges in ensuring follow-up to assess effusion resolution and exclude underlying SNHL; counseling materials are provided for families, but continued education of hospital providers who administer newborn testing is an additional challenge. The new guideline reaffirms a prior recommendation against routine screening of children for OME and adds a new recommendation that clinicians evaluate at-risk children when the at-risk condition is diagnosed and again at 12 to 18 months of age, a change that imposes additional burden but had strong consensus and support from the GUG.

At-risk children monitoring and evaluations — At-risk children require closer monitoring for OME and attendant hearing loss, and such close monitoring should begin once the child is identified as high risk. For children with Down syndrome, hearing assessments are recommended every 6 months, starting at birth until the age of 3 or 4 years, then annually through childhood, and otolaryngologic evaluation is also recommended if middle ear disease, hearing loss, or both are identified or if normal middle ear function cannot be confirmed. Children with stenotic ear canals are best assessed with an otologic microscope every 3 to 6 months to remove cerumen and assess tympanic membrane appearance and middle ear aeration. For cleft palate, which is a common orofacial malformation with a prevalence of 1 in 700 live births, OME occurs in nearly all infants and children, and continued monitoring for OME and hearing loss should continue throughout childhood, including after palate repair, because of a continued high prevalence of effusion and hearing loss.

Definitions

Our classification of otitis media was based on current population-specific, evidence-based guidelines. In this study (where close follow-up was ensured), we used the following criteria: i) Aerated middle ear-normal TM mobility and Type A or C tympanogram; ii) Otitis media with effusion (OME)-middle ear effusion behind an intact TM identified by an air-fluid level or bubble seen through a translucent TM or decreased mobility of the TM or type B tympanogram (admittance < 0.2 mmho); iii) AOM without perforation-clinical diagnosis by health staff or moderate to marked bulging of an intact TM plus decreased TM mobility or Type B tympanogram; iv) AOM with perforation-evidence of recent TM perforation provided by clinical history and visualisation of fresh pus in the ear canal. The TM was intact if the perforation had already healed by the time of the assessment, and 'functionally intact' if the TM was bulging and the perforation could only be identified by pneumatic otoscopy; v) Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)-TM perforation with otorrhoea present for more than six weeks; vi) Dry perforation-TM perforation with no discharge seen in the ear canal or within the middle ear space.

AOM was cured when there was no bulging and no discharge present on examination. Similarly, we described an episode of AOM as improved if: i) the ear discharge had resolved but bulging of the TM persisted in AOM with perforation, or ii) the bulging of the TM was reduced to mild in AOM without perforation. Examples of mild, moderate, and marked bulging of the TM are available in our training video. The outcome at "1 week" was determined by the examination that was closest to day 7 (at least 5 days after the diagnosis). The outcome at "2 weeks" was determined by the examination that was closest to day 14 (at least 10 days after diagnosis).

Relevant concomitant care

Throughout this study, the Australian Indigenous infant vaccination schedule was EngerixB™ at birth, Rotarix R at 2–4 months, Infanrix R Hexa, and (for non-study participants) Prevenar13 at 2–4–6 months. Study staff provided treatment or referral for all concomitant conditions according to local guidelines.

Secondary outcomes: otitis media

Ear assessments were made at scheduled study visits at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 months by research nurses trained in paediatric video otoscopy and tympanometry. Diagnostic categories (see Table 2) were made according to national guidelines for otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations and managed according to these and local guidelines (Central Australian Rural Practitioners Association Standard Treatment Manual). Tympanometry-only was used at 1 and 2 months of age, and both otoscopy and tympanometry were used at all subsequent visits. At 1 and 2 months of age a diagnosis of either normal (type A tympanogram) or OM (type B (flat) tympanogram) was made. For each child and time point a worst ear diagnosis and laterality were allocated as this determines medical management. The hierarchy of increasing severity was normal, OME, AOMwoP, DP, AOMwiP, and CSOM. Dry perforations were detected on two occasions and have been excluded from analyses.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) outcome assessment and documentation — clinicians are encouraged to document patient-centered outcomes when managing children with OME to ensure patient follow-up and assess effectiveness, and resolution can be documented by normal tympanic membrane mobility with pneumatic otoscopy or a sharp peak on tympanometry with either normal middle ear pressure (type A curve) or negative pressure (type C1 curve); for children with tympanostomy tubes, resolution can be documented by an intact and patent tube with otoscopy or a large ear canal volume with tympanometry. Improved hearing can be documented through age-appropriate comprehensive audiometry, and improved quality of life can be measured using the OM-6, which has 6 brief questions; the caregiver completes the survey at baseline and again after a minimum follow-up period of 1 month, and a change score rates clinical change as trivial, small, moderate, or large. The time interval for assessing OME outcomes is at the discretion of the clinician; for watchful waiting or surveillance, outcome assessment can take place at a follow-up visit, and for surgery it can take place at the postoperative or subsequent follow-up visit; if documentation is not possible because of loss to follow-up, this should be noted in the medical record along with attempts to contact the family.

Diagnosis and Outcome assessments

Eligibility and scheduling

Baseline characteristics and pre-enrolment ear disease were assessed from clinical records. Infants were examined fortnightly from enrolment to randomization, and monthly over the 24 week intervention period or until success was documented.

Assessments

At each study visit a paediatrician or pediatric nurse trained by an Australian expert used video pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry (Grason Stadler GSI 38) to assess ear status. Clinic notes were reviewed to assess inter-current illness and side effects. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and at each post-randomisation visit, and processed as previously reported to detect pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Criteria for otitis media categories (Table 1)

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria and severity scale for worse ear

Diagnostic criteria were as previously reported. Table 1 gives definitions and the severity scale used to assign the worse (highest score) ear diagnosis at each examination. In this study, ear examinations that demonstrated type B tympanogram, reduced mobility on pneumatic otoscopy and a marked or moderately bulging TM were categorised as AOM without perforation (AOMwoP) even if the child was asymptomatic.

Success

The primary outcome ('success'), was detection of bilateral aerated middle ears (confirmed with tympanometry) at two consecutive monthly visits.

Statistical power and methods

We aimed to achieve a sample size of 118 that would provide 80% power to detect a 20% increase in success rate (5% to 25%). This would also give 88% power to detect a 30% reduction in perforation at the end of therapy (60% to 30%). Interim analysis and stopping rule was intended to be applied if the success rate in the active arm was 40%.

Data were analysed according to a pre-determined plan. We used the outcome in the worse ear (the ear with the highest severity score) to avoid dependence between ears. Estimates of treatment effect are given as the difference between amoxicillin and placebo groups in the prevalence of each outcome at the end of therapy, as a difference in the proportion of examinations during therapy (risk difference and unadjusted 95% confidence interval) or as a adjusted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (adjusted for repeat child examinations using generalised linear models – Poisson).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^111CVJsk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) key points on pediatric hearing screening — applicable to children evaluated for OME — state that any parental concern about hearing loss should be taken seriously and requires an objective hearing screening of the patient. All providers of pediatric health care should be proficient with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry; however, neither method assesses hearing. Developmental abnormalities, level of functioning, and behavioral problems may preclude accurate results on routine audiometric screening and testing, and in this situation, referral to an otolaryngologist and audiologist should be made. The results of abnormal screening should be explained carefully to parents, and the child's medical record should be flagged to facilitate tracking and follow-up. Any abnormal objective screening result requires audiology referral and definitive testing.

Hearing evaluation for otitis media with effusion (OME) candidates for tympanostomy tubes — policy and evidence profile: Aggregate evidence quality is "Grade C" with "Level of confidence in evidence: High". Benefits include "Documentation of hearing status" and "detection of coexisting mixed or sensorineural hearing loss", while harms are limited to "Cost of the audiologic assessment"; the "Benefit-harm assessment" indicates a "Preponderance of benefit over harm". The statement acknowledges "Intentional vagueness" in methods and notes caregiver preferences ("Some caregivers may decline testing"); the "Policy level" is "Recommendation". Implementation notes that "Resource limitations and access to care may allow for only a single preoperative audiogram; if resources permit only a single audiometric assessment, this would ideally be performed after tympanostomy tube insertion to assess for normal hearing (following resolution of OME) or to identify any residual or underlying hearing loss".

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — hearing thresholds, monitoring, and tympanostomy tube decisions are tied to audiologic findings and effusion duration. If a child with OME has hearing levels in the normal range (< 15 dB HL), the clinician should assess for signs or symptoms of OME that would make tube insertion an option, and if watchful waiting is continued a repeat hearing test should be performed in 3 to 6 months if OME persists. If a child with OME has mild hearing loss (16–40 dB HL) and bilateral effusions for 3 months or longer (chronic), the clinician should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion; if mild hearing loss (16–40 dB HL) occurs with a unilateral effusion or with bilateral effusions for less than 3 months, the clinician should assess for signs or symptoms of OME that would make tube insertion an option. If a child with OME has moderate hearing loss (> 40 dB HL), tympanostomy tube insertion should be recommended. Reevaluation at 3- to 6-month intervals should include otologic examination, with audiologic assessment as needed, and any child with evidence of hearing loss on screening or hearing testing should be referred for comprehensive audiologic evaluation by a licensed audiologist in a sound-treated booth. One systematic review showed early improvement in hearing levels after tympanostomy tube placement at postoperative 1–3 months, but by 12 to 24 months hearing outcomes were equivalent to watchful waiting, and randomized trials suggest that otherwise healthy children with persistent OME who do not have any of the at-risk criteria in Table 2 can be safely observed for 6 to 12 months without developmental sequelae or reduced overall QOL. Ongoing surveillance is mandatory because the incidence of structural damage increases with effusion duration.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) watchful waiting — Clinicians should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Strong recommendation based on systematic review of cohort studies and preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid interventions with potential adverse events and cost for a condition that is usually self-limited (National Quality Strategy domains: patient safety, efficient use of health care resources). Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic review of cohort studies. Level of confidence in the evidence: High. Benefit: Avoid unnecessary referrals, evaluations, and interventions; take advantage of favorable natural history.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — failed newborn hearing screen follow-up: Clinicians should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn hearing screen regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Intentional vagueness states that the method and specifics of follow-up are at the discretion of the clinician but should seek resolution of OME within 3 months of onset or, if not known, diagnosis. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C; Level of confidence in evidence: Medium; Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit, with benefits including more prompt diagnosis of SNHL, earlier intervention for hearing loss, reduced loss to follow-up, and reassurance for parents, and risks including time spent in counseling and parental anxiety from increased focus on child hearing issues. Supporting data report that among screening failures referred for further testing, 55% of children had OME, of which 23% had spontaneous resolution; in remaining infants after tympanocentesis or placement of ventilation tubes, 69% had immediate return and 31% had delayed return in hearing with a median of 4.8 months; a cohort study found that 11% had SNHL in addition to the transient conductive hearing loss from the effusion.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) — Vestibular and developmental symptoms may justify considering tympanostomy tubes when symptoms are likely attributable to OME despite not meeting hearing-loss criteria. The statement's purpose is to facilitate intervention for children with chronic OME and associated symptoms likely attributable to OME when prior criteria are not met, and it notes United Kingdom guidance to "consider surgical intervention in children with chronic bilateral OME with a hearing loss less than 25 to 30 dB HL" when impact is significant. The group also considered chronic unilateral OME as a surgical indication if presented with symptoms likely attributable to OME. OME has "a direct and reversible impact on the vestibular system in children aged 3 years and older", with deficiencies that "tend to resolve promptly following tympanostomy tube insertion", and "evidence suggests that tympanostomy tube insertion is a reasonable option for children with chronic OME who have unexplained clumsiness, balance problems, or delayed motor development". For children "under the age of 3 years" the vestibular impact "has not been well studied", though improvement or resolution has been described after tube insertion.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114Lzcn9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — diagnosis and initial observation research priorities — states there will probably never be a gold standard for diagnosis of AOM because of the continuum from otitis media with effusion (OME) to AOM, and performing tympanocentesis studies on children with uncomplicated otitis is likely not feasible because of ethical and other considerations. Devices that more accurately identify the presence of middle ear effusion (MEE) and bulging that are easier to use than tympanometry during office visits would be welcome, with additional development of inexpensive, easy-to-use video pneumatic otoscopes still a goal. For less certain tympanic membrane (TM) appearances, randomized controlled trials could clarify the benefit of initial antibiotics and initial observation, and such studies must also specify severity of illness, laterality, and otorrhea, establish appropriate end points, and, when TM appearance is unimproved, require randomization to continued observation and antibiotic groups. The most efficient and acceptable methods of initial observation should continue to be studied balancing the convenience and benefits with the potential risks to the patient.

Tympanometry as an adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy — indications for use. Tympanometry is a useful adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy because it provides objective evidence of middle ear status, and although recommended as a first-line diagnostic test for OME, pneumatic otoscopy has varying degrees of validity and accuracy in routine clinical practice; all studies examining test performance of pneumatic otoscopy have used experienced otoscopists with special training, validation, or both, whereas OME is most often diagnosed by primary care providers who are not validated and do not often use a pneumatic attachment. There are no specific studies that validate the performance characteristics of tympanometry as a confirmatory, or adjunctive, test with pneumatic otoscopy, and we therefore recommend tympanometry when the diagnosis of OME is uncertain after pneumatic otoscopy is used or attempted; specific situations for which tympanometry is recommended include child intolerance of pneumatic otoscopy; inability to reliably perform pneumatic otoscopy because of training or equipment considerations (eg, inability to obtain an air-tight seal); difficulty visualizing the tympanic membrane because of partially obstructing cerumen that cannot be readily removed by the clinician; difficulty visualizing the tympanic membrane because of a very narrow or stenotic external auditory canal (eg, Down syndrome); uncertainty about the presence or absence of OME because of equivocal findings on pneumatic otoscopy; need or desire to rule out OME in an at-risk (Table 3) child; and need or desire for objective confirmation of OME before surgery.

General health measures

Common conditions of childhood were recorded at the time of ear assessment by direct observation; the child's skin (head, arms, legs and trunk) was examined for the presence of scabies, tinea, skin sores or other skin condition; presence of nasal discharge (visible at a distance of 1 meter), and any cough (spontaneous or cough on request, either wet or dry). We categorised 'not sure' as absent. Antibiotics and other treatments or referrals were provided to participants according to local guidelines.

Definitions of OM

We categorized middle ear states as follows: (1) normal; (2) otitis media with effusion (OME); (3) acute otitis media without perforation (AOMwoP); (4) AOM with perforation (AOMwiP); (5) dry perforation; and (6) chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The final middle ear diagnosis reflected the child's more severely affected ear (highest category). We based our criteria for diagnosis on recommendations for clinical practice in this population: (i) OME – intact and non-bulging tympanic membrane (TM) and Type B tympanogram; (ii) AOMwoP – any bulging of the TM and Type B tympanogram; (iii) AOMwiP – middle ear discharge observed and TM perforation recently healed or present for less than six weeks or covering less than 2% of the pars tensa of the TM; (iv) dry perforation – TM perforation without any discharge observed; (v) CSOM – middle ear discharge observed and perforation present for longer than six weeks and covering at least 2% of the pars tensa of the TM. We also include combination categories of any suppurative OM (any AOM, AOMwiP or CSOM) and any TMP (any AOMwiP, dry perforation or CSOM). Where duration of discharge was not known, size of perforation was used to distinguish AOMwiP and CSOM. Where otosocopy was not successful we used the child's tympanometry result and defined the child's status as OME if either ear had a Type B tympanogram. We asked the mother if she thought her child had ear pain that day or during the previous evening. These a priori diagnostic criteria have been applied in all our surveillance and clinical trials conducted in this population since 2001.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) and cochlear implantation — use of tympanostomy tubes in children is summarized as follows: when a child who is a candidate for cochlear implantation also has chronic OME or a history of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), the appropriateness of tympanostomy tube insertion prior to implant surgery is questioned; a review supports using a tympanostomy tube in otitis-prone children undergoing cochlear implantation; the preponderance of evidence and policy statements favor using tubes in children with recurrent AOM undergoing cochlear implantation with no evidence of increased infectious complications from a tube; for OME prior to implantation, evidence is less robust, but a case series reported that infectious complications are rarely associated with tubes and that tube insertion is safe; a more recent literature review concluded that chronic OME and recurrent AOM should have tympanostomy tubes placed to treat any middle ear infection before cochlear implantation.

Methods

Study design and participants

This study was a double blind randomised placebo controlled trial of 217 children with a history of otitis media and tympanometrically confirmed bilateral otitis media with effusion. We randomly assigned children to receive either mometasone nasal spray (n = 105) or placebo nasal spray (n = 112), given for a period of three months to assess likely effectiveness in a health service setting. We chose mometasone because of its preferred safety profile in children. Seventy-six practices in the Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework actively recruited children into the study between 2004 and 2007. Research nurses recruited children aged 4–11 years by using both audit procedures and within practice referrals. Children identified from the audit had either one or more recorded episodes of otitis media in the previous 12 months or histories suggestive of otitis media with effusion, such as speech or language delay or hearing problems. All children identified as clinically "at risk" for otitis media with effusion were then invited for tympanometric screening to diagnose and confirm current bilateral otitis media with effusion.

We excluded children from the study if they had passed tympanometry (that is, had at least one tympanometrically normal ear (A or C1) with which to hear) or had large amounts of wax or uninterpretable tympanograms. We also excluded children at high risk of recurrent disease for whom early referral was indicated (children with cleft palate, Down's syndrome, primary ciliary dyskinesia, Kartagener's syndrome, and immunodeficiency states), as well as children with grommets in the drum or perforations, children referred or listed for ear surgery, those for whom developmental concerns about their growth existed, those with frequent or heavy epistaxis, and those with hypersensitivity to mometasone or who had received systemic steroids in the previous three months or were likely to need them (for example, for poorly controlled asthma). We did not include children aged under 4, because pilot work suggested that younger children do not adequately comply with taking nasal sprays.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116PfbT7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — clinical role and risk considerations — state that when children receive surgery for otitis media with effusion (OME), insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the preferred initial procedure, with candidacy dependent primarily on hearing status, associated symptoms, and the child's developmental risk. Placement of tympanostomy tubes significantly reduces middle ear effusion (MEE) prevalence, resolves hearing loss caused by MEE, reduces the incidence of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), and provides a mechanism for drainage and administration of topical antibiotic therapy should acute tube otorrhea occur. Tympanostomy tubes also can improve disease-specific quality of life (QOL) for children with chronic OME, recurrent AOM, or both. Risks and potential adverse events are related to general anesthesia, usually required for the procedure, and the effects of the tympanostomy tube on the tympanic membrane and middle ear, but risks associated with general anesthesia can be eliminated by inserting tubes in the office setting without general anesthesia, when appropriate, based on shared decision making between the clinician and family.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — identifying children at risk and action: "Clinicians should distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME, and should more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, and the need for intervention". The panel noted "Risks, harms, costs: None", a "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", and "Policy level: Recommendation". For this update, "the GUG agreed to add 'intellectual disability, learning disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder' to the list of risk factors that place children who have OME at increased risk for developmental difficulties". Context includes that "Whereas a child with baseline normal hearing might tolerate a 15- to 20-dB hearing decrease from OME without problems, one with permanent hearing loss, independent of OME, would have substantial difficulty that could worsen existing speech and language delays", and that "About 18% of children aged 3 to 17 years in the United States have a developmental disability, with increasing prevalence over the past decade". Implementation notes state "Potential to add this list of conditions to the electronic health record to facilitate identifying at-risk children when OME is diagnosed".

Children with cleft palate — otologic management emphasizes prevalence of otitis media with effusion (OME), indications for tympanostomy tubes, and alternatives: almost all children with cleft palate and cleft lip and palate have OME as infants; there is no evidence for the timing of tube insertion, but general consensus is to insert tympanostomy tubes when clinically indicated (eg, hearing loss and flat tympanograms); children with cleft palate require long-term otologic monitoring throughout childhood due to eustachian tube dysfunction and risk of cholesteatoma with individualized decisions involving caregivers; hearing aids are an alternative to tympanostomy tubes when hearing loss is present.

Achondroplasia — ear, nose and throat (ENT) care and hearing: Children "should have a comprehensive audiological assessment at birth, as indicated by signs and symptoms or in any case no later than 5 years of age", and those with "speech delay, hearing difficulties, and/or signs and symptoms of middle ear effusion should be referred to an ENT specialist". Adults and children "frequently have hearing loss and middle ear disease", so clinicians "should evaluate eardrums and ask about hearing difficulties as part of regular health maintenance to guide appropriate referrals". For chronic eustachian tube dysfunction with middle ear effusions and conductive hearing loss, tympanostomy tube placement "can be recommended when middle ear effusions are present for 3 or more months and hearing loss is documented". "Amplification with hearing aids can be offered" for hearing loss, including conductive loss from middle ear disease. Because high jugular bulb in the middle ear is more common, clinicians should check for otoscopic signs of high jugular bulb before myringotomy or other otological procedures are performed.
