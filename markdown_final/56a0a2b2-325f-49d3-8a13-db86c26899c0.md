## Question

What kind of complication is CLAD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kind of complication CLAD is after lung transplantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why CLAD matters. Then, I should verify the formal definition and diagnostic thresholds. Next, I will classify CLAD within the spectrum of post-transplant complications and its phenotypes. After that, I need to review pathophysiology and risk factors. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic approach and staging. Finally, I will consider prognosis and management implications to synthesize a precise answer.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. CLAD is the leading cause of late mortality after lung transplantation and the principal barrier to long-term survival, with a median post-transplant survival around 6 years and 5-year survival limited to roughly 55% largely due to CLAD, which affects up to half of recipients by 5 years, so I need to ensure I frame it as a major late complication with substantial impact on outcomes [^112DhMHe] [^117PndTK].

> Wait, let me verify the formal definition before proceeding. CLAD is defined by the ISHLT as a persistent decline in FEV1 of at least 20% from the patient's post-transplant baseline, with baseline computed as the mean of the two best post-operative FEV1 values obtained at least 3 weeks apart. Onset is dated to the first value at or below 80% of baseline, and the diagnosis is staged from CLAD 1 to 4 based on the magnitude of FEV1 decline, which I should double-check to avoid misclassification [^111Yeic2] [^115SWnTR] [^115Mwv3u].

> Hold on, I should classify CLAD within the complication taxonomy. CLAD is a chronic alloimmune complication that emerges after the early post-transplant period, distinct from early surgical or ischemia-reperfusion issues like primary graft dysfunction; it sits under the umbrella of alloimmune responses and is the chronic counterpart to acute rejection, so I need to be clear that it is a late, immunologically mediated graft failure syndrome rather than an early technical or infectious problem [^1136Lbq2] [^116PzPxN] [^111FrV4a].

> I will now examine the phenotypes, because CLAD is heterogeneous. The two principal phenotypes are bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, an obstructive pattern without persistent parenchymal opacities, and restrictive allograft syndrome, defined by a restrictive physiology with TLC decline and persistent opacities on imaging; mixed phenotypes occur, and RAS carries markedly worse prognosis than BOS, so I should confirm that phenotype matters for counseling and trials [^112XWiBe] [^112j2K7q] [^114jyTcb].

> Let me consider pathophysiology and risk factors, and I should double-check that I separate immune from non-immune drivers. Major risks include acute cellular rejection, antibody-mediated rejection with donor-specific antibodies, and community-acquired respiratory viral infections including CMV, while primary graft dysfunction and aspiration also predispose; mechanistically, CLAD reflects alloimmune injury superimposed on dysregulated repair with fibrosis, and emerging data implicate type 1 immunity and endogenous regulators in the airway transcriptome, which aligns with the clinical picture of chronic rejection [^114vD153] [^1159YDn4] [^112hLUJK] [^111vGwSA].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and staging, and I need to ensure I integrate function, imaging, and exclusion of mimics. Diagnosis relies on serial spirometry with confirmation of persistence, while CT helps distinguish BOS from RAS and mixed phenotypes; TLC by plethysmography is recommended to confirm restriction, and bronchoscopy with BAL is used early to exclude infection, acute rejection, and airway stenosis, after which its role diminishes once CLAD is established; staging uses FEV1 thresholds and should specify phenotype for clarity [^114WQtpp] [^112j2K7q] [^115iwcyF] [^115Mwv3u].

> But wait, what if the decline is not persistent or is due to a reversible cause; I should confirm how that affects classification. Probable CLAD captures early, persistent decline that has not yet met the 3-month confirmation threshold and carries a high risk of progression and graft loss, so centers often act at a 10% FEV1 decline to investigate and treat reversible contributors before labeling definite CLAD, which is important for timing interventions and trial enrollment [^116wyy2v] [^111sppTE] [^112T7pPT].

> I need to check prognosis by phenotype to avoid overgeneralization. BOS typically progresses more slowly with median survival around 3 to 5 years, whereas RAS has a median survival of only 6 to 18 months and mixed phenotypes fall between, so phenotype-specific counseling and trial stratification are essential. Importantly, retransplantation outcomes are worse for RAS than BOS, reinforcing the prognostic distinction [^114jyTcb] [^1113swo6] [^116xqLkM].

> Let me think about management implications, and I should confirm that I separate disease-modifying from supportive strategies. There is no definitive cure for CLAD; management includes optimizing immunosuppression, treating acute rejection or AMR when present, azithromycin for BOS with neutrophilic inflammation, antifibrotic agents in selected cases, and supportive care including oxygen and rehabilitation; for advanced disease, retransplantation is the only curative option, though selection and timing are critical, and ongoing trials like E-CLAD UK are evaluating extracorporeal photopheresis to slow decline [^112LTVZr] [^116SXR8N] [^113WET4x].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CLAD was uniformly irreversible, but I should correct that nuance. While CLAD is generally progressive and many cases are irreversible, some patients, particularly with BOS and neutrophilic inflammation, can experience clinically meaningful improvements with azithromycin or other interventions, and the 2019 consensus explicitly acknowledges that partial reversibility to greater than 80% of baseline would prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis, so I need to ensure I do not overstate irreversibility as an absolute rule [^116okVot] [^112LTVZr].

> Putting this together, CLAD is a chronic, alloimmune complication of lung transplantation defined by a persistent FEV1 decline of at least 20% from baseline, encompassing obstructive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, restrictive allograft syndrome, and mixed phenotypes, with diagnosis requiring exclusion of reversible causes and phenotype classification guiding prognosis and management. It is the dominant cause of late mortality after lung transplant and typically progresses despite therapy, though selected cases show partial reversibility and retransplantation remains the only curative option for end-stage disease [^111Yeic2] [^112DhMHe] [^112XWiBe] [^112LTVZr].

CLAD is the **leading cause of late mortality** [^112DhMHe] after lung transplantation, defined by a persistent ≥ 20% decline in FEV1 from baseline [^111Yeic2] that is not explained by other causes. It is a **chronic, progressive, and often irreversible** complication [^1146CDSB] with two main phenotypes: obstructive (BOS) and restrictive (RAS) [^112XWiBe], the latter carrying worse prognosis [^1113swo6]. CLAD is driven by alloimmune injury [^111vGwSA], chronic AMR [^117X4yYW], infections [^112sSbMW], and aspiration [^115sQGLc]; risk increases with acute rejection, DSA [^1148NwkC], CMV [^114uPnU4], and primary graft dysfunction [^112vTdbz]. Diagnosis relies on serial spirometry [^111Yeic2], CT [^115sQGLc], and exclusion of other causes [^116JYZrJ]; management is supportive [^112LTVZr] and includes azithromycin [^1157GPip], ECP [^116SXR8N], and retransplantation for advanced disease [^113WET4x].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

- **Definition**: CLAD is a persistent decline in lung function (FEV1) by ≥ 20% from baseline [^111Yeic2], not explained by other causes [^115SWnTR].

- **Baseline**: Baseline is the mean of the two best post-transplant FEV1 measurements obtained at least 3 weeks apart [^115SWnTR].

- **Persistence**: The decline must persist for at least 3 weeks [^116wyy2v] and be confirmed on at least two occasions [^116wyy2v].

- **Exclusion of other causes**: Acute rejection, infection, airway complications, and extrapulmonary factors must be excluded [^116JYZrJ].

---

## Clinical phenotypes

CLAD has two main phenotypes with distinct physiological and radiological features:

| **Phenotype** | **Physiological features** | **Radiological features** | **Prognosis** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) | - Obstructive pattern <br/> - FEV1/FVC < 0.7 <br/> - Air trapping | - Bronchiectasis <br/> - Bronchial wall thickening <br/> - Mosaic attenuation | - Median survival 3–5 years [^113M3FEo] |
| Restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) | - Restrictive pattern <br/> - TLC ≤ 90% of baseline <br/> - Persistent opacities | - Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis <br/> - Subpleural thickening <br/> - Volume loss | - Median survival 6–18 months [^114jyTcb] |

---

## Pathophysiology

CLAD arises from **alloimmune injury** — acute and chronic rejection [^111sppTE] — and is amplified by **chronic antibody-mediated rejection** with donor-specific antibodies (DSA) [^1135zLMu]. Community-acquired respiratory viral infections, including CMV, are key non-alloimmune drivers [^112sSbMW] [^111sppTE], and aspiration further contributes to injury and fibrosis [^115sQGLc].

---

## Risk factors

- **Acute rejection**: Acute cellular rejection (ACR) and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) increase CLAD risk [^114vD153].

- **Donor-specific antibodies (DSA)**: Persistent DSA are strongly associated with CLAD [^1159YDn4].

- **Infections**: Respiratory viral infections, especially CMV, are significant risk factors [^112sSbMW] [^114uPnU4].

- **Primary graft dysfunction (PGD)**: Early graft injury predisposes to CLAD [^112vTdbz].

- **Aspiration**: Gastroesophageal reflux and microaspiration contribute to CLAD [^115sQGLc].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Serial spirometry is essential for detecting and monitoring CLAD [^113eWAqW].

- **Imaging**: High-resolution CT (HRCT) helps differentiate BOS from RAS and identify mixed phenotypes [^116JYZrJ].

- **Bronchoscopy**: Used to exclude infection, acute rejection, and airway complications [^115sQGLc].

- **Biomarkers**: Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is under investigation for early detection [^111ekvTZ].

---

## Management strategies

- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and vaccination are foundational [^116SXR8N].

- **Azithromycin**: Improves FEV1 in BOS with neutrophilic inflammation [^112LTVZr].

- **Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP)**: Considered for progressive BOS [^116UcXjy].

- **Retransplantation**: The only definitive therapy for advanced CLAD [^113WET4x].

---

## Prognosis

CLAD significantly impairs long-term survival [^112DhMHe], with **median survival of 3–5 years for BOS** and 6–18 months for RAS [^114jyTcb]. Retransplantation offers the best outcomes in selected patients [^notfound].

---

CLAD is a **chronic, progressive complication** after lung transplantation, defined by a persistent ≥ 20% FEV1 decline [^111Yeic2], with two main phenotypes (BOS and RAS) and multifactorial pathophysiology. It requires a structured diagnostic approach and supportive management, with retransplantation for advanced disease [^113WET4x].

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part II. complications… [^113qMfar]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Portal Hypertension and Variceal Bleeding Regardless of the etiology of cirrhosis, the development of portal hypertension is nearly universal and results from an increased resistance to portal flow secondary to scarring, narrowing, and compression of the hepatic sinusoids. When the portal pressure exceeds a certain threshold, it results in the development of varices. Approximately 50 percent of patients with cirrhosis develop varices, most commonly in the distal 2 to 5 cm of the esophagus. After the cessation of active variceal hemorrhage, the subsequent six weeks carry a high risk of recurrent hemorrhage. The greatest risk of rebleeding is within the first 48 to 72 hours, with more than 50 percent of episodes occurring within the first 10 days. 30, 31 Fulminant hepatic failure is a rare syndrome that arises from the loss of hepatic parenchymal function accompanied by encephalopathy and coma in patients who have had liver disease for less than eight weeks.

The Child-Turcotte-Pugh scoring classification, originally devised to risk-stratify patients undergoing shunt surgery for portal decompression, is a useful system to assess liver disease severity in patients with established cirrhosis. 32 In a retrospective study involving 92 patients with cirrhosis who underwent abdominal surgery, the mortality rate was 10 percent for patients with CTP grade A disease, 30 percent for those with grade B, and 82 percent for those with grade C. 33 The CTP classification also correlates with the frequency of postoperative complications including renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding, infection, intractable ascites, and worsening liver failure.
32. CONTRAINDICATIONS Absolute contraindications to liver transplantation encompass clinical scenarios in which the expected outcome of transplantation is so poor that the procedure should not be considered.

Examples include multisystem organ failure, extrahepatic or extrabiliary malignancy or infection, advanced cardiac or pulmonary disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and active alcohol or illicit substance abuse. 34 Relative contraindications include comorbidities that have a potential to reduce survival but that allow for the option of transplantation. Examples include renal insufficiency, a primary hepatobiliary malignancy greater than 5 cm, hemochromatosis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, age older than 65 years, poor social support, and the inability to comply with an immunosuppression protocol. 34.

Conclusion

The postoperative course — measured by hospital-LOS and ICU-LOS as well as the incidence of PGD, AMR, ACR, and CLAD — appear to be similar between LTx recipients with a history of bariatric surgery for weight loss and matched controls. Therefore, a history of bariatric surgery should not preclude LTx. However, some trends indicating variations in post-LTx outcomes based on the type of bariatric intervention were observed. Thus, we recommend a multidisciplinary approach both pre- and post-LTx for these patients, involving specialists in bariatric surgery, thoracic surgery, pulmonology, nutrition, and pharmacy to address specific concerns that may arise (i.e. weight control, nutrition and medication absorption, GERD and aspiration, and enteral complications such as delayed gastric emptying). Further research involving larger sample sizes is needed.

### A starting point for the phenotypic classification of pulmonary chronic graft-versus-host disease [^115x1jgQ]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Various biomarkers for cGVHD have been proposed and studied, including donor/recipient gene polymorphisms, immune cell profiles, and secretory cytokines; however, the utility of any biomarker for diagnosing cGVHD earlier than is possible with clinical manifestations or diagnosing organ-specific injury from cGVHD needs to be validated. In the absence of biomarkers, early and accurate diagnosis of cGVHD is a challenge. It is plausible that a valid cGVHD biomarker would help distinguish noninfectious pulmonary complications that are not caused by cGVHD from those that are caused by cGVHD. We concur with Sheshadri et al that there is a dire need for cGVHD biomarkers and that the subject merits rigorous exploration.

Nonetheless, application of the proposed Adapted Criteria requires meticulous attention from multiple disciplines. Recognition of other phenotypes of pcGVHD does not conflict with the research in bronchiolitis obliterans. The recognition of restrictive allograft syndrome as a distinct entity of chronic lung allograft disease (CLAD) in lung transplant recipients has greatly broadened the landscape of CLAD research. Similarly, we hope our research facilitates the recognition of other lung disease phenotypes in cGVHD and improves global pcGVHD research efforts. Furthermore, we anticipate that our research will facilitate crosstalk between those who perform HSCT and lung transplantations to improve the outcomes of transplant recipients in both fields.

### Antibody-mediated rejection of the lung: a consensus report of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^1159YDn4]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes and therapy — Published management data for lung antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) are limited (6 case series and 7 case reports; 1 series outlining an antibody-depletion strategy), and it is difficult to make firm conclusions because regimens are individualized. Reported outcomes include 15 of 21 patients with severe allograft dysfunction due to AMR improving and discharged, whereas 6 died; however, 13 of 14 developed CLAD and 15 of 21 died during follow-up, and two other series reported a 50% to 70% mortality rate after AMR. De novo DSA develop in 25% to 55% of lung transplant recipients and are associated with decreased survival and an increased incidence of BOS, and persistence of DSA or autoantibodies correlates with poor outcomes.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1123tev1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) — pathogenesis and early antecedent events are outlined as follows: The small airways are "characterized by their small diameter (< 2 mm)", and the "presentation of BOS after HCT within the first 2 years after transplant is closely linked to the presence of immune dysregulation due to cGVHD", with a "three-step model: 1) acute inflammation induced by toxic insults, 2) alloreactive lymphocyte dysregulation and chronic inflammation, and 3) abnormal tissue repair and subsequent fibrosis". Evidence directly linking specific immune dysregulation phenomena to BOS remains limited and "murine models of OB… are limited by the lack of true terminal bronchioles… as well as the low penetrance of the disease". Early peri- and posttransplant lung complications include "idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS)", yet "No study to date has shown an association between IPS specifically and post-HCT BOS", and "IPS has a 1-year mortality rate as high as 70%", which can obscure associations. By contrast, in lung transplantation "acute rejection is well documented to increase the risk for subsequent CLAD-BOS". Shared injury pathways include "acute inflammation with release of proinflammatory cytokines (including TNF-α [tumor necrosis factor-α] and IL-1β), epithelial and endothelial injury, and pulmonary recruitment of donor-derived macrophages and donor neutrophils", and epidemiology links "early posttransplant spirometry declines and a history of respiratory illness or lower tract infection" with BOS; unlike lung-transplant rejection surveillance, IPS "is not routinely monitored or uniformly histologically characterized".

### The future of lung transplantation [^116RLbjH]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

The Future of Lung Transplantation — Lung transplant (LTX) practice expanded after the mid-1980s, with nearly 4,000 LTXs performed around the world per year, and survival and wait-list time improving alongside changes in allocation and donor utilization; nonetheless, morbidity and mortality remain high versus other solid organ transplants and the operation remains fraught with mortality risk and much morbidity, largely due to immunosuppression. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) contribute to early and late complications of LTX, respectively, and barriers such as donor shortage mean many candidates cannot survive until a suitable donor becomes available. Future progress is tied to overcoming donor shortage, proper selection of candidates, PGD, and CLAD, with innovation including ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), bioengineered lungs, novel biomarkers, and new ways to treat infected donors.

Lung transplantation — timing, efficacy, and adverse effects — "In lung transplant, mTORi can be used > 3 months post-transplant in combination with reduced CNI, MPA, and corticosteroids to minimize the nephrotoxicity of the CNI", with evidence that "all four RCTs and one single arm study… found improvement in kidney function"; rates of "rejection, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), and death were similar", but "Increased rates of mTORi side effects and pneumonia occur in mTORi arms".

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^111Qegqi]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) — spirometry interpretation, imaging indicators, and staging are outlined as follows: forced vital capacity (FVC) may be falsely reduced from increased residual volume (RV) indicating obstruction, and after bilateral lung transplantation the forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio may remain < 0.7 even with restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), where total lung capacity (TLC) decline may be the only indication for restriction; when bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) evolves to a mixed phenotype, the FEV1/FVC will also remain < 0.7 and persistent chest imaging opacities with a TLC decline of ≥ 10% are suggested as indicators; chest CT may show ground glass, consolidation, small linear and reticular opacities and pleural thickening consistent with pulmonary and/or pleural fibrosis, which is proposed as the probable cause of restrictive physiology rather than airway-based changes; staging will be performed by attributing CLAD stage based on percent FEV1 decline and then specifying phenotype, with examples including CLAD Stage 2 (FEV1 > 50% to ≤ 65%) with BOS and CLAD Stage 1 (FEV1 > 65% to 80%) with RAS defined by TLC decline ≥ 10% and persistent opacities.

CLAD with mixed BOS/RAS features in a 37-year-old female 13 years out from lung transplants for cystic fibrosis. A Frontal chest radiograph 9 months after Covid-19 infection in this patient with persistent dyspnea and ventilatory defect on PFTs shows apical predominant pleural thickening (yellow arrowheads), bronchiectasis (blue arrowheads) and confluent fibrosis (green arrow). B Axial CT image (lung window) at the upper lobes (B) again shows areas of pleural thickening (yellow arrowheads) with subpleural confluent fibrosis (green arrow) and traction bronchiectasis (blue arrowheads). Findings are typical of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis. C Axial static end-expiratory CT image at the level of the lower lobes (lung window) shows lobular air trapping (red arrowheads) with intervening dense normal lung (blue arrowheads), representative of small airways disease and indicative of BOS

BOS is characterized by an obstructive (FEV1/FVC < 0.7) spirometry pattern without restriction. BOS comprises 65–75% of cases of CLAD with an incidence of 8.8% at 1 year and 41.1% at 5 years, with median survival of 3–5 years. CT shows expiratory air trapping, bronchial wall thickening, and bronchiectasis (Fig. 13). Other than to exclude other causes of decline in spirometry, bronchoscopy and histopathology have limited utility in diagnosis. The use of quantitative imaging in combination with a radiologist's qualitative analysis has also been shown to increase diagnostic performance in distinguishing BOS from other entities.

Diagnostic criteria for RAS include a restrictive pattern in spirometry (persistent ≥ 10% decline of TLC from baseline), absence of airflow obstruction, and persistent opacities on imaging. RAS comprises 25–35% of CLAD cases with a median survival of 6–18 months. The incidence of RAS and mixed phenotypes is 14–26%. Both PFT and radiologic abnormalities persist despite treatment. Histopathology reveals either acute inflammation or pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE). Radiologic features of PPFE include apical predominant pleural thickening with subjacent reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion (Fig. 13).

### Antibody-mediated rejection of the lung: a consensus report of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^116KWR5J]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) — diagnostic criteria and evaluation context: Diagnostic criteria for AMR in renal transplantation were proposed in 2003 by the Banff Working Group and included the presence of circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSA), positive C4d peritubular capillary staining and other histopathologic changes, and these criteria have been adopted and modified by the lung transplant community to support a diagnosis of pulmonary AMR. Given the large physiologic reserve of the lung, reliance on graft dysfunction as a prerequisite for pulmonary AMR is likely to under-appreciate sub-clinical AMR that may be a precursor of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), and whether sub-clinical AMR represents a precursor to clinical AMR, and how often, is yet to be demonstrated. Confounding factors such as bronchopulmonary infection also need to be considered, and ultimately, a secure diagnosis of AMR mandates a multidisciplinary approach that integrates the clinical presentation with available immunologic and pathologic diagnostic tools.

### Type-1 immunity and endogenous immune regulators predominate in the airway transcriptome during chronic lung allograft dysfunction [^112hLUJK]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains the major complication limiting long-term survival among lung transplant recipients (LTRs). Limited understanding of CLAD immunopathogenesis and a paucity of biomarkers remain substantial barriers for earlier detection and therapeutic interventions for CLAD. We hypothesized the airway transcriptome would reflect key immunologic changes in disease. We compared airway brush-derived transcriptomic signatures in CLAD (n = 24) versus non-CLAD (n = 21) LTRs. A targeted assessment of the proteome using concomitant bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for 24 cytokines/chemokines and alloimmune T cell responses was performed to validate the airway transcriptome. We observed an airway transcriptomic signature of differential genes expressed (DGEs) in CLAD marked by Type-1 immunity and striking upregulation of two endogenous immune regulators: indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 6B (TNFRSF6B). Advanced CLAD staging was associated with a more intense airway transcriptome signature. In a validation cohort using the identified signature, we found an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 for CLAD LTRs. Targeted proteomic analyses revealed a predominant Type-1 profile with detection of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β as dominant CLAD cytokines, correlating with the airway transcriptome. The airway transcriptome provides novel insights into CLAD immunopathogenesis and biomarkers that may impact diagnosis of CLAD.

Immune dysfunction and cytomegalovirus (CMV) — infection-linked risk for HCT-BOS: immunoglobulin deficiency has been reported as a risk factor, with risk increasing at an IgG threshold of < 350 mg/dl; CMV reactivation increased the risk for subsequent BOS by 70%, and CMV viremia was associated with a 61% increase in the risk of future chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) development; newer CMV prophylaxis agents may significantly mitigate the BOS risk for this specific virus.

### Variability in azithromycin practices among lung transplant providers in the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation community [^1157GPip]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the most important long-term complication after lung transplant (LTx), and clinical experience suggests significant variability in its management. We sought to capture azithromycin practices among LTx providers internationally. A survey was distributed via the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation and completed by 103 respondents (15 countries). Azithromycin indications, timing, and dosing varied significantly, and 37 (36%) reported inconsistency even within their center. Thirty (29%) reported initiating azithromycin prophylactically (during initial transplant hospitalization). Of 73 others, only 10 (14%) reported waiting until CLAD diagnosis (with persistent ≥ 20% pulmonary function decline). Most initiated azithromycin after a CLAD risk-factor and/or event, including 59 (81%) for a persistent ≥ 10% decrement in FEV 1, 32 (44%) for lymphocytic bronchiolitis, and 27 (37%) for bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophilia. Azithromycin prescribing patterns appear to vary significantly, and further study is needed to elucidate the optimal timing and indications for its initiation after LTx.

### Pulmonary graft-versus-host disease and chronic lung allograft dysfunction: two sides of the same coin? [^114t4eeF]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) and lung transplantation are both established life-saving treatment options for carefully selected patients with various haematological disorders or end-stage lung diseases, respectively. However, long-term survival after allogeneic HSCT is severely limited by chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD)-of which pulmonary cGVHD in particular has a very poor prognosis-and long-term survival after lung transplantation is hampered by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Both pulmonary cGVHD and CLAD are characterised by similar underlying immunopathology, which results in transplant-related pulmonary fibrosis and structural lung remodelling, leading to respiratory dysfunction. Accurate clinical identification and appropriate management is of utmost importance to allow for timely diagnosis, to further optimise current preventive and treatment strategies of pulmonary cGVHD and CLAD, and to ameliorate quality of life and long-term outcomes after allogeneic HSCT and lung transplantation. In this Review, we provide a unique state-of-the-art perspective of both entities for respiratory care practitioners.

### Criteria for identifying acute respiratory events based on FEV1 decline in home spirometry for lung transplant patients [^114FE1d3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main results

This study evaluated an algorithm based on FEV1 decline from home spirometry and analysed the association between potential abnormalities detected by the algorithm and clinically assessed acute respiratory events. The comparison between case and control windows revealed a clear association between abnormal FEV1 declines detected by the algorithm and the occurrence of acute respiratory events. When case patients were matched with control patients regarding post-operative follow-up period and procedure type, the odds ratio obtained by conditional logistic regression was 1, indicating no apparent time trend during the study period.

Traditionally, repeated medical test measurements have been used to monitor patient changes during follow-up. In post-lung-transplantation patients, laboratory spirometry is periodically measured to detect CLAD, diagnosed as a decline of more than 20% in FEV1 from the average of the two best values taken at least three weeks apart. CLAD is a chronic allograft dysfunction that is considered irreversible, with no effective treatments. However, acute pulmonary complications, such as graft rejection or infection, could trigger CLAD, making early detection indispensable.

### Graft-versus-host disease may cause pulmonary restriction, but not all restriction is graft-versus-host disease [^115cQ2nG]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Noninfectious pulmonary complications (NIPCs), including BOS, occur in about 20% of HCT recipients and are well known to increase mortality, but these do not necessarily constitute pcGVHD. Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE), a hallmark of RAS, is extremely rare after HCT.PPFE may represent cGVHD, but other NIPCs may not. For example, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, occurring in 1% to 3% of HCT recipients, often occurs before cGVHD manifests and is often unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, occurring in 1% to 2% of HCT recipients, may occur in the absence of cGVHD and is generally responsive to corticosteroid therapy, unlike severe cGVHD syndromes. Histopathologic studies of NIPCs occasionally show nonspecific bronchiolar pathologies, but constrictive bronchiolitis is seen in most patients with RAS. This implies that post-HCT restrictive lung disorders cannot be definitively linked to cGVHD in the same way that RAS is linked to CLAD. Therefore, assuming that post-HCT pulmonary restriction constitutes cGVHD may hinder the understanding of post-HCT BOS by conflating dissimilar disease processes.

A, Thoracosternotomy. B, Bilateral anterior thoracotomies. C, Median sternotomy.

Central Message

Retransplant is the only curative treatment option for end-stage lung disease due to CLAD. A sternal-sparing approach to retransplant can be a safe alternative with significant patient benefit.

It is estimated that 50% of lung transplant recipients will develop chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) to varying degrees and with various phenotypic presentations. After the first year post-transplant, CLAD is the leading cause of death for these patients and may lead to a need for retransplant. A subset of recipients with CLAD will be candidates for retransplant, and although these patients provide a unique challenge for transplant centers, optimal outcomes are achieved when morbidity and mortality are minimized by all available means. Sternal wound complications are particularly devastating in lung transplant recipients, with morbidity reported in 34% of recipients undergoing transverse sternotomy. We describe 2 cases of retransplant with bilateral anterior thoracotomies to prevent sternal complications and optimize recipient outcomes.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^116okVot]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) — definition and phenotypes in lung transplantation (LTx) recipients are outlined as follows: CLAD is defined as the presence of an irreversible or partly reversible (to ≤ 80% of baseline) FEV1 change upon treatment, and the authors acknowledge that the ≥ 20% decline in FEV1 is somewhat arbitrary; the definition will need to be revised if therapies reverse the disease process to within > 80% of baseline. Defining CLAD without pulmonary function testing is difficult; some patients have acute-onset dysfunction but are too sick to have spirometry and the term CLAD should not be employed in these instances, and other patients may show radiologic or pathologic evidence without serial spirometric data, for which more precise definitions are needed. The report has focused on the 3 phenotypes (BOS, RAS, and the mixed phenotype) described to date, and other phenotypes may exist based on different combinations of lung function variables and clinical features.

### Prognosis and risks for probable chronic lung allograft dysfunction: a prospective multicenter study [^111sppTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) hinders lung transplant success. A 2019 consensus refined CLAD diagnosis, introducing probable or definite CLAD based on persistence of lung function decline. Outcomes and risks for probable CLAD remain uncertain. Objectives: We sought to determine the prognosis and clinical risks for probable CLAD in a prospective multicenter cohort. Methods: Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation-20 included 745 CLAD-eligible adult lung recipients at five centers and applied rigorous methods to prospectively adjudicate probable CLAD. The impact of probable CLAD on graft loss was determined using a Cox model that considered CLAD as a time-dependent covariate. Regularized Cox modeling with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty was used to evaluate donor or recipient characteristics and the occurrence and timing of posttransplant events as probable CLAD risks. Similar analyses were performed for definite CLAD. Measurements and Main Results: Probable CLAD occurred in 29.7% of patients at 3 years posttransplant and conferred a marked increase in risk for graft loss (unadjusted hazard ratio = 4.38, P < 0.001). Most patients (80%) with probable CLAD progressed to definite CLAD. Cytomegalovirus infection and, specifically, late presence (> 90 d posttransplant) of donor-specific alloantibodies, acute rejection, acute lung injury, or organizing pneumonia contributed the greatest independent information about probable CLAD risk. Definite CLAD risks were similar. Conclusions: Probable CLAD identifies patients at high risk for graft loss, supporting prospective identification of this condition for early initiation of CLAD-directed interventions. More effective strategies to prevent posttransplant cytomegalovirus, inhibit allospecific immunity, and reduce tissue injury are needed to reduce probable CLAD and improve lung recipient survival.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition and update of restrictive allograft syndrome – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^113q2Zok]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) physiology — total lung capacity (TLC) thresholds and prevalence are characterized as follows: plethysmography in 468 bilateral lung transplant (LTx) recipients found 156 with chronic graft dysfunction, and a threshold decline in TLC to ≤ 90% of the baseline value demonstrated the best operating characteristics for correctly classifying an irreversible loss; Thirty percent of the CLAD cohort had a sustained decline in TLC to ≤ 90% of the baseline TLC. Corroborating evidence includes evaluation of a ≥ 10% TLC decline on survival in 71 lung recipients, including 23 single LTx recipients. Additional data show that among 89 patients with CLAD, 28% developed restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) defined as TLC ≤ 90% of baseline; patients with TLC loss to ≤ 80% had the shortest graft survival, and before CLAD onset, 52 patients (58%) exhibited an FEV1/FVC ratio of < 0.7.

### Pulmonary transplant complications: a radiologic review [^1123CqGD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Retrospective studies report severe presentation and higher mortality rates in transplant recipients with COVID-19 compared to the general population. Radiologic findings are similar whether transplanted lungs are present or not (Fig. 12). Confounding features are possible in patients with SLTs with native lung fibrosis or emphysema. Recent studies with at least 6 month follow up of these patients demonstrated allograft function decline following severe COVID-19 infection. New cases of CLAD including BOS and restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) phenotypes have been reported, with prior studies demonstrating a link between viral pneumonia and CLAD. Long term follow-up should establish whether allograft dysfunction and imaging findings are permanent.

Axial CT image (lung window) shows extensive bilateral patchy as well as confluent ground glass opacities. Covid-19 infection was confirmed with nasopharyngeal swab. The patient required mechanical ventilation

Immunologic

Hyperacute rejection is primarily described in case reports, as most cases are averted through anti-HLA antibody screening and avoidance of organs bearing those specific HLA antigens. It presents intraoperatively or within the first few hours after the vascular anastomosis is created, due to rejection by antibodies reactive to the allograft already in the recipient's circulation. It can present as severe and refractory hypoxemia, with rapid airspace opacification on imaging.

Acute cellular rejection (ACR) most commonly occurs in the early period, radiographically evident by 5–10 days, though still possible weeks to months after transplant. The pathophysiology involves a T-cell mediated immune response by the recipient against donor allograft antigens. 27.3% of transplant recipients had a previously treated episode of acute rejection at one year in the 2019 ISHLT report. 2.7 and 1.9% of all transplant patient deaths at 30 days and 1 year respectively were attributed to acute rejection.

### Radiological findings of complications after lung transplantation [^1159LWV9]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Complications following lung transplantation may impede allograft function and threaten patient survival. The five main complications after lung transplantation are primary graft dysfunction, post-surgical complications, alloimmune responses, infections, and malignancy. Primary graft dysfunction, a transient ischemic/reperfusion injury, appears as a pulmonary edema in almost every patient during the first three days post-surgery. Post-surgical dysfunction could be depicted on computed tomography (CT), such as bronchial anastomosis dehiscence, bronchial stenosis and bronchomalacia, pulmonary artery stenosis, and size mismatch. Alloimmune responses represent acute rejection or chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD has three different forms (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, restrictive allograft syndrome, acute fibrinoid organizing pneumonia) that could be differentiated on CT. Infections are different depending on their time of occurrence. The first post-operative month is mostly associated with bacterial and fungal pathogens. From the second to sixth months, viral pneumonias and fungal and parasitic opportunistic infections are more frequent. Different patterns according to the type of infection exist on CT. Malignancy should be depicted and corresponded principally to post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). In this review, we describe specific CT signs of these five main lung transplantation complications and their time of occurrence to improve diagnosis, follow-up, medical management, and to correlate these findings with pathology results.

Key Points

- The five main complications are primary graft dysfunction, surgical, alloimmune, infectious, and malignancy complications.

- CT identifies anomalies in the setting of unspecific symptoms of lung transplantation complications.

- Knowledge of the specific CT signs can allow a prompt diagnosis.

- CT signs maximize the yield of bronchoscopy, transbronchial biopsy, and bronchoalveolar lavage.

- Radiopathological correlation helps to understand CT signs after lung transplantation complications.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116wwwsB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Insights can be drawn from the understanding of OB of other origins, particularly as a manifestation of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (i.e. CLAD-BOS), the syndromic term for chronic rejection following lung transplant, which shares a histologic similarity and a context of alloimmunity with HCT-BOS. Yet the syndrome manifests differently for HCT recipients, so the clinical approach should reflect the evidence base for the specific medical and biologic context of HCT.

This project was inspired by patients who experience the consequences of delayed diagnosis and our incomplete knowledge. The goal of this research statement is to survey our current understanding of early BOS and to define the research agenda for the early detection of BOS. This document is not intended to provide clinical practice and treatment recommendations. We aimed to identify knowledge gaps, emphasize key scientific research questions, and propose a research road map to address these gaps.

### Description and first insights on a large genomic biobank of lung transplantation [^1132g2Vs]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, GenCOLT stands as one of the most extensive LT DNA cohorts worldwide, encompassing 387 donor-recipient pairs (n = 775 individuals). This comprehensive cohort not only comprises clinical data but also genetic information for both donors and recipients, making it an invaluable resource for investigating the underlying mechanisms of CLAD, as well as other LT outcomes and complications. The genetic profiles of the recipients are likely to significantly impact a wide range of transplantation outcomes, from their susceptibility to experiencing rejection, response to medications (pharmacogenetics), to the development of various medical conditions linked to the prolonged use of immunosuppressive treatments. Furthermore, the genetic makeup of the organ donors may also serve as a predictor for the function of the transplanted organ. Finally, the genetic compatibilities between the donor and recipient could play a crucial role in influencing both the likelihood of rejection and the long-term survival of transplanted organs. The identification of HLA and non- HLA genetic associations within GenCOLT would significantly enhance our understanding of CLAD and other LT outcomes, and may uncover potential therapeutic targets. Moreover, the identification of predictive biomarkers in GenCOLT would help to stratify individual risk at an early stage, before the onset of symptoms, ultimately improving personalized and predictive medicine in the field of lung transplantation. The wealth of information within GenCOLT therefore opens up new avenues for research and has the potential to advance our knowledge and management of lung transplant patients.

### Application of plasma donor-derived cell free DNA for lung allograft rejection diagnosis in lung transplant recipients [^1146CDSB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung transplantation, at present, is the only therapeutic option for patients with end-stage lung or pulmonary vascular disease. Lung transplantation has witnessed dramatic growth worldwide in the recent years; over 4,000 lung transplants are performed annually worldwide. Nonetheless, the survival rate following lung transplantation is the lowest among all solid-organ transplants (11 y for heart and 8.5 y for liver). Lung transplant patients have the shortest survival of any other solid organ transplantation, primarily because of the high incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Other pulmonary complications, such as persistent rejection and severe infection, also increase mortality among lung transplant recipients. However, CLAD remains the main limiting factor for reduced life expectancy after lung transplantation, occurring in approximately 50% of transplant recipients within 5 years of primary lung transplantation. Approximately 27% of recipients experience at least one episode of treated acute cellular rejection (ACR) during the initial year post-lung transplantation. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is also a very severe complication which leads to allograft lung injury and increase patient mortality. AR increases the mortality significantly; moreover, AR is well recognized as a risk factor for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), the major form of CLAD. Increased severity of AR and number of episodes of AR increase the risk of BOS, but also leads to a prior CLAD. CLAD is the leading cause of death for lung transplant recipients (LTRs) after 1-year post-lung transplantation. CLAD represents a progressive and irreversible type of tissue injury that ultimately culminates in allograft failure. Therefore, exact detection of AR and CLAD in the early stage is critical for mitigating lung transplantation mortality.

Currently, pathology from invasive biopsy tissue is the golden standard for diagnosis of AR and CLAD. Among the procedures commonly used to get the lung tissues, trans-bronchial lung biopsies (TBLBs) are the first choice. However, this approach is difficult to practice for most cases in clinical settings. Apart from the potential risks, cost-prohibitive burden, and inconvenience, it is always difficult to get a consent from the patients mainly because it is an invasive procedure; also, physicians may care about minimizing the development of secondary complications in relation to TBLB and may thus be unwilling to perform the procedure. Moreover, biopsies are costly, sampling-error prone, and also have restricted specificity and sensitivity, limited by subjective interpretation. Thus, a non-invasive, relatively objective, and specific biomarker is urgently required for examining AR and CLAD complications.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition and update of restrictive allograft syndrome – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^113eWAqW]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and restrictive allograft syndrome — early monitoring and historical observations emphasize spirometry-based assessment and restrictive phenotypes in heart–lung transplant (HLTx) cohorts. Serial pulmonary function testing (PFT) has been the primary method to quantify allograft performance, and spirometric indices have been the standard benchmark to detect the emergence of CLAD. Early HLTx reports described 14 long-term survivors with 5 developing airflow limitation, and 3 of those developing a superimposed progressive restrictive ventilatory defect. Histopathology from HLTx recipients, based on analysis of 2 open lung biopsies, 2 autopsies, and 1 explant, showed extensive bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with interstitial and pleural fibrosis and both arterial and venous vasculopathy, and BO was opined to be a significant complication of HLTx. In 1988, Glanville et al examined 12 HLTx patients with a non-progressive restrictive ventilatory defect and concluded that a stable restrictive defect post-HLTx was determined primarily by chest wall mechanics, with patients with progressive restrictive physiology not examined.

### 2018 ATS BEAR cage winning proposal: cell-free DNA to improve lung transplant outcomes [^116FvBYh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The first lung transplantation in 1963 brought hope to patients with end-stage lung disease. In the two decades that followed, short-term survival remained dismal, primarily because of early surgical complications such as anastomosis dehiscence and early post-transplant allograft rejection. With advances in surgical techniques and new immunosuppression regimens, 1-year survival improved to greater than 90%. Unfortunately, long-term survival still remains low, with only 50% of patients surviving 5–6 years after transplant. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), an umbrella term used to describe recognized phenotypes of chronic lung rejection, is a leading contributor to poor long-term survival. With no available therapies for CLAD, current management strategies are focused on early detection and treatment of CLAD risk factors, which include primary graft dysfunction, acute cellular rejection (ACR), antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and community-acquired respiratory viral infections. The introduction of genomic, proteomic, and other "omic" approaches have reenergized a new wave of innovative research that promises to improve long-term outcomes via early detection of CLAD and its risk factors. One such innovative project focused on assessing the benefit of early detection and treatment of AMR by means of a noninvasive genomic technology — donor-derived cell-free DNA (%ddcfDNA; Figure 1) — and received the 2018 American Thoracic Society (ATS) Building Education to Advance Research (BEAR) Cage Innovation Award.

### The search for peripheral tolerance in lung transplantation [^114vD153]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Median survival after lung transplantation is 5.7years, which lags behind other solid organ transplants, such as heart, liver, and kidney. The major barrier to long-term survival in lung transplant recipients is chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). This review discusses the challenge of CLAD as a barrier to tolerance and identifies key areas in the field that require further development.

Recent Findings

CLAD is a heterogenous disease in its kinetics of onset and severity and remains a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, based on a decline in allograft function. While acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection are major risk-factors for CLAD, other barriers to long-term allograft acceptance are aspiration and primary graft dysfunction. However infections, particularly respiratory viral infections and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remain the most significant risks for CLAD. Additionally, the lung transplant field is limited by a lack of molecular diagnostic assays for CLAD. Further, new targets are needed for precision immunosuppression, and more studies are needed to develop novel interventions to extend allograft acceptance.

Summary

This review discusses new lines of study to address important unmet needs necessary to extend lung allograft acceptance. Other studies, such as tandem lung transplant and bone marrow transplant in select patients with primary immunodeficiency may provide additional lessons on how to potentially establish tolerance. However, tolerance in lung transplant is extremely rare, and further studies are needed to pursue this ultimate goal.

### The ABC of transplant: ALAD, BLAD, and CLAD: definition and significance [^111zujbs]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is a recognized complication after lung transplantation, with a clear definition, although some pitfalls in phenotyping still exist. Recently, new terminologies, such as acute lung allograft dysfunction (ALAD) and baseline lung allograft dysfunction (BLAD) were introduced, but their definitions and real significance are not yet fully established.

Recent Findings

Based on the existing literature and ongoing discussions within two expert groups of the Advanced Lung Failure & Transplantation Interdisciplinary Network (ALFTx IDN) of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), we will describe current definitions, prevalence and outcome of these rather new entities, keeping in mind that a lot of uncertainties still exist.

Summary

ALAD and BLAD will be defined, and the currently accepted outcome of these conditions will be summarized. Existing pitfalls in the phenotyping of CLAD will also be discussed.

### The ISHLT chronic lung allograft dysfunction consensus criteria are applicable to pulmonary chronic graft-versus-host disease [^115dQAcJ]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) that affects 30% to 70% of long-term survivors and indicates poor quality of life and increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Pulmonary manifestations are one of the most difficult to treat conditions in cGVHD. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), characterized by small airway inflammation and fibrotic obliteration, has been definitively linked to cGVHD. The current diagnostic criteria for BOS, as established by the 2014 National Institutes of Health (NIH) cGVHD consensus criteria, require a new-onset irreversible obstructive ventilatory defect on pulmonary function testing (PFT) after HCT with a forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) < 75% of predicted normal values and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.7, with or without evidence of air-trapping on expiratory thoracic computer tomography (CT), and absence of other causes of pulmonary dysfunction.BOS occurs in 3.4% to 10% of HCT recipients and implicates a 2-year and 5-year NRM rate of approximately 50% and 80%, respectively. The NIH criteria do not include nonobstructive phenotypes of pulmonary cGVHD (PcGVHD). However, restrictive pulmonary disease after HCT has been described, and the incidence of severe restrictive ventilatory defects (vital capacity < 60%) beyond 100 days after transplant is around 3%. The clinical characteristics and associations of the nonobstructive pulmonary complications with HCT outcomes are not well elucidated.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), an irreversible and progressive form of allograft failure in lung transplantation, manifests as a sustained decline in FEV1 by at least 20% from the subject's best PFTs. Based the on 2019 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) CLAD Consensus Report, the definition of CLAD and CLAD phenotypes, including BOS, restrictive allograft syndrome, mixed obstruction/restriction, and undefined, have been standardized, providing a framework for clinical practice and research (Table 1).CLAD and PcGVHD share similar immune-mediated pathophysiologic mechanisms. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ISHLT consensus definition for CLAD could be adapted to identify and characterize non-obstructive phenotypes of PcGVHD.

### The promise of machine learning applications in solid organ transplantation [^116XKwvt]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

ML and lung transplant complications

Among lung transplant recipients, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) affects more than 50% in the first 5 years post-transplant, and negatively impacts long-term survival. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is an obstructive form of CLAD due to chronic immune-mediated rejection. BOS can lead to decreased airflow represented by reduced forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1). Early diagnoses can pave the way for future research in interventions. To this end, an SVM to analyze quantitative CT imaging data from 71 patients was investigated as a diagnostic tool for early CLAD detection. Using quantitative CT scan at first post-transplant visit, SVM algorithm was able to identify those recipients who are at higher risk of developing BOS in near future while pulmonary function tests did not show any significant changes in early stages. The model resulted in an 85% accuracy rate using three features from patient images. SVM model identified smaller lobar and airways volumes, smaller airways surfaces, and higher airways resistance as predictive factors for BOS at early quantitative CT scan. Earlier identification of these patients can guide clinicians with appropriate management to avoid further progression of this pathology.

Strengths and weaknesses of machine-learning algorithms in post-transplant settings

For post-transplant complications, ML techniques such as SVMs, Random Forests and ANNs have the ability to model evolving and heterogeneous patient-level data over time, identify predictors of poor outcomes, and inform care. Uses of ML in predicting post-transplant complications have numerous applications including decision-support systems and even the development of data-driven assessments. CART and LASSO regression models can guide post-transplant patient management by providing clinicians with transparent algorithms that can be easily understood and explained from a clinical perspective. Moreover, recent research also strives to make ML models more interpretable in terms of identifying features playing a key role during the prediction tasks. Some recent methods including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as used for evaluating feature importance and explain the predictions made by ML algorithms toward post-LT AKI, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) used to assess relative impact of key predictors in post-transplant patient survival, and integrated gradients used to identify important predictors in diagnosing allograft rejection, make ML models more explainable. However, further validation of their results using multicenter prospectively collected data is important before wider application of these algorithms in daily clinical practice.

### "Probable chronic lung allograft dysfunction" is definitely good enough [^114uPnU4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Another provocative finding of the present study is that cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNAemia (defined as any quantifiable amount of CMV DNA on PCR) at any time after transplantation is associated with the subsequent development of probable or definite CLAD. Although CMV pneumonitis has previously been associated with CLAD development, the association of any CMV DNAemia with CLAD has not previously been reported and will likely be of marked interest for lung transplantation teams. Clinical practices regarding CMV prophylaxis and, especially, how to manage asymptomatic patients with low degrees of CMV DNAemia vary among centers and providers. Before the field can coalesce around a strategy to manage these patients, further work is needed to understand whether CMV DNAemia leads directly to allograft injury and/or dysfunction or whether the allograft risk is related to the reductions in immunosuppression or augmentation in antiviral therapies that will inevitably be more common in these patients.

In summary, in this issue of the Journal, Todd and colleagues have clarified the importance of the clinical entity of probable CLAD, both as it related to its high likelihood of progressing to definitive CLAD and the overall risk for allograft failure, and provide insight into how the timing of ACR/LB events affect the risk for CLAD development. It is not merely an exercise in taxonomy or an argument of lumping versus splitting of terminology. These findings will be of relevance to patients and clinicians alike and will be particularly crucial to designing future interventional trials to improve outcomes among patients who develop CLAD.

### Therapeutic choices and disease activity after 2 years of treatment with cladribine: an Italian multicenter study (cladStop) [^115cY8cq]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Evidence from these real‐world data suggests predictors for starting a new treatment after 2 years of cladribine treatment and confirms the efficacy of cladribine on disease activity and on disability worsening (with a consistent reduction on ARR and an improvement on the EDSS).

The incidence of AEs was relatively low, with no treatment‐related serious AEs reported. However, the retrospective design of this study together with the selection of a limited Italian–Swiss cohort of patients could bias these results, and further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow‐up would be useful to validate these findings.

### Validation of a post-transplant chronic lung allograft dysfunction classification system [^1113swo6]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term survival after lung transplantation (LTx) is hampered by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Our study evaluated the prevalence and prognostic importance of obstructive and restrictive CLAD phenotypes, with or without an identifiable underlying cause, to validate the recently proposed classification system for CLAD.

Methods

Data for patients who underwent LTx between 2004 and 2015 with a minimal survival of 180 days post-LTx were retrospectively collected. Double LTx patients with CLAD (defined as a persistent forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline of ≥ 20% compared with baseline) were subsequently classified according to obstructive (forced expiratory volume in 1 second /forced vital capacity [FVC] < 70%, total lung capacity > 90%, and FVC > 80%) or restrictive (total lung capacity ≤ 90% or FVC ≤ 80%) pulmonary function and to the presence of an unknown (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [BOS]/restrictive allograft syndrome [RAS]) or known (non-BOS/non-RAS) underlying cause.

Results

After a median of 3.2 years, CLAD developed in 39% of double LTx patients (n = 219), of which 20% (n = 43) had an identifiable cause. Survival was worse in patients with restrictive CLAD (26%) compared with obstructive CLAD (64%; p < 0.0001). Non-BOS patients suffered from inferior survival compared with BOS patients (p = 0.0016), whereas there was no significant difference in survival between RAS and non-RAS (p = 0.17). Patients who evolved from an obstructive (BOS) to a restrictive (RAS) phenotype (10%) experienced better survival than RAS patients and a worse outcome compared with BOS patients (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Given the differences in outcome, accurate diagnosis of CLAD phenotypes is important, because this helps to inform patients about their prognosis, to reveal underlying pathogenesis, to identify homogenous patient populations for clinical trials, and to guide future therapeutic approaches.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^115iwcyF]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy — diagnostic role and cytology associations: Transbronchial biopsy and BAL "should be performed at the start of the diagnostic process" to evaluate unexplained decline before definitive CLAD, but "once the diagnosis of CLAD has been established, these investigations have little role in follow-up", and "there are no specific features that can be obtained from BAL, biopsy, or serum that are useful to phenotype CLAD"; rather, cytologic and microbiologic BAL assessments "should be obtained". Histopathologic evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans on biopsy "is relatively uncommon". BAL cytology neutrophilia "(> 15%)" or eosinophilia "(≥ 2%)" "have been associated with the development of CLAD", and in the absence of infection or colonization, "persistent early BAL neutrophilia may signal the onset of BOS". BAL eosinophilia correlating with blood eosinophilia and raised C-reactive protein "has been associated with the development of BOS", and "peripheral blood eosinophilia is also associated with poor graft survival after the diagnosis of RAS". BAL should also be assessed for aspiration indicators including "multinucleated giant cells", "foreign organic material", lipid on "oil red-O or Sudan black" stain, or "bile acids", and detection of lymphocytic bronchiolitis after CLAD diagnosis "is a poor prognostic indicator associated with decreased survival and the development of RAS and BOS".

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) — historical BOS definitions and key spirometric thresholds are detailed, noting that lung transplantation (LTx) has a current median post-transplant survival of 6.0 years and that allograft failure accounts for > 40% of deaths beyond the first year post-LTx. In 1993 bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) was introduced as the key manifestation of lung allograft dysfunction and was identified as a persistent decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥ 20%, compared with a reference FEV1 defined as the mean of the 2 best post-operative FEV1 measurements taken at least 3 weeks apart after exclusion of other known pulmonary and extrapulmonary causes of FEV1 decline. A later revision incorporated "BOS 0-p", characterized by a 10% to 20% drop in FEV1, signifying potential BOS, with the intent to trigger early investigations and therapy with the hope of preventing further allograft dysfunction.

### Oral complications of cancer therapies-NCI… [^111tjQyS]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

The most common oral complications from cancer treatment include the following:

- Oral mucositis.
- Infection.
- Salivary gland problems.
- Change in taste.
- Pain. These complications can lead to other problems such as dehydration and malnutrition. Complications caused by either chemotherapy or radiation therapy The most common oral complications may be caused by either chemotherapy or radiation therapy. These include the following:

- Inflamed mucous membranes in the mouth.
- Infections in the mouth or that travel through the bloodstream. These can reach and affect cells all over the body.
- Taste changes.
- Dry mouth.
- Pain.
- Changes in dental growth and development in children.
- Malnutrition caused by being unable to eat.
- Dehydration caused by being unable to drink.
- Tooth decay and gum disease.

Oral complications may be caused by the treatment itself or by side effects of the treatment. Radiation therapy can directly damage oral tissue, salivary glands, and bone. Areas treated may scar or waste away. Total-body radiation can cause permanent damage to the salivary glands. This can change the way foods taste and cause dry mouth. Complications may be acute or chronic. Acute complications are ones that occur during treatment and then go away. Chemotherapy usually causes acute complications that heal after treatment ends. Chronic complications are ones that continue or appear months to years after treatment ends. Radiation can cause acute complications but may also cause permanent tissue damage that puts you at a lifelong risk of oral complications. The following chronic complications may continue after radiation therapy to the head or neck has ended:

A preventive oral health exam will check for the following:

- Mouth sores or infections.
- Tooth decay.
- Gum disease.
- Dentures that do not fit well.
- Problems moving the jaw.
- Problems with the salivary glands.
- Pain during swallowing and being unable to swallow are common in cancer patients before, during, and after treatment.
- Trouble swallowing increases the risk of other complications.
- Whether radiation therapy will affect swallowing depends on several factors.
- Swallowing problems sometimes go away after treatment
- Swallowing problems are managed by a team of experts.
- Tissue and Bone Loss.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^112gqA7F]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Non-CLAD causes of pulmonary function decline — In lung transplant recipients with non-CLAD contributors to lung function loss, the baseline FEV1 should be reset when the underlying non-CLAD condition (Table 1, section A conditions only) has been stable for at least 6 months, and in this 6-month period, the mean of 2 best FEV1 measurements, taken at least 3 weeks apart, will be the new reference baseline FEV1. Trend review is important because when graphed over time, a step change in slope is suggestive of the development of CLAD. Confounders include weight-related restriction, as the body habitus of the patient may change with increasing weight, leading to a restrictive pulmonary function (without any opacities on CXR/CT scan), and donor–recipient factors; consideration should also be given to the donor-recipient predicted sizes, and lungs from older smoking donors may also display some emphysematous changes, which will likely be reflected on the best FEV1 achieved post-LTx. In these scenarios, a stable baseline is usually achieved within 3 to 6 months (rarely several years) of transplant, which can then be used to compute reference values and track CLAD development.

### Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in the treatment of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD): a prospective, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trialing the addition of ECP to standard care in the treatment of bilateral lung transplant patients with CLAD (E-CLAD UK) [^112QBup8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Trial objectives

E-CLAD UK is a prospective, 2-arm, randomised, open-label clinical trial. The primary objective is to establish whether the addition of immunomodulation via ECP to standard care is more efficacious at stabilising lung function in lung transplant recipients with CLAD compared with standard care alone. Secondary objectives are to determine how the different treatment strategies affect other outcomes including rate of decline in lung allograft function, exercise capacity, disease severity, health-related quality of life, survival and treatment safety over the 24-week trial period. It is designed to collect evidence on the efficacy and safety of ECP for CLAD necessary to inform decisions by clinicians, patients and healthcare commissioners globally regarding its place in the management of lung transplant recipients.

### Graft-versus-host disease may cause pulmonary restriction, but not all restriction is graft-versus-host disease [^116euKSA]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Pang et alsuggest that the 2019 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria to diagnose chronic lung allograft disease (CLAD)could be adapted to pulmonary chronic graft-versus-host disease (pcGVHD) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Their work shows the deleterious impact of pulmonary impairment on mortality, whether it is due to airflow obstruction or to restriction. However, the implications of considering any noninfectious pulmonary function impairment to represent pcGVHD may unintentionally impede our efforts to better understand bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), the predominant form of pcGVHD.

First, we interrogated the underlying assumption that CLAD and pcGVHD are similar enough that we can broadly adapt the same criteria to these disparate populations. BOS is well-known to be the primary manifestation of CLAD after lung transplantation, whereas restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) occurs in 30% of patients with CLAD and was formally recognized as a CLAD subtype in 2014 ISHLT guidelines.RAS is fundamentally different from BOS beyond patterns of pulmonary impairment. First, RAS typically manifests earlier and tends to be inexorably progressive, whereas BOS after lung transplantation often exhibits periods of transient stability. Second, RAS is typically associated with higher mortality than BOS. Finally, the main radiologic and histologic patterns in RAS are parenchymal and pleural fibrosis, usually with constrictive bronchiolitis, whereas BOS is characterized by constrictive bronchiolitis without parenchymal or pleural fibrosis.

### Health-related quality of life after pediatric lung transplantation [^113DEiiX]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

We assessed three determinants that might influence HRQOL after pediatric lung transplantation, including age at assessment, age at transplantation, time after transplantation and CLAD. In our study population encompassing a wide age range cohort, self‐reported HRQOL post‐lung‐transplant did not differ between children, adolescents and adults.

Notably, we did find a significant association between the age at lung transplantation and HRQOL (both EuroQoL‐Score and VAS score), with patients transplanted below the age of 8 years reporting a less favorable HRQOL than patients transplanted in older years. Only literature from other solid organ recipients is available, not finding an association between age at transplantation and quality of life. While our study does not give reasons for a worse HRQOL in patients transplanted in younger age, we can only speculate that the lower results might be due to a more severe and rapid disease course before transplantation and subsequently increased co‐morbidities and impaired development.

CLAD represents the most important marker of transplant function and health status post‐lung transplantation. Indeed, our patients with CLAD rated their health status significantly worse than patients with a preserved graft function. This was the case in any of the assessed parameters of the EuroQol questionnaire as well as for the employment and education rates, suggesting effects also on social function by occurrence of CLAD.

While we do not have information on the influence of other post‐transplant complications on HRQOL, it seems likely that CLAD, as the major cause of morbidity and mortality after the first months of transplantation with limited treatment options, has particular importance in limiting HRQOL after lung transplantation.

The occurrence of CLAD increases continuously over time after transplantation as do many other post‐transplant complications, consequently, our results show a significant decline of the VAS score over time after transplantation. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that across all categories and even years after the procedure, the values remain higher as compared to the pre‐transplantation group.

### "Probable chronic lung allograft dysfunction" is definitely good enough [^112T7pPT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the four decades since lung transplantation emerged as a viable therapeutic and life-prolonging option for patients with end-stage lung disease, the field has seen remarkable advances in patient selection, organ preservation, perioperative management, and immunosuppressive regimens. Although the specter of chronic rejection and allograft failure after lung transplantation continues to loom large, our understanding of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) has similarly evolved, as we have now moved beyond conceiving of this process as simply alloimmune-mediated bronchiolitis obliterans to appreciating that there is a wide range of risk factors and clinical presentations that constitute CLAD. In this issue of the Journal, Todd and colleagues (pp.) develop our conception of CLAD further still.

The current consensus guidelines on CLAD were updated in 2019 to reflect the increasing recognition that CLAD presents as diverse clinical phenotypes, as well as to resolve the conundrum of how to classify the subset of patients who had a decline in their lung function for at least three weeks (i.e. had met criteria for CLAD diagnosis) but who subsequently experienced recovery in their lung function after starting azithromycin or other treatments. Thus, the current definition of CLAD is an irreversible decline in lung function to less than 80% of a patient's best post-transplantation lung function (which is confirmed after 3 mo), with patients meeting the prior definition of CLAD (i.e. a decline to less than 80% of their post-transplantation baseline of at least three weeks) reclassified as having only have "probable" CLAD.

### Lung transplant outcomes are influenced by severity of neutropenia and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment [^116Sqkc9]. American Journal of Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Although neutropenia is a common complication after lung transplant, its relationship with recipient outcomes remains understudied. We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 228 adult lung transplant recipients between 2008 and 2013 to assess the association of neutropenia and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) treatment with outcomes. Neutropenia was categorized as mild (absolute neutrophil count 1000–1499), moderate (500–999), or severe (< 500) and as a time-varying continuous variable. Associations with survival, acute rejection, and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) were assessed with the use of Cox proportional hazards regression. GCSF therapy impact on survival, CLAD, and acute rejection development was analyzed by propensity score matching. Of 228 patients, 101 (42.1%) developed neutropenia. Recipients with severe neutropenia had higher mortality rates than those of recipients with no (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–8.41, P = 0.040), mild (aHR 14.508, 95% CI 1.58–13.34, P = 0.018), or moderate (aHR 3.27, 95% CI 0.89–12.01, P = 0.074) neutropenia. Surprisingly, GCSF treatment was associated with a higher risk for CLAD in mildly neutropenic patients (aHR 3.49, 95% CI 0.93–13.04, P = 0.063), although it did decrease death risk in severely neutropenic patients (aHR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07–0.88, P = 0.031). Taken together, our data point to an important relationship between neutropenia severity and GCSF treatment in lung transplant outcomes.

### Early chest CT abnormalities to predict the subsequent occurrence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction [^117No5DK]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung transplantation (LTx) is a recognized treatment option for selected patients with end-stage chronic respiratory disease. Since the beginning, there has been a significant and steady increase in lung transplant activity, and post-transplant survival outcomes have improved. However, medium- and long-term survival remains limited by the occurrence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). First described only as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), an obstructive syndrome, chronic rejection now comprises two phenotypes with different functional and evolutionary profiles. BOS is now distinguished from restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) with a restrictive functional profile. A third mixed phenotype was recently described, defined as a restrictive physiology with persistent CT opacities after initial BOS. According to the latest published report, the prevalence of BOS is estimated to reach nearly 47% of 5-year survivors and is the leading cause of mortality at 3 years post-transplantation.

### Radiological findings of complications after lung transplantation [^1136Lbq2]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Complications following lung transplantation may impede allograft function and threaten patient survival. The five main complications after lung transplantation are primary graft dysfunction, post-surgical complications, alloimmune responses, infections, and malignancy. Primary graft dysfunction, a transient ischemic/reperfusion injury, appears as a pulmonary edema in almost every patient during the first three days post-surgery. Post-surgical dysfunction could be depicted on computed tomography (CT), such as bronchial anastomosis dehiscence, bronchial stenosis and bronchomalacia, pulmonary artery stenosis, and size mismatch. Alloimmune responses represent acute rejection or chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD has three different forms (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, restrictive allograft syndrome, acute fibrinoid organizing pneumonia) that could be differentiated on CT. Infections are different depending on their time of occurrence. The first post-operative month is mostly associated with bacterial and fungal pathogens. From the second to sixth months, viral pneumonias and fungal and parasitic opportunistic infections are more frequent. Different patterns according to the type of infection exist on CT. Malignancy should be depicted and corresponded principally to post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). In this review, we describe specific CT signs of these five main lung transplantation complications and their time of occurrence to improve diagnosis, follow-up, medical management, and to correlate these findings with pathology results. KEY POINTS:
- The five main complications are primary graft dysfunction, surgical, alloimmune, infectious, and malignancy complications.
- CT identifies anomalies in the setting of unspecific symptoms of lung transplantation complications.
- Knowledge of the specific CT signs can allow a prompt diagnosis.
- CT signs maximize the yield of bronchoscopy, transbronchial biopsy, and bronchoalveolar lavage.
- Radiopathological correlation helps to understand CT signs after lung transplantation complications.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^116JYZrJ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) flowchart — diagnostic thresholds, staging, and onset definition: Lung allograft dysfunction is triggered by " ≥ 10% decline in FEV1 ± FVC from baseline", prompting clinicians to "Perform Investigations" and evaluate "Non CLAD causes" including "acute infection, acute cellular rejection, acute antibody mediated rejection, main airway stenosis, extra-pulmonary factors". If there is "Normalisation or stabilization FEV1 ± FVC > 80% of baseline", CLAD is not established; otherwise classification by time applies: "Possible CLAD: < 3 weeks ≥ 20% decline in FEV1 ± FVC", "Probable CLAD: > 3 weeks–3 months ≥ 20% decline in FEV1 ± FVC Assign provisional CLAD phenotype", and "Definite CLAD: > 3 months ≥ 20% decline in FEV1 ± FVC", with confirmation to "Confirm definite CLAD Phenotype, based on Spirometry, TLC and CT chest appearance". Phenotyping may be BOS, RAS, mixed, or undefined, and "The date of onset of CLAD is defined as the date at which the first value of FEV1 ± FVC ≤ 80% of baseline was recorded, provided subsequent values remain at ≤ 80% of baseline".

Restrictive CLAD diagnostic testing — Given "the uncertainty inherent in relying solely on spirometry to diagnose a restrictive ventilatory defect, we strongly recommend measuring TLC by body plethysmography to confirm a suspected diagnosis in all cases unless specific contraindications exist". For baseline assessment, "obtaining a baseline TLC at 3 and 6 months post-transplant in addition to a high-resolution CT (HRCT) at 6 months will provide a clinically useful baseline". In restriction, "FEV1/FVC ratio per definition increases to > 0.7… but such changes are difficult to interpret in some situations".

### The ISHLT chronic lung allograft dysfunction consensus criteria are applicable to pulmonary chronic graft-versus-host disease [^114Fmh3f]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary chronic graft-versus-host disease (PcGVHD) is a devastating complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). The 2014 National Institutes of Health cGVHD consensus criteria (NIH criteria) only captures bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). In this study, we adapted the 2019 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) to define novel phenotypes of PcGVHD and compared the performance of this criteria with the NIH criteria to identify patients with high-risk PcGVHD. We reviewed consecutive patients in a cGVHD natural history protocol (#NCT00092235) and adapted the 2019 CLAD criteria (the adapted criteria) to define PcGVHD as post-HCT forced expiratory volume at 1 second < 80% predicted value, with 4 phenotypes: obstructive, restrictive, mixed obstructive/restrictive, and undefined. An independent adjudication committee evaluated subjects for diagnosis and phenotyping. We identified 166 (47.4%) patients who met the adapted criteria, including obstruction (n = 12, 3.4%), restriction (n = 67, 19.1%), mixed obstruction/restriction (n = 47, 13.4%), and undefined (n = 40, 11.4%). In these patients, less than half (n = 78) met the NIH criteria for BOS (NIH+); the rest (n = 88) did not (NIH-). The NIH- subjects showed increased risk of death compared with those without PcGVHD (hazard ratio = 1.88, 95% confidence interval = 1.20–2.95; p = 0.006) that was similar to NIH+ subjects (P = 0.678). Our study demonstrated the potential of the adapted criteria in identifying patients with high-risk PcGVHD that have been missed by the NIH criteria. The adapted criteria could become a valuable tool to better phenotype and study lung disease in cGVHD.

### Tacrolimus versus cyclosporine immunosuppression in lung transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pQRnE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our review's strengths include the use of duplicate screening and data extraction, the use of the most updated GRADE guidance, assessed by methodologists with significant experience in assessing interventional studies. This is critical for any meta-analysis, as poor application of methods from the statistical analysis to quality assessment can obfuscate the interpretation of the evidence for clinicians and patient partners. Furthermore, our review was done in pairs and in duplicate, reducing the risk of errors when screening and collecting data. Lastly, there was very little heterogeneity across the trials included, with some exception regarding the definition of CLAD vs BOS.

There are also notable limitations. First, all trials included in the analysis did not address the question of multi-organ transplantation. Although the literature suggests tacrolimus is more effective than cyclosporine in other solid organ transplantation as well, we cannot assume this would translate to similar benefit in the multi-organ setting.

Second, although we judged the lack of blinding to be unlikely to affect the outcome of the trials, it is possible that the lack of blinding has inflated the overall benefit of tacrolimus compared with cyclosporine due to unmeasured or unconsidered confounders.

Third, we pooled the results of trials that reported on both BOS and CLAD. It should be noted that the definition of CLAD encompasses BOS. Since 2012, these terms have essentially become equivalent. Because of this, we chose not to downgrade the evidence for indirectness. This is because BOS accounts for approximately 60–75% of all CLAD cases, making it a significant component when comparing the effects of tacrolimus and cyclosporine on CLAD.

Fourth, included trials used mycophenolate-based background immunosuppression, and there was variability in the use of induction agent (see Table S3). It is unknown whether different background therapy would result in differences in efficacy. Furthermore, the follow-up duration of the included trials, which ranged from 1.39 to 3 years. This timeframe may be insufficient to fully capture long-term adverse effects associated with immunosuppression, particularly the development of CLAD. Given that CLAD often manifests beyond this follow-up window, the observed differences between tacrolimus and cyclosporine might not reflect the true long-term outcomes. Lastly, subgroup analysis was limited by the reported data, and important subgroup effects based on aetiology of transplant and double vs single lung transplant are uncertain.

### International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus statement for the standardization of bronchoalveolar lavage in lung transplantation [^112LX7jd]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric indications and contraindications for BAL after lung transplantation (LTx) — of the 8 pediatric LTx centers surveyed, 100% of centers reported performing surveillance bronchoscopies with BAL, and diagnostic bronchoscopy is universally performed when clinical evidence suggests a deterioration in allograft health from infection, AR, AMR, or CLAD. At programs where infants undergo LTx there are no age or size limitations. Our group's consensus is that contraindications for BAL collection include conditions where a risk-benefit ratio is not favorable for pediatric LTx recipients. The collection of BAL fluid is indicated in pediatric LTx recipients of all ages undergoing surveillance and diagnostic bronchoscopy for assessment of the allograft for infection and/or rejection, and the potential complications associated with this procedure have to be evaluated carefully and taken into consideration.

### Outcome and prognostic factors after lung transplantation for bronchiectasis other than cystic fibrosis [^115tWW9w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, our study must be interpreted with caution and a number of limitations should be considered. First, we have insufficient sample size for further analysis. In order to seek the risk factors for outcomes, there were variables that needed to be included for the analysis, such as bronchiectasis, pre-transplant Pseudomonas colonization and chronic sinusitis, with which multivariate analysis should be performed. Due to shortage of the bronchiectasis patients (n = 13), the multivariate cox hazard model showed a wide confidence interval (Additional file 1: Supplemental data) and was not worth documenting. Despite the univariate analysis that lacks adjustments for comparisons or power for multivariate analysis, comparable survival rates and a high rate of pre- and post-transplant Pseudomonas colonization in bronchiectasis were evident from our study. A multicenter study including a large number of patients with bronchiectasis for analysis would be beneficial in seeing the outcome calculated on the basis of a multivariate analysis. Second, we were unable to analyze whether the post-transplant Pseudomonas led to the CLAD onset, or vice versa. An etiology between post-transplant Pseudomonas colonization and CLAD development is a chicken-or-egg problem and remains unexplored, yet colonized Pseudomonas was partially or somewhat considerably associated with developing or worsening CLAD. To understand whether the duration of one variable is a risk factor for another variable is complicated when it may occur at some time after LTX. Apart from causality that has never been proven through observational studies, the recent study from clinical practice demonstrated Pseudomonas eradication after LTx improved CLAD-free and graft survival and maintained pulmonary function. This kind of intervention is a means to prove its complicated relationship and a feasible approach to seek how best we could provide better outcome among individuals with bronchiectasis after LTX. In addition to those above analyses, it would be intriguing to see whether pre- and post-transplant Pseudomonas are the same strains by genotyping and how multi-drug resistant strains affect the outcome. Finally, additional analysis in the details of post-transplant complications will be needed for a better understanding those populations. CLAD was determined in 4 LTX recipients with bronchiectasis other than CF in the study period, of which 2 cases were obstructive and the others restrictive in CLAD phenotype. It cannot be conclusive from such a small number of CLAD cases whether they tended to show which phenotype of allograft loss. On the other hand, a recent study demonstrated bronchiectasis rather than CF had higher rate of CLAD with infectious features than other diseases. Given higher prevalence of chronic sinusitis and chances of Pseudomonas colonization, infectious exacerbations could be more commonly seen in LTX recipients with bronchiectasis other than CF. As the lack of those data in our study, the next challenge is to investigate the post-transplant complications in those individuals in a large-scale analysis.

### Radiological findings of complications after lung transplantation [^116Qyu33]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

CLAD

The prevalence of CLAD 5 years after transplantation is 40–50% of patients. CLAD has two distinct phenotypes: obstructive, namely, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive, namely, restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS). CT scans along with lung functions may help in distinguishing between subtypes.

BOS is a constrictive bronchiolitis. CT signs of BOS are bronchiectasis, bronchial thickening, and air-trapping on expiratory acquisition (Figs. 10 and 11).

Conversely, RAS is a pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis on histopathology, with a more fibrotic pattern on CT and poorer survival. CT signs of RAS are peripheral consolidations or central or peripheral ground-glass opacities, septal or non-septal lines, subpleural thickening, bronchiectasis, architectural distortion, and volume loss with an upper lobe predominance (Fig. 12).

### The future of lung transplantation [^113bLFoF]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

The future of lung transplantation — chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) prevention and monitoring — highlights current strategies and biomarker directions, noting that "quantitative BAL research has helped to illicit some of the biomarkers and cell lines upregulated within the subtypes of CLAD; however, the underlying mechanisms and therapies remain elusive". It states, "Most strategies currently aim at the prevention of gastroesophageal reflux disease and use of azithromycin, whereas other treatments have had small or no impact". It also notes that "severe PGD is associated with later graft dysfunction such as CLAD" and that "there is hope for expanded use of donor-derived cell-free DNA as a biomarker for the identification of acute and chronic rejection", with the rationale that "With early identification, adaptation of immunosuppressive drugs can be used, thereby curbing graft dysfunction and lending to a reduction in the incidence of CLAD".

### The diagnosis and management of chronic lung allograft dysfunction [^113PgimB]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains a life-threatening complication following lung transplantation. Different CLAD phenotypes have recently been defined, based on the combination of pulmonary function testing and chest computed tomography (CT) scanning and spurred renewed interests in differential diagnosis, risk factors and management of CLAD.

Recent Findings

Given their crucial importance in the differential diagnosis, we will discuss the latest development in assessing the pulmonary function and chest CT scan, but also their limitations in proper CLAD phenotyping, especially with regards to patients with baseline allograft dysfunction. Since no definitive treatment exists, it remains important to timely identify clinical risk factors, but also to assess the presence of specific patterns or biomarkers in tissue or in broncho alveolar lavage in relation to CLAD (phenotypes). We will provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in risk factors and biomarker research in CLAD. Lastly, we will also review novel preventive and curative treatment strategies for CLAD.

Summary

Although this knowledge has significantly advanced the field of lung transplantation, more research is warranted because CLAD remains a life-threatening complication for all lung transplant recipients.

Key research areas and future priorities for restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) within chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) emphasize two initiatives: "Determine exact prevalence, specific risk factors, mechanisms, prognostic variables, and clinical outcomes for RAS and whether they differ from risk factors for BOS", and "Explore proteomic, immunologic, genetic, and epigenetic profiles among patients with each CLAD phenotype to elucidate common or divergent biologic mechanisms. This may provide a rationale for phenotype-specific therapies".

### "Probable chronic lung allograft dysfunction" is definitely good enough [^113kppg4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Using data from CTOT-20, a large multicenter prospective clinical study, Todd and colleagues demonstrate that a large majority (80.1%) of patients who meet criteria for probable CLAD subsequently directly progress to meet criteria for definite CLAD. This finding has important implications for clinical practice and clinical trial design. First, this observation argues in favor of prompt clinical investigation and treatment for potential contributing factors and/or alternative etiologies of lung function decline as near as possible to the time of initial lung function loss, rather than waiting to initiate such workups and treatments until CLAD would be considered definite. Second, these data strongly support enrolling patients with probable CLAD in clinical trials evaluating interventions aimed at ameliorating the lung function decline and/or improving allograft survival after CLAD onset. Although lung function trajectories after CLAD onset are highly variable, even within CLAD phenotypes, it is not uncommon for patients to stabilize their lung function shortly after meeting diagnostic criteria for CLAD. Given this natural history, requiring patients to have definite CLAD before enrolling in a clinical trial may inadvertently result in missing the critical window in which patients have a biologically active process that is responsive to a therapy. We anticipate that future consensus statements pertaining to clinical trial design and endpoints for patients with CLAD will similarly identify the importance of enrolling patients as near as possible to their initial lung function decline.

The authors further show that the timing of many of the recognized risk factors for CLAD development ought to influence how patients and clinicians conceptualize the relative risk of these events. Specifically, they found that the development of acute cellular rejection (ACR), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB), and either acute lung injury (ALI) or organizing pneumonia (OP) on transbronchial biopsies more than three months after lung transplantation were predictive of probable CLAD, whereas these entities in the first three months after transplant did not convey a significant risk for CLAD. Although ACR and LB are previously described risk factors for CLAD, the present study should reassure patients and clinicians, who frequently observe ACR and LB in the early post-transplantation period. ALI and OP have been observed in histopathological specimens at the time of CLAD onset, but this study is the first to identify these before CLAD onset as being independent risk factors for CLAD. Further research is needed to clarify how late-onset ACR, LB, OP, and ALI subsequently progress to CLAD (or resolve) and whether patients with these risk factors might benefit from interventions to reduce their CLAD risk.

### When tissue is the issue: a histological review of chronic lung allograft dysfunction [^111vGwSA]. American Journal of Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Although chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains the major life-limiting factor following lung transplantation, much of its pathophysiology remains unknown. The discovery that CLAD can manifest both clinically and morphologically in vastly different ways led to the definition of distinct subtypes of CLAD. In this review, recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the different phenotypes of CLAD will be discussed with a particular focus on tissue-based and molecular studies. An overview of the current knowledge on the mechanisms of the airway-centered bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, as well as the airway and alveolar injuries in the restrictive allograft syndrome and also the vascular compartment in chronic antibody-mediated rejection is provided. Specific attention is also given to morphological and molecular markers for early CLAD diagnosis or histological changes associated with subsequent CLAD development. Evidence for a possible overlap between different forms of CLAD is presented and discussed. In the end, "tissue remains the (main) issue", as we are still limited in our knowledge about the actual triggers and specific mechanisms of all late forms of posttransplant graft failure, a shortcoming that needs to be addressed in order to further improve the outcome of lung transplant recipients.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^115SWnTR]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) — definition and baseline computation specify that CLAD is a substantial and persistent decline (≥ 20%) in measured FEV1 from the reference baseline; the baseline is the mean of the 2 best post-operative FEV1 measurements taken ≥ 3 weeks apart, and CLAD can present with predominantly obstructive, restrictive, or mixed obstructive–restrictive ventilatory patterns not explained by other conditions.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^112XWiBe]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) phenotypes — obstructive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) — are defined using spirometry, lung volumes, and imaging. Obstruction is defined by "a fall in FEV1 ≥ 20% (compared with baseline)… without persistent radiologic pulmonary opacities". "Up to 30% of patients with CLAD develop a restrictive defect". RAS "is defined physiologically by: (1) a persistent ≥ 20% decline in FEV1 (± FVC)… (2) a decrease in total lung capacity (TLC) to ≤ 90% compared with baseline; and (3) the presence of persistent opacities on chest imaging (chest X-ray [CXR] and/or computed tomography [CT])". Additionally, "Restriction should be diagnosed by a ≥ 10% decline in TLC relative to baseline".

### Antibody-mediated rejection of the lung: a consensus report of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^1135zLMu]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2016). Medium credibility.

AMR research priorities summary — validation of the consensus definition is critical with understanding of potential confounding by other conditions; studies should analyze the timing of testing for AMR and timing of AMR detection after transplantation to provide insights into phenotypes such as hyperacute AMR, acute AMR, chronic AMR and acute-on-chronic AMR; criteria should be developed to define AMR resolution, recurrence and persistence; immunotherapeutic trials should consider routine surveillance for AMR and incorporate AMR events into outcome assessments, perhaps including freedom from AMR as part of a composite outcome; chronic AMR requires additional study and development of a definition; and further studies should assess associations between antibody types and different CLAD phenotypes.

Comparison to patients undergoing DLTx for CLAD

The observations that antibody-mediated rejection was less frequent, and infection was more frequent or severe, suggested a higher degree of immunosuppression in patients with allo-HSCT compared to propensity-matched LTx controls. Since patients requiring a re-transplant (re-LTx) for CLAD have a history of chronic immunosuppression, we elected to compare outcomes of patients undergoing a first re-LTx (DLTx only; n = 70; Additional file 1: Table S4) to that of the allo-HSCT cohort, within the same study period. Biopsy proven ACR (TBBx > A1B0) was identified in 10% of the re-LTx cohort, compared to 21.1% in the allo-HSCT cohort (p = 0.239). Overall post-LTx graft survival was similar (Fig. 4; p = 0.805) between cohorts, but there was a time-dependent mortality risk that differed between each cohort. The CLAD cohort had a higher risk of death during the early post-LTx phase (100% vs. 78.6% 1-year survival; p = 0.034). However, in patients surviving 1-year post-LTx, the allo-HSCT cohort experienced a hazard ratio of 1.99 for death (95% CI 0.79–5.01; p = 0.145) and 1.59 for infection-related death (95% CI 0.43–5.95; p = 0.489).

### Impact of CLAD phenotype on survival after lung retransplantation: a multicenter study [^116xqLkM]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains a major problem after lung transplantation with no definitive treatment except redo lung transplantation (re-LTx) in selected candidates. However, CLAD is not a homogeneous entity and different phenotypes exist. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of CLAD phenotypes on survival after re-LTx for CLAD. Patients who underwent re-LTx for respiratory failure secondary to CLAD in four LTx centers between 2003 and 2013 were included in this retrospective analysis. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive CLAD (rCLAD) were distinguished using pulmonary function, radiology and explant lung histopathology. Patient variables pre- and post-re-LTx were collected and analyzed. A total of 143 patients underwent re-LTx for CLAD resulting in 94 BOS (66%) and 49 rCLAD (34%) patients. Unadjusted and adjusted survival after re-LTx for rCLAD was worse compared to BOS (HR = 2.60, 1.59–4.24; p < 0.0001 and HR = 2.61, 1.51–4.51; p = 0.0006, respectively). Patients waiting at home prior to re-LTx experienced better survival compared to hospitalized patients (HR 0.40; 0.23–0.72; p = 0.0022). Patients with rCLAD redeveloped CLAD earlier and were more likely to redevelop rCLAD. Survival after re-LTx for rCLAD is worse compared to BOS. Consequently, re-LTx for rCLAD should be critically discussed, particularly when additional peri-operative risk factors are present.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^111Yeic2]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) definition and onset — The CLAD definition is based on a sustained ≥ 20% drop in FEV1 compared with baseline, and this consensus report states that CLAD onset occurs at the time of measurement of the first decline in FEV1 ≥ 20% from baseline. This differs from prior approaches that excluded initial FEV1 ≤ 80% of baseline if associated with rejection or infection and are considered too subjective and dependent on surveillance test frequency. For irreversible conditions not directly related to allograft complications, a diagnosis of CLAD should be based on the new FEV1 baseline value, whereas the baseline should not be reset after conditions that are known risk factors for CLAD such as acute cellular or antibody-mediated rejection and infection. For pulmonary function testing (PFT), "We recommend PFT values used for assessment should be consistently obtained at a single, accredited PFT laboratory", and home spirometry devices may provide more variable results as they are not calibrated on a routine basis.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^1178qVhn]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction — future directions and research priorities are stated explicitly: Future research and discussions regarding CLAD diagnosis should focus on better characterization of other (undefined) phenotypes of CLAD, better definition of post-transplant predicted lung function values, use of other pulmonary function tests to characterize CLAD subtypes such as forced expiratory flow and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), quantitative assessment of chest CT opacities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allowing serial assessments of ventilation and opacities without radiation exposure and contrast media, and better descriptions of CLAD-like entities that do not fit the definition including failure to achieve adequate lung function, allograft dysfunction in the absence of PFT data, and overlap processes. The path toward these goals can be summarized in the following 3 categories: improving graft surveillance for early detection of CLAD by combining spirometric and/or volumetric trajectories with quantitative radiographic and biologic measures; moving from physiologic phenotyping to biologic endotyping with biomarkers such as BAL proteins and RNA transcripts, lung tissue RNA transcripts, and allograft-derived cell analyses, noting there are no biomarkers that specifically identify any single CLAD phenotype; and tailoring of therapeutic modalities, as more effective personalized immunomodulatory therapies as well as anti-fibrotic approaches are greatly needed in LTx, with clear definitions of CLAD phenotypes helping harmonize patient recruitment for multicenter studies.

### Clozapine (clozaril) and risk of serious bowel problems… [^115EMm2u]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug Safety Communications 01–28–2020 FDA Drug Safety Communication The Food and Drug Administration is strengthening an existing warning that constipation caused by the schizophrenia medicine clozapine can, uncommonly, progress to serious bowel complications. This can lead to hospitalization or even death if constipation is not diagnosed and treated quickly. Constipation is a frequent and known side effect of clozapine, but serious and fatal events continue to be reported. We reviewed the period from 2006 to 2016 and identified 10 cases describing constipation that progressed to serious bowel problems resulting in hospitalization, surgery, or death. These included death of the colon wall, blockage of blood flow to the intestines, death of part of the intestine, and abdominal distention leading to bowel obstruction.

This number includes only cases submitted to FDA* or those found in the medical literature, so there may be additional cases about which we are unaware.
- FDA is strengthening an existing warning that constipation caused by the schizophrenia medicine clozapine can progress to serious bowel problems. This can lead to hospitalization or even death if constipation is not diagnosed and treated quickly.
- Constipation is a frequent and known side effect of clozapine, but serious bowel problems continue to be reported, although they are uncommon.
- Clozapine impairs bowel function in the majority of patients. It produces effects ranging from constipation to complete bowel obstruction, paralytic ileus and intestinal ischemia or infarction. Constipation is a frequent and known side effect of clozapine, but serious and fatal events continue to be reported.

FDA identified 10 cases of constipation that progressed to serious complications with clozapine use reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database from July 21, 2006, through July 20, 2016, and in the medical literature from July 21, 2006, through August 2, 2016. These cases resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and five deaths. Adverse events included necrotizing colitis.

### Effect of targeted coagulopathy management and 5% albumin as volume replacement therapy during lung transplantation on allograft function: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112vTdbz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung transplantation (LuTx) remains the ultimate treatment for end-stage lung disease refractory to optimized medical therapy. Post-implantation, long-term outcomes are impaired by ongoing medical factors including chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD (and its phenotypes) represents a major complication that limits the 5-year survival to approximately 55%. CLAD develops as a result of various alloimmune-dependent and alloimmune-independent graft injuries and dysregulated repair processes. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) has been identified as an important risk factor for CLAD development.

PGD is defined by the presence of diffuse pulmonary opacities on thoracic imaging and various levels of hypoxemia without other identifiable causes developing in the first 72 h after lung allograft reperfusion. Its clinical course in the most severe form resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is considered to be one of the most important causes of early death after transplantation, with an incidence of PGD reported between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, patients who develop PGD also show significantly worse long-term outcomes. Although the pathophysiology of PGD is not completely understood and multifactorial, several intraoperative anesthetic risk factors have been described within the literature. For instance, intraoperative administration of blood products is associated with a strong negative influence on PGD development and outcome in lung transplant recipients. Moreover, a large volume of intraoperative fluids and red blood cells (RBCs) significantly correlates with the development of PGD grade 3. Therefore, the limitation of intraoperative fluid and blood product administration may reduce the risk for the development of PGD grade 3 and thus improve early postoperative morbidity and mortality after LuTx.

### High-resolution CT findings of obstructive and restrictive phenotypes of chronic lung allograft dysfunction: more than just bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [^112DHsZi]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the high-resolution CT characteristics of individual obstructive and restrictive chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) phenotypes to aid in making accurate diagnoses and guiding treatment.

Conclusion

Long-term survival and function after lung transplant are considerably worse compared with after other organ transplants. CLAD is implicated as a major limiting factor for long-term graft viability. Historically thought to be a single entity, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, CLAD is actually a heterogeneous group of disorders with distinct subtypes.

### Double lung, unlike single lung transplantation might provide a protective effect on mortality and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [^1121kvWa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains the major barrier to long-term success after lung transplantation. The primary cause of death after LTx is CLAD. The development of CLAD is rare in the first year after LTx, but the rate increases quickly with cumulative incidence reported to be as high as 40% to 80% within the first five years. CLAD that manifests early after transplantation reportedly shows a poorer prognosis than late-onset CLAD. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is the pathologic pattern of injury most commonly seen in lung transplant recipients with progressive loss of lung function. It is believed to be due to chronic allograft rejection and is characterized by the obliteration of small airways by fibromyxoid granulation tissue. Distribution is patchy and difficult to detect with transbronchial biopsy. Because BO is difficult to document histologically, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) in 1993 established criteria for its physiologic counterpart, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). This diagnosis requires a permanent 20% drop in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) not attributable to a concurrent process. Since 2014 the diagnosis for chronic rejection was further broadened to CLAD, which includes restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS). CLAD can also be diagnosed by CT scan with visual signs of small airway disease and lung biopsies with severe narrowing or complete obstruction of the small airways.

In Sweden two centers perform lung transplantation for a population of about 10 million, all of whom are covered by national health insurance. Skåne University Hospital is one of these centers. This retrospective report reviews the 25-year experience of Skåne University Hospital, Lund University Lung Transplant Program with particular emphasis on chronic rejection between different subgroups of recipients and type of transplant procedure performed. Because of the retrospective nature of this study, chronic rejection is referred to as BOS rather than the recently termed CLAD.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^112mKXLB]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) case illustrations — Figure 2 shows: A) Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decreased from 2.92 liters to 1.88 liters and was labeled CLAD Stage 2 with BOS (FEV1 decline to 64% of baseline); azithromycin led to FEV1 normalization within 2 months, and later a mixed phenotype emerged with TLC decline 12% and persistent opacities. B) After late biopsy-proven acute rejection, obstructive spirometry was diagnosed as CLAD Stage 3 with BOS; after extracorporeal photopheresis, FEV1 rose from 2.12 liters to 2.72 liters and remained around 2.35 liters, showing partial reversibility of +27% while remaining CLAD Stage 2 BOS. C) Following bilateral transplantation, best post-operative FEV1 was 3.9 liters (100% predicted) and current FEV1 is 3.1 liters (98% predicted); despite the decline this is not considered CLAD. D) Weight gain of 25 kg over 5 years coincided with 20% decreases in FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC), initially considered CLAD Stage 1 with TLC decline 11% but without CT opacities; after gastric bypass with 30 kg weight loss, pulmonary function normalized and the CLAD score was restored to 0.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^116UcXjy]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) possible future treatments — A European multicenter, randomized, controlled Phase 3 trial with pirfenidone in BOS (NCT02262299) is currently ongoing (enrolling until mid-2019), and another study on the role of ECP for the management of progressive BOS (NCT02181257) is currently active. Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy, shown to be safe and feasible, is under investigation as a treatment for CLAD, and is currently being investigated in an Australian Phase 2, multicenter, randomized study (NCT02709343). A retrospective analysis suggested increased BOS-free survival when using normothermic ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) compared with contemporaneous cold preservation, while long-term clinical results from a randomized EVLP trial (INSPIRE) are pending. Pre-emptive circulating antibody-directed treatment may mitigate later CLAD associated with human leukocyte antigen donor-specific antibodies, but placebo-controlled trials are needed to determine efficacy. Other non-medicated interventions, such as supplemental oxygen or supervised pulmonary rehabilitation, may reduce CLAD-associated complaints or complications, and mobile health interventions may also be associated with reduced risk of BOS.

### The future of lung transplantation [^112DhMHe]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Addressing CLAD — The syndrome of CLAD limits outcomes after LTX, limiting the 5-year survival to approximately 55%, and as many as one-half of all patients can be shown to have CLAD at the 5-year mark after LTX; it remains the primary cause of death after the third year; CLAD is an all-encompassing term for chronic graft dysfunction after LTX, inclusive of BOS, and is defined as "a persistent (at least 3 weeks), often unexplained decline in pulmonary function (FEV1, with or without FVC) ≥ 10% from baseline (baseline defined as the average of the 2 best post-transplant values for FEV1, and FVC obtained at least 3 weeks apart)", and therefore, a decrease in spirometry should prompt an investigation into other underlying treatable etiologies.

### Lung retransplantation for chronic rejection: a single-center experience [^111eYqHK]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is nonreversible and remains the biggest obstacle to long-term survival after lung transplantation (LTx). Retransplantation is the sole definitive therapeutic option for CLAD. We analyzed our single-center experience with retransplantation as a treatment option for CLAD.

Methods

From March 1, 2010, to May 31, 2016, 419 consecutive patients underwent LTx at our institution; 29 of these procedures were retransplantations for CLAD. We analyzed demographic characteristics, lung allocation score, operation type, length of stay, and perioperative outcomes. Actuarial survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.

Results

In total, 29 of 419 patients (6.9%) underwent retransplantation for CLAD. Median time from primary LTx to retransplantation was 1,163 days (range: 304 to 3,971 days). Patients undergoing retransplantation were younger and had higher lung allocation scores than primary transplantation patients. Most LTx procedures were bilateral (93% of retransplantations, 95% of primary LTx). Rates of cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for severe primary graft dysfunction, and re-exploration for bleeding were higher in retransplantation patients (p = 0.010, p = 0.019, and p = 0.029, respectively). One- and 5-year survival rates in the retransplantation group were similar to those of the primary LTx group (89.2% and 64.3% versus 89.7% and 58.2%, respectively; p = 0.79).

Conclusions

Lung retransplantation is a viable treatment option for CLAD after LTx. In this study, retransplantation patients were younger, had higher lung allocation scores, and were more likely to require cardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support than primary LTx patients. Postoperative length of stay and short- and mid-term survival were comparable with those of primary LTx patients.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^112LTVZr]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) treatment options and adjuncts: "There are few treatment options for CLAD" with mostly BOS data and "limited efficacy", and "retransplantation may be the only therapeutic option for advanced CLAD" though it is associated with "lower peak lung function" and "higher post-operative mortality". In CLAD (BOS), "sustained administration of high-dose corticosteroids should be avoided", while options include cyclosporine-to-tacrolimus conversion, "a trial of azithromycin for ≥ 8 weeks", and fundoplication for documented reflux. For RAS, "there are no formal treatment guidelines" and management is "relatively experimental", with no clinical studies demonstrating efficacy, though small reports describe off-label pirfenidone, nintedanib, or alemtuzumab. In BOS, "total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) or extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP)" are therapeutic options; TLI may benefit "rapid decliners" defined by "an FEV1 decline > 100 ml/month" pre-treatment, whereas ECP effects are mostly seen in slowly progressive FEV1 decline with increased BAL neutrophilia and is "less likely" to help rapidly declining BOS without significant BAL neutrophilia or "patients with RAS". Adding azithromycin has shown improvement and even normalization of FEV1 in non-controlled studies, corroborated by a "placebo-controlled, randomized trial", where a "treatment delay of several months" did not impair FEV1 improvement; add-on montelukast has "been suggested" to have benefit in small studies, although "controversy of its effects remains".

### Prevalence and mechanisms of small intestinal obstruction following laparoscopic abdominal surgery… [^114p2Q9J]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Intestinal obstruction following laparoscopic abdominal surgery can occur irrespective of the type of operation; the prevalence is as high as or even higher than that seen in open procedures. Compared with the open surgery series of Stewart et al, 14 the prevalence of intestinal obstruction in our series was significantly higher in infracolonic procedures, especially in transperitoneal hernia repair. As summarized in Table 3, 50% of obstructions were due to adhesions or bands while 46% were due to intestinal incarceration, accounting for 23 cases, all involving the small intestine. The last patient who initially underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was reoperated on 72 hours later for cecal volvulus due to unrecognized intestinal malrotation.

Intestinal obstruction occurred at the trocar site in 54% of cases and in the operative field in 42% of cases. The postoperative course was uneventful in 21 cases. Three patients had complications; 1 had a large mural intestinal hematoma following reoperation for intestinal incarceration at the umbilical trocar site after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 1 had acute pancreatitis after reoperation for adhesions at the umbilical site following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 1 had acute postoperative duodenal ulcer bleeding following reoperation for intestinal incarceration behind the mesh in an inguinal hernia repair. None of these patients required another operation and there were no deaths. As after laparotomy, 12, 32 the small intestines were involved in the majority of obstructions complicating laparoscopic abdominal surgery.

However, colonic herniation, as well as incarceration or herniation of the greater omentum through trocar ports, 11 has been reported after gynecologic laparoscopic procedures.
24. In 1 of our patients, a cecal loop volvulated 72 hours after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This complication has already been reported after laparoscopy, 33 and may be due to excessive slackness of the malrotated cecum after withdrawal of the pneumoperitoneum. 34 As complete inspection of the abdomen is thought to be less satisfactory under laparoscopy, 35 the right colon was not seen to be abnormally mobile during the primary operation.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^115KVJA4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired respiratory viral infection (RVI) is a well-established risk factor for CLAD-BOS in lung transplantation. In HCT recipients, RVIs have long been associated with poor outcomes in HCT recipients and are presumed to be a major risk factor for BOS. However, to date, only two single-center retrospective studies have been conducted in adults to demonstrate RVI as a risk factor for posttransplant airflow decline. In a pediatric HCT cohort, RVI early after transplant was associated with early acute respiratory failure (i.e. IPS) as well as BOS. Although this association has most commonly been attributed to parainfluenza or respiratory syncytial virus lower tract infection, it is probable that most RVIs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), contribute to BOS development, although the risk for progressive airway injury may vary. An area of uncertainty is the duration of the "risk window" for BOS after any RVI, given that RVIs can cause transient lung impairment, but most RVIs will not lead to BOS. In studies of CLAD, the magnitude of the association between RVI and CLAD decreases as the length of time between these events increases.

RVI likely represent an additional injury superimposed upon background airway inflammation, a phenomenon that is evident in asthma and other airway diseases. In HCT-BOS, it is possible that RVIs serve as antigenic stimuli for alloimmune attack, as well as causing direct epithelial airway injury. In the setting of subclinical antecedent lung injury (e.g. early after transplant), RVI (and possibly bacterial infections) may further perturb an abnormal bronchial epithelial milieu and induce further inflammation and metaplasia in a way that is self-propagating, as has been described in COPD, but direct mechanistic studies are lacking. Resolution of inflammation and injury following RVI may be crucial to prevent the development of airway remodeling that eventually leads to BOS.

Lower respiratory tract infection in the first 100 days after transplant is a described risk factor for the development of BOS. To date, no specific bacterial or fungal organism has been linked as a trigger for BOS, but lower tract bacterial infection is common in patients with established BOS and associated with progression of FEV 1 decline. There is a high prevalence of occult infection in the BAL fluid of patients with BOS enrolled in clinical trials, but it is unclear whether these infections represent culprits or bystanders in BOS development.

### Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in the treatment of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD): a prospective, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trialing the addition of ECP to standard care in the treatment of bilateral lung transplant patients with CLAD (E-CLAD UK) [^116SXR8N]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Methods and analysis

Trial methods and analysis are reported as per Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials reporting guidelines

Trial setting

The trial will be performed in a tertiary care setting involving all five of the designated adult lung transplant centres in the UK (The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Brompton & Harefield Hospitals and Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust). This will allow all adult UK bilateral lung transplant recipients who develop CLAD to learn about the trial and decide if they wish to participate. Two of the centres (Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust) do not have their own ECP centre and so will be supported by other organisations (Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and NHS Blood and Transplant, respectively) to provide the study intervention.

Eligibility

The target population for E-CLAD UK is patients aged 16 and over who have received a bilateral (a.k.a. single sequential) lung or heart and (bilateral) lung transplantation that fulfil the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2019 diagnostic criteria for CLAD. The specific eligibility criteria are detailed in box 1.

Box 1
Eligibility criteria for the E-CLAD UK trial

Intervention

Standard of Care

The standard management of lung transplant recipients both before and after the development of CLAD may vary between centres. However, the underlying principles are well aligned in terms of the approach to maintenance immunosuppression regimen (cell cycle inhibitor, calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids) and prophylaxis against common viral, bacterial and fungal infections with attention to blood pressure control, lipid profiles, preservation of renal function and bone protection. Acute cellular rejection of ISHLT grade A2 or higher is treated with short-term augmentation of corticosteroids in all centres.

The diagnostic approach to new-onset CLAD is also well aligned with the 2019 ISHLT criteriawith a diagnosis made only after a failed response to a trial of azithromycin therapy and exclusion of reversible causes such as cellular or humeral rejection, large airway anastomotic obstruction and infection.

All five centres participating in this trial have agreed clear principles for the SOC for CLAD treatment. The basis remains supportive with supplementary oxygen for hypoxia, prevention and treatment of infective exacerbations, physical rehabilitation and psychosocial support. Participants in the trial will not be treated with any immunomodulatory interventions such as total lymphoid irradiation or ECP as part of the SOC arm. This will be the approach in both arms of the study, with use of ECP in the treatment arm the only difference.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition, diagnostic criteria, and approaches to treatment – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^116wyy2v]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) — diagnostic thresholds and categories indicate that a ≥ 20% fall from baseline FEV1 qualifies for "possible" CLAD, most centers trigger investigations at a ≥ 10% threshold for "potential" CLAD, and prompt investigations should be performed to exclude treatable causes; if impairment persists on a second test at least 3 weeks after the first ≥ 20% fall and after adequate treatment of secondary causes, a diagnosis of "probable" CLAD can be made; CLAD is "confirmed" if an FEV1 decline of ≥ 20% persists for 3 months after the first value; the onset date is when the first FEV1 ≤ 80% of baseline is recorded, and if lung function returns to > 80% of baseline after therapy, the diagnosis is not sustained; it is now advised to start investigations whenever the FEV1 declines by ≥ 10% from baseline.

Tools for diagnosis of CLAD phenotype and suggested follow-up — Patients with a first drop in FEV1 of ≥ 10% should be investigated thoroughly and reassessed within 4 to 6 weeks, especially if a new treatment has been initiated. Spirometry (performed according to ATS/ERS standards) should be assessed at every clinic visit, and if bronchodilator response is performed, post-bronchodilator FEV1 values should be used to exclude other (reversible) etiologies for obstruction. In stable CLAD patients with stable FEV1 or a very slow decline in FEV1 (so-called plateau phase), it is advised to have lung function measured at least every 3 or 4 months, and home spirometry is a useful technique to detect early changes in graft function and to determine when to intervene. We recommend measuring TLC in LTx patients at 3 and 6 months after transplant and annually thereafter, and TLC measurements should also be obtained if FEV1 changes ≥ 10% from previous values; the "gold standard" technique to assess TLC is body plethysmography. Imaging guidance includes that the initial CT scans (inspiratory with a breath hold with 3-mm sections, and expiratory sections as well) without contrast medium are recommended in all LTx patients at 6-month follow-up, and repeat CT studies should be obtained when CLAD is initially diagnosed to better visualize air trapping and various subtle opacities.

### Extreme elevations of donor-derived cell-free DNA increases the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction and death, even without clinical manifestations of disease [^111ekvTZ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung transplant recipients are traditionally monitored with pulmonary function testing (PFT) and lung biopsy to detect post-transplant complications and guide treatment. Plasma donor-derived cell free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is a novel molecular approach of assessing allograft injury, including subclinical allograft dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine if episodes of extreme molecular injury (EMI) in lung transplant recipients increases the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) or death.

Methods

This multicenter prospective cohort study included 238 lung transplant recipients. Serial plasma samples were collected for dd-cfDNA measurement by shotgun sequencing. EMI was defined as a dd-cfDNA above the third quartile of levels observed for acute rejection (dd-cfDNA level of ≥ 5% occurring after 45 days post-transplant). EMI was categorized as Secondary if associated with co-existing acute rejection, infection or PFT decline; or Primary if not associated with these conditions.

Results

EMI developed in 16% of patients at a median 343.5 (IQR: 177.3–535.5) days post-transplant. Over 50% of EMI episodes were classified as Primary. EMI was associated with an increased risk of severe CLAD or death (HR: 2.78, 95% CI: 1.26–6.22, p = 0.012). The risk remained consistent for the Primary EMI subgroup (HR: 2.34, 95% CI 1.18–4.85, p = 0.015). Time to first EMI episode was a significant predictor of the likelihood of developing CLAD or death (AUC = 0.856, 95% CI = 0.805–0.908, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Episodes of EMI in lung transplant recipients are often isolated and may not be detectable with traditional clinical monitoring approaches. EMI is associated with an increased risk of severe CLAD or death, independent of concomitant transplant complications.

### Blood MMP-9 measured at 2 years after lung transplantation as a prognostic biomarker of chronic lung allograft dysfunction [^1175PYFS]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we report a potential prognostic value of MMP-9 plasma concentrations at 2 years post-transplantation for CLAD diagnosis. In a smaller set of patients, our team, with a different methodology in which the reference time point was CLAD diagnosis, found increased levels of plasma MMP-9 1 year before CLAD diagnosis compared to the levels in recipients without CLAD. It was, however, essential to validate the prognostic potential of blood MMP-9 in a setting that could enable risk stratification and thus therapeutic intervention. To this aim, we chose two posttransplantation time points, Y1 and Y2, that have clinical relevance because they are sufficiently distant from the lung transplantation surgery, early infection and immune complications that could strongly interfere with inflammatory or wound-healing-related biomarkers but also early enough regarding the CLAD onset time to allow early intervention in the lung transplant population.

### Chronic lung allograft dysfunction: definition and update of restrictive allograft syndrome – A consensus report from the pulmonary council of the ISHLT [^113Dd6CH]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) — research and trial design priorities emphasize the following actions: design future prospective, multicenter, collaborative studies utilizing existing LTx tissue/BAL banks; examine preventive strategies by focusing on known risk factors; design interventional trials to reduce the risk of DSA such as real-time donor/recipient epitope matching; explore utility of anti-fibrotic therapy after pro-fibrotic events such as severe AR, AMR, or viral pneumonia; use the new definitions of RAS and CLAD phenotypes as per the current RAS and related CLAD consensus definition documents in the design of therapeutic CLAD clinical trials with incorporation of the CLAD staging criteria; design randomized, non-inferiority clinical trials and analyze outcomes, stratified by CLAD phenotype given the worse survival of RAS; consider reanalyzing previously published LTx studies using the new definitions, thereby generating novel strategies to test prospectively; determine how best to diagnose RAS after single LTx; and design therapeutic trials based on the CLAD phenotypes to improve outcomes of patients with RAS, including the role of retransplantation. The report additionally states that RAS has protean manifestations, uncertain pathogenetic mechanisms, and almost a universally poor prognosis, that the entity is relatively new so recommendations regarding therapy must perforce be cautious until deeper understanding is achieved, and that when read with the CLAD consensus report this work aims to provide a roadmap toward reducing rates of lung allograft failure.

### Lung transplantation for late-onset non-infectious chronic pulmonary complications of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant [^111LDajJ]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In attempting to explain the increased infection related mortality seen in this study, we hypothesize that acquired immunodeficiencies related to allo-HSCT alter the risk profile of these patients. We further hypothesize that the persistence of these acquired immunodeficiencies is the result of impaired or delayed immune reconstitution following allo-HSCT. Whilst functional innate immunity is generally thought to recover within a few months of allo-HSCT, a significant proportion of patients experience adaptive immune deficits at 1-year and ongoing immunological deficits present at greater than 10 years have been reported. Unfortunately, detailed assessment of the pathways underpinning prolonged immunodeficiency are lacking, although T- and B- cell memory responses, T-cell diversity and regulatory T-cell balance have been implicated. This immunological dysfunction is likely further exacerbated by chronic GVHD, which may further delay T-cell immune reconstitution and potentiate B-cell deficiency. It is notable that all patients in this study experienced chronic GVHD affecting at least 1 organ at the time of LTx.

The optimal approach for translating knowledge regarding potential immunodeficiency and resultant infection risk into post-LTx management is not clear cut. It might be argued that a less intensive immunosuppressive regimen should be provided to LTx recipients with previous allo-HSCT. However, the complexity of the pathobiology and the impact of individualised factors in the pathogenesis of these deficits, makes a "one-size-fits-all" strategy inappropriate for this cohort. Our study suggests that these patients commonly experience humoral immune deficiencies, evidenced by the high proportion of patients receiving immunoglobulin replacement and the low rates of DSA development post-LTx. However, T-cell mediated rejection (ACR) remains an ongoing concern, with 31.6% of the allo-HSCT cohort requiring treatment for this during the first post-LTx year — similar to ACR rates reported by international registries (for all LTx recipients). Furthermore, when compared to re-LTx for CLAD, a greater proportion of the allo-HSCT cohort developed mild-moderate ACR (21.1% vs. 10.0%; p = 0.239).

### Pulmonary transplant complications: a radiologic review [^111zMV3R]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Following the first human lung transplant performed by Dr. Hardy and his team at the University of Mississippi in 1963, the number of lung transplants has increased steadily, particularly over the last few decades. From 2010–2018, approximately 34,000 were reported worldwide. Over half of those were done in North America alone. Efforts to increase available donors have contributed to the rising rates of transplants. Worldwide, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most common indication for lung transplant, however in North America idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has supplanted COPD, followed by cystic fibrosis (CF) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD).

In the early 2010s, the median, 1-, and 5-year survival rates had all increased from previous decades in part due to advancements such as infection prophylaxis, immunosuppression, and surgical techniques reducing incidence of morbid airway complications. However, early complications remain dominated by infection and acute rejection, while chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), infection, and malignancy significantly affect late survival. Contributing to these complications are an increase in recipients of advanced age and low volume centers performing transplants. Further, survival is lower than that of other solid organ transplant recipients.

Lung transplant recipients now live longer and are burdened with a greater number of comorbidities than in prior decades, lending to a greater volume and complexity of postoperative imaging. As imaging can support and potentially diagnose these complications, review of time-course specific features is of value to radiologists and transplant clinicians involved in post-transplant care.

### BAL fluid eosinophilia associates with chronic lung allograft dysfunction risk: a multicenter study [^1138MrWM]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the leading cause of death among lung transplant recipients. Eosinophils, effector cells of type 2 immunity, are implicated in the pathobiology of many lung diseases, and prior studies suggest their presence associates with acute rejection or CLAD after lung transplantation.

Research Question

Does histologic allograft injury or respiratory microbiology correlate with the presence of eosinophils in BAL fluid (BALF)? Does early posttransplant BALF eosinophilia associate with future CLAD development, including after adjustment for other known risk factors?

Study Design and Methods

We analyzed BALF cell count, microbiology, and biopsy data from a multicenter cohort of 531 lung recipients with 2,592 bronchoscopies over the first posttransplant year. Generalized estimating equation models were used to examine the correlation of allograft histology or BALF microbiology with the presence of BALF eosinophils. Multivariable Cox regression was used to determine the association between ≥ 1% BALF eosinophils in the first posttransplant year and definite CLAD. Expression of eosinophil-relevant genes was quantified in CLAD and transplant control tissues.

Results

The odds of BALF eosinophils being present was significantly higher at the time of acute rejection and nonrejection lung injury histologies and during pulmonary fungal detection. Early posttransplant ≥ 1% BALF eosinophils significantly and independently increased the risk for definite CLAD development (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.04; p = 0.009). Tissue expression of eotaxins, IL-13-related genes, and the epithelial-derived cytokines IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphoprotein were significantly increased in CLAD.

Interpretation

BALF eosinophilia was an independent predictor of future CLAD risk across a multicenter lung recipient cohort. Additionally, type 2 inflammatory signals were induced in established CLAD. These data underscore the need for mechanistic and clinical studies to clarify the role of type 2 pathway-specific interventions in CLAD prevention or treatment.

### Radiological findings of complications after lung transplantation [^1154zTCR]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Complications following transplantation may impede allograft function and threaten patient survival. Five principal complications have been described: primary graft dysfunction (PGD), post-surgical complications, alloimmune responses, infections, and malignancy.

Improvement in surgical procedures, in particular bronchial anastomosis techniques and the endoscopic management of stenosis or leakage, has contributed to reduce airway complications. Furthermore, systematic infection prophylaxis and a trend for virus serology matching have significantly reduced post-operative morbidity and improved long-term survival with reduced chronic allograft dysfunction.

Nevertheless, these advances are currently unable to completely prevent these complications and clinical follow-up is required with regular lung function assessments, bronchoscopy exams, and computed tomography (CT) scans.

Chest X-ray is performed systematically every year or whenever clinical symptoms occur. Chest CT is a key tool in active follow-up or when chest X-ray is abnormal by allowing early identification and diagnostic clues in the setting of unspecific acute respiratory symptoms, regardless of their origin. Knowledge of the specific CT signs can improve medical management by allowing a prompt diagnosis, by guiding bronchoscopic procedures for bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy. Likewise, the decline of lung function may not always be discriminative between infection or rejection, either acute or chronic, and further investigation by chest CT may help clinicians in establishing a diagnosis before more invasive bronchoscopic procedures.

Complications after lung transplantation vary depending on the delay of their occurrence. Figure 1 summarizes the mean time of occurrence and the greatest incidence of complications depending on the time after the procedure and according to the literature.

In this review, we describe specific CT signs of these five main lung transplantation complications and their time of occurrence to improve diagnosis, follow-up, medical management, guide bronchoscopic procedures, and to correlate these findings with pathology results.

### Restrictive chronic lung allograft dysfunction: where are we now? [^114jyTcb]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains a frequent and troublesome complication after lung transplantation. Apart from bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a restrictive phenotype of CLAD (rCLAD) has recently been recognized, which occurs in approximately 30% of CLAD patients. The main characteristics of rCLAD include a restrictive pulmonary function pattern with a persistent decline in lung function (FEV1, FVC and TLC), persistent parenchymal infiltrates and (sub)pleural thickening on chest CT scan, as well as pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis and obliterative bronchiolitis on histopathologic examination. Once diagnosed, median survival is only 6 to 18 months compared with 3 to 5 years with BOS. In this perspective we review the historic evidence for rCLAD and describe the different diagnostic criteria and prognosis. Furthermore, we elaborate on the typical radiologic and histopathologic presentations of rCLAD and highlight risk factors and mechanisms. Last, we summarize some opportunities for further research including the urgent need for adequate therapy. In this perspective we not only assess the current knowledge, but also clarify the existing gaps in understanding this increasingly recognized complication after lung transplantation.

### A new classification system for chronic lung allograft dysfunction [^111y8XaF]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Although survival after lung transplantation has improved significantly during the last decade, chronic rejection is thought to be the major cause of late mortality. The physiologic hallmark of chronic rejection has been a persistent fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second associated with an obstructive ventilatory defect, for which the term bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) was defined to allow a uniformity of description and grading of severity throughout the world. Although BOS was generally thought to be irreversible, recent evidence suggests that some patients with BOS may respond to azithromycin with > 10% improvement in their forced expiratory volume in 1 second. In addition, a restrictive form of chronic rejection has recently been described that does not fit the strict definition of BOS as an obstructive defect. Hence, the term chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) has been introduced to cover all forms of graft dysfunction, but CLAD has yet to be defined. We propose a definition of CLAD and a flow chart that may facilitate recognition of the different phenotypes of CLAD that can complicate the clinical course of lung transplant recipients.

### Symptomatic respiratory virus infection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction [^112sSbMW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is a major cause of allograft loss post-lung transplantation. Prior studies have examined the association between respiratory virus infection (RVI) and CLAD were limited by older diagnostic techniques, study design, and case numbers. We examined the association between symptomatic RVI and CLAD using modern diagnostic techniques in a large contemporary cohort of lung transplant recipients (LTRs).

Methods

We retrospectively assessed clinical variables including acute rejection, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, upper and lower RVI, and the primary endpoint of CLAD (determined by 2 independent reviewers) in 250 LTRs in a single university transplantation program. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to analyze the relationship between RVI and CLAD in a time-dependent manner, incorporating different periods of risk following RVI diagnosis.

Results

Fifty patients (20%) were diagnosed with CLAD at a median of 95 weeks post-transplantation, and 79 (32%) had 114 episodes of RVI. In multivariate analysis, rejection and RVI were independently associated with CLAD (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) 2.2 (1.2–3.9), P = 0.01 and 1.9 (1.1–3.5), P = 0.03, respectively. The association of RVI with CLAD was stronger the more proximate the RVI episode: 4.8 (1.9–11.6), P < .01; 3.4 (1.5–7.5), P < .01; and 2.4 (1.2–5.0), P = 0.02 in multivariate analysis for 3, 6, and 12 months following RVI, respectively.

Conclusions

Symptomatic RVI is independently associated with development of CLAD, with increased risk at shorter time periods following RVI. Prospective studies to characterize the virologic determinants of CLAD and define the underlying mechanisms are warranted.

### Imaging indications and findings in evaluation of lung transplant graft dysfunction and rejection [^115sQGLc]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) following lung transplantation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is an umbrella term that encompasses bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and restrictive allograft syndrome.

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome/obliterative bronchiolitis

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome/obliterative bronchiolitis is the most common form of chronic lung allograft dysfunction and reported in 48% of patients by 5 years after transplant and 76% of patients after 10 years. Obliterative bronchiolitis (also known as constrictive bronchiolitis) is a pathologic diagnosis characterized by fibrotic scarring that greatly narrows or completely obliterates bronchiolar lumens (Fig. 7). Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is the clinical manifestation of obliterative bronchiolitis. The hallmark of this syndrome is the presence of declining pulmonary function tests compared with baseline, in the absence of another explanation such as acute rejection, infection, pulmonary edema, or airway stenosis. Defined in this way, the diagnosis obviates the need for pathologic confirmation, which is limited by sampling issues and low sensitivity. Obliterative bronchiolitis/bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is the most common manifestation of chronic lung allograft dysfunction. Acute rejection, recurrent infections, primary graft dysfunction, HLA mismatch, cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, aspiration, and non-compliance with immunosuppressive therapy are thought to be potential risk factors for this disease. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome often presents with non-specific symptoms; in advanced cases, patients may present with dyspnea at rest. The key feature is irreversible airflow limitation with a sustained decrease in FEV1 for > 3 weeks. The clinical staging of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is based on the FEV1 compared with baseline (Table 2). Pathologic examination shows obliterative bronchiolitis, as described above. Bronchiolar involvement in this disease is typically patchy, greatly limiting the yield of transbronchial biopsy. A major role of bronchoscopy in this setting is to exclude other causes of decreased FEV1 such as acute rejection, infection, or bronchial stenosis.

### FDA strengthens warning that untreated constipation caused by schizophrenia medicine clozapine (clozaril) can lead to serious bowel problems… [^113ezrb3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

caused by the schizophrenia medicine clozapine can, uncommonly, progress to serious bowel complications. This can lead to hospitalization or even death if constipation is not diagnosed and treated quickly. Constipation is a frequent and. known side effect of clozapine, but serious and fatal events continue to be reported. Clozapine affects how the intestines function in the majority of patients. It produces effects ranging from constipation, which is a common occurrence, to serious but uncommon bowel problems, including complete blockage of the. week or less than their normal frequency, or are unable to pass gas. Monitor patients for symptoms of potential complications associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility such as nausea, abdominal distension or pain, and vomiting. Consider prophylactic laxative treatment when starting clozapine in patients with a history of constipation or bowel obstruction.

What did FDA find. We reviewed the period from 2006 to 2016 and identified 10 cases describing constipation that progressed to serious bowel problems resulting in hospitalization, surgery, or death. These included death of the colon wall, blockage of blood flow to the intestines., death of part of the intestine, and abdominal distention leading to bowel obstruction. This number includes only cases submitted to FDA* or those found in the medical literature, so there may be additional cases about which we are unaware. medicine clozapine can progress to serious bowel complications. This can lead to hospitalization or even death if constipation is not diagnosed and treated quickly.
- Clozapine impairs bowel function in the majority of patients. It produces effects ranging.

from constipation to complete bowel obstruction, paralytic ileus and intestinal ischemia or infarction. Constipation is a frequent and known side effect of clozapine, but serious and fatal events continue to be reported.
- The risk is greater with clozapine than the other schizophrenia medicines we reviewed in.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection correlates with high MFI donor-specific antibody development following lung transplantation with consequential graft loss and shortened CLAD-free survival [^1148NwkC]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung transplantation (LuTx) has a poor long-term outcome, with a current median post-transplant survival of 6.5 years, and 8.7 years for recipients surviving the first postoperative year. Novel immunosuppressive regimens significantly eradicated acute graft-rejection events, yet chronic rejection manifesting as chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) represents the major complication in long term allograft survival, affecting ~ 50% of recipients at the first 5 years. No specific treatment is currently available to prevent or reverse CLAD, and the lack of appropriate biomarkers challenge the detection of the early and probably reversible phase of this condition.

The development of CLAD is multifactorial and several immune and non-immune related mechanisms have been suspected in its progression. The generation of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) against human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are common following LuTx, with a wide range of reported incidence (12–47%) 8,9. Previous studies analyzed the link between DSAs, graft loss and CLAD pathogenesis, however discrepancies often appear in clinical research. Not all DSAs are equally pathogenic, their level, HLA class or HLA-DQ specificity, complement-fixing traits, persistency or time of emergence all have been suspected to cause inconsistencies in clinical studies.

Respiratory tract infections often generate severe complications in immunosuppressed recipients that are now recognized risk factors of CLAD. Continuous pathogenic provocation of the lungs, repetitive inflammatory episodes and impaired repair mechanisms lead to allograft deterioration over time. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is commonly found in LuTx recipients and aggravates tissue damage. Recently, P. aeruginosa colonization in respiratory specimens has been directly linked to the DSA response and shortened CLAD-free time.

In our present study we aimed to clarify the clinical impact of DSAs on graft survival and CLAD progression, and applied an MFI based risk stratification method to predict these outcomes. In search of factors contributing to DSA development we investigated the role of P. aeruginosa infection in BAL specimens. Additionally, we analyzed BAL immune cell ratios that correlated to DSA levels.
